It may also help you reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke, reduce cardiovascular risk factors, and promote overall health. Exercise can also help prevent the development of diabetes in people who have prediabetes. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) encourages people to get at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic activity per week. According to the ADA, in the absence of contraindications, such as moderate to severe retinopathy, for example, it’s also important to do at least two sessions of strength training each week. The benefits of exercising are independent of weight loss. However, compliance with an exercise program has to be consistent in order to see lasting results. If you’re sedentary and considering starting an exercise program, it’s a good idea to consult with a doctor first, to make sure there are no restrictions or special precautions. It’s always a good idea to start gradually and build up to your personal goal. Not sure where to start? Here are 10 exercises that can help you reach your fitness goals. 1. Walking You don’t need a gym membership or expensive exercise equipment to get moving. If you have a supportive pair of shoes and a safe place to walk, you can start today. In fact, you can meet your recommended minimum target for aerobic fitness by going for a brisk 30-minute walk five days a week. According to a 2014 review, walking can help people with type 2 diabetes lower their blood sugar levels and lose weight. 2. Cycling Roughly half of people with type 2 diabetes have arthritis. The two conditions have several risk factors in common, including obesity. Diabetic neuropathy, a condition that occurs when the nerves become damaged, can also cause joint pain in people with type 2 diabetes. If you have lower joint pain, consider choosing low-impact exercise. Cycling, for example, can help you meet your fitness goals while minimizing strain on your joints. 3. Swimming Aquatic activities provide another joint-friendly exercise option. For example, swimming, water aerobics, aqua jogging, and other aquatic activities can give your heart, lungs, and muscles a workout, while putting little stress on your joints. A 2017 review found that aquatic exercise can help lower blood sugar levels, much like land-based exercise does. 4. Team sports If you find it hard to motivate yourself to exercise, it might help to join a recreational sports team. The opportunity to socialize with teammates and the commitment you make to them might help you find the motivation you need to show up each week. Many recreational sports offer a good aerobic workout. Consider trying basketball, soccer, softball, pairs tennis, or ultimate frisbee. 5. Aerobic dance Signing up for an aerobic dance or other fitness class might also help you meet your exercise goals. For instance, Zumba is a fitness program that combines dance and aerobic movements for a fast-paced workout. A 2015 study found that women with type 2 diabetes were more motivated to exercise after taking part in Zumba classes for 16 weeks. Participants also improved their aerobic fitness and lost weight. 6. Weightlifting Weightlifting and other strengthening activities help build your muscle mass, which can increase the number of calories you burn each day. Strength training may also help improve your blood sugar control, reports the ADA. If you want to incorporate weightlifting into your weekly exercise routine, you can use weight machines, free weights, or even heavy household objects, such as canned goods or water bottles. To learn how to lift weights safely and effectively, consider joining a weightlifting class or asking a professional fitness trainer for guidance. 7. Resistance band exercises Weights aren’t the only tool that you can use to strengthen your muscles. You can also perform a wide variety of strengthening activities with resistance bands. To learn how to incorporate them into your workouts, speak with a professional trainer, take a resistance band class, or watch a resistance band workout video. In addition to increasing your strength, exercising with resistance bands may provide modest benefits to your blood sugar control, according to a recent study published in the Canadian Journal of Diabetes. 8. Calisthenics In calisthenics, you use your own body weight to strengthen your muscles. Common calisthenic exercises include pushups, pullups, squats, lunges, and abdominal crunches. Whether you choose to strengthen your muscles with weights, resistance bands, or your own body weight, try to work out every major muscle group in your body. To give your body time to recover, take a day off from muscle-strengthening activities between each session of strength training, suggests the ADA. 9. Pilates Pilates is a popular fitness program that’s designed to improve core strength, coordination, and balance. According to a recent study of older women with type 2 diabetes, it may also help improve blood sugar control. Consider signing up for a Pilates class at your local gym or Pilates studio. Many instructional videos and books are also available. 10. Yoga According to a 2016 review, yoga can help people with type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar, cholesterol levels, and weight. It might also help lower your blood pressure, improve the quality of your sleep, and boost your mood. If you’re interested in trying yoga, sign up for a class at a local studio or gym. A trained professional can help you learn how to move from one pose to another, using the proper posture and breathing technique. The takeaway Regular physical activity is important, not only for managing type 2 diabetes but also for promoting your overall health. If you have any other health conditions in addition to type 2 diabetes, talk to your doctor before starting a new fitness routine. They can help you learn how to stay safe and minimize your risk of injury, while meeting your fitness goals. For more tips on living with type 2 diabetes, download our free app, T2D Healthline.

35,is a ketogenic keto diet suitable for people with diabetes ,chatgpt35,1,The ketogenic  or keto  diet is a high fat  low carbohydrate diet that has been used primarily for weight loss and managing certain medical conditions  including epilepsy  When it comes to diabetes  the effects of a keto diet can vary depending on the individual and their specific circumstances  Here s some information to consider   1  Potential Benefits  The keto diet can potentially offer benefits for people with diabetes  such as improved blood sugar control and reduced insulin resistance  By severely limiting carbohydrate intake  the diet can lower blood glucose levels and decrease the need for insulin or other diabetes medications in some individuals   2  Monitoring and Medications  If you have diabetes and are considering a keto diet  it s crucial to work closely with your healthcare team  Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to ensure that they remain within a safe range  Medication adjustments may be necessary to prevent low blood sugar  hypoglycemia  or other complications   3  Nutritional Balance  Following a keto diet requires careful attention to nutritional balance  It s important to ensure you re getting enough essential nutrients  including vitamins  minerals  and fiber  Consuming a wide variety of low carbohydrate  non starchy vegetables  along with adequate protein and healthy fats  is crucial to meeting nutritional needs   4  Individual Variations  People with diabetes can respond differently to the keto diet  Some individuals may experience significant improvements in blood sugar control  while others may not see the same benefits  It s crucial to monitor your individual response to the diet and make adjustments as needed under the guidance of your healthcare provider   5  Potential Risks  While the keto diet can be suitable for some people with diabetes  it may not be appropriate for everyone  Individuals with certain medical conditions  such as pancreatic disease or liver disorders  may need to avoid or modify the diet  Additi,"Nutrition Is the Keto Diet Safe If You Have Type 1 Diabetes? Written by Daniel Preiato, RD, CSCS on June 3, 2019 Ketoacidosis vs. ketosis Blood sugar Weight loss Insulin Safety Bottom line We include products we think are useful for our readers. If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process. The ketogenic, or keto, diet is a very-low-carb, high-fat diet that has been shown to offer several health benefits. In recent years, interest in using the keto diet as a tool to help manage diseases, such as epilepsy, cancer, and diabetes, has increased. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition in which your pancreas produces little or no insulin. It should not be confused with type 2 diabetes, which affects the way your body processes blood sugar and is usually associated with insulin resistance. Though the keto diet has been shown to improve blood sugar control and reduce insulin requirements, several complications may arise for those with type 1 diabetes (1). This article tells you whether the keto diet is safe for those with type 1 diabetes. Diabetic ketoacidosis vs. nutritional ketosis A common area of misunderstanding surrounding the keto diet is the concept of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) versus nutritional ketosis (ketosis). Knowing the difference between the two becomes even more important if you have type 1 diabetes. On a keto diet, you significantly reduce your carb intake to less than 50 grams per day and increase your fat intake instead. This pushes your body to produce ketones from fat in your liver and use fat as its main fuel source as opposed to carbs. This shift in metabolism results in nutritional ketosis, which means your body uses ketones in your blood for energy. On the other hand, diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency that occurs mostly in people with type 1 diabetes if they don’t take insulin. Without insulin to transport blood sugar into your body’s cells, blood sugar and ketone levels rise rapidly, disrupting your blood’s acid-base balance (2). Thus, the main difference between nutritional ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis is as follows: In ketosis, only ketone levels are elevated, allowing your body to use mostly fat for energy. In diabetic ketoacidosis, blood sugar and ketone levels are very high, resulting in a critical health state. If you have type 1 diabetes and are thinking about trying a ketogenic diet, it’s extremely important to work with healthcare professionals, such as a registered dietitian and medical doctor, to avoid serious complications. Summary Nutritional ketosis is a metabolic state in which your body burns fat instead of carbs as its primary fuel source. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication in type 1 diabetes in which blood sugars run high and excess ketones are produced. May lower blood sugar too much The keto diet has been shown to significantly lower blood sugar levels in people with type 1 and 2 diabetes (1, 3). One 2.5-year study in 11 adults with type 1 diabetes found that the keto diet significantly improved A1C levels, a marker of long-term blood sugar control (1). However, some participants experienced episodes of their blood sugar levels falling too low. This can happen if your blood sugar levels drop below 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/L) and is likely due to improper insulin dosing. The keto diet raises the risk of your blood sugar levels becoming too low. This could lead to potentially serious complications, such as confusion, dizziness, slurred speech, and loss of consciousness (4, 5). Summary The keto diet can considerably lower blood sugar levels in people with type 1 and 2 diabetes. Without proper insulin adjustments, your levels may become too low, leading to potentially serious complications. May cause unwanted weight loss Strong evidence suggests that the keto diet can promote weight loss (6). A number of factors are believed to be responsible, including: Appetite suppression. The keto diet promotes feelings of fullness, likely due to changes in hunger hormones, making you less likely to overeat (7). Food elimination. Higher-carb foods are eliminated, reducing your calorie intake (8). Higher protein intake. Keto diets tend to be higher in protein than standard diets, leading to increased fullness at meals (9). While some people with type 1 diabetes may be interested in losing weight, this is not the goal, or even safe, for everyone. It’s important to take this possible side effect into consideration before starting the keto diet. Summary Following a keto diet may lead to weight loss, which may be undesirable or unsafe for some people, especially those who are underweight. May require insulin reduction To control their blood sugar, people with type 1 diabetes use short-acting insulin in varying doses that depend on how high their blood sugar levels are and how many carbs a given meal contains. When drastically reducing your carb intake, such as with the keto diet, blood sugar levels trend much lower, requiring less insulin to manage them. For instance, a study in 10 people with type 1 diabetes on a low-carb diet found that participants needed an average of 20 fewer units of insulin per day (10). Insulin dosing must be properly adjusted to account for your current blood sugar levels, which will likely be lower after starting the keto diet. If you administer the same amount of insulin as before starting the diet, you may experience hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), a serious side effect. Considering that less insulin is required, it’s crucial to seek medical guidance and test your blood sugar levels frequently to prevent episodes of hypoglycemia. Summary On a keto diet, blood sugar levels run lower due to reduced carb intake. If you have type 1 diabetes, you may need to decrease insulin accordingly. This reduction should be supervised by your doctor. Is it safe? Whether the keto diet is safe for people with type 1 diabetes does not have a simple yes-or-no answer. Many factors need to be considered. If your diabetes is well managed and you thoroughly educate yourself and seek medical guidance, the keto diet can be a relatively safe option (11, 12). However, it’s best to experiment with a lower-carb diet before implementing a full keto diet to see how your body responds. Don’t start keto unsupervised If you have type 1 diabetes and are interested in the keto diet, it’s extremely important to start by seeking medical guidance from a registered dietitian (RD) and medical doctor (MD). An RD can assist you with the specific format and outline of the diet, whereas your doctor can help adjust your insulin regimen or oral medications accordingly. Together, their supervision and guidance will greatly reduce your risk of serious complications and help you adhere to the diet safely and sustainably. Make sure to monitor your ketone levels In addition to closely monitoring your blood sugar levels, be sure to test your ketone levels regularly when following a keto diet. Many people with type 1 diabetes may be familiar with ketone testing already, as it’s used to detect early stages of diabetic ketoacidosis (13). There are several methods for testing ketones: Blood testing. You can purchase meters with test strips that work similarly to blood glucose meters. Urine testing. You can buy test strips that indicate ketones by color when submerged in a urine sample. Breath analyzer. These devices measure acetone levels, a ketone byproduct, in your breath. Specifically, you should check your ketone levels if your blood sugar level is above 300mg/dl (16.6 mmol/L) or you’re feeling sick, confused, or in a fog (13). Blood ketone meters tend to be the most accurate and are readily available online or in pharmacies. Urine strips and breath analyzers can be purchased as well. Some people should avoid the keto diet Due to potentially negative overall health effects, some people with type 1 diabetes should not follow a keto diet, including: those with a history of chronic low blood sugar levels people who are underweight or have an eating disorder people undergoing or recovering from a medical procedure children or adolescents under 18 years old pregnant or breastfeeding mothers cholesterol hyper-responders These populations have an increased risk of complications and are not advised to start a keto diet without medical clearance (5, 14). Summary Some people with type 1 diabetes can safely follow a keto diet, though close medical supervision is crucial. Other groups of people should avoid the diet. It’s important to monitor ketone levels, especially if your blood sugar levels are elevated. The bottom line Whether the keto diet is safe if you have type 1 diabetes depends on many individual factors, such as how well your diabetes is managed or whether you’re underweight or have a history of low blood sugar levels. With proper medical guidance, the keto diet can be a relatively safe option for some people with type 1 diabetes while others should avoid it altogether. It’s best to start by trying a lower-carb diet before implementing a full ketogenic diet to gauge how your body responds. If you have type 1 diabetes and want to try the keto diet, speak to your healthcare provider and a dietitian to set up a personalized program to minimize your risk of potentially dangerous side effects.

Being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes can be difficult, especially since the disease is perceived as incurable. But experts say diabetes can be reversed early on. “If you follow the advice of your doctors and nutritionist and make an effort to lose weight, diabetes can be reversed by normalizing your blood sugar levels without medication early in the course of the disease, that is the first three to five years,” Dr. Sangeeta Kashyap, endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic, told Healthline. Researchers at the University of Glasgow in Scotland agree and want to promote this message. In a recent study published in The BMJ, Scottish researchers report that patients and doctors may not be aware that type 2 diabetes can be reversed. They said that weight loss of around 33 pounds often produces total remission of the disease, yet remission is often not coded in medical records. They point to a U.S. study that found remissions in less than 1 percent of 120,000 patients who were tracked for seven years. Similarly, a database that includes all patients in Scotland shows less than 1 percent of type 2 diabetes coded as being in remission. The researchers argue that greater awareness, documentation, and surveillance of remissions would improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Just a honeymoon period? Researchers say that the reasons why remission isn’t coded may be due to medical professionals’ disagreement on criteria and guidance as well as the fact that few patients are trying to gain remission or actually achieving remission. Dr. Ashwin Patel, the chief medical officer of InquisitHealth who also sits on the Community Leadership Board of the American Diabetes Association, agrees. “There’s a ‘fixed’ criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes, so it makes diabetes seem like it’s a very clear, binary diagnosis. In that, either you have it or you don’t,” Patel told Healthline. “Importantly, not only is there ongoing debate on what the right criteria should be, there is a growing realization that diabetes, especially type 2, isn’t binary physiologically. It’s much more of a continuum.” Another reason, Kashyap points out, is that even if blood sugars reach normal levels due to weight loss achieved by dieting, exercising, or surgery, they may not stay normal for a long period of time. “Blood sugars can come back into the diabetes range, and so some people feel like this isn’t reversing diabetes, [but rather] silencing the disease,” said Kashyap. “I call this a ‘honeymoon period,’ meaning the blood sugars normalize, there’s no meds needed, and things look great, but we don’t know how long that will last.” She notes that in up to 60 percent of people who have bariatric surgery, their diabetes comes back within 15 years. “I tell people it’s a nice vacation from their disease and we hope it does slow down developing complications from diabetes, such as heart, eye, kidney, and nerve disease,” said Kashyap. Why does diabetes come back? The reasons aren’t known, but it may be due to weight gain or genetics. “Part of the reason that the pancreases fails to produce insulin over time is genetic. Also, as you age, your pancreatic function declines. That’s why it’s common to see diabetes in people in their 60s and 70s,” Kashyap explained. Worth the psychological boost Whether or not a person stays in remission from diabetes long term, researchers say that noting their remission is still worth it. “When someone works really hard to lose 15 percent of their body weight, they’ve put a lot of work in. If blood sugar is normalized and they’re not on medications, it can be a big psychological boost to put in their chart that they are in remission,” said Kashyap. “It reinforces the message that if you work hard to lose weight you can see results.” Think of someone with breast cancer who undergoes treatment and then goes into remission. When this occurs, remission is almost always documented in their records. “This gives the person hope. They may even forget about cancer for a while,” said Kashyap. When it comes to diabetes, recognizing remission may also give a person a sense of control since weight and diabetes are strongly tied. “Weight is the root cause of people developing diabetes at a young age. More than 82 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight,” said Kashyap. “Now we have a lot of tools to help people to lose weight, such as nutritionists, exercise physiologists, medications, and surgery. You can’t control your age or who your parents are, but you can modify your weight.” From the physician’s perspective, documenting remission is a way to back the importance of lifestyle changes. “Like The BMJ article said, we physicians often push drugs, but give lip service to lifestyle modification. This is a way to not do lip service. By putting it in the chart, we’re recognizing patients’ efforts and keeping them motivated to keep it up,” Kashyap said. If lifestyle changes are implemented successfully during the early stages of being officially diagnosed with diabetes, and if medications are no longer required, Patel says documenting diabetes “remission,” diabetes “being reversed,” or simply that someone’s diabetes is now “diet-controlled” can have impact beyond the patients themselves. “These might seem like semantics, but they have real downstream implications for research, budget/cost analyses, and most importantly, for the individuals having, or not, the potentially stigmatizing label of diabetes,” noted Patel.

These 15 tips can get you started on your journey to living well. 1. Learn everything you can MS is a chronic disease that affects the central nervous system. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, which vary from person to person. There are several different types of MS and each requires a different treatment plan. Learning everything you can about your diagnosis is the first step you can take to effectively manage your condition. Your doctor can provide you with informational pamphlets about MS, or you can read about it from organizations like the National MS Society. Finding out the facts and clarifying any misconceptions about MS may make your diagnosis a bit easier to bear. Scientists are also learning more and more about MS each day. So, it’s essential to stay up-to-date as new treatments make their way through the pipeline. 2. Stay current with new treatments and clinical trials The National MS Society is a good resource for finding new clinical trials in your area. You can also find a comprehensive listing of all past, present, and future clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov. If you find a clinical trial in your area, speak with your doctor to find out if you’re a candidate to participate in the trial. 3. Keep active Daily exercise is essential for maintaining muscle strength and building endurance. Not getting enough physical activity can also increase your risk of developing osteoporosis — a condition where your bones can become thin and fragile. Exercise can also improve your mood and ward off fatigue. Start off simple with low-impact exercises such as walking, biking, or swimming. 4. Practice good sleep hygiene Practicing good sleep hygiene can give you a leg up when it comes to battling MS fatigue. Here are some tried and true ways to help you get more restful sleep: Establish a bedtime routine. For example, take a warm bath and listen to soothing music right before bed. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. Stay away from bright screens before bedtime. Avoid caffeine in the late afternoon and evening. 5. Find an MS buddy You don’t have to go through this diagnosis alone. Log on to Healthline’s MS Buddy app (iPhone; Android) to connect with and talk to others living with MS. MS Buddy is a safe place for you to share your concerns and ask for advice from others who are going through some of the same experiences as you. 6. Assemble a team of doctors MS is a lifelong disease, so it’s important to be under the care of an MS specialist who is a good match for you. Your primary care doctor can refer you to a team of other healthcare providers to help you manage all of your symptoms. Or, you can use this “Find Doctors & Resources” tool from the National MS Society. The healthcare providers you may need to see include: a neurologist who specializes in MS a neuropsychologist to help manage your mental function, like memory, focus, information processing, and problem solving a physical therapist to work on overall strength, joint range of motion, coordination, and gross motor skills a psychologist or mental health counselor to help you cope with your diagnosis an occupational therapist, who can give you the tools to perform day-to-day tasks more efficiently a social worker to assist you with finding financial resources, entitlements, and community services a dietitian or nutritionist to help you maintain a healthy diet a speech-language pathologist if you’re having problems with speech, swallowing, or breathing 7. Eat well Your diet is an important tool when it comes to living well with MS. While there’s no miracle diet for treating MS, consider aiming for a healthy diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, and lean protein. It’s also important to eat well in order to avoid gaining weight. Researchers have seen greater disability progression and more brain lesions in people living with MS who are overweight or obese. Here are some other diet tips to consider: Eat a low-fat or plant-based diet. A 2016 study found that people with MS who adhered to a very low-fat, plant-based diet had improvements in their fatigue levels after 12 months. However, it didn’t show improvements on relapse rates or disability levels, so more research is needed. Get enough fiber. The recommended intake is at least 25 grams of fiber each day for women and 38 grams of fiber each day for men.This helps promote good bowel function. Reduce alcohol consumption. Eat foods high in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Examples include fatty fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel), soybeans, canola oil, walnuts, flaxseeds, and sunflower oil. Some evidence suggests that eating these fats could reduce the severity and duration of MS attacks. 8. Divide and conquer chores Housework can seem overwhelming, but you don’t have to do it all at once. Divide up your chores to make them more manageable. For example, only clean one room a day or divide all the chores up in time segments throughout the day. You can still get your cleaning done on your own, but you’ll avoid hurting yourself in the process. 9. Rearrange your home and work environment Try to think strategically about how your home and workplace are set up. You’ll may need to make some adjustments to suit your needs. For example, consider storing the kitchen tools that you use every day on the kitchen counter and in the most easy-to-reach cabinets. You may want to place heavy electric appliances, like blenders, on the countertop so you don’t have to constantly move them around. Rearrange or get rid of furniture, rugs, and decor that take up too much floor space or could trip you as you move around your home. Remember that the more stuff you have, the harder it is to clean your house. You can also talk to your employer to see if they’ll provide ergonomic equipment to make your work day easier. Examples include glare protection on computer screens, a trackball instead of a mouse, or even moving desk seating closer to the entrance. 10. Invest in nifty gadgets New gadgets and small tools for the kitchen can make ordinary tasks easier and safer. For example, you may want to purchase a jar opener that makes opening up a vacuum-sealed jar lid a breeze. 11. Set reminders MS can lead to symptoms like memory loss and issues concentrating. This can make it difficult to remember day-to-day tasks, like appointments and when to take your medication. Phone apps and tools can help you work around memory problems. There are apps available that make it easy to see your calendar, take notes, make lists, and set alerts and reminders. One example is CareZone (iPhone; Android). 12. Get involved MS support groups can connect you with other people living with MS and help you establish a network for exchanging ideas, new research, and good vibes. You can also join a volunteer program or activist group. You may find that participation in these types of organizations is incredibly empowering. The National MS Society’s activist website is a good place to get started. You can also look for upcoming volunteer events nearby. 13. Keep cool Many people with MS find that they’re sensitive to heat exposure. When your body temperature rises, your symptoms may become worse. Even just a slight temperature increase can impair nerve impulses enough to cause symptoms. This experience actually has its own name — Uhthoff’s phenomenon. Try to keep yourself cool by avoiding hot showers and baths. Use air conditioning in your home and stay out of the sun when possible. You can also try wearing a cooling vest or neck wrap. 14. Set up auto-refills for prescriptions It’s important to take your medications on time. Forgetting to take a medication or refill a prescription can have major consequences on your day-to-day life. To solve this issue, set up auto-refills for your prescriptions with your local pharmacy. You can have the pharmacy text or call you to let you know that your prescription is ready for pick up. Many pharmacies can even mail you your prescriptions in advance. 15. Stay positive Although there’s no cure for MS right now, newer treatments can slow down the disease. Don’t give up hope. Research is being conducted to improve treatments and reduce disease progression. If you’re having a hard time keeping a positive outlook on life, consider meeting with a psychologist or a mental health counselor to discuss your needs. Takeaway Life after a diagnosis of MS can be overwhelming. Some days, your symptoms might prevent you from doing what you love or leave you feeling emotionally drained. While some days may be difficult, it’s still possible to live well with MS by implementing some of the changes above into your life.
