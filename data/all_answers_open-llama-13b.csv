35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,"Yes, but with a few caveats.

The keto diet is a form of low-carb diet, in which carbohydrates are limited to less than 50 grams per day. This forces the body to burn fat for energy, instead of carbohydrates.

In a study of type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients on a keto diet, researchers found that after 22 weeks, average weight loss was 18 pounds, and average HbA1C decreased from 8.3% to 7.5%. The HbA1C is the average blood sugar level for the past 3 months.

A keto diet is not suitable for everybody. People who are on insulin or other medications should be closely monitored by a doctor.

Q: How do I know if I have diabetes or high blood sugar?
 A: Diabetes is a disease that can affect anyone at any age. There is no test to know if you have diabetes.

If you have any of the symptoms below, talk to your doctor about getting tested for diabetes.

Symptoms

 * Blurred vision, or seeing things that aren't there
 * Frequent urination
 * Feeling tired or weak
 * Feeling thirsty
 * Numbness in the hands and feet
 * Nausea or vomiting
 * Sores that don't heal
 * Weak or brittle bones

Diabetes is a long-term (chronic) disease that affects your blood glucose (sugar) level.

Glucose is the main source of energy for your body. Your body uses glucose to make energy for your muscles, blood, and other parts of your body.

Your body uses insulin (a hormone) to move glucose from your blood into your cells.

When you have diabetes, your body can't use insulin properly to move glucose into your cells.

If you have too much glucose in your blood, it can lead to serious health problems.

Q: How do I know if I have prediabetes?
 A: If you have prediabetes, your blood glucose level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be called diabetes.

Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood glucose is higher than normal, but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. You may feel healthy, but you're at risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

58,Risk to develop multiple sclerosis,"It’s a risk for anybody who is exposed to a lot of stress, to be exposed to a lot of cold, to be exposed to a lot of heat. If you look at all the people who get multiple sclerosis, they’ll have a lot of these kinds of exposures. And then you have to look at other things like family history, exposure to a lot of viruses, and some people have been exposed to a lot of viruses and then they develop multiple sclerosis. But, if you look at the whole population of people who are exposed to these things, there’s a small percentage of them that develop multiple sclerosis.
Q: What causes multiple sclerosis?
 A: We don’t know. There’s a lot of evidence to suggest that it’s an autoimmune disease, where the immune system goes wrong and starts attacking the brain. And there’s a lot of evidence that it’s related to a virus, and the virus may trigger the immune system to go wrong. There’s a lot of genetic factors that we know about. And it’s also true that people who are exposed to a lot of stress get multiple sclerosis, and people who have been exposed to a lot of viral infections get multiple sclerosis, and people who have a family history of multiple sclerosis are more likely to get multiple sclerosis. So, it’s a combination of things. We know that the immune system can be affected by the virus, and we know that the immune system can be affected by exposure to a lot of cold, to exposure to a lot of heat, to exposure to a lot of stress, and to exposure to a lot of viruses.

59,long-term effects likelihood multiple sclerosis,"Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system. It is characterized by lesions in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord, which cause a progressive degeneration of nerve fibers and their axons. The long-term effects of MS are related to the destruction of these nerve fibers.

A: I think that's a poor word choice by the author, but it's not wrong, technically.
MS is not a ""disease"". It's not a bacteria, or a virus. It's a condition, a condition that can be caused by a number of factors.
The ""degeneration of nerve fibers and their axons"" is a ""long-term effect"", and it's not related to the ""destruction"" of nerve fibers and axons, which is the cause of the condition.
So, the author's statement is correct, but not in the way that they intended it.

68,List of multiple sclerosis symptoms,"Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system. The symptoms of MS include blurred vision, double vision, tingling, numbness, muscle spasms, weakness, and problems with balance and coordination. There are many different types of MS, but the most common type is called relapsing-remitting MS.
 Q: What causes multiple sclerosis?
 A: MS is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. The immune system attacks myelin, a protective covering that surrounds nerve fibers. The immune system attacks myelin in people with MS, but it may also attack myelin in healthy people. In some people, the immune system is triggered by a viral infection or by exposure to certain chemicals. Researchers are studying the role of other environmental factors, such as smoking and diet. They are also trying to find out whether a person's genes may make them more likely to develop MS.
 Q: What are the symptoms of multiple sclerosis?
 A: The symptoms of MS vary and may be mild or severe. Some symptoms may appear in one attack and disappear, and other symptoms may appear with each attack. The symptoms of MS may come and go, and they may come back over time. MS symptoms may include:
 Vision problems
 Double vision
 Blurred vision
 Problems with color vision
 Light sensitivity
 Numbness
 Tingling
 Weakness
 Muscle spasms
 Problems with balance and coordination
 Q: How is multiple sclerosis diagnosed?
 A: Diagnosing MS requires a careful neurological examination and a detailed medical history. MS is diagnosed based on symptoms, a neurological exam, and certain medical tests, including magnetic resonance imaging (M MRI). The doctor will also ask about your symptoms, such as how long they have lasted and how often they occur. If you have had a relapse, you will be asked about that episode. The doctor will ask about symptoms that have occurred since the time of your last relapse.
 Q: How is multiple sclerosis treated?

79,Can I pass multiple sclerosis to other family members?,"No. The risk of MS is not passed from parent to child. The risk is related to genetics, but the genes involved are not identified.
Q: How are multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases diagnosed?
 A: There are three steps to diagnosing MS.
 First, a neurologist must rule out other conditions that may be causing your symptoms. Some of these conditions are: aseptic meningitis, lupus, transverse myelitis and vitamin B12 deficiency.
 Second, a neurologist may order a spinal tap or lumbar puncture. This is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the lower back and fluid is removed from the spinal canal. This fluid is examined for a protein called oligoclonal bands. This protein is found in the fluid of most people with MS, but is not found in people with other disorders.
 Third, a neurologist may order an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). This test uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed pictures of body tissues and organs. The MRI is very effective in showing lesions (areas of injury) in the brain and spinal cord.
Q: How do I know if I have multiple sclerosis?
 A: The diagnosis of MS is based on the clinical features and the results of tests.
The clinical features of MS are often divided into two types: the ""monophasic"" and the ""polyphasic"". Monophasic MS is characterized by a single attack that causes a temporary worsening of neurologic function. The symptoms may last for several weeks and then gradually improve. Polyphasic MS is characterized by several attacks that cause a temporary worsening of neurologic function. The symptoms may last for several weeks or months, and then gradually improve.
The diagnosis of MS is made when a neurologist finds lesions on the MRI and the clinical features of MS.
Q: How will I know if a new attack of MS is starting?

85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). It is a chronic progressive disease with relapsing remitting course.


*

*Relapse:


*

*Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the most common form of MS, in which the patient has recurrent episodes of worsening neurologic function (relapse) followed by partial or complete recovery.

*Relapses are usually followed by periods of remission, or no new symptoms.

*Remission is a period with no new signs or symptoms of MS activity. It may last days, weeks, months, or years.

*Remission periods do not always follow relapses.


*Progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS):


*

*Progressive MS means the disease gets worse over time, but there may be periods of stability or improvement.

*This form of MS is often diagnosed after the patient has had symptoms for more than 2 years.

*It is more common in women than men.

*It is more common in people with a family history of MS or a personal or family history of an autoimmune disease.

*It is less common in people who are over age 60 at the time of diagnosis.



"
86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,"I think the best treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis is to use a very aggressive treatment approach in the beginning. It appears to me that most of the people who are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the secondary progressive phase have been living with it for 10 years, and by that time they have accumulated an extensive number of lesions in their brain and spine. So the earlier we start treatment, the better the outcome is likely to be.
 Q: What is the treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis?
 A: The treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis is the same as the treatment for primary progressive multiple sclerosis. There are two drugs that are approved by FDA for treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis: Tecfidera and Gilenya. Both of them are very effective in slowing down the progression of multiple sclerosis. They are very well tolerated and don't cause many side effects.

92,causes of fatigue in MS,"I have been diagnosed with MS for over 20 years now. I'm 40. I was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS and was told that I would have an ""excellent"" prognosis. The doctor told me that most people with my type of MS never progress, and that they were very rare. I was told that I had no symptoms and that I would likely never need a wheelchair. I have had a few symptoms along the way: double vision, some numbness, and a few other things. I've had no major symptoms for at least 10 years, and I have been told that I have no disability. I was also told that I have no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) for at least 5 years. My MRI's show little to no activity.
 I've been very active all my life. I was a competitive athlete, and was always very physically active. I played basketball, softball, ran 5K's, 10K's, marathons, etc. I also lifted weights and did lots of other physical activities. I'm in great shape. But in the past few months I've been feeling tired more often. I feel like I've lost some stamina and energy. I'm working out 5 days a week. I'm trying to get in shape, but I just can't seem to get back to where I was before I got sick.
 I don't really know what to do. I've been to several doctors, but none of them have been able to figure out what's going on. I've had a few blood tests, and the doctor said that my liver and kidney function were fine. I've had a few MRIs over the years, but they show no activity. The doctor I'm seeing now is trying to help me, but he's not a neurologist. I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to go to a neurologist, because I know that if I had a lot of symptoms, that's what I would need to do. But since I have no symptoms, I don't know who to see. I want to get back to where I was before I got sick. I want to get back in shape and get back to my normal life. But I'm not sure what to do.

93,Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?,"Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system. The disease involves a loss of myelin, a fatty substance that protects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. This causes a number of different problems, including weakness, numbness, and vision problems. Multiple sclerosis is most common between the ages of 20 and 40, but it can develop at any age. There is no cure, but there are treatments to help slow the progression of the disease.
Sleep problems are common in older people, and they can be caused by a number of different factors. One common cause is the loss of a natural sleep rhythm. This often occurs as people get older. It can also be caused by medications, such as pain relievers or sleeping pills, or by problems related to chronic health conditions.
It may take some time to figure out exactly what is causing your sleep problems, and you may need to try several different treatments before finding one that works. Some people find that changes in lifestyle, such as getting more exercise, can help their sleep. Others may need medications or other treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, to improve their sleep.
It is important to discuss any change in your sleep habits with your doctor. This will help your doctor to find the cause of the problem and to treat it if necessary."
94,When will I start to feel better with multiple sclerosis?,"The symptoms of multiple sclerosis are the result of the damage that MS causes to the protective covering of your nerves known as myelin. Myelin is like the insulation around electrical wires. When the insulation is damaged, nerve signals slow down or stop. When the nerve signals stop, your body can't work well.
 MS does not affect your brain, so you will continue to think, remember, and learn. MS also does not affect your eyes, so you won't have any vision problems.
 The most common MS symptoms are muscle weakness, fatigue, and problems moving your arms, legs, or body. You may also have problems with sensation, balance, and coordination. You may also have pain, bladder problems, and sexual problems.
 MS symptoms may come and go. They often get worse over time. But they can also come and go at the same time or stay the same, or they may be mild or severe. Some people have just one symptom, while others have many.
 MS symptoms may be very mild, or you may have serious symptoms that limit your daily activities.
 A: Symptoms can begin with any type of MS, but they tend to be milder with the relapsing-remitting MS. Symptoms can be mild, moderate, or severe and can come on suddenly or slowly. They can be mild or severe enough to keep you from carrying out your normal daily activities.
 The type of MS you have will determine how you should be treated and what your outlook is.
 A: MS is not contagious. It isn't caused by a virus, and you can't catch it from a person who has MS.
 A: MS is an autoimmune disease. It occurs when your immune system, which normally protects your body, attacks myelin, a fatty substance that protects nerves. MS is thought to have many causes. Researchers are investigating how genes, viruses, and other factors might trigger MS.
 A: MS is a chronic (long-lasting) disease. It's not fatal, but it can cause serious disability.
 A: Most people with MS live a normal life span. However, the disease may affect your life and your ability to carry out your daily activities. It can be tough to deal with the symptoms and the stress of having a chronic illness. But MS is treatable. You can live a full life and be active.
 Q: What is the cause of MS?
 A: No one knows what causes MS, but researchers are"
95,Reading problems in MS,"I have a problem reading files in MS. I want to create a function to read a file and return the number of lines in the file. I have a problem with the function and I don't know why. This is the function
int read_lines(const char* file_name)
{

 FILE *fp;
 int num_lines = 0;

 // Open the file
 fp = fopen(file_name, ""r"");

 // While there are lines in the file
 while (fgets(lines, sizeof(lines), fp)) 
 {
 // Add one to the number of lines
 ++num_lines;
 }

 // Close the file
 fclose(fp);

 return num_lines;
}

This is my main
int main(void)
{
 char line[50];

 printf(""Enter a file name: "");
 scanf(""%s"", line); // line is the file name

 int num_lines = read_lines(line);

 printf(""Number of lines: %d\n"", num_lines);
}

It doesn't work, I get an error message when I try to execute it. What did I do wrong?

A: The problem is that your line variable is not being initialized. You need to initialize it before you use scanf(). You can do this with memset().
memset (line, '\0', sizeof(line));

Or you could initialize it to a zero-terminated string.
char line[] = ""Enter a file name: "";


A: In main, you need to allocate memory for line.
memset(line,0,'\0', sizeof line);

You also need to check the return value of scanf to make sure that it actually read something.

96,most efficient and sustainable diets,"A vegetarian diet with a lot of fruit and vegetables.
 B: A meat-based diet with a variety of fruit and vegetables.
 C: A fish-based diet with a variety of fruit and vegetables.
 D: A vegetarian diet with a lot of fruit and vegetables and some fish.

I can't find any good resources to help me with this question. I have done some research into this area but I don't know what I'm doing. Can anyone help?

A: It's not so much the diet but the sustainable part that is key here.
If you are referring to the environment then it's a matter of how much of the food is grown locally and how much is shipped in.
If you are talking about the health of the eater then it's a matter of how many nutrients are in each food.
If you are talking about the health of the planet then it's a matter of how many resources are required to grow the food.
So, to answer the question, ""Which is most sustainable?"" you need to know what you mean by sustainability.
In the case of health, the most sustainable diet is the one which is easiest on your body and the easiest to digest. This means that the most sustainable diet is the least processed diet.
In the case of sustainability, it is the diet that uses the least amount of resources.
In the case of health, the least sustainable diet is the one that requires the most resources and energy to maintain.
In the case of sustainability, the most sustainable diet is the one that uses the least amount of resources and energy to produce.

131,exercises for better posture,"Stand with your feet together and your knees flexed. Hold your body with your shoulders back, chest up and your chin up.
 B: Bend your knees, keeping your back straight. Bend your hips forward, keeping your back straight.
 C: Stand up and walk.
 D: Stand with your feet together and your knees flexed. Hold your body with your shoulders back, chest up and your chin up. Bend your knees, keeping your back straight. Bend your hips forward, keeping your back straight.

The answer key for the above questions are A,C,B. I am confused with the last question. Why can't we use D as the answer?

A: The question is asking you to identify a series of actions that lead to a desired result (e.g. ""good posture"").
In the first two questions, you are asked to identify the desired result (in order to make a comparison), so you can compare actions that lead to the same or different results.
In the third question, you are being asked to identify the desired result, so that the question is more of a statement of fact than a comparison.
In the final question, you are being asked to identify the desired result, and then identify actions that lead to the same or different result.

A: The answer is C.

Stand with your feet together and your knees flexed. Hold your body with your shoulders back, chest up and your chin up. Bend your knees, keeping your back straight. Bend your hips forward, keeping your back straight. Stand up and walk.

The first and second questions are asking you to identify actions that lead to a desired result. The third question is asking you to identify the desired result. The final question asks you to identify actions that lead to the same or different results.
The answer is C because it matches the third question.

132,headpats scalp psoriasis,"Headpat, it's a psoriasis.

I have no idea what is being said here, can someone help?

A: I don't think there's anything offensive about this. It's just a play on words.
Headpat is an onomatopoeia, a word formed by imitation of the sound (in this case that of a head being patted on the head.
It's a joke that a psoriasis is also called a headpat, which is why the guy is saying ""headpat, it's a psoriasis"" - the psoriasis is called a headpat, so the psoriasis is called a headpat, so it's a headpat.
If you don't get it, you probably don't have a psoriasis.
