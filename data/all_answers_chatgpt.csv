By seeking medical attention and getting a diagnosis, individuals with multiple sclerosis can better manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life."
85,relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,"Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the most common form of multiple sclerosis (MS). It is characterized by episodes of acute worsening of neurological symptoms, called relapses or exacerbations, followed by periods of partial or complete remission. During these remission periods, the person affected by RRMS can regain some or all of their previous function, although they may still have some residual symptoms or deficits.

RRMS is caused by damage to the myelin sheath, the protective covering that surrounds nerve fibers, in the central nervous system. This damage leads to the formation of scar tissue, or lesions, that interfere with the transmission of nerve impulses. The symptoms of RRMS can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the lesions, but may include vision problems, muscle weakness, difficulty walking or maintaining balance, numbness, tingling, and cognitive disturbances.

There is currently no cure for RRMS, but there are several disease-modifying therapies available that can slow the progression of the disease and reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. These treatments work by targeting the immune system, which is thought to play a key role in the development and progression of MS. In addition to drug therapies, there are many other interventions that can help people with RRMS manage their symptoms and maintain their quality of life, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy."
86,secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,"Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) is a type of multiple sclerosis that occurs after a patient has been experiencing relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) for several years. RRMS is characterized by flares of symptoms followed by periods of remission, while SPMS is characterized by a steady worsening of symptoms without relapses or remissions.

SPMS is typically diagnosed after a patient has had RRMS for at least a decade, although it can occur earlier in some cases. Symptoms of SPMS can include mobility issues, vision problems, cognitive difficulties, and fatigue. These symptoms may worsen over time, leading to significant disability.

There is no cure for SPMS, but there are treatments that can help manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. These treatments may include medications, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes.

1. Chemotherapy: This is the primary treatment for triple negative breast cancer. It involves the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. Patients may receive a combination of drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel. Chemotherapy may be administered intravenously or orally.

2. Radiation therapy: This treatment is typically used after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells. It involves the use of high-energy beams of radiation to destroy cancerous cells. It may also help to relieve pain and other symptoms caused by the cancer.

3. Surgery: Although stage 4 breast cancer cannot be cured with surgery alone, it may be used to remove the primary tumor and reduce the size of cancerous lymph nodes. Surgery may also be used to remove metastatic tumors that are causing pain or other symptoms.

4. Immunotherapy: This is a newer type of treatment that helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. This treatment is often combined with chemotherapy. The most common immunotherapy drug used in triple negative breast cancer is pembrolizumab.

5. Targeted therapy: This type of treatment targets specific proteins or genes that promote cancer growth. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, are a type of targeted therapy that may be used in patients with BRCA mutations.

126,birth control suppression antral follicle count,"As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or experiences, but I can provide you some information about this topic.

Antral follicles are small, fluid-filled sacs that contain immature eggs. They can be visualized on an ultrasound and their count can be used as an indicator of a woman's ovarian reserve, which is the number and quality of eggs remaining in her ovaries. 

Birth control pills work by suppressing ovulation, which means that no eggs are released from the ovaries during the menstrual cycle. This may have an effect on the antral follicle count, as the ovaries are not being stimulated by the natural hormonal fluctuations of the menstrual cycle.

Some studies have suggested that long-term use of birth control pills may reduce the number of antral follicles, but the evidence is not conclusive. Additionally, the effect of birth control pills on antral follicle count may depend on the individual woman and her baseline ovarian reserve.

While birth control pills have been shown to be highly effective at preventing pregnancy, they should not be relied upon as a method of preserving fertility. If you are concerned about your ovarian reserve or fertility, you may want to speak with your healthcare provider about other options for monitoring and preserving your fertility."
