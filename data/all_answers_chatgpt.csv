116,"outcome prostate cancer","As an AI language model, I cannot have a personal experience of cancer. However, I can provide you with general information about prostate cancer.

Prostate cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the prostate gland, which is a small walnut-shaped gland that produces the seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm. In some cases, prostate cancer may not cause any symptoms or problems, but in others, it can grow and spread to other parts of the body, potentially causing serious health problems.

The outcome of prostate cancer depends on various factors, including the stage of the cancer, the age and general health of the patient, and the treatment options chosen. With early diagnosis and treatment, many men with prostate cancer can go on to live long and healthy lives. However, in advanced stages, the disease can be more challenging to treat, and the prognosis may not be as favorable. 

The five-year survival rate for localized prostate cancer (cancer that has not spread outside the prostate gland) is nearly 100%, while the five-year survival rate for cancer that has spread to other parts of the body is around 30%.

It is important to note that not all men with prostate cancer will experience the same outcome, and that early detection, regular screening, and appropriate treatment options can all improve the prognosis of this disease. If you have concerns about prostate cancer or have noticed any symptoms, it's important to speak with your doctor as soon as possible.",1
117,"stage 4 metastatic lung cancer outcome","The prognosis for stage 4 metastatic lung cancer is generally poor, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 10%. However, the specific outcome depends on various factors such as age, overall health, type of cancer, and response to treatment.

Treatment options for metastatic lung cancer typically include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and palliative care to improve the quality of life. However, even with treatment, the cancer may continue to grow and spread.

Some patients may experience remission or a prolonged survival period with the help of new therapies. Others may experience a dramatic improvement in symptoms and quality of life, extending their life beyond the predicted prognosis. However, for many patients, the outcome remains poor despite the best efforts of medical professionals.",1
118,"stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment","Stage 4 triple negative breast cancer is an advanced stage of cancer that can be difficult to treat. Treatment options may include:

1. Chemotherapy: Triple negative breast cancer is typically treated with chemotherapy to shrink the tumour and reduce the risk of metastasis (cancer spread).

2. Targeted therapy: Targeted therapy may be used to attack specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells that promote their growth and spread.

3. Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy may be used to treat the primary tumour or to target specific areas of the body where the cancer has spread.

4. Surgery: In some cases, surgery may be used to remove the primary tumour and surrounding lymph nodes.

5. Clinical trials: New treatments for triple negative breast cancer are constantly being developed and tested in clinical trials. Patients may be eligible to participate in these trials to access the latest treatments.

6. Palliative care: If the cancer has spread extensively, palliative care may be recommended to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.

It is important to discuss all treatment options with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for an individual patient.",1

126,"birth control suppression antral follicle count","As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs/ experiences. However, I can explain.

The use of birth control pills has been associated with a reduction in antral follicle count (AFC) in some studies. AFC is a measure of the number of small follicles present in the ovaries and is commonly used to assess ovarian reserve, or the number and quality of eggs remaining in the ovaries.

The mechanism behind this effect is not fully understood, but it is thought that the hormonal changes induced by birth control pills, particularly the suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, may play a role.

However, it is important to note that this effect is usually temporary and AFC typically returns to baseline levels within a few months of stopping birth control pills. Additionally, the use of birth control pills may actually have a protective effect on ovarian reserve in some cases, as it can help to reduce the risk of ovarian cysts and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), both of which can contribute to fertility issues.",1
127,"glasses for computer","As an AI language model, I do not have eyes nor use computers in a physical sense, but I can provide advice for human users that may help them reduce eye strain while using a computer.

1. Adjust computer settings: Brightness, contrast, and font size can affect eye strain. Adjusting these settings to match the lighting in the room can reduce eye fatigue.

2. Use the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, take a break and look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This helps reduce eye strain and refocuses the eyes.

3. Use blue light filter: Blue light emitted from computer screens can disrupt sleep patterns and cause eye strain. Use blue light filters on your computer, or wear glasses with blue light filtering lenses, to reduce eye strain.

4. Get computer glasses: Computer glasses are specially designed for computer use and have lenses that reduce glare and magnify the screen, making it easier for the eyes to focus on the screen.

5. Blink often: Staring at a computer screen for a long time can cause dry eyes. Blinking frequently can help keep the eyes hydrated and reduce dryness.",1
