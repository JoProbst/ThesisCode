1,what are the most common chronic diseases what effects do chronic diseases have for the society and the individual ,OA_LLama,OA_LLama1,0,Chronic diseases  also known as non-communicable diseases (NCDs)  are long-lasting conditions that can cause significant health problems. Some of the most common chronic diseases include:  Cardiovascular disease - including heart attack  stroke  and high blood pressure Diabetes mellitus - a condition characterized by high levels of sugar in the blood  often due to poor dietary choices or lack of physical activity Cancer - a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth of cells Chronic respiratory diseases - such as asthma  bronchitis  emphysema  and lung cancer Mental illnesses - including depression  anxiety disorders  bipolar disorder  schizophrenia  and other mental disorders Arthritis - joint pain and inflammation caused by damage to cartilage and other tissues Alzheimer's and other types of dementia - progressive brain disorders causing memory loss  confusion  and difficulty thinking and making decisions Effects on Society: The impact of chronic diseases on society is significant. They contribute significantly to the burden of morbidity  mortality  and healthcare costs  which affect individuals  families  communities  and entire countries. In many low-income countries  these diseases represent an increasing share of public spending on health care. According to WHO  NCDs account for more than 80% of deaths worldwide each year.  Effects on Individuals: For individuals living with chronic diseases  the impact can be profound and far-reaching. These diseases can lead to reduced quality of life  decreased productivity  and financial stress. People may require frequent medical attention  medications  and hospitalization  all of which can be costly. The emotional toll of managing a chronic disease can also take its toll on individuals and their loved ones. Additionally  chronic diseases can impede social interaction and participation  further exacerbating feelings of isolation and loneliness.

But what happens after those first few weeks or months of motivation pass? Life becomes busy, as it always does, and your dedication to physical fitness falters. You don’t feel you have the time, energy or, in some cases, finances to maintain this new commitment. So, yet again, your treadmill starts collecting dust, the gym membership goes unused and your running shoes get pushed back to the dark corners of your closet. So the question is, how do you combat what seems like the inevitable end to your new and improved lifestyle? What can you do to ensure you stay committed to your exercise routine? There are some important and useful tips and resources that you can utilize to stay laser-focused on physical activity and also improve your overall health. The newest resource is literally in the palm of your hand — your smartphone or other device. This is the age of technology for people with diabetes to use these resources for physical fitness, and overall health is improving every day. It is no secret that physical activity is vital for overall health but, particularly, for people with prediabetes[2] and Type 2 diabetes[3]. Recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports indicate that 84.1 million people have prediabetes, which is one out of every three American adults. And in fact, nine out of 10 individuals with prediabetes don’t even know that they have it. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical study demonstrated that people with prediabetes or at risk for Type 2 diabetes could reduce their risk of developing diabetes by 58 percent by participating in a structured lifestyle change program incorporating weight loss[4] and regular physical activity[5]. An additional 30 million U.S. adults already have Type 2 diabetes, and the positive benefits of weight loss and regular physical activity have long been established for this population as well. There are multiple exercise and physical activity benefits for those with prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes. The most important is obviously that exercise improves insulin sensitivity[6] and makes it easier to control blood glucose levels. Whether a person’s elevated glucose is a result of insufficient insulin production or the inability to use insulin effectively (insulin resistance[7]), physical activity will help lower blood glucose levels. In addition to the glucose-lowering effects, regular physical activity has long-term benefits in that it decreases the risk for chronic complications[8] for those with Type 2 diabetes. It helps maintain good cholesterol levels (high-density lipoproteins, or HDL), protects your heart and lowers blood pressure. Last, but certainly not least, regular exercise is essential to weight loss. Weight loss is directly related to a reduction in insulin resistance. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends daily exercise or, at the very least, no more than two elapsed days between exercise sessions. Ideally, people with Type 2 diabetes should perform both aerobic and resistance exercise training for optimal glycemic and health outcomes, according to the ADA. Based on the DPP, individuals with prediabetes or at high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes should get at least 150 minutes per week of physical activity. So you know about the important role exercise plays in the prevention of Type 2 diabetes as well as improved glycemic control in individuals with Type 2 diabetes. Now we need to translate that knowledge into practice — better yet, a practice that you maintain indefinitely. There are several keys to developing and sustaining a successful exercise program. The first step toward your commitment to physical activity is setting specific goals and having reasonable expectations. Too often, we set lofty but unachievable goals for exercise and are discouraged when we cannot meet them. The American Council on Exercise (ACE) outlines the SMART guide to goal setting for your new exercise program. With the SMART[9] method, your goals should be clearly defined: S=specific; M=measurable; A=attainable; R=relevant; T=timebound. The goals should be important to you and achievable. Finally, your exercise goals should have specific time frames that will motivate you and give you a sense of accomplishment. For example, a SMART fitness goal might be, “I will walk at least 10 minutes three times per week for the next three weeks.” This may not seem like a very ambitious goal to some, but for an individual new to exercise, this is usually a very realistic and achievable goal. With regard to being specific about your exercise goal, using the FITT principle to design your exercise program can be extremely helpful. Many people do not feel they have the knowledge to design a fitness program, and the FITT principle is a reasonable guide. FITT stands for frequency, intensity, time, and type. All of these components are equally important to create exercises that fit your goals and fitness levels and can help keep your goals reasonable for you. How often will you exercise? Frequency depends on a variety of factors, including your fitness level, exercise goals and type of physical activity. How hard will you work during exercise? For beginners, it is best to start with a low-intensity program. Using a heart rate monitor is a great way to monitor your intensity. How long will you exercise? The duration of your activity will again depend on your fitness level. It may be easier to complete smaller, more frequent exercise bouts than one longer duration activity. As time passes, you can slowly increase how long you exercise. What kind of activity are you going to do? It could be a cardio activity such as walking, some type of resistance training or a combination of both. Talk with your diabetes care team, especially your diabetes educator[10], to determine the right fitness goals for you. Mobile fitness applications or “apps” can be great assistants in meeting your health, fitness, and weight loss goals. They are always with you and can be personalized to fit your specific needs. Staying motivated in your fitness goals requires daily attention to your eating habits and exercise routine, and fitness apps can provide that extra support to move you in the right direction. Some fitness apps function more as trackers to help you log your exercise and track your progress while others provide actual workouts and exercise plans. Although these apps can vary in the tools they provide, they share a common goal: to promote physical activity and improve your fitness level and overall health. Using a fitness app to help you achieve your physical activity goals can be a great motivator. However, the fitness app is only an aid. Personal accountability is key for any fitness program or lifestyle change. Here are a few tips to get the most out of whatever fitness app you choose. Your fitness app should be on the home page of your phone or electronic device. If it is buried on the third or fourth page, you are less likely to use it. After all, the apps you see on the first page of your device are typically the ones you use the most. If you see it each time you power on your device, it is likely to trigger a subconscious reminder to make it happen. Most apps include a logging feature as part of their design. Immediately after a workout, get in the habit of logging it. This benefits you because you can constantly track your progress, and that, in itself, is a great incentive to keep up the good work. Better yet, plan your day of exercise and log it ahead of time so you are more likely to find time for it. Schedule your physical activity just as you would that important meeting. On most apps, you can manually input your workout and it will help calculate calories burned. Some apps include workouts that can be personalized to meet your fitness level and goals. It is easy to shy away from exercise simply because you lack confidence. With detailed instructions and examples, these apps can be great for beginners and allow people to work at their own pace. Since they can be done virtually anywhere, apps can eliminate the typical excuses that you don’t have time to go to the gym. A large majority of fitness app users stop using their app within the first week because they aren’t using the app consistently every day. That means that only a small portion of users stay on track with their app and exercise routine. Fitness apps only really work if you use them every day. Furthermore, most apps offer graphing features to visualize your progress and see if you are on track with your goals. Quite simply, seeing your progress is a foolproof way to keep you moving in the right direction. The bottom line is: Embrace technology and let it work for you in the new year. With individualized workouts, progress tracking capabilities and inspirational virtual communities, fitness apps can motivate you and turn exercise into a fun and rewarding experience. Choose a fitness app that can work with your lifestyle, and use these tips to stick with the program. Keep in mind that using a fitness app does not replace the professional advice of your health-care provider or trained fitness professional. Always check with your health-care provider before beginning any exercise program. Talk with your diabetes educator to see what plan may be right for you. Be SMART, set a realistic goal.

35,is a ketogenic keto diet suitable for people with diabetes ,OA_LLama,OA_LLama35,72,The KETO/Keto Diet can be beneficial to some  but not all individuals. To determine if the KETO/Keto Diet is right for you or your friends and family members who have Diabetes please consult a medical professional as well as a registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN).  The Keto Diet may help manage blood sugar levels for those who are insulin resistant due to obesity; however  it may cause harm in Type 2 diabetic patients.[3] Individuals taking the medication SGLT-2 Inhibitors should avoid the KETO/Keto Diet since these drugs work by blocking the reabsorption of glucose into the bloodstream via the kidneys which could lead to hypoglycemia or low blood sugar.[4][5] Another study found that participants experienced a significant decrease in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels after following the Keto Diet compared to other Diabetic meal plans.[6] Please remember these results do not reflect every individual's health outcome and should only serve as guidance when making informed decisions about one's health along with support from medical professionals.

The diet is very low in carbohydrates, high in fat and moderate in protein. While the diet is considered safe for most people, it’s associated with some unpleasant side effects. The keto flu, also called the carb flu, is a term coined by followers to describe the symptoms they experience when beginning the diet. This article investigates what the keto flu is, why it happens and how to ease its symptoms. The keto flu is a collection of symptoms experienced by some people when they first start the keto diet. These symptoms, which can feel similar to the flu, are caused by the body adapting to a new diet consisting of very little carbohydrates. Reducing your carb intake forces your body to burn ketones for energy instead of glucose. Ketones are byproducts of fat breakdown and become the main fuel source when following a ketogenic diet. Normally, fat is reserved as a secondary fuel source to use when glucose is not available. This switch to burning fat for energy is called . It occurs during specific circumstances, including starvation and fasting (). However, ketosis can also be reached by adopting a very low-carb diet. In a , carbohydrates are typically reduced to under 50 grams per day (). This drastic reduction can come as a shock to the body and may cause withdrawal-like symptoms, similar to those experienced when weaning off an addictive substance like caffeine (). The keto flu is a term used to describe flu-like symptoms associated with beginning the very low-carb ketogenic diet. Switching to a very low-carb diet is a major change, and your body may need time to adapt to this new way of eating. For some people, this transition period can be especially difficult. Signs of the keto flu may start popping up within the first few days of cutting back on carbs. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and vary from person to person. While some people may transition to a ketogenic diet without any side effects, others may experience one or more of the following symptoms (): These symptoms are commonly reported by those who have just begun the ketogenic diet and can be distressing. Symptoms typically last about a week, though some people may experience them for a longer period of time. While these side effects may cause some dieters to throw in the towel, there are ways to reduce them. When beginning a ketogenic diet, some people may experience symptoms, including diarrhea, fatigue, muscle soreness and sugar cravings. Luckily, there are ways to reduce its flu-like symptoms and help your body get through the transition period more easily. is necessary for optimal health and can also help reduce symptoms. A keto diet can cause you to rapidly shed water stores, increasing the risk of dehydration (). This is because glycogen, the stored form of carbohydrates, binds to water in the body. When dietary carbohydrates are reduced, glycogen levels plummet and water is excreted from the body (). Staying hydrated can help with symptoms like fatigue and muscle cramping (). Replacing fluids is especially important when you are experiencing keto-flu-associated diarrhea, which can cause additional fluid loss (). While exercise is important for and keeping body weight in check, strenuous exercise should be avoided when experiencing keto-flu symptoms. Fatigue, muscle cramps and stomach discomfort are common in the first week of following a ketogenic diet, so it may be a good idea to give your body a rest. Activities like intense biking, running, weight lifting and strenuous workouts may have to be put on the back burner while your system adapts to new fuel sources. While these types of exercise should be avoided if you are experiencing the keto flu, light activities like walking, yoga or leisurely biking may improve symptoms. Replacing dietary electrolytes may help reduce keto-flu symptoms. When following a ketogenic diet, levels of insulin, an important hormone that helps the body absorb glucose from the bloodstream, decrease. When insulin levels decrease, the kidneys release excess sodium from the body (). What’s more, the keto diet restricts many foods that are high in , including fruits, beans and starchy vegetables. Getting adequate amounts of these important nutrients is an excellent way to power through the adaptation period of the diet. Salting food to taste and including potassium-rich, keto-friendly foods like green leafy vegetables and avocados are an excellent way to ensure you are maintaining a healthy balance of electrolytes. These foods are also high in , which may help reduce muscle cramps, sleep issues and headaches (). Fatigue and irritability are common complaints of people who are adapting to a ketogenic diet. Lack of sleep causes levels of the stress hormone to rise in the body, which can negatively impact mood and make keto-flu symptoms worse (, ). If you are having a difficult time falling or staying asleep, try one of the following tips: : is a stimulant that may negatively impact sleep. If you drink caffeinated beverages, only do so in the morning so your sleep is not affected (). : Shut off cell phones, computers and televisions in the bedroom to create a dark environment and promote restful sleep (). : Adding Epsom salt or lavender essential oil to your bath is a relaxing way to wind down and get ready for sleep (). : Waking at the same time every day and avoiding oversleeping may help normalize your sleep patterns and improve sleep quality over time (). Transitioning to a very low-carb diet can cause you to crave foods that are restricted on the ketogenic diet, such as cookies, bread, pasta and bagels. However, eating , the primary fuel source on the ketogenic diet, will help reduce cravings and keep you feeling satisfied. In fact, research shows that low-carb diets help reduce cravings for sweets and high-carb foods (). Those having a difficult time adapting to the ketogenic diet may have to eliminate carbohydrates gradually, rather than all at once. Slowly cutting back on carbs, while increasing fat and protein in your diet, may help make the transition smoother and decrease keto-flu symptoms. You can combat the keto flu by staying hydrated, replacing electrolytes, getting plenty of sleep, avoiding strenuous activities, eating enough fat and cutting out carbs slowly over time. People adapt to ketogenic diets differently. While some may experience weeks of keto-flu symptoms, others may adjust to the new diet with no adverse side effects. The symptoms people experience are tied to how their bodies adjust to a new fuel source. Usually, carbs provide the body with energy in the form of glucose. When carbs are substantially reduced, the body burns ketones from fat instead of glucose. Those who typically consume lots of carbs, especially refined carbs like pasta, sugary cereal and soda, may have a more difficult time when beginning the ketogenic diet. Thus, the transition to a high-fat, very low-carb diet may be a struggle for some, while others are able to switch between fuel sources easily with little to no keto-flu symptoms. The reason some people adapt to ketogenic diets easier than others is unknown, but genetics, electrolyte loss, dehydration and carbohydrate withdrawal are believed to be the driving forces behind the keto flu. Luckily, the uncomfortable symptoms of the keto flu only last about a week for most people. However, some people may have a more difficult time adapting to this high-fat, low-carb diet. For these individuals, symptoms may last several weeks. Fortunately, these symptoms will gradually decrease as your body gets used to converting ketones into energy. While keto-flu symptoms are commonly reported by those shifting to a ketogenic diet, if you are feeling particularly unwell and experiencing symptoms like prolonged diarrhea, fever or vomiting, it’s best to contact your doctor to rule out other causes. Some people may experience keto-flu symptoms due to genetics, electrolyte loss, dehydration and carbohydrate withdrawal. The keto flu usually lasts for about a week, but some may experience symptoms for over a month. Although the ketogenic diet may be helpful for many people, it’s not suitable for everyone. For example, the ketogenic diet may not be appropriate for pregnant or breastfeeding women, children and teens, unless it’s being used therapeutically under medical supervision. Furthermore, this diet should be avoided by those with certain health conditions like kidney disease, liver disease or pancreatic conditions. Also, those with who are interested in following a ketogenic meal plan should consult their doctor to determine if this diet is safe and suitable for their specific needs. Lastly, this diet may not be appropriate for individuals who are hypersensitive to dietary cholesterol, who account for around one-quarter of the world’s population (). The ketogenic diet may not be safe for pregnant women, children, people with kidney, liver or pancreatic disease and those who are sensitive to dietary cholesterol. The keto flu is a collection of symptoms associated with the body adapting to a ketogenic diet. Nausea, constipation, headaches, fatigue and sugar cravings are common in some people who are adapting to a high-fat, low-carb diet. Staying hydrated, replacing lost electrolytes, getting enough rest and ensuring you are consuming proper amounts of fat and carbohydrates are ways to reduce keto-flu symptoms.

45,can diabetes be cured ,OA_LLama,OA_LLama45,424,The causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are not well understood  but current research suggests that it is a complex neurodevelopmental condition caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There is currently no single 'cure' for ASD  as the symptoms can vary greatly from person to person.  However  there are treatments available that can help manage some of the symptoms associated with ASD  such as behavior therapy  medication  and educational interventions. These approaches aim to improve communication skills  social functioning  and daily living abilities in individuals with ASD. Additionally  early diagnosis and intensive treatment during childhood may lead to significant improvements over time  although more research is needed on long-term outcomes. It's important for people with ASD to work closely with healthcare professionals to develop an individualized plan for managing their symptoms and improving their quality of life.,"COVID-19 Vaccines: Information about COVID-19 vaccines and how we're preparing for distribution. Can you ""reverse"" type 2 diabetes? Can you cure it? Diabetes can go into . When diabetes is in remission, you have no signs or symptoms of it. But your risk of is higher than normal. That's why you make the same daily healthy choices that you do for active type 2 diabetes. There is no known cure for type 2 diabetes. But it can be controlled. And in some cases, it goes into remission. For some people, a diabetes-healthy lifestyle is enough to control their blood sugar levels. That means losing weight if you are overweight, eating healthy foods, and being more active. But most people with type 2 diabetes also need to take one or more medicines or insulin. Of those people who don't need diabetes medicine, some find that their diabetes does ""reverse"" with weight control, diabetes-healthy eating, and exercise. Their bodies are still able to make and use insulin, and their blood sugar levels go back to normal. Their diabetes is in remission. ""Complete remission"" is 1 year or more of normal A1c and fasting glucose levels without using diabetes medicine. When you have complete remission, you still get tested for high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and kidney and eye problems. You do regular foot checks. ""Prolonged remission"" is 5 years or more of normal A1c and blood sugar levels without using diabetes medicine. You might have lab tests less often. But your doctor will still check on any heart, eye, foot, or other health problems you have had from diabetes, even if they are better than before. Remission is in the early stage of diabetes or after a big weight loss. It can also happen after for weight loss, which can trigger healthy changes in the body's insulin system. Remission is in the later stages of diabetes, because the body may slowly lose its ability to make insulin over time. Whether your diabetes is under control or in remission, the keys to keeping high blood sugar down are weight control, exercise, and a diabetes-healthy diet. There's no way to know in advance if your body can ""reverse"" your diabetes. It happens for some people and not for others, despite the same diet, exercise, weight loss, or even bariatric surgery. Experts don't fully understand why. Your goal is to do whatever it takes to keep your blood sugar in your target range. You may go into remission, or you may not. Keep these guidelines in mind. Carbohydrate raises your blood sugar higher and more quickly than any other nutrient. Eat foods with protein, fat, and fiber—they don't raise your blood sugar as much. To help take charge of your diabetes, manage how much and what type of carbohydrate you eat. Spread carbs throughout your day. When you are active, your body uses sugar. You can use activity to help lower your blood sugar and manage your diabetes. Exercise also can help you lose weight and stay at a healthy weight. If you use medicine, you may find you need less of it when you increase your exercise. Over time, exercise helps some people stop using medicine. The A1c test gives you your average blood sugar level over the few months before the test. Generally, A1c is checked at least 2 times a year. Talk with your doctor about how often you should have this test. Some risks related to diabetes, such as heart disease, are still higher than normal even when your blood sugar is controlled. So work closely with your doctor, and go to all of your appointments. Buse JB, et al. (2009). Consensus statement: How do we define cure of diabetes? , 32(11): 2133–2135.

52,what are the most common mental health problems how can i prevent or manage the most common mental health problems ,OA_LLama,OA_LLama52,136,Common mental health issues include anxiety  depression and OCD. Anxiety is often treated with therapy  as well as medications like benzodiazepenes (such as Xanax) or antidepressants (such as Prozac). Depression is typically treated using therapy  as well as antidepressant drugs such as fluoxetine. For many people  their mental health may be impacted by factors in their environment that cause them stress. In these cases  it's important to identify those sources of stress and work towards reducing or eliminating them if possible. This could mean finding a new job or moving out of an undesirable living situation  for example. Exercise is also believed to have benefits for the brain  and can help reduce symptoms of certain mental disorders. When facing difficult situations  practicing mindfulness techniques can improve your ability to cope and maintain good mental health. Some simple examples of this include meditation or deep breathing exercises which might focus you on the present moment instead of worrying about things outside of your control or dwelling over past events. It is not uncommon to struggle with mental health at some point in life; seeking support from friends and family  or professionals such as counselors  psychiatrists  or therapists can provide additional tools to help address mental health challenges and make positive changes in one's life. Making sure that you prioritize taking care of yourself physically - getting enough sleep  eating nutritious meals  etc. - will better enable you to handle whatever comes up emotionally.,"When you’re living with a mental health problem, or supporting someone who is, access to the right information is vital. If you're finding things hard emotionally right now, you're not alone. We're here to provide information and support.

The Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey is published every seven years and is based on the results of a household survey in England. One in five women (19 per cent) had reported symptoms of common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety disorders One in five adults (21 per cent) reported that they had thought of taking their own life at some point One in four 16 to 24 year old women (26 per cent) surveyed has self-harmed, more than twice the rate in young men (10 per cent). One in three adults (37 per cent) with common mental health problems were accessing mental health treatment, in 2014 Responding to these results, Paul Farmer, Chief Executive of Mind, said: “We welcome this new survey data by NHS Digital which provides a useful insight into the nation’s mental health. Nothing has improved when it comes to the prevalence of mental health problems in England. It’s also particularly concerning to see the amount of women experiencing common mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, has risen. It’s shocking that a quarter of young women have been self-harming, and a fifth of adults have felt suicidal. “It’s difficult to know the exact reasons behind these changes and they are likely to be due to a huge combination of factors. It’s also worth bearing in mind that this could be an indication that more people are coming forward if and when they are concerned about their own mental health, and that GPs and other health professionals are quickly recognising symptoms and prescribing relevant treatments and services where necessary. “It’s good to see that the proportion of people accessing mental health services has increased to one in three adults, however this is only for those with common mental health problems. It’s still clear that nowhere near enough people are getting the support they need – in fact, more people than not are getting no treatment at all. We want to see everyone experiencing a mental health problem being able to access the treatments and services they need, when they need them. We still have a long way to go before our mental health is treated as equally important to our physical health. These data make it clear to the Government that when it comes to the nation’s mental health, the time to act is now.” Mind Infoline is closed right now, for support visit our  © 2021 Mind We're a registered charity in England (no. 219830) and a registered company (no. 424348) in England and Wales."
53,what is psychotherapy ,OA_LLama,OA_LLama53,85,Psychotherapy can be defined as a form of treatment that involves talking with a licensed therapist to help people overcome mental health problems or issues in their lives. It involves exploring thoughts  feelings and behaviors in order to gain insight into one's emotional state and work towards improving it through various therapeutic techniques. The goal of psychotherapy is to empower individuals to make positive changes in their lives by providing them with the tools they need to cope with difficult situations and improve their overall well-being.,"Psychotherapy is seen as a serie of cognitive emotional interactions between the patient and the therapist. The emotional impact of this interaction forms the basis of the patient therapist relationship, which provides the principal reinforcement in certain phases of therapy. The actual method of intervention depends on the training and the preference of the therapist, the condition of the patient, and the state of therapy. The emotional tone of the patient therapist relationship may vary from patient to patient, and also in the same patient during various states of therapy. Therapists generally aim to reduce anxiety and to clarify conditions, but often they have to temporarily provoke anxiety and disorganize their patients to modify the relationship and/or to induce a change of maladaptive attitudes.

55,how to manage multiple sclerosis ,OA_LLama,OA_LLama55,467,Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic and often disabling disease of the central nervous system that affects about 2.5 million people worldwide. The condition causes damage to nerve fibres in the brain  spinal cord and optic nerves due to inflammation and scarring (sclerosis). There are different types of MS including relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS)  secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). While there’s no cure for MS yet  early treatment can help prevent or delay some of the physical problems caused by MS attacks. Here's how you can best manage your health with this condition: 1. Get professional medical advice: Your doctor will be able to give you personalised recommendations on treatments and lifestyle changes based on your symptoms. They may also refer you to other specialists like physiotherapists  occupational therapists or speech pathologists. Make sure to attend all your appointments and ask as many questions as possible.  2. Monitor your MS: Keep track of any new symptoms or worsening old ones using an MS journal. This information will come handy when discussing treatment options with your neurologist. You could also use mobile apps like MyMSTeam which tracks symptoms and provides tools for managing medications  exercise schedules etc. 3. Adhere strictly to prescribed medications: Drugs used to treat MS work by altering the immune response within the body. It’s essential to take them exactly as directed by your doctor so that they remain effective. If you have trouble sticking to your drug regimen  talk to your pharmacist who might offer tips such as pill organizers or reminders via text message. 4. Exercise regularly: Regular activity helps strengthen muscles and improve balance reducing your chances of falls. Low impact exercises like swimming  yoga or cycling would be more comfortable for most people with MS. Start slow and gradually increase intensity over time. 5. Maintain a healthy diet: A balanced diet rich in fruits  vegetables  w,"The Multiple Sclerosis Association of America Launches Updated My MS Manager Mobile Phone App to Help People with MS Better Manage Their Disease The Multiple Sclerosis Association of America Launches Updated My MS Manager Mobile Phone App to Help People with MS Better Manage Their Disease ™, the first-of-its kind mobile phone app created by the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA) to help individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) better manage their disease, now offers new features including a way to connect and share information with one’s physician.

For additional information, please visit or call . Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS), which consists of the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord. MS damages or destroys the protective covering (known as myelin) surrounding the nerves of the CNS, and can potentially injure the nerves as well. This damage causes reduced communication between the brain and nerve pathways. Common MS symptoms include visual problems, overwhelming fatigue, difficulty with balance and coordination, and various levels of impaired mobility. Many experts estimate that 2.5 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with this disease, and most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 50. MS is not contagious and researchers continue to look for both a cause and a cure.

Smith, Hasti Atashi Shirazi, , , Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disorder targeting the central nervous system (CNS). The relapsing-remitting phase of MS is largely driven by peripheral activation of autoreactive T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 lymphocytes. In contrast, compartmentalized inflammation within the CNS, including diffuse activation of innate myeloid cells, characterizes the progressive phase of MS, the most debilitating phase that currently lacks satisfactory treatments. Recently, bryostatin-1 (bryo-1), a naturally occurring, CNS-permeable compound with a favorable safety profile in humans, has been shown to act on antigen-presenting cells to promote differentiation of lymphocytes into Th2 cells, an action that might benefit Th1-driven inflammatory conditions such as MS. In the present study, we show that bryo-1 provides marked benefit in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an experimental MS animal model. Preventive treatment with bryo-1 abolishes the onset of neurologic deficits in EAE. More strikingly, bryo-1 reverses neurologic deficits after EAE onset, even when treatment is initiated at a late stage of disease when peak adaptive immunity has subsided. Treatment with bryo-1 in vitro promotes an anti-inflammatory phenotype in antigen-presenting dendritic cells, macrophages, and to a lesser extent, lymphocytes. These findings suggest the potential for bryo-1 as a therapeutic agent in MS, particularly given its established clinical safety. Furthermore, the benefit of bryo-1, even in late treatment of EAE, combined with its targeting of innate myeloid cells suggests therapeutic potential in progressive forms of MS.

58,risk to develop multiple sclerosis,OA_LLama,OA_LLama58,14,There are several risk factors that can increase a person's chances of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). Some of the most common ones include:  * Age: MS is more common in people who are older  with peak onset occurring between 20 and 50 years old. * Genetics: Having a family member with MS increases your risk of developing the condition. * Gender: Women are at higher risk for MS than men. * Environmental exposures: Certain viral or bacterial infections may trigger MS  as well as living far from the equator  which could be related to vitamin D deficiency. * Autoimmune diseases: People with other autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes  lupus  rheumatoid arthritis  or inflammatory bowel disease have an increased risk of developing MS. * Smoking: Smokers are at greater risk of getting MS and progressing more quickly once they have it.  It's important to note that having these risk factors does not necessarily mean you will get MS. Conversely  if you don't have any known risks factors  you still might develop the disease. If you suspect you may have symptoms of MS  it's essential to speak with your doctor about further evaluation and potential diagnosis.,"Our news web pages include ground-breaking multiple sclerosis news and research from around the world.  These news stories are taken from external sources and as such, MS-UK does not verify, endorse or accept responsibility for their content.

Among their findings, they report numerous irregularities in the status of genes related to immune activity in the untreated group that normalized after long-term treatment with interferon beta. They also defined 277 immune-related genes that differed in their status between people who were categorized as “complete responders” to interferon therapy and those considered “partial responders.” This raises the future possibility of developing a lab test to predict an individual’s likelihood of benefiting from interferon therapy. The research was supported by the National MS Society and Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals. The team (Xuan Feng, PhD, Anthony Reder, MD, and colleagues) published their findings in ()   DETAILS Studies have noted disruptions in the activity of the immune messenger protein interferon beta in people with MS. Versions of interferon beta are administered as disease-modifying therapies for relapsing MS. This team took advantage of advanced  microarray technology – which allows for analysis of the products of thousands of genes – to understand more about how immune cell-related genes respond to interferon therapy in people with MS, and whether interferon provides long-term resolution of abnormal immune responses.   Investigators examined changes in the genes in immune-related blood cells obtained from 46 people with MS and 8 healthy people without MS. Among the group with MS, 27 people had received therapy with interferon beta and 19 had never taken disease-modifying therapy for MS. The team followed participants for five years and collected blood samples at specific times to examine short-term and long-term effects.   Among their findings, the team showed that 8,800 genes showed irregular status in those who were untreated, but not in those who had undergone long-term treatment with interferon beta. The irregularities affected genes involved in immune system regulation and neuroprotection. There were also significant differences between people categorized as “complete responders” to interferon compared to those considered “partial responders.” This raises the future possibility of developing a lab test to predict an individual’s likelihood of benefiting from interferon therapy --- a personalized medicine approach that would improve the ability to shut down immune attacks in MS.   The team (Xuan Feng, PhD, Anthony Reder, MD, and colleagues from the University of Chicago and other institutions) published their findings in ()   Read more about medications used to modify the disease course in MS Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

62,disclosing multiple sclerosis at work how will colleagues react ,OA_LLama,OA_LLama62,1,It is difficult to predict exactly how your colleagues will react when you disclose a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) at work. Some may be understanding and supportive  while others may have negative or uninformed attitudes towards the condition.  It's important for you to consider how much information about your MS you want to share with your coworkers  as well as what impact this could have on your job duties or working relationships. You may choose to provide only basic information about your symptoms and treatment plan  or you may feel more comfortable sharing details about your diagnosis in order to educate others about MS.  Regardless of their reactions  it can help to have a clear idea of your own needs and boundaries around discussing your health at work. This might include establishing communication preferences with your employer  such as setting up regular check-ins or designating someone to act as a point person for any questions or concerns related to your health.  If you are concerned about potential discrimination or other adverse effects on your job due to your MS diagnosis  you may wish to consult with an employment lawyer or seek guidance from a disability rights organization in your area. They can offer advice on navigating legal protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)  negotiating reasonable accommodations with your employer  and advocating for yourself within the workplace.,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS         People in the workforce may consider disclosing information about their medical condition or impairment for a variety of reasons — some that are more emotional and others that are more practical. They may feel uncomfortable in one way or another about keeping their medical condition a secret, or want their boss and colleagues to understand the ways in which their medical condition can impact their attendance or job performance from day to day. Or, they may consider disclosing this information in order to request time off or some kind of accommodation. Many people consider disclosing information about their medical condition or impairment at work because they feel the need to share the information with the people around them. Feeling comfortable on the job — particularly with one's boss and co-workers — can make the difference between a satisfying job situation and a very unpleasant one. Disclosing can help you feel less alone. It may reduce feelings of guilt or dishonesty that can sometimes occur. But while there may be significant emotional reasons for disclosing this important information now, there are also significant reasons to delay disclosure. Keeping a secret can be stressful and create anxiety. Once you disclose, you may feel a sense of relief — and find support from people in the workplace. Disclosing medical information sooner rather than later may provide an opportunity to speak about your MS in a positive light, as opposed to waiting until a problem arises. It makes it easier to communicate your needs in the event that your condition changes and you need an accommodation. Once you have given people this important information about yourself, you can’t take it back. Some people have misconceptions about MS and prejudices. Despite your best efforts, they may react negatively toward you, incorrectly viewing you as someone less competent or less able to handle stress. You could be held back from promotions following disclosure but find it difficult to prove this was due to your MS. People also have very practical reasons for wanting to disclose information about their medical condition or impairment on the job: to take advantage of available legal protections; to request time off to deal with medical problems or appointments; because a medication or the disease itself is affecting work performance; because symptoms are becoming obvious to others. Although disclosing now may be helpful or even necessary in some circumstances, it may also be advisable to delay disclosure by making optimal use of vacation time and sick days. You may endanger your health by not getting the medical care you need. Your job status or reputation may be negatively impacted if your work is slipping or your evaluations are poor and you need assistance to improve your performance.   You need to disclose information about your medical condition or impairment in order to take advantage of the and the provisions of the — resources that will help you maintain your employment. You’re currently experiencing an exacerbation that you could ride out by using your vacation and sick time, making disclosure unnecessary at this time. Disclosure of information about one's medical condition or impairment is required to make certain common requests (medical leave or accommodations) from an employer. The person's doctor must support these requests by documenting the ways in which the medical condition limits his or her job performance. If you decide to request a job accommodation or medical leave from your employer, or apply for short-term disability, you will need to supply documentation from your physician in support of your request: Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), your physician is only required to certify that you have a ""medical condition"" that limits you in a particular way. The doctor is not required to provide your diagnosis. However, your employer has the right to ask for additional information if the information that has been provided is not detailed enough to support your request. If you are requesting an accommodation or medical leave, your employer needs sufficient information  about your medical condition or impairment to determine that you have a qualified disability under the ADA. This may, in some cases, result in disclosure of your diagnosis. While it may feel better to disclose information about your medical condition or impairment at this time, it may not be in your best interest in the long run. Special consideration should be paid if you  want to take advantage of available legal protections or request an accommodation.

63,will multiple sclerosis affect my career ,OA_LLama,OA_LLama63,291,Multiple Sclerosis (MS) can have an impact on your career  but it depends on various factors such as the severity of the disease and how well you manage your symptoms. Some people with MS are able to continue working for many years without significant disruptions  while others may need to make adjustments or even stop working altogether.  It is important to discuss any concerns about work with your healthcare team and employer. They can help assess your abilities and provide support to accommodate any limitations that arise due to your condition. This might include flexible hours  modified tasks  or adaptive equipment. Additionally  there are resources available through government programs  non-profit organizations  and other sources that can assist with vocational counseling  job training  and financial assistance. It's also crucial to prioritize self-care and maintain a positive outlook  focusing on what activities you can still do rather than those you can no longer pursue. With proper management and support  living with MS does not necessarily mean giving up your career goals and aspirations.,"Cultivating the multiple sclerosis workforce of the future on behalf of the FCMSC MS Mentorship Forum Participants Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex neurologic disorder that affects people with ever-changing needs. The MS health-care field has entered an era of exponential knowledge growth in which better understanding of the immunologic dysregulation of the disease has translated into an expanding array of treatment options. It is estimated that, if it has not already, within the next decade the demands of a growing MS patient population will outstrip the number of professionals dedicated to the management of this chronic, lifelong disease. Therefore, there is a pressing need to attract and retain clinicians in this dynamic field. In response to this need, the Foundation of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers organized a 2-day colloquium, a Mentorship Forum, on January 23-24, 2015, bringing together talented internal medicine and neurology trainees from across North America with an interest in MS and neuroimmunology. This article highlights the rationale for the MS Mentorship Forum, its structure and content, and its outcomes. We believe that the stage has been set to interest young, promising clinicians in learning more about MS and to encourage them to consider a career in this field.

72,is the covid 19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs ,OA_LLama,OA_LLama72,13,Yes  the Covid-19 vaccines are considered safe for individuals who take medications to treat multiple sclerosis (MS). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone aged 6 months and older receive a COVID-19 vaccine if they haven't already been infected with or had COVID-19.  It is important for individuals who have MS to speak with their healthcare provider about any concerns regarding potential risks associated with receiving the vaccine. However  there is no evidence that suggests that getting vaccinated against COVID-19 will worsen symptoms of MS or interact negatively with disease-modifying therapies used to manage MS. In fact  getting vaccinated can help prevent serious complications from COVID-19 infection which could potentially worsen MS symptoms. Additionally  it is essential for individuals with MS to maintain good vaccination rates within their community to reduce transmission of COVID-19 to vulnerable populations such as those living with disabilities like MS.,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS Information about people living with multiple sclerosis who have also been diagnosed with coronavirus (COVID-19) is still limited. However, the National MS Society is sharing what we know, what we don’t know and what we are striving to learn so that we get to the answers people with MS need as quickly as possible Not much is yet known about people living with MS who have also been diagnosed COVID-19. The disease course and mortality rate are still being studied. Most information is only anecdotal data right now, meaning there are only individual reports of people with MS who have gotten the virus. Researchers across the globe are working to learn more about COVID-19 as quickly as possible. Recently, two registries launched in the United States to help people with MS and their providers share insights. There are also registries in the United Kingdom, Italy and Australia It is known that infections in general may provoke new symptoms or new MRI activity. As COVID-19 is an infection, it is possible that an MS relapse could occur. Sometimes a fever can provoke a temporary worsening of old symptoms. If you are concerned about your symptoms, please contact your MS provider. There are several vaccines for COVID-19 in early clinical trials, but any vaccine will not be available for several months. When a vaccine is available, it will be important for all people, including those living with MS, to consider getting it. Please note, certain DMTs could affect the timing of vaccine administration. There are no drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19, but the FDA has authorized the use of some treatments for those who meet specific criteria. If someone with MS gets COVID-19 and meets the criteria to use an authorized drug, it will be prescribed. Individual risks, including current use of a DMT, will need to be considered in this decision making. To learn more about emergency use authorization (EUA), please from the FDA.

77,how do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms ,OA_LLama,OA_LLama77,1,Menopausal symptoms and MS symptoms can be similar or even the same.  The most common ones include: 1) Fatigue - This is a primary symptom of both conditions.  In menopause  it's often due to hormonal changes while in MS  fatigue may come from several factors such as muscle weakness and spasticity.   2) Cognitive difficulties - Both MSers and women going through menopause have experienced memory issues.  Some say they feel like their brain has turned into mush during these times.  These cognitive challenges also affect our ability to focus  concentrate and learn new things which makes work very difficult.   3) Muscles Weakness - Women experiencing menopause report feeling weaker overall compared to premenopausal years while those with MS experience more pronounced muscle weakness that comes on suddenly but then goes away after resting for an extended period of time (typically overnight). 4) Spasms/Stiffness - Stretching your legs before getting out of bed or standing up too fast usually results in some sort of muscle reaction whether you have MS or are post-menopausal.   5) Bladder problems - If you’re experiencing bladder issues  it could indicate either of these two things – however  if you also experience bowel problems along with the urinary issues  chances are good you might have Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalitis (PML)  a rare but deadly complication of MS. 6) Vision Issues - Double vision or trouble seeing at night can point towards both menopause AND relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis where optic neuritis causes temporary blindness in one eye.   7) Depression - Whether from being tired all the time or because life isn’t what was expected  depression is quite common during perimenopause and among people living with Multiple Sclerosis.,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     MS is three times and is in women of childbearing age than in any other age group. Many women report their MS symptoms fluctuate during their menstrual cycle and at menopause. The risks of taking an oral contraception pill (OPC) is no different for a woman with MS than it is for a woman who does not have MS. There is no evidence the OCPs reduce the effectiveness of DMTs. Conversely, there is no evidence that DMTs reduce the effectiveness of OCPs (). However, some medications used to treat MS symptoms interact with OPCs. Be sure to tell your MS healthcare provider and your gynecologic care provider of all the medications and supplements you are taking to ensure there are no interactions. Many women report that their MS symptoms temporarily worsen around the time of their period. A few studies have confirmed this  and others have shown that women on oral contraception have less worsening of their MS symptoms prior to the start of their period (; ). These findings have all come from relatively small studies, and more research is needed to fully characterize the relationship between MS and the menstrual cycle. The age of menopause onset does not appear to be affected by MS. Some women experience a worsening of their MS symptoms during menopause. And for some, the hot flashes associated with menopause may intensify or bring on MS symptoms. Menopause may make issues with mood, sleep, fatigue, cognitive problems or bladder function more challenging (Kaisey et al, 2018). You should discuss any new or worsening MS symptoms with your MS healthcare provider. There have not been any large studies of women with MS using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during menopause. If you have questions, discuss the use of HRT with your gynecologic care provider.

While there may be a genetic component to MS  it is not inherited in the same way as traits such as eye color or height.  While having a close relative with MS can increase your risk of developing the condition  it does not mean you will definitely develop MS yourself. Additionally  even if you have MS  your relatives are unlikely to develop the disease solely because they are related to you. The exact cause of MS is still unknown and more research is needed to understand how genetics play a role.

Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Medical Genetics: DNA Studies for Single Gene Defects Genes are made up of a chemical structure called DNA. To look for single gene defects, healthcare providers look at the DNA to see if it has any errors in it. Errors are known as mutations. DNA is gathered by taking a sample of blood or saliva. Or it is gathered from swabbing the inside of your cheeks (buccal swab). There are 2 ways to then check the DNA: These are done by looking at the actual gene itself. These are done by looking at markers very close to the gene. Direct DNA studies mean looking directly at a gene to see if there’s an error. Errors in the DNA may include a repeated piece of DNA (duplication), a missing piece of DNA (deletion), or a change in the DNA code (point mutation). Different types of errors cause different disorders. The first task is to find which type of error occurs in a family. This is done by checking the DNA of the family member with the disorder. The DNA is then compared with other family members. This can help show who else has the disorder or carries the gene for the disorder. This helps the family learn who’s at risk to pass it on to a child. In some cases, the error in the gene that causes a disorder is not yet known. In these cases, indirect studies can look for markers. Markers are sections of DNA that are almost always near the part of DNA suspected of causing the disorder. The studies look for an area of the genetic code that is passed on through the family with the disorder. When markers are close to a gene and are inherited together, they are called ""linked."" If someone has the set of linked markers, he or she will also have the gene that causes the disorder. Indirect DNA studies are also known as linkage studies or genetic mapping. The first task is to find which type of error occurs in a family. This is done by checking the DNA of the family member with the disorder. The DNA is then compared with other family members. This can help show who else has the disorder or carries the gene for the disorder. This helps the family learn who’s at risk to pass it on to a child. Linkage studies are complex and can take weeks or months to complete. The accuracy of the studies depends on how close the markers are to the gene that causes the disorder. In some cases, a reliable marker is not available. Then the test isn’t helpful to healthy family members. In many cases, several family members need to be tested to find an accurate set of markers and see who’s at risk for the disorder in the family. "
81,can i work and study full time with multiple sclerosis ,OA_LLama,OA_LLama81,1,Yes  it is possible to work and study full-time with multiple sclerosis (MS). However  the severity of symptoms can vary greatly from person to person. Some people may be able to continue working or studying without any major modifications  while others may need accommodations such as flexible schedules  modified assignments  or assistive technology.  It's important for individuals with MS to communicate their needs to their employer or educational institution in order to receive support and make necessary adjustments. Additionally  there are resources available through organizations like the National Multiple Sclerosis Society that provide information on legal rights at work  financial planning  and other topics related to living with MS. It may also be helpful to speak with a healthcare professional about treatment options that can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     Employment Study in MS Shows Value of Seeking Workplace Accommodations Employment Study in MS Shows Value of Seeking Workplace Accommodations In a survey of 70 people with MS, a majority of those who reported a stable or improved work situation over three years had sought out at least one work accommodation. The most common of these accommodations were flexible hours, written job instructions, the ability to work from home, and memory aids. Developing and achieving employment goals can be accomplished despite an MS diagnosis -- and the National MS Society is here to work with you as you navigate your options. The symptoms of MS commonly appear in early adulthood, at a time when young people are typically establishing themselves in their careers. While the initial symptoms might not interfere with work activities to any significant degree, symptoms can change over the years, likely requiring some adaptation in the working life of the person with MS. In this study by researchers at The State University of New York, Buffalo, 25.7% of people with MS surveyed had experienced a decline in employment over three years, most often a change from full-time to part-time employment or to complete unemployment. This loss within a short period of time highlights the need to identify those at risk for job issues quickly, and to find ways to address those issues with workplace accommodations. The factor most associated with negative employment changes was what the investigators called reduced conscientiousness (being diligent, organized). Accommodations might help to increase the ability of people with MS to better organize themselves and become more goal-oriented at work. The National MS Society provides for developing and achieving employment goals, including a video series, “,” guidance on deciding whether and when to disclose MS to employers,  how to identify and request effective , and , a workbook to help in considering career-related options. “Conscientiousness and deterioration in employment status in multiple sclerosis over 3 years” by Michael G Jaworski, III, Ralph HB Benedict, PhD, and colleagues at State University of New York, Buffalo, is published in the (Published online August 6, 2020).

83,why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis ,OA_LLama,OA_LLama83,-1,An exacerbation or 'relapse' of MS is when there are new symptoms  worsening symptoms  or both. It's common for people with relapsing-remitting MS to have periods where their disease activity increases and they have more frequent attacks (also known as flare-ups). It can be helpful to see your healthcare provider if you think that you may be having an attack so that you can discuss treatment options early on. If it is an acute attack then corticosteroids like Solu-Medrol would be administered intravenously over the course of five days in the hospital  this will speed up recovery from the attack. You should call 911 immediately though if you experience any sudden weakness in arms or legs along with loss of bladder or bowel control or vision changes; these could all be signs of a serious medical emergency. Early intervention and proper management by healthcare professionals has been shown to help reduce the severity and duration of attacks and also increase the chances of full recovery after each one.,"COVID-19 Vaccines: Information about COVID-19 vaccines and how we're preparing for distribution. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? You may want to have a say in this decision, or you may simply want to follow your doctor's recommendation. Either way, this information will help you understand what your choices are so that you can talk to your doctor about them. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? Take medicines after your first attack of multiple sclerosis or as soon as you are diagnosed. Don't take medicines now. Wait to see how the disease progresses. Your doctor may suggest medicines after your first attack or when multiple sclerosis (MS) is first diagnosed. Lasting damage to the can occur in the early stages of MS. Early treatment may prevent or delay some of this damage. Some people wait to see if their symptoms get worse before they make a decision to start taking MS medicines. Instead of medicines, you can try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and shots to help you manage your symptoms. It's hard to know the course that your MS will take. Doctors can't know for sure if your MS will get worse. A small number of people with MS have only mild disease and do well without treatment. But many get worse over time. Medicines can reduce the severity of attacks of and how often you have them. They may also reduce or delay disability. But they don't work for everyone. And there is no way to predict if they will work for you. These medicines have side effects that can range from flu-like symptoms to headaches, chest pain, flushing, infections, and allergic reactions to the injection. Some of these medicines can damage your liver or heart. These medicines are costly. Your cost will depend on your health plan coverage. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system—the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. It is also called MS. It can cause problems with muscle control and strength, vision, balance, feeling, and thinking. Your nerve fibers have a protective covering called . Without myelin, the brain and spinal cord can't communicate with the nerves in the rest of the body. MS slowly destroys myelin and nerve cells in the central nervous system. This causes muscle weakness and other symptoms. Most of the time, MS is not diagnosed unless a doctor can be sure you have had at least two attacks affecting at least two different areas of your . Your doctor will examine you, ask you questions about your symptoms, and do some tests. An MRI scan is often used to confirm the diagnosis. That's because the patches of damage (lesions) caused by MS attacks can be seen with MRI. MS is different for each person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. In general, MS follows one of four courses: Clinically isolated syndrome. The symptoms last for 24 hours or longer and go away. Relapsing-remitting. This means symptoms fade and then return off and on for many years. Secondary progressive, which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course and then becomes progressively worse. ""Progressive"" means it gets worse over time. Primary progressive. This means the disease is progressive from the start. Disease-modifying therapy means treatment to delay, change, or interrupt the natural course of the disease. For MS, this means taking medicine over a long period of time to reduce not only the number of attacks but also how bad they are. To slow down the spread of MS, your doctor may suggest medicines after your first attack or when you are first diagnosed with MS. People treated soon after being diagnosed with MS may have better results than those who delay treatment. Lasting damage to the can occur in the early stages of MS. Early treatment may prevent or delay some of this damage. Medicines for MS can be costly. They don't work for everyone. And it's hard to know who will benefit. Making a decision about starting disease-modifying therapy can be hard, especially if your symptoms have been mild. Some people wait to see if their symptoms get worse before they make a decision to start therapy. A small number of people with MS may never have more than a few mild episodes and never have any disability. But there is no way to know who will fall into this group. Medicines can't cure MS. They don't stop disease activity or reverse nervous system damage that has already happened. But drugs may reduce relapses and delay disability in many people with relapsing forms of MS. If you decide not to try disease-modifying therapy at this time, work with your doctor to monitor your health through regular checkups and periodic MRI scans to evaluate whether the disease is progressing. If new lesions are developing or existing lesions are growing, you may want to reconsider your decision and begin treatment. If you decide not to take MS medicines, there are some other things you can do. Take other medicine, such as , to relieve symptoms during attacks or relapses. Try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other treatment you can do at home to help you manage your symptoms and adjust to living and working with MS. Do what you can to stay well. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of rest, and try to reduce stress. Some people try alternative therapy to reduce their symptoms. Before you try any type of alternative treatment for MS, talk with your doctor about your treatment options. You can also get advice from an MS treatment center or the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. What do numbers tell us about benefits and risks of MS medicines? This section focuses on glatiramer and interferon beta, the most commonly used MS medicines. Progression from early symptoms to diagnosis of MS *Based on the best available evidence (evidence quality: ) Flushing, chest tightness, sweating, heart palpitations, anxiety, and shortness of breath (glatiramer) *Based on the best available evidence (evidence quality: ) The evidence suggests a slight positive effect for people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. But the quality of the evidence isn't good. It is . If you have had some early symptoms of MS but don't have a clear diagnosis yet, medicine may reduce the chance that your symptoms will progress to full-blown MS. Take a group of 100 people who have had an MS-like episode but do not yet have an MS diagnosis: Without medicines, 45 to 58 out of 100 may progress to an MS diagnosis. This means that 42 to 55 may not. With MS medicines, 34 to 35 out of 100 may progress to an MS diagnosis. This means that 65 to 66 may not. Your risk of needing a hospital stay over the next 2 years may be lower if you take medicines than if you don't. : Without MS medicines, 20 people out of 100 may need to be hospitalized over the next 2 years, while 80 out of 100 may not. With MS medicines, 12 out of 100 may need to be hospitalized over the next 2 years, while 88 out of 100 may not. Many people who take MS medicines have uncomfortable side effects. : With interferon beta, 48 out of 100 may have flu-like symptoms. This means that 52 out of 100 may not. The quality of the evidence about this is . With glatiramer, 24 out of 100 may have symptoms such as flushing, chest tightness, sweating, heart palpitations, anxiety, and shortness of breath. This means that 76 out of 100 may not. The quality of the evidence about this is . Some evidence is better than other evidence. Evidence comes from studies that look at how well treatments and tests work and how safe they are. For many reasons, some studies are more reliable than others. The better the evidence is—the higher its quality—the more we can trust it. The information shown here is based on the best available evidence. The evidence is rated using four quality levels: . Another thing to understand is that the evidence can't predict what's going to happen in your case. When evidence tells us that 2 out of 100 people who have a certain test or treatment may have a certain result and that 98 out of 100 may not, there's no way to know if you will be one of the 2 or one of the 98. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and active, relapsing disease start treatment with medicine as soon as possible after receiving a diagnosis. Most neurologists support this recommendation and now agree that permanent damage to the nervous system may occur early on, even while symptoms are still quite mild. Early treatment may help prevent or delay some of this damage. In general, treatment is recommended until it no longer provides a clear benefit. The National MS Society also says that treatment with medicine may be considered after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS (before MS is definitely diagnosed). Your doctor may suggest that you take MS medicines because: You have had symptoms that are most likely caused by multiple sclerosis, tests show you most likely have MS, and your doctor is confident that you have MS. You have just been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and early treatment may delay damage to your central nervous system. These medicines are the only ones proved to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses and delay disability. You take the type of medicine prescribed (pills, injections, or shots). You visit your doctor regularly for blood tests and to check your progress. These drugs can make relapses less severe and reduce how often they occur. Medicines can slow the spread of the disease by limiting new areas of damage in the brain. These drugs don't work for everyone. It is hard to predict who will benefit. The long-term risks of some of these drugs are not known. Side effects of these medicines can include flu-like symptoms, headaches, diarrhea, nausea, hair thinning, depression, chest pain, anxiety, flushing, and redness and swelling at the injection site (for shots or injections). You visit your doctor regularly to check your progress. You try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other treatment at home to adjust to living with MS. You avoid the risks and cost of medicines that you might not need or that may not work for you. You avoid taking medicine for multiple sclerosis if you end up being diagnosed with a different condition. You may have a higher chance of becoming disabled. Long-term use of steroid medicine may lead to other problems such as stomach ulcers, problems sleeping, and high blood pressure. Personal stories about treatment for multiple sclerosis These stories are based on information gathered from health professionals and consumers. They may be helpful as you make important health decisions. The MS episodes I've had were fairly mild, but I'm worried that next time the symptoms will be more severe. I don't think I'm being pessimistic by deciding to take interferon. I think I'm giving myself the best chance to live a long and healthy life. I have never been much of a risk-taker, and my health is definitely not something I want to risk. My doctor recommends that I take the medicine. Even if it turns out that I might not have needed treatment for MS, I would rather err on the side of caution by starting therapy now. I know I would really regret not doing the treatment if I had a relapse a year from now or even a few years from now. I generally try to avoid medicine when I can. My doctor really thinks it would be a good idea for me to take the medicine, but I don't want to deal with the side effects, and I'm not sure I like the idea of giving myself shots on a regular basis. I don't want to take medicine ""just in case"" I have problems with MS later. Besides, I can always reconsider if and when I have another episode. Your personal feelings are just as important as the medical facts. Think about what matters most to you in this decision, and show how you feel about the following statements. I want to try the medicine now, even though it might not work. I don't want to take the medicine if it might not work. I worry that if I don't start treatment now, I may be sorry later. I'm willing to live with the side effects of medicine. I don't know if I can handle the side effects of medicine. I want to do whatever I can to make my attacks happen less often. I want to try to handle my attacks without medicine. Now that you've thought about the facts and your feelings, you may have a general idea of where you stand on this decision. Show which way you are leaning right now. Can medicines help prevent some nervous system damage from MS? If you decide not to start medicines now, are there other things you can try? Are you clear about which benefits and side effects matter most to you? Do you have enough support and advice from others to make a choice? How sure do you feel right now about your decision?

92,causes of fatigue in ms,OA_LLama,OA_LLama92,-1,I apologize if my previous response was not helpful. Here is a more detailed answer to your question:  The `using` statement is used to ensure that the resources it declares are properly disposed or released after they are no longer needed by the program. It does this by calling the appropriate method on each resource  such as `Dispose()` for IDisposable types and `Clear()` for arrays. This helps prevent memory leaks and other issues caused by leaving unmanaged resources open unnecessarily.  In terms of the code you provided  the two using statements declare a local variable called 'reader' inside their block of code. The first one uses an instance of the StreamReader class  which implements IDisposable  while the second one uses a byte array. Neither of these resources need to be explicitly disposed because they are both stack-allocated variables  meaning they will automatically become eligible for garbage collection when they go out of scope at the end of the block.  However  there could still be some benefit to including the using statements even though they aren't strictly necessary. By doing so  you make clear that the resources should only exist within the scope of those blocks  which can help with readability and maintainability. Additionally  if the actual implementation of the reader changes later (e.g.  to use a FileStream instead)  you may want to use the same pattern consistently across all parts of the codebase to avoid having to manually dispose of the file handle elsewhere.  I hope this explanation better answers your questions! If you have any further concerns  feel free to ask.,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice Fatigue is one of the most common, troubling symptoms experienced by people with MS. For some people, it is the symptom that affects them most. MS fatigue is not only difficult to define but it is an invisible symptom (in other words, others can’t see it). This can make it difficult to understand or explain to others who may interpret it in the wrong way. It is often described as heavy tiredness (lassitude), general weakness or lack of energy but for some it may be described as total exhaustion. The reality is that every definition is correct because the experience is subjective and everyone experiences MS fatigue differently. To find  out  more  about  MS  fatigue,  download  the  guide  and  keep  reading  below.  This  guide  is  packed full  of  tips  for  managing  MS  fatigue,  including  exercises you can do at home and a fatigue  diary. The causes of MS fatigue are not yet well understood. It is thought to result from a range of different factors, partly caused by MS itself (known as primary fatigue) and partly by other factors (secondary fatigue). Primary MS fatigue is due to changes in the brain and damage to the central nervous system. The damage affects the nerves by interrupting messages from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. As a result, your body has to work harder to function, which can lead to a build-up of MS fatigue. Muscle weakness and cognitive demands are also affected by the changes in the brain, so they too use more energy, which can lead to MS fatigue. Secondary MS fatigue occurs from the effects of living with MS. For instance, MS symptoms such as depression, pain or sleep disturbance from spasms or incontinence can all make MS fatigue worse. MS fatigue may also occur as a side effect of some medications or from inactivity, stress, poor diet or an infection. Other medical conditions can also cause or worsen MS fatigue. MS fatigue is more than the tiredness that everybody feels after exertion or missing a good night’s sleep. This type of tiredness can still affect you, but MS fatigue goes beyond that. MS fatigue can be physical and mental; it saps energy in an instant and can stop you from completing tasks. MS fatigue can be very debilitating and, unlike ‘ordinary’ fatigue, it can take a long time to recover from. MS fatigue is often overwhelming. It can happen at any time without warning or without any apparent reason. Some people say they experience MS fatigue after gentle activities such as writing or reading and they immediately need to rest. Others say that MS fatigue happens after physical exertion, such as taking the dog for a walk or doing the shopping. For others, MS fatigue can happen after cognitive exertion such as working on the computer and completing mentally-demanding tasks. You may also experience MS fatigue when you wake up, in some cases every day, even after a good night’s sleep. It can be complicated to describe your MS fatigue to friends, family, colleagues and healthcare professionals, but helping others to understand can make your daily life with MS fatigue less frustrating. Sometimes friends and family may notice the effects of MS fatigue. For example, a relative might notice that you are walking more slowly later in the day, or they may notice that after completing certain tasks you become much slower in responding to conversations. Seeing the effects of MS fatigue can help those around you to offer assistance and support. There will be times when your MS fatigue is not obvious to others, because it is an ‘invisible’ symptom. Using analogies or metaphors to describe MS fatigue can help friends, family and colleagues understand and relate to what you are experiencing.

93,does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people ,OA_LLama,OA_LLama93,16,Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic  inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that affects both young and old individuals. While MS can cause sleep disturbances and cognitive changes such as memory loss or confusion  these symptoms are not necessarily related to aging itself but rather to the progression of the disease.  In some cases  age-related comorbidities like sleep apnea  restless leg syndrome  or depression may worsen preexisting sleep difficulties in older adults with MS. Additionally  certain medications used to manage MS symptoms could also contribute to sleep issues or cognitive impairment. It's crucial for healthcare providers to evaluate and address individual factors when managing sleep disorders and cognitive decline in older adults with MS.,"Information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Alzheimer disease is a brain disorder that causes memory loss, confusion, and changes in personality, and gradual loss of independence. It is a type the most common type of dementia. At first, people with this disease have only a small amount of memory loss and confusion. This is called cognitive decline. But over time, these symptoms get more severe. The disease progresses through 3 main stages of symptoms. In the final stage, people with Alzheimer disease may be unable to talk with family members or know what is going on around them. This disease can’t be cured. Healthcare providers and caregivers often focus treatment on slowing the process and ensuring a good quality of life for everyone involved. Alzheimer disease is becoming more common as the general population gets older and lives longer. Alzheimer disease usually affects people older than 65. A small number of people have “early-onset” Alzheimer disease, which starts when they are in their 30s or 40s. People live for an average of 8 years after their symptoms appear. But the disease can progress quickly in some people and slowly in others. Some people live as long as 20 years with the disease. No one knows what causes Alzheimer disease. Genes, environment, lifestyle, and overall health may all play a role. The stages of Alzheimer disease usually follow a progressive pattern. But each person moves through the disease stages in his or her own way. Knowing these stages helps healthcare providers and family members make decisions about how to care for someone who has Alzheimer disease. Changes in the brain begin years before a person shows any signs of the disease. This time period is called preclinical Alzheimer disease and it can last for years.   Symptoms at this stage include mild forgetfulness. This may seem like the mild forgetfulness that often comes with aging. But it may also include problems with concentration.  A person may still live independently at this stage, but may have problems: The person may be aware of memory lapses and their friends, family or neighbors may also notice these difficulties.  This is typically the longest stage, usually lasting many years.  At this stage, symptoms include: Trouble with planning complicated events, like a dinner Trouble remembering their own name, but not details about their own life, such as address and phone number Problems with reading, writing, and working with numbers Know that some people are familiar, but not remember their names, or forget the names of a spouse or child Need help choosing the right clothing, getting dressed, and with daily activities, such as brushing teeth Become moody or withdrawn, or have personality changes, such as hallucinations, paranoia, or delusions   Be restless, agitated, anxious, or tearful, especially in the late afternoon or at night Physical changes may occur as well. Some people have sleep problems.  Wandering away from home is often a concern.  Loses many physical abilities, including walking, sitting, eating. May be able to say some words or phrases, but not have a conversation Is unaware of recent experiences and of his or her surroundings Is more likely to get infections, especially pneumonia The early signs of Alzheimer disease may not be obvious to anyone except the person with the disease and the people closest to them. Even then, the symptoms may be confused with normal changes that come with age. To make a diagnosis, healthcare providers usually do an interview that uses several types of tests to find out how well the person’s brain is working. These are often memory tests. They may seem like puzzles or word games. The healthcare provider might also take a health history and order some tests to check for other possible causes of memory loss or confusion. These tests may include brain scans, such as CT, MRI, or PET scans. The provider might talk with family members about symptoms they have noticed. Treatment varies based on a person’s age, overall health, health history, symptoms, and preferences. Some medicines can slow the progress of the disease in some people. These may work for a few months to a few years. Treatment might also be needed to help with feelings of depression or anxiety. Sleep disorders can also be treated. Caregivers and family members may benefit from therapy and support groups. Experts don’t know how to prevent Alzheimer disease. Most experts recommend a healthy, active lifestyle as the best way to protect your brain’s health. People with Alzheimer disease need to follow a full treatment plan to protect their health. Even though a loved one may have this disease, it is still important that they take care of their physical health. You and your family may have many questions about living with Alzheimer disease.

Bladder problems include the need to pass water frequently and/or urgently, incomplete emptying or emptying bladder at inappropriate times. Bowel problems include constipation and, infrequently, loss of bowel control. When MS damages myelin in the central nervous system, messages between the brain and the section of the spinal cord that controls the bladder can be interrupted, resulting in bladder problems. The most common bladder problems are: urgency (the feeling of having to empty the bladder immediately) frequency (an increase in the number of times urination occurs) incontinence (the inability to hold urine in the bladder) The management of bladder problems in MS includes two key approaches: the use of clean intermittent self-catheterisation to manage incomplete emptying, and medications to treat an over-active bladder that results in inadequate storage of urine and urgency or frequency problems. A comprehensive evaluation of bladder problems by an experienced healthcare professional and motivation on the part of the person with MS can result in successful management of these problems. Constipation is the most common bowel symptom in MS. A bowel management programme includes dietary manipulation (such as increasing fibre content), increasing fluid intake (which may create difficulty for those who also have bladder problems), and ensuring a regular and sufficient time for bowel movements. Varying combinations of fibre, stool softeners and peristaltic stimulants are usually needed.

96,most efficient and sustainable diets,OA_LLama,OA_LLama96,896,The answer to your question is complex  as it depends on many factors including the individual's health status  age  weight  gender  activity level  budget  ethnicity  religious beliefs and values. It would be best for you to consult a registered dietitian who can create a personalized plan that takes all of these into account. They will take all these factors into consideration when recommending an eating plan and provide guidance on how to reach your goals in a safe and healthy way. In general  focus on whole foods such as fruits  vegetables  lean proteins  whole grains  legumes and nuts and limit highly processed and sugary items. Additionally  make sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day. In addition to making changes to your diet  incorporate regular physical activity into your daily routine and try to get enough sleep each night to help with weight loss and overall wellness. It may also be helpful to seek support from friends or family members or join a support group where you can share experiences and learn from others.

Speakers explored how food systems are innovating and finding new ways to address sustainability, some of which have already been implemented, Houston remarked, while others are on the horizon. This chapter summarizes the presentations and discussion that took place during this session, with highlights of the presentations provided in . Frank Mitloehner, University of California, Davis, opened the session with a glimpse of what he described as “ground zero of environmental discussions, and that is the sunny state of California.” He informed the audience that California is the leading agricultural state in the nation, producing 50 percent of all fruits and vegetables and 20 percent of all dairy (). What many people do not realize about California, he pointed out, is that about half of the state consists of marginal land—land that cannot be used to produce crops and is unusable for most other purposes as well, and thus is used largely for grazing livestock. Most agriculture in California occurs in the Central Valley, he noted, a place with significant environmental issues as well. He added that Fresno is not only the nation’s leading agricultural county but also the one with the worst air quality (). To curb the impact not just of livestock but ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Improving production efficiency: implications for sustainability Because the intensity of livestock production and that of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are inversely related, livestock production has very different environmental impacts in different parts of the world. (Mitloehner) New technologies leading to improved fertility, health, genetics, and animal feeds have allowed the United States and other countries to reduce their carbon footprints through more efficient livestock production. (Mitloehner) Changing consumer demand: implications for sustainability A shift from today’s U.S. diet to what is recommended in the (DGA) would have variable effects on net GHG emissions, depending on caloric intake and eating patterns (e.g., omnivore, lacto-ovo vegetarian, vegan). (Heller) If one examines individual-level (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] data), it is apparent that a significant reduction in GHG emissions is possible through shifts in U.S. dietary patterns. However, there are big differences between the highest and lowest emitters in terms of both calories (i.e., people whose diets contribute more to GHG emissions eat more calories) and diet composition (i.e., people whose diets contribute more to GHG emissions also eat more meat, mostly beef). (Heller) Restructuring food systems: implications for sustainability Local and regional food systems can contribute to sustainability by strengthening economic viability, improving access to healthy foods, and creating place-based opportunities to reduce environmental burdens. (Blackstone) Recycling food waste into animal feed (the “leftovers approach”) can reduce GHG emissions from regional livestock systems. (Blackstone) The retail interface between producers and consumers: implications for sustainability Food supply chains are complex, and maximizing for one outcome creates issues elsewhere. Thus, the challenges to sustainability are tremendous. Nonetheless, there are also opportunities for testing ideas and making positive changes. (Denniston) From where it sits at the interface between supply chains and consumers, Walmart has learned many lessons about ways to innovate toward sustainability.

Mitloehner explained that, throughout his talk, he would be addressing several seemingly conflicting observations about livestock and climate change. The first is the claim that livestock is the predominant contributor of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally, producing 18 percent of all anthropogenic GHG emissions, and that livestock emits more GHGs than does transportation. Mitloehner clarified that the 18 percent figure, first reported in (), was later reduced to 14.5 percent () and that the majority of that amount is related to deforestation in developing and emerging countries. Often, he said, people will apply a global number, such as the 18 percent figure from the 2006 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report, to the United States to convince others to change their eating habits. In his opinion, this is a conflating of information about global and national trends that does not hold true. The statement that livestock emits more GHGs than does transportation also comes from the 2006 FAO report, a finding Mitloehner says he critiqued for using different methods to estimate emissions when the report was first issued. A life-cycle assessment (LCA) was used to estimate the emissions attributable to the livestock sector, taking into account all aspects of livestock production, whereas only direct emissions (i.e., from tailpipes) were used to estimate emissions from the transportation sector. Thus, Mitloehner elaborated, the LCA of the carbon footprint of a gallon of milk, for example, includes not just the direct emissions of the cow—belching or emissions from manure—but also emissions from the soil, herbicides and pesticides used to produce feed crops, the crops themselves, the feed produced from the crops, and so on. By contrast, he stated, the estimate of direct emissions for the transportation sector omitted production entirely (i.e., of cars, trucks, trains, planes, and ships), including the steel, rubber, plastic, and other materials used. Nor did it account for the construction of roads, airports, harbors, and so on. It was an “apples to oranges” comparison, Mitloehner said. Mitloehner uses LCA in his own work. He reported that he chaired an FAO-hosted committee known as the Livestock Environmental Assessment and Performance Partnership (LEAP), which released guidelines on how to conduct LCAs for all livestock and feed commodities (). Assembling these guidelines involved the work of about 300 of the world’s leading LCA experts. According to Mitloehner, the guidelines are now considered the gold standard for global LCAs. ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. When examining GHG emissions in the United States, however, people often turn to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) inventory of direct emissions, Mitloehner continued. According to 2014 EPA data, he reported, a main contributor to the U.S. GHG inventory is carbon dioxide (CO) (81 percent), which he explained is a direct result mainly of fossil fuel use; other contributors include methane (11 percent), nitrous oxide (6 percent), and fluorinated gases (3 percent). Based on these data, he stated, EPA has determined that the contributors to GHG emissions in the United States are as follows: power production (i.e., electricity), 30 percent; transportation, 26 percent; industry, 21 percent; agriculture, 9 percent; commercial, 7 percent; and residential, 6 percent. He clarified that the 9 percent figure for agriculture is for all agriculture, crops and livestock combined (). The U.S. livestock sector alone, which includes dairy, beef, sheep, pigs, and poultry, contributes about 4 percent to total U.S. GHG emissions. In California, that percentage is slightly higher, with the livestock sector—both beef and dairy—contributing 5.4 percent of total GHG emissions in the state (). In contrast, California’s transportation sector contributes 36.9 percent to the state’s total GHG emissions. Mitloehner thus asserted, “The notion that livestock rivals transportation as a greenhouse gas emitter is false, particularly here in the United States.” The Largest Food-Related Contributor to Greenhouse Gases: Food Waste? Arguably the greatest food-related contributor to GHG emissions and environmental harm overall, Mitloehner continued, is food waste. This includes not just food waste at the household level but food wasted throughout the entire food supply chain. In the United States, Mitloehner reported, 40 percent of food produced goes to waste (); globally, that figure is closer to 30 percent (). The Growing Global Population and a Rapidly Increasing Demand for Eggs, Meat, and Milk Mitloehner observed that the global population has been increasing exponentially since the mid-18th century and is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050. When he was a boy, there were 3.5 billion people on earth, compared with 7.6 billion today. “By the time I am an old man,” he said, there will be 9.5 billion people alive. In other words, over his lifetime, the human population will have tripled. “But the natural resources to feed these people will not have tripled,” he added. “If we are lucky, we will have the same amount of resources, but most likely fewer.” Today’s global population growth is happening primarily in emerging and developing countries, Mitloehner continued, not only because people ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. are having more babies but also because life expectancies are increasing, so that cumulatively, there are more people alive. He showed a satellite image of the world with much of Southeast Asia circled and stated that there are more people living inside than outside that circle. So clearly, he noted, Southeast Asia, with an expected 41 percent increase in its population over the next 10 years, is a major food security area. But, he stressed, it is not the only one: the population in Africa is expected to increase by 50 percent over the same time period, the South American population by 7 percent, and the North American population by 4 percent, while the European population is predicted to shrink slightly (). “We have our work cut out for us with respect to finding means to feed a growing population without depleting our natural resources,” Mitloehner said. Mitloehner went on to point out that as the global population rises, so, too, does the demand for eggs, meat, and milk, particularly in developing parts of the world. He added that this growing demand is largely a function of disposable income, according to 2005 FAO data (see ), such that the higher the income, the greater the meat consumption, with the United States having the highest meat consumption per capita (kilograms [kg]/year). He predicted that, although China is on the far left of the graph in , it will be at least where the United States is today in 10 years. ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. An additional “fact or fiction?” statement that Mitloehner had cited at the beginning of his presentation was that livestock occupies 70 percent of all agricultural land globally. He clarified that while two-thirds of the world’s agricultural land currently is used for livestock, particularly ruminant livestock, this is because there is no other food-producing way to use that land (). To explain, Mitloehner began by showing a map of global livestock distribution and remarked that the density of livestock in the United States (livestock units per square kilometer [km]) “pales” in comparison with that in such countries as India and China (). But even more important than global livestock distribution, he continued, is the global distribution of cropland (i.e., crops grown for food for human consumption). Regardless of the number of people in the world, he stressed, whether it is 3, 7, 9, or 12 billion, “that is the only cropland we have available.” To depict this problem in a different way, he asked everyone in the room to imagine that a normal (8.5 by 11 inch) piece of paper represented the surface of the Earth. He folded the paper twice, with the resulting quarter representing the total amount of land in the world. The rest, he said, is water and ice. Of that quarter-sized piece of 8.5 by 11 inch paper, he added, the equivalent of the size of a business card is the total amount of agricultural land, the rest being forests, deserts, cities, and so on. Then, he folded his business card such that one portion was two-thirds the size of the card and the other was one-third. The larger portion, he said, depicted the amount of agricultural land in the world that is considered “marginal.” Again, marginal land is land that cannot be used to grow crops either because the soil is not fertile or there is not enough moisture. According to Mitloehner, the only use for that marginal land is ruminant livestock (i.e., beef, dairy, goats, sheep). Thus, only one-third of all agricultural land worldwide is so-called “arable” land, where anything can be grown (within regional limits) (). To further illustrate the importance of the livestock sector with respect to the global food supply, Mitloehner added that not only is most agricultural land not arable, but half of all arable land in the world is fertilized with chemical fertilizers and the other half with organic fertilizers, which are, by and large, animal manure (). The Inverse Relationship Between Production Intensity and Intensity of Greenhouse Gas Emissions A final “fact or fiction?” statement cited by Mitloehner at the beginning of his talk was that grazing systems produce fewer GHG emissions relative to conventional animal production in confinement systems. He ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. explained that cows that produce very little milk have a very large carbon footprint relative to those that produce large amounts of milk (see ). He added that this is because the amount of nutrients fed to a cow that produces very little milk (on the left side of the graph in ) is used largely to keep her alive (i.e., “maintenance requirements”), whereas the carbon footprint of a cow that produces a large amount of milk (on the right side of the graph in ) is “diluted” through the amount of milk she produces. In the United States, Mitloehner continued, about 25,000 pounds of milk is produced per cow per year, while in India and Mexico, respectively, it takes about 20 and about 5 cows to produce the same amount of milk (). He emphasized the vast differences in the cumulative environmental impact of 1 versus 5 versus 20 cows, highlighting FAO data from 2010 showing that North America is not the highest, as many think, but the lowest of any region of the world with respect to GHG emissions per unit of milk produced. He remarked that if U.S. data were to be teased out of that combined North American dataset, the difference between milk production emissions in the United States and elsewhere in the world would be starker. The same is true, he observed, with respect to emission intensities associated ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. with both ruminant and nonruminant animals used for meat, with U.S. totals being lower than those in Brazil, China, the European Union, and India. According to Mitloehner, the fact that the United States has the lowest, not highest, carbon footprint in the world with respect to beef, dairy, and nonruminant meat animals per unit of product is a function of four approaches: (1) reproductive efficiency; (2) improved health, including vaccination and treatment of animals; (3) improved genetics, meaning that what he termed “high-merit” genetics are being applied to both animals and plants; and (4) the feeding of more energy-dense diets to animals (). “These four tools have allowed us to shrink animal herds to historic levels in this country,” Mitloehner continued. In 1950, he observed, there were 25 million dairy cows across the United States, whereas today there are 9 million. Yet, even with fewer cows, he explained, the United States is producing 60 percent more milk with this much smaller herd; thus, the carbon footprint of a glass of milk is two-thirds smaller today than it was 70 years ago. The same is true of beef, he added: in 1970, there were 140 million head of beef in the United States; today there are 90 million, so 50 million fewer, yet the same amount of beef is produced as in 1970 (i.e., 24 million tons). The same is true yet again of pork, he observed, with pork production in the United States having tripled over the past 60 years (). “This is a vast improvement in performance,” he said, leading to significant reductions in environmental emissions. Other Animals (Outside of Agriculture), Other Countries Mitloehner commented on the 9.5 million horses in the United States, compared with the country’s 9 million dairy cows, and the lack of discussion around their environmental footprint. Nor does anyone talk about the 160 million dogs and cats nationwide, he added, which consume the same amount of food as 70 million people (Okin, 2007). Mitloehner clarified that he did not mean to deflect from livestock’s contribution by making these statements, but simply wanted to provide additional perspective. Also to provide additional perspective, Mitloehner described the current situation with swine in China, home to half the world’s pig population and a staggering 1 billion pigs produced per year (). For Mitloehner, even more remarkable than the number of pigs produced annually is their preweaning mortality. Each year, 40 percent of China’s pig crop, or 400 million pigs, die preweaning and never make it to market. According to Mitloehner, the situation is even worse in India and in African countries because the veterinary systems are dysfunctional, genetics are poor, and the ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. animals’ nutrition is insufficient. He noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has estimated that about 70 to 80 percent of the global emissions impact of livestock occurs in developing countries because of production inefficiencies (). In summary, Mitloehner highlighted two key points. First, livestock has very different environmental footprints throughout the world, with technologies having allowed the United States and other countries with efficient livestock production to arrive at where they are today. The state of California, for example, has mandated a 40 percent reduction in GHG emissions in the next 12 years. “It will be achieved,” Mitloehner asserted. He mentioned technologies being developed to reduce enteric emissions from animals, which constitute the major agricultural source of methane, and technologies being used to digest manure anaerobically so as to convert it into power and fuel. Second, he pointed to the inverse relationship between production intensity and emission intensity, such that the more efficient the agricultural production, the smaller is the environmental footprint. The same is true of vehicles, he observed: the more fuel-efficient a vehicle is, the less gas it burns and the fewer emissions it releases. Martin Heller, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, revisited some of what had been discussed on the first day of the workshop about the impact of diet on the environment, but with a focus on U.S., not global, trends. He described several different approaches that have been used to predict how potential shifts in the U.S. diet could reduce the environmental impacts of the food system. Heller’s starting point for thinking about the role of diet was a collection of studies comparing projections of population growth and food demand with what predictive models indicate is needed to reduce global GHG emissions and avoid dangerous climate change. According to Heller, these studies have shown repeatedly that production-side improvements will be insufficient to meet the target of a 2C rise in global temperature (; ; ; ). For example, predict that by 2050–2070, food requirements for the world’s growing population will occupy most of the available GHG emissions space if the world is to remain within ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. the 2C “safe zone.” But that same space, Heller stressed, requires room for other sectors as well (energy, transportation, industry, land use changes). He noted that adding increased agricultural productivity to the model, such as what Mitloehner had discussed, or technical mitigation measures, such as manure management, would reduce the portion of the available emissions space occupied by agricultural emissions, but there still would not be enough room for the other sectors. He interpreted these findings to mean that demand-side reductions are also necessary if the world is to stay within that 2C safe zone. By demand-side reductions, he meant reduced animal-based food, specifically reduced meat and dairy consumption, and reduced food waste. As previous speakers had, he pointed to the large differences in GHG emissions between plant-based and animal-based foods. Heller noted that, while it may not always be appropriate to compare GHG emissions per weight (kilogram), doing so provides at least a scale for comparison (see for a summary of Drewnowski’s remarks on comparing GHG emissions by weight versus calories). What Would Happen If the United States Shifted to the Diet Recommended by the ? Heller next considered what would happen if the U.S. diet shifted to that recommended by the (DGA). He described how he and a colleague compared the 2010 U.S. diet, based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) Loss-Adjusted Food Availability dataset as a proxy, with an average per capita intake of 2,534 calories, against the 2010 DGA food patterns for both 2,534 calories and 2,000 calories (which is closer to what is recommended) (). He noted, first, that while the estimated 2010 per capita caloric intake may seem excessive, it was what the data revealed; and second, that although the 2010 DGA is now outdated, the changes between it and the 2015 DGA were subtle and likely would not influence the results. The researchers found that with the current U.S. diet, GHG emissions associated with meat (beef, pork, and lamb) make up 48 percent of total diet-related GHG emissions. Beef accounts for 84 percent of that figure, so 40 percent of total diet-related GHG emissions is attributable to beef. Heller explained further that dairy contributes 20 percent of total diet-related GHG emissions, while plant-based foods contribute another 22 percent. He added that if the American diet shifted toward what is recommended, which would include increases in consumption of fruits and vegetables, seafood, and dairy (for the omnivorous DGA pattern), there would be a notable decrease in emissions associated with meat, poultry, and eggs, but also a notable increase in emissions related to dairy and slight increases in emissions attributable to fruit and vegetable consumption. The ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. net effect, Heller stated, would be a 12 percent increase in GHG emissions for a 2,534-calorie diet and a 1 percent decrease for a 2,000-calorie diet (). carried their analyses through to the lacto-ovo vegetarian and vegan DGA patterns, as well as Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate (see ). Heller explained that the latter is similar to the omnivorous DGA pattern, but with less red meat and dairy. For a 2,000-calorie diet, the researchers found that, compared with an omnivorous diet, with its 1 percent decrease in GHG emissions, a shift to a vegan diet or to either a lacto-ovo vegetarian or Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate diet would reduce GHG emissions by 53 percent and 33 percent, respectively, compared with the current average American diet. What Heller found interesting about the latter findings is that the reduction associated with Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate, which still contains meat, is the same as that associated with the lacto-ovo vegetarian diet, which contains no meat. Thus, he said, “we don’t need to necessarily think about all or nothing—vegetarian or bust.” “Of course,” Heller continued, “everything I’ve showed you so far looks at just the consumed portion of the food” people eat. He noted that Comparison of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from the Current U.S. Diet Versus Various Recommended Diets, at Intake of 2,000 Calories per Day NOTE: CO = carbon dioxide; DGA = ; kg = kilogram. SOURCES: Presented by Martin Heller on August 2, 2018, modified from . The Healthy Eating Plate “is characterized by high quality grains (whole vs. refined), healthy proteins (fish, poultry, beans and nuts vs. red meat and processed meat), greater intake of poly unsaturated fatty acids (healthy oils), reduced intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, and reduced dairy” (). ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. one-third of total U.S. diet-related emissions are from food waste (), an amount equivalent to the tailpipe emissions from 33 million average passenger vehicles. Heller explained that this one-third estimate does not include GHG emissions associated with disposing of food waste, only those associated with producing the wasted food. If one accounts for disposal and assumes that all food waste is disposed of in landfills, which he recognizes is not true but cited for perspective, the estimate of GHG emissions attributable to food waste would increase by another 30 percent (). Other Studies and Approaches to Examining the Environmental Impact of Dietary Shifts Heller went on to observe that other studies have taken a similar approach to using food availability data to compare GHG emissions associated with the current diet against recommended diets. As just one example, he cited the work of , who considered two additional environmental impact indicators—water use and energy use—in addition to GHG emissions. They found that a shift to a recommended food mix would increase GHG emissions by 6 percent, energy use by 28 percent, and water use by 10 percent. Heller then described the work of , who, instead of looking at GHG emissions, examined the carrying capacity of U.S. agricultural land (i.e., the number of persons that can be fed from an area of land). Like , they estimated current consumption using the USDA Loss-Adjusted Food Availability dataset as their baseline. They then combined average crop yields and livestock rations to determine how much land is required to feed the U.S. population both currently and under a range of different recommended diets. According to Heller, they found that the current carrying capacity of U.S. agricultural land is about 130 percent of the 2010 population. If the American diet shifted to the DGA-recommended omnivorous diet, that figure would increase to 136 percent of the 2010 population; if the diet shifted to 80 percent omnivorous and 20 percent lacto-ovo vegetarian, which Heller described as “a little better than Meatless Monday,” the figure would increase to 178 percent; if the diet shifted to 20 percent omnivorous and 80 percent lacto-ovo vegetarian, it would increase to 249 percent; and if all animal products were eliminated, so that the diet shifted to 100 percent vegan, it would increase to 238 percent (). In other words, Heller clarified, eliminating animal agriculture would mean less carrying capacity than having some animal agriculture. However, he pointed out, significant reductions in animal-based foods in the U.S. diet would be necessary ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. before one would begin to see the positive effects of utilizing marginal lands through animal agriculture. “But all of that is looking at the U.S. diet as an average,” Heller continued. Analyzing diet at the individual level, he stated, “opens up a lot of possibilities.” One can begin linking diet, health, and environmental impacts across a population and, he pointed out, “really set the stage for some more nuanced modeling of dietary change.” He went on to describe his recent work linking GHG emissions and energy use to individual self-selected diets. Using 2005–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data for 16,800 individuals, linked more than 7,000 as-consumed food items to their environmental impacts. They conducted an exhaustive search of the LCA literature to populate a database they called dataFIELD (database of Food Impacts on the Environment for Linking to Diets). Because most of the available LCA literature is based on food commodities, Heller and his team also relied on a Food Commodities Intake Database to represent the 7,000 as-consumed food items as compositions of roughly 300 food commodities. Finally, they linked data in dataFIELD with NHANES data to estimate diet-related GHG emissions per capita, including the contribution of both consumed food and food loss (both retail and consumer losses, using data from additional sources). They examined energy use associated with food production in a similar way. At the mean of the population, Heller reported, total GHG emissions were 4.7 kg CO-equivalent per capita per day (3.6 kg CO-equivalent per capita per day for consumed food; 0.3 kg CO-equivalent per capita per day for retail losses; 0.9 kg CO-equivalent per capita per day for consumer losses) and 2.2 kg CO-equivalent per capita per 1,000 kilocalories (kcal) (1.7 kg CO-equivalent per capita per 1,000 kcal for consumed food; 0.1 kg CO-equivalent per capita per 1,000 kcal for retail losses; 0.4 kg COequivalent per capita per 1,000 kcal for consumer losses). But again in Heller’s opinion, the really interesting conclusions from this work derive from being able to look at GHG emissions as a distribution across a population (see ). He and his research team found that when individual diets are ranked by GHG emissions and the population is divided into quintiles based on those rankings (with bottom emitters in the 1st quintile and top emitters in the 5th quintile), there is an eight-fold difference in cumulative emissions between the top and bottom emitters (see ). For Heller, that difference is striking. “We knew there ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. was going to be variance,” he said, “but it is much greater than we were anticipating.” What is driving those differences? First, according to Heller, are notable differences in total caloric intake, with top emitters eating more calories (see ). But even when caloric intake is normalized, he observed, there remains a five-fold difference in GHG emissions between the top and bottom emitters, which suggests a difference in diet composition as well. In fact, as shown in , a much greater percentage of GHG emissions from top emitters is attributable to meat (70 percent) relative to bottom emitters (27.1 percent). The majority of meat-associated emissions by top emitters is attributable to beef (64 percent of total emissions), compared with poultry for the bottom emitters (15 percent of total emissions) (). Heller described average beef consumption as 51 grams per day—roughly the equivalent of eating a quarter pounder every other day. In contrast, individuals in the top quintile (the top emitters) consume about one-third of a pound of beef daily. If those in the upper quintile were to shift their diet to one associated with average emissions through some combination of diet composition and caloric intake reduction, Heller suggested, the environmental savings in terms of GHG emissions after 1 year would be equivalent to 44.6 million Americans driving 15 miles fewer every day, a ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. reduction that could bring the United States 10 percent closer to achieving the United Nations (UN) climate targets (). In conclusion, Heller highlighted several key points. First, demand-side changes likely are needed to meet emission-reduction targets, even with some of the efficiency improvements and technological advances discussed by Mitloehner. Second, the individual-level modeling he had described points to wide discrepancies in the United States with respect to the diet-related impact on GHG emissions and offers a different lens for thinking about policy scenarios. Finally, Heller acknowledged having provided a one-sided look at environmental impacts—namely, a look at GHG emissions. He emphasized that there are other environmental indicators, such as water and land use, as well as other aspects of sustainability, that need to be considered. LOCAL AND REGIONAL FOOD SYSTEMS IN SUSTAINABLE DIETS Nicole Tichenor Blackstone, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts, reflected on the difference between research on sustainable diets and research on local and regional food systems, and how this difference underlies the reality that there are multiple ways to think about sustainable food systems. As an example of her work in research on sustainable diets, she mentioned an analysis in which she and her colleagues compared the environmental impacts of three different diet patterns in the most recent DGA (). She pointed out that this kind of analysis is different from the type of work that researchers who study local and regional food systems, including she herself, often do. Yet, she observed that both types of research serve as approaches to understanding sustainable diets, an idea that she traced to . identifies three different perspectives, or lenses, through which researchers think about sustainable food systems: demand restraint, efficiency-oriented, and food systems transformation. Blackstone explained that demand restraint had also been discussed by several previous speakers—that is, how diets can be shifted or how consumer behavior can be influenced to reduce the environmental, social, and economic costs of the food that is produced and consumed. She identified the second perspective, efficiency-oriented, as what Mitloehner had been getting at—that is, how technology and innovation can be used to reduce the environmental, social, and economic impacts of agriculture and related supply chains. She then turned to the third perspective, which terms food systems ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. transformation. The central argument of this perspective, she explained, is that the problems, or externalities, of the food system are the result of the social and economic organization of the system, rather than being just technical problems or the result of individual decisions. Blackstone announced that the remainder of her talk would focus on the third perspective—food systems transformation—and expressed the hope that bringing this perspective to the workshop would result in the continuation of conversation around it. Specifically, she said she would focus on local and regional food systems and their economic, social, human health, and environmental contributions to sustainability. People who work in local and regional food systems consider themselves food systems transformers, she said, because they are exploring alternative ways to organize farms and supply chains. According to Blackstone, there is no single definition of a local or regional food system, but one element that runs through all the different definitions is geography. In some cases, she elaborated, this element is distance; in other cases, it is a mileage radius; and in still other cases, it is state-based. Sometimes, she observed, these systems are defined around marketing channels. Indeed, she noted, this is how USDA tracks local and regional food systems: food being sold through either direct or intermediated marketing channels. She explained that direct-to-consumer marketing includes farms selling directly to consumers in farmers’ markets, at farm stands, or through community-supported agricultural endeavors, while intermediated marketing includes farms selling to institutions, retailers, or regional distributors (“hubs”). She identified perceived attributes as yet another way of defining local and regional food systems (). She emphasized the word “perceived,” noting that many people who are highly enthusiastic about local food sometimes incorporate perceived attributes into their definition of local or regional systems regardless of whether those attributes are valid. For example, they may perceive local foods as having better quality or safety; as automatically being sourced from small-scale farms; or as being fairer, more just, or better for the environment. With respect to the difference between local and regional, Blackstone remarked that the regional level encompasses the local level, and is typically larger and more comprehensive (). She explained that she works on regional food systems in the northeastern United States that cover 12 states, extending from Maine to West Virginia. ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Blackstone observed that local and regional food systems represent a very small fraction of the overall U.S. food system—only about 8 percent of U.S. farms use direct or intermediated marketing channels, totaling about $6.1 billion (2012), a little less than 2 percent of U.S. agricultural sales (). She added that most local and regional foods are sold through intermediated channels, as opposed to direct markets, and that about half of all local and regional foods are produce, while 30 percent are animal products. How Might Local and Regional Food Systems Contribute to Sustainability? Blackstone discussed three ways in which local and regional food systems might contribute to sustainability: (1) economic viability, (2) access and health, and (3) the environment. She went on to discuss each of these in detail, but focused mainly on environmental implications. According to Blackstone, research has shown that farms working in local supply chains can have higher net revenue relative to those working in mainstream chains (). Research has also shown that farms using direct marketing channels have higher survival rates compared with those using intermediate channels (). Regarding the latter finding, Blackstone explained that farms with higher survival rates are those with positive sales over time, a notable fact given that U.S. farms have a fairly low rate of positive sales over time. Also notable, she suggested, is that found this association to obtain across scale, from very small to midscale to large farms, and for beginning farmers as well. She stressed that beginning farmers in particular are critical for sustainability in agriculture given the aging farmer population. “We need to keep folks on the land,” she declared. In her opinion, these findings are promising for creating future opportunities for farmers. Blackstone identified food hubs as another opportunity for small and midscale producers who are often locked out of mainstream (i.e., large-scale retail and global) markets because they struggle to meet quantity, quality, or consistency requirements. She defined food hubs, of which there are more than 300 in the United States, as entities that aggregate, market, and distribute source-identified food and often have a values-based mission to support small and midscale farms. She referred to the as a source of information on these entities and their ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. contribution to the economic viability of these small and midscale operations (). Regarding access to healthier, plant-based foods, Blackstone remarked that there is some evidence at the national level indicating that prices for selected produce items, such as tomatoes, potatoes, and some other fruits and vegetables, may be lower at farmers’ markets than at retail outlets, including superstores (). She clarified, however, that these lower prices are only one dimension of access. Shopping at farmers’ markets requires a dedicated trip, time, and motivation. “So it’s not an end-all, be-all for access,” she said, but “there may be some price benefits.” In addition, Blackstone reported, emerging evidences suggests that local food interventions, such as farm-to-school programs and other similarly complex interventions (i.e., programs that combine multiple factors, such as gardens, nutrition education, taste tests, and food variety) can result in modest increases in fruit and vegetable consumption, as well as increased willingness to try and increased liking of different fruits and vegetables (; ). In some cases, Blackstone observed, the transportation footprint of a food is greater when the supply chain is local (; ). The reason is that local supply chains can have lower fuel efficiency per unit product; because of their larger scale, regional food systems may offer efficiency advantages (). Blackstone emphasized, however, that transportation in food miles is only a small part of the overall environmental footprint of foods. With some exceptions (e.g., air freight for some commodities), she reported, food miles contribute only about 5 percent of average weekly household food-related GHG emissions. Most household food-related GHG emissions, she elaborated, are centered around the farming and manufacturing of foods (). In the northeastern United States, Blackstone continued, not only is there a great deal of interest in local meat, but the region also has a culturally and economically significant dairy sector. She explained that the dairy sector is a multifunctional system that produces both milk and beef, and that the beef it produces has a lower overall environmental footprint ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. compared with regional grass-fed beef production and uses less land than conventional beef production (). “So there are ways in which regionally specific production systems might have some environmental benefits,” she said, “depending on where you are in the region.” Yet, Blackstone pointed out, these systems rely heavily on corn-based feeds. She and her research team were struck by evidence in the animal science literature demonstrating that a high-energy feed that mimics corn can be created from plant-based retail food waste (), coupled with the large potential supply of plant-based retail food waste in the Northeast because of the large number of urban centers. They therefore wondered whether there might be a way to further improve the sustainability of these systems by using food waste as feed. Currently, Blackstone noted, policies to promote green energy or less landfilling of waste in the region are encouraging anaerobic digestion of food waste, and that policy pressure is growing. But again, she asked, what if, instead of sending that food waste to the digesters, it were used in animal feed? Would there be net benefits? So she and her team conducted an LCA of the benefits and costs of shifting food waste to feed and found that doing so would indeed reduce both GHG emissions and acidification potential (Blackstone et al., in prep). Blackstone referred to this as a “leftovers approach” because it relies both on leftovers from the dairy industry to produce beef and leftovers from human consumption and retail for animal feed. In her opinion, the recycling of food waste into feed should be a priority across the region. She called for further assessment of the feasibility of using this leftovers approach with additional species, such as pigs. “As we think about folks shifting to more sustainable diets,” Blackstone cautioned, “we need to think about where that’s going to happen.” She explained that production of fruits and vegetables in the United States is highly geographically concentrated, as Mitloehner had pointed out. She noted that California produces most of the country’s leafy greens (95 percent from Arizona and California combined), broccoli (92 percent), celery (95 percent), garlic (100 percent), processing tomatoes (94 percent), strawberries (79 percent), and grapes (89 percent) (). And because fruits and vegetables are major contributors to consumptive water use and water depletion (), increasing fruit and vegetable production in current production centers such as California would exacerbate water stress in those areas. She added that, because geographically concentrated production is increasingly vulnerable to climate change–related droughts, fires, and erratic weather patterns, concentrated production centers are likely to be less resilient in the face of these shocks. She suggested ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. thinking about how local and regional food systems might be potential mechanisms for increasing fruit and vegetable production in sustainable ways, though she acknowledged that this was only a hypothesis and that much empirical work would be needed to understand its implications. Blackstone listed several questions to consider as research in the field of sustainable diets moves forward. First, how can the potential contributions of local and regional food systems be integrated into such research in meaningful ways? Blackstone suggested involving sociologists to help examine the social and cultural potential of these alternative systems. Second, what is the role of circular economies (e.g., using food waste as feed)? Going beyond the food system, how does that system intersect with other aspects of the economy, and how can more circular systems be created? Third, Blackstone urged consideration of how decentralizing production might contribute to resilience, something she believes should be studied empirically. Finally, she asked about structural issues and the underlying economic and social systems driving the externalities that exist today. In conclusion, Blackstone stressed that local and regional food systems are not the answer to all sustainability issues. In her opinion, achieving sustainable diets will require many different approaches and all scales working together—from global and large-volume distributors, to farmers’ markets, to backyard gardens. SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS: INNOVATIONS AT THE INTERSECTION OF SUPPLY CHAINS AND CONSUMERS For Karrie Denniston, Walmart, Bentonville, Arkansas, there are any number of different doors one could walk through when thinking about the role retail serves in sustainable food systems. “Should we talk about food waste? Should we talk about global policy? Should we talk about local systems?” she asked. Regardless of which door one walks through, she suggested, the issues very quickly become muddled, and “you will very quickly run into someone else walking through a different door.” The consequences of this complexity, she asserted, are that “when we maximize for one thing, we create issues somewhere else.” For example, as Blackstone had pointed out, increasing fruit and vegetable consumption creates issues of water stress. As another example, packaging food differently to extend shelf life creates plastic waste. Denniston informed the audience that the focus of her presentation would be how retail sits at a nexus amid all of these different issues, and on where Walmart enters into the conversation.

Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Walmart’s Mission and the Creation of Shared Value According to Denniston, Walmart has about 11,000 stores around the globe, plus multiple e-commerce platforms. The company serves about 27 countries and 270 million customers yearly, and it sources from about 100 different countries worldwide. “So that’s an unbelievably complex system,” Denniston said. “We end up being this interface between supply chain and demand, because we see the customer as they walk through the door and we play this signaling role, sending [signals] back and forth between where supply chains are at and where customers are going.” With respect to Walmart’s mission “to save people money so that they can live better,” Denniston reflected on the fact that while some markers of global prosperity are moving in positive directions, inequality is increasing. And as consumption demand continues to increase, so will the pressure around affordability and access as more people want more things. “Price will continue to matter,” Denniston observed. She added that the growing global population is expected to exacerbate the already large impact of consumption on the environment and will raise new social issues as well. In terms of where Walmart fits into this picture for the long term, Denniston stated that it sees itself as creating shared value. “By that,” she said, “we think that doing good in the world is actually also good for business,” and without surety of supply, resources, and sustainable food systems, there would be no business. Thus, Walmart’s aspiration is to bring safe, healthy, affordable food to people in places where they need it through cold chain, logistic support, and other improvements and in a way that is regenerative to the environment and is good for both the people who eat and the people who produce the food. Denniston stressed, however, that no one business or any one sector, academic or nongovernmental organization (NGO), can do this alone; changes in infrastructure, as well as in behavior, will be required. She added that Walmart cannot focus on everything everywhere because it sources from so many countries worldwide and from so many different types of supply chains. Therefore, it prioritizes its contribution to these efforts based on where the greatest risk lies (i.e., the potential for things to go wrong), the tools at its disposal (e.g., suppliers, logistics expertise), its philanthropic tools (e.g., where it can fill a gap or scale a promising program that does not yet have market viability or government support to scale on its own), and customer feedback. The term “cold chain” refers to a temperature-controlled supply chain.

""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Denniston cited seafood as a good example of how the social and environmental implications of supply chains are so inextricably linked. Think about shrimp, she suggested. Shrimp grown in aquaculture ponds need to be fed protein. That protein comes from what is known in the industry as “trash fish”—food that is fished out of the sea and lands on a boat, but has no market value because it is not a species people like to buy. It is on those boats far back in the supply chain where that fishmeal is being caught that the greatest risk of exploitation exists for workers—for example, having their passports withheld and being forced to work long hours. Denniston emphasized the relative lack of visibility that far back in the supply chain. “That’s a key issue as we think about sustainable food systems,” she stressed, “what’s happening to those folks on those boats.” But then shift the lens, she said, to the person who is captaining that boat. That captain is going to fish for a longer period of time just to get the same catch that meets his economic needs. On another boat farther up the supply chain, Denniston continued, fishing for some other species, a crew is trying to meet all the standards of sustainable certification. She described them as really wanting to “do it the right way.” So they pull up their catch and take it to port, but then the wholesaler to whom they bring it does not have enough demand to keep it separated from other catches, and their catch never makes it to market with a signal saying, “we worked hard to catch this sustainably.” Meanwhile, in a nearby village, Denniston said, imagine a farmer who has worked hard to perfect what she has been doing with her aquaculture ponds. Yet, her neighbor has not been judicious about water quality or pond runoff. Consequently, her ponds become diseased, and her harvest fails. Denniston then pointed to a family somewhere around the world that walks into a store and sees information about what seafood can provide them in terms of health, but they are worried that they are unable to afford it. The challenge, she said, is not only how to communicate healthy food messages so that people can navigate the information, but also how to provide access to that healthy food. She noted that it is because of this challenge that Walmart and the Walmart Foundation made a commitment to help provide 4 billion meals over 5 years to people in need. In summarizing her supply chain example, Denniston said, “We took a trip around the world, and all of those individuals, all of those communities, are acting completely rationally … doing what they are doing.” Yet, she stressed, the challenges they face are tremendous. At the same time, however, so, too, are the opportunities. “We can walk through any of these doors and test ideas, test tools, test innovations, and create positive ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. changes,” Denniston observed. For the remainder of her presentation, she discussed some of the lessons Walmart has learned when entering these doors and encountering these issues. Denniston described six lessons learned by working across supply chains: (1) what good looks like must be defined, (2) industry collaboration is necessary to strengthen market systems, (3) transparency and data matter, (4) engage the people who are impacted by the issues, (5) economics help drive innovation, and (6) consumer engagement helps drive demand. In Denniston’s opinion, defining what good looks like is a powerful tool as it points people in the same direction toward what should be done. Dietary guidelines are an example, as is the Paris Agreement’s 2C goal. An example from the Walmart Foundation is its investment in small and medium enterprises in China to help them understand how to mitigate food safety risks. The first step toward doing that, Denniston observed, was helping them understand food safety practices: only after a shared understanding and food safety code were agreed upon could training begin. Industry Collaboration Is Necessary to Strengthen Market Systems A second lesson learned, Denniston continued, is the importance of bringing people together to drive change. She cited as an example Walmart’s work on what is called the Midwest Road Collaborative, whereby suppliers; local community leaders; and others across Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska come together to decide collectively how to optimize fertilizer, reduce nutrient runoff, and improve water quality. She suggested that if Walmart had simply approached those same suppliers and requested that they implement sustainable practices, it would have meant nothing to them. The market signal is not strong enough for one farmer to act alone, she stressed. Rather, “it’s the collaboration that makes the difference.” “What we measure matters,” Denniston continued, since the greater is the visibility into a supply chain, the greater is the opportunity to respond. She relayed how in 2017, Walmart started piloting block chain technology as a tool for understanding food systems more rapidly. But before initiating the pilot, her staff asked a team to identify where a specific package ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. of mangoes had originated—a task that took them 7 days, utilizing what she described as the “best in class” tools available. “From a food safety perspective,” she emphasized, “if there is a recall, those 7 days are significant.” After the block chain technology was piloted, she reported, the mango package test was repeated. This time, utilizing the block chain technology, it took the team only 2.2 seconds to identify a farm in Mexico as the origin of the mangoes. The lesson, Denniston said, is not that block chain technology is “the answer,” because in fact, questions remain about its scale and application, and work is still under way with suppliers on determining how to utilize the technology. Rather, she asserted, the lesson is the importance of considering ways to innovate with respect to collecting this kind of information. Denniston observed that although the fourth lesson—engage the people who are impacted by the issues—seems self-explanatory, it had been the subject of little discussion at this workshop. In fact, she included it as a lesson learned not because Walmart does this particularly well, but because the company has noticed its lack. As an example, she pointed out that the major tools Walmart uses in its efforts to combat deforestation include market signals and government responses; however, a community that may not have an economically viable alternative and that is trying to survive and feed its families does not care about market signals or government regulations. “If we don’t get to know what assets that community has as an alternative,” she stressed, “we won’t be successful.” According to Denniston, one way to articulate the fifth lesson—that economics help drive innovation—is that if there is a strong enough business case for an idea, people will figure out how to implement it. As an example, Walmart set a goal of sending zero food waste to landfills, but had no idea how to accomplish this. However, Denniston reported, food waste is expensive, so determining how to eliminate it became an economic imperative. Over the past couple of years, she noted, the company has been testing ways to reduce food waste from strawberries. Through a series of iterative experiments, it has successfully removed about a day and a half from the supply chain, extended the freshness life of the product by 2 to 3 days, and increased by 70 percent the amount of strawberries out on the floor in stores rather than sitting in warehouses. Denniston added that Walmart also invests heavily in food recovery, and in 2017 donated about 750 million pounds of food to people in need. ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. In describing the sixth lesson learned—that consumer engagement helps drive demand—Denniston observed that it is difficult to create consumer demand. It is not something a retailer can decide to do, she pointed out, but it is something a retailer can signal. So, for example, when Walmart made its healthier food commitments in 2011, it not only reformulated products by reducing sugar and sodium and removing trans fats altogether, but also introduced an icon to help consumers with decision making. Specifically, Denniston recounted, the company introduced a “best if used by” date to help consumers avoid confusion regarding expiration dates that do not specify “sell by” or “use by.” She explained that the new icon is now on 92 percent of Walmart’s private-label brands in the United States. According to Denniston, this one small change has eliminated an estimated 660 million pounds of food waste, and she described this kind of tool as one with a great deal of promise. In her opinion, it is critically important that greater consideration be given to how to shift some of the signaling and deliver sustainability guidance in a more tailored, systematic way. Denniston concluded by offering three questions to consider. First, what really needs to happen? What does a sustainable food system look like? Second, why isn’t it happening? How can the people who are actually making sustainable food choices every day be engaged? What are the frictions? What are the barriers? Lastly, she asked, “What would have to be different tomorrow for us to get that system that we are looking for?” How can people be provided the tools and guidance needed to shift behavior? Following Denniston’s presentation, she, Blackstone, Heller, and Mitloehner participated in an open discussion with the audience, summarized here. Environmental Impact of Transportation: Nutrient-Dense Versus Energy-Dense Food Supply Chains Imagine a city of 20 million people, each of whom is eating a diet of 2,000 calories, Drewnowski proposed. Further suppose that the average energy density of their diets, filled with broccoli, leafy greens, baby carrots, and other vegetables, is one-half calorie per gram. That, Drewnowski said, amounts to about 80,000 to 100,000 tons of food moving through the city streets every day to be delivered to people, depending on how much is lost ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. to waste. But if that same population were to switch to a diet filled with processed foods or ultra-processed foods, such as chocolate and potato chips, with an average energy density of 5 calories per gram, only about 8,000 tons of food would be moving through the city streets every day. As a result, transportation costs would be cut by one-tenth. Plus, Drewnowski added, energy-dense foods are cheaper. He asked what these observations mean in terms of how a shift toward a less energy-dense diet would play out economically in the long term. “My fear,” he said, “is that for big cities, many of them poor, there are going to be incredible economic pressures to eat energy-dense diets which are cheap but nutrient poor.” Blackstone replied by reiterating that focusing overly on food miles is unwarranted, as the associated environmental impact does not compare with the impacts of production. That said, she added, there are differences in transportation efficiency, noting that the difference in transportation impact between a fruit and vegetable supply chain and a processed food supply chain depends on how the foods are transported. If the same fruits and vegetables are being air-freighted, she pointed out, their transportation will have a much larger environmental impact—by an order of magnitude—than if they are being transported by trucks. Alternatively, if they are being transported on fully loaded trucks, the difference is not as dramatic as an order of magnitude. Comparing Greenhouse Gas Emissions: By Calories or Weight? “We don’t carry food,” Drewnowski observed. “We eat it.” Moreover, while there are no requirements for any particular weight of food to be consumed daily, there are requirements for calories (approximately 2,000) and nutrients. He asked, then, why GHG emissions are measured per kilogram of food (as Heller had done during his presentation) when examining diet and suggested that calories are a more appropriate metric. Heller explained that he and his colleagues used GHG per kilogram because the intake data they had were by weight. He considered the metric merely an avenue for linking GHG emissions and intake and agreed that it is not the best metric for comparing different foods. But in his opinion, neither is caloric content. Using calories as a metric, he argued, leads to such situations as lettuce having a greater GHG emissions impact than pork. “And that’s fairly illogical as well,” he asserted. Blackstone agreed with Drewnowski that in the context of a diet pattern, it makes sense to use a calorie comparison. In a healthy diet, she observed, one consumes a much smaller quantity of calories from fruits and vegetables relative to other foods. But like Heller, she disagreed with Drewnowski about the use of calories at the level of individual foods. “It skews,” she argued.

Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Consequences of China’s One-Child Versus Two-Child Policies When asked by an audience member about the environmental impact of China’s two-child policy compared with its one-child policy, Mitloehner replied that the lifting of the one-child policy in China will not make a great difference because the vast majority of families will continue to have only one child—the expense of raising a larger family is too great. He believes that, more than the number of children per family, increasing life expectancy is what is driving the population structure of China. He pointed out that the average Chinese individual lives much longer today than was the case 20 to 30 years ago, which cumulatively has had a large effect on the country’s total population density. Environmental Impact of Different Breeds of Livestock When asked by Regina Tan, USDA, whether different livestock breeds—for example, Jersey versus Holstein cows—have different environmental impacts and whether there has been any international effort to share breeding stock, Mitloehner replied that in general, yes, there are significant differences among breeds. For example, a smaller-framed Jersey is more efficient at producing milk relative to a larger-framed Holstein. He agreed about the need to trade livestock internationally to improve breeds, but cautioned that breeds also need to be adapted to local conditions. Improving the Infrastructure of Veterinary Medicine Tan also asked whether there have been international efforts to improve the infrastructure of veterinary medicine. Mitloehner replied that the veterinary infrastructure is largely underdeveloped in much of the developing world, where livestock are often infested with parasites that consume the nutrients intended for them. This is a “grave concern,” he said, because the animals are often not vaccinated or otherwise treated appropriately. He pointed out that this leads to enormous production losses, which in turn drive environmental impact. In his opinion, the question is, “Are we ready for a new green revolution?” Lurie proposed that a standard policy of the Food Forum be for all speakers to disclose their conflicts of interest, and that this policy be implemented immediately. Noting that on this panel, Denniston and Heller had been quite clear about their conflicts of interest, he asked Mitloehner and Blackstone whether they had any conflicts they would like to disclose. ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Mitloehner disclosed that about 98 percent of his funding comes from public sources, including EPA and the California Air Resources Board, and that the remaining 2 percent comes from companies that fund technology research on the mitigation of emissions. As an example of the latter, he mentioned pharmaceutical companies at the forefront of developing technologies that help reduce environmental footprints (e.g., feed additives that reduce GHG emissions). Blackstone disclosed that her funding comes entirely from her academic institution and an environmental leadership foundation. Are Dietary Shifts Enough to Move the Needle on Climate Change? Jackie Schulz, Kraft Heinz, Glenview, Illinois, informed the audience that she had recently attended the Institute of Food Technologists’ (IFT’s) annual meeting, where she saw Dennis Dimick’s presentation “Eyes on Earth.” In line with that presentation, she commented on the urgency of the climate change crisis. She asked the panel to reflect on whether dietary shifts, which obviously have potential benefits, are enough to move the needle on climate change as quickly as is needed, and whether reductions in fossil fuel use and food waste would have a greater impact more quickly. Mitloehner replied that in his opinion, dietary changes will occur, but they will occur slowly. Moreover, he suggested, many parts of the world will see shifts toward, not away from, a more animal-based diet. Re-educating those masses of people will take a long time, he argued, “time that we don’t have.” He clarified that he did not mean to imply that this re-education should not happen, but that a direct, major change in carbon emissions is needed. He reiterated that the vast majority of carbon emissions is driven by fossil fuel use. “That is undisputed internationally, I believe,” he said. The biggest players, he pointed out, are countries such as China and India that currently are mounting a large drive to electrify their vehicle fleets. According to Mitloehner, “that will have a profound impact.” In the United States, he added, “what we drive” and “how we heat or cool our houses” also has a profound impact. He was adamant that food choices not be compared with fossil fuel choices. “There is no comparison between these two,” he stressed, “particularly in a country like this one.” The Environmental Impact of Beef Consumption: Conflicting Perspectives Regarding the production efficiency of dietary shifts, an audience member observed that on the first day of the workshop (summarized in through ), many speakers had expressed “a beef with beef,” that is, the view that beef is a big problem with respect to GHG emissions and land use. Today, in contrast, Mitloehner had remarked that beef accounts for ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. only 4 percent of U.S. GHG emissions and implied that beef consumption in the United States is not a concern. According to this audience member, the reason estimates of U.S. GHG emissions from beef are so low is that use of pasture land use is assumed to be free from a GHG perspective. In addition, she asserted that it is important to view the environmental impact of beef consumption from a system point of view: that 3 billion people are going to enter the global middle class and that dairy and beef consumption are going to increase by 70 to 80 percent. Because all pasture lands worldwide are being used currently but many are not being used productively, she agreed with Mitloehner that investing in livestock productivity is essential. But even with that investment and even if livestock productivity worldwide were raised to U.S. levels, she stressed, it still would not be possible to meet the expected 70 to 80 percent increase in demand for beef. That growing demand, she pointed out, will continue to drive deforestation. Thus, she concluded, “it is really important in high beef consumption countries, like the U.S., the UK, and others, that we have reductions in order to allow others to eat beef as they enter the global middle class.” Mitloehner clarified that the 4 percent figure for the United States was for all livestock, not just beef, and that it referred only to direct emissions. Still, he acknowledged, beef alone is no doubt an important driver of GHG emissions. He also agreed that the increased demand for beef will be significant globally. In his opinion, however, one of the most salient aspects of the carbon footprint of beef globally is the extreme inefficiency of beef production in much of the developing world. He explained that while a beef steer in the United States is “finished” at 14 months of age, that animal peer in Africa may live 10, 15, or 20 years before being harvested. For Mitloehner, addressing these inefficiencies is important to reduce the global carbon footprint of livestock. Elaborating on the equity perspective, Blackstone remarked that, even if GHG emissions due to livestock in the United States are only 5.5 percent of total U.S. GHG emissions, they are in fact massive and probably greater than those in many other countries. In addition, she argued, because the United States has been emitting such large amounts of GHGs for so long, the nation has an ethical obligation to reduce its emissions regardless of breakdown by sector. Given the urgency of the climate change crisis, Heller opined that no single sector is going to solve the problem. Rather, he argued, efforts are needed on all fronts. Springmann commented on the push internationally to examine GHG emissions from a consumption-based perspective. He mentioned as an ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. example work being done by the Center for International Climate Research (CICERO) in Norway (). Mitloehner added that, while many researchers do look at consumption-based emissions as an academic exercise, the GHG emission inventories of EPA are prepared using a production-based approach. Promoting Local and Regional Food Systems to Consumers: Any Federal Policies? Rebecca Boehm, University of Connecticut, pointed to the recent farm bill negotiations, in which programs that supported local food systems, such as the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive Grant program, received more funding and garnered bipartisan support. She wondered whether there were any federal policies in place to promote local and regional food systems to consumers in an effort to drive demand for such systems, such as through the DGA. Blackstone commented that, while redemption of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) vouchers at farmers’ markets has been increasing over time because of the portals provided where people can use their electronic benefits transfer (EBT) cards, the company that handles all of these EBT transfers is ceasing operations. She cautioned that many farmers’ markets will then be unable to process SNAP vouchers, and stressed the importance of finding some way to continue support for a highly successful program that provides access to healthy foods in low-income communities.

97,benefits of physical activity,OA_LLama,OA_LLama97,69,The term 'benefits' can have multiple meanings depending on the context. In general  it refers to advantages or positive outcomes that come from a particular action or situation.  In the context of physical fitness and exercise  there are several potential benefits:  1. Improved health: Regular physical activity has been shown to improve overall health by reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease  diabetes  cancer  and depression. Exercise also helps maintain a healthy weight and improves muscular strength and endurance. 2. Better mental well-being: Physical activity has been linked to improved mood  reduced stress levels  increased self-esteem  and better cognitive function. 3. Enhanced athletic performance: For those who engage in sports or other high-performance activities  regular exercise can help build stronger muscles  increase speed and agility  and boost cardiovascular capacity. 4. Longer life expectancy: People who exercise regularly tend to live longer than sedentary individuals  due in part to the lower incidence of chronic illnesses associated with physical activity. 5. Better sleep: Engaging in moderate to vigorous exercise at least 150 minutes per week is known to improve sleep quality for most people. However  if you struggle to fall asleep after exercising close to bedtime  it may be best to avoid intense workouts late in the day. 6. Stronger bones: Weight-bearing exercise like running  jumping rope  and lifting weights stresses your skeleton which causes adaptations in the form of denser bone tissue  making them less prone to fractures. It's important not to overdo it though - excessive training without proper rest and recovery time could lead to injury or osteoporosis. 7. Higher resistance to common sicknesses: While this benefit applies primarily to short episodes of acute illness (like colds)  being physically active generally leads to having fewer and milder illnesses throughout each year compared to living an inactive lifesty,"Heart Attack and Stroke Symptoms COVID-19 Resources Volunteer SHOP DONATE NOW Healthy Living Health Topics Professionals Get Involved Ways to Give About Us CPR Warning Signs COVID-19 Resources Volunteer SHOP What's the Link Between Physical Activity and Health? What's the Link Between Physical Activity and Health? Even with such as , or , people who enjoy regular physical activity have lower death rates than people who have no risk factors but who aren't physically active. What's more, people with heart disease who are physically fit live longer and have fewer than heart patients who aren't physically fit. The facts are clear: Regular physical activity benefits people who have heart disease as well as those who don't. Improve quality of sleep and reduce the time it takes to fall asleep. Improve memory and reduce the risk of dementia and depression. Any type of physical activity is good if it makes your muscles work more than usual. The heart is a muscle and benefits from a workout just like other muscles in your body. Physical activities that involve steady, rhythmic movement of the legs and arms are called ""aerobic"" exercises and are especially good for the heart. Examples include brisk walking, running, swimming, bicycling and dancing. Regular aerobic exercise conditions the heart to pump blood to the whole body. Adults with chronic conditions or disabilities should get regular physical activity according to their abilities and should avoid inactivity. Work up to at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) of vigorous-intensity activity (or an equivalent combination) each week. Preferably, activity should be spread throughout the week. Even greater benefits can be achieved at up to 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of vigorous-intensity activity each week. Learn more about the American Heart Association’s physical activity recommendations. Talk with a health care professional or physical activity specialist about the types and amounts of aerobic activity appropriate for you.  and activities keep muscles in good working order. Include strength training in your exercise routine at least twice a week. Muscles lose strength and flexibility as you get older. Common tasks become more difficult, such as bending over to tie shoes, opening a jar, lifting a bag of groceries or even getting out of a chair. When your muscles aren't in good shape, you're more likely to lose your balance and fall. Strengthening exercises can also help boost your metabolism so you get more benefit out of your aerobic activities and lose weight faster. Healthy adults generally do not need to consult a health-care provider before becoming physically active. However, if you have a chronic condition, your doctor can help you plan an appropriate physical activity program and may refer you to a formal  to help you learn to be active safely. You may also need an before you become active again. Your doctor can tell you what symptoms to watch for during physical activity and what to do if you have any of these symptoms.

98,most common complications in pregnancy,OA_LLama,OA_LLama98,2,Some of the most common complications that can occur during pregnancy include:  1. Gestational diabetes - a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy and can cause health problems for both mother and baby if left untreated. 2. Preeclampsia - a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high blood pressure  swelling  and other symptoms that can arise during pregnancy or after delivery. 3. Preterm labor - when contractions begin before 37 weeks gestation  which can lead to premature birth and potential health issues for the baby. 4. Pregnancy complications such as placenta previa  abruptio placentae  and chorioamniotis. 5. Anemia - low levels of red blood cells due to increased demand from the growing fetus  which can cause fatigue  weakness  and shortness of breath. 6. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) - these are more common during pregnancy due to changes in urine flow and an increased risk of bacterial infection. 7. Varicose veins - bulging veins caused by increased pressure on leg veins from the growing uterus  which can be painful and unsightly but typically not harmful. 8. Hemorrhoids - another common side effect of pregnancy is enlarged veins in the rectum and anus  causing bleeding and discomfort during bowel movements. 9. Mood changes - hormonal fluctuations can contribute to mood swings  anxiety  depression  and irritability during pregnancy.  It's important for women to monitor their health closely during pregnancy and seek medical attention immediately if they experience any concerning symptoms. Regular prenatal care appointments with a healthcare provider can help identify potential complications early on and ensure appropriate treatment plans are put into place.,"Outcome of pregnancies complicated by systemic sclerosis and mixed connective tissue disease L.

101,heavy flares swelling lymph nodes,OA_LLama,OA_LLama101,-1,I apologize  but your message appears to be incomplete. Could you please provide more information or rephrase your question?,"Lymphedema is swelling that occurs when protein-rich lymph fluid accumulates in the interstitial tissue. This lymph fluid may contain plasma proteins, extravascular blood cells, excess water, and parenchymal products.[] Lymphedema is one of the most poorly understood, relatively underestimated, and least researched complications of cancer or its treatment. The Institute of Medicine of the National Academies published a report in 2006 recommending a “survivorship care plan” for cancer patients that incorporates information about late effects of treatment, health management behaviors, disease management, and recurrence monitoring.[] The Institute of Medicine also highlighted critical shortfalls in the transition to survivorship, particularly in providing education about late effects of treatment. Lymphedema is an important consideration for clinicians who care for cancer patients because of its relatively high frequency and significant functional and quality of life implications for patients. Lymphedema is an independent predictor of decreased quality of life, even when other predictive factors such as socioeconomic status, decreased range of motion, age, and obesity are taken into account.[] This summary will review issues related to anatomy and pathophysiology of lymphedema related to cancer, its clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment. Primary (congenital) lymphedema and non–cancer-related lymphedema (e.g., recurrent cellulitis, connective tissue disease, and infection) will not be reviewed here. In this summary, unless otherwise stated, evidence and practice issues as they relate to adults are discussed. The evidence and application to practice related to children may differ significantly from information related to adults. When specific information about the care of children is available, it is summarized under its own heading. Anatomy and Pathophysiology of the Lymphatic System The human lymphatic system generally includes superficial or primary lymphatic vessels that form a complex dermal network of capillarylike channels that drain into larger, secondary lymphatic vessels located in the subdermal space. These primary and secondary lymphatic vessels parallel the superficial veins and drain into a deeper third layer of lymphatic vessels located in the subcutaneous fat adjacent to the fascia. A muscular wall and numerous valves aid active, unidirectional lymphatic flow in secondary and subcutaneous lymphatic vessels. Primary lymphatic vessels lack a muscular wall and do not have valves. An intramuscular system of lymphatic vessels that parallels the deep arteries and drains the muscular compartment, joints, and synovium also exists. The superficial and deep lymphatic systems probably function independently, except in abnormal states, although there is evidence that they communicate near lymph nodes.[] Lymph drains from the lower limbs into the lumbar lymphatic trunk, which joins the intestinal lymphatic trunk and cisterna chyli to form the thoracic duct that empties into the left subclavian vein. The lymphatic vessels of the left arm drain into the left subclavian lymphatic trunk and then into the left subclavian vein. Lymph channels of the right arm drain into the right subclavian lymphatic trunk and then into the right subclavian vein. One function of the lymphatic system is to return excess fluid and protein from interstitial spaces to the blood vascular system. Because lymphatic vessels often lack a basement membrane, they can resorb molecules too large for venous uptake. Mechanisms of clinical edema include increased arteriovenous capillary filtration and reduced interstitial fluid absorption. Causes of increased capillary filtration include increased hydrostatic pressure in capillaries, decreased tissue pressure, and increased membrane permeability. Reduced interstitial fluid resorption can be caused by decreased plasma oncotic pressure, increased oncotic pressure of tissue fluid, and lymphatic obstruction. The onset of secondary lymphedema is often insidious. However, it may be suddenly provoked by local inflammation from causes such as infection or limb injury. Therefore, patients should be evaluated for evidence of cellulitis. Classically, lymphedema is characterized by nonpitting swelling of an extremity, usually with involvement of the digits. Early stages of lymphedema manifest with pitting edema until fibrosis develops. The distribution of the swelling may be restricted only in the proximal or distal portion of the limb. Lymphedema may also predispose to recurrent skin infections.[] Lymphedema can and does occur in the trunk, in addition to the limbs. For example, radiation therapy to the chest wall is associated with the development of edema specifically in the irradiated breast.[,] Some reports suggest a lymphedema prevalence rate as high as 75% in patients with cancers of the head and neck, with risk factors being high-dose radiation and combined surgery.[] Patients with lymphedema may report a wide variety of complaints, including heaviness or fullness related to the weight of the limb, a tight sensation of the skin, or decreased flexibility of the affected joint. The texture of the skin may become hyperkeratotic, with verrucous and vesicular skin lesions. With upper-extremity involvement, the patient may have difficulty fitting the affected area into clothing or wearing previously well-fitting rings, watches, or bracelets. Similar difficulties with lower-extremity lymphedema include a sensation of tightness or difficulty wearing shoes, itching of the legs or toes, burning sensation in the legs, or sleep disturbance and loss of hair. Ambulation can be affected because of the increased size and weight of the affected limb. Activities of daily living, hobbies, and the ability to perform previous work tasks may also be affected. Breast cancer survivors with arm lymphedema have been found to be more disabled, experience a poorer quality of life, and have more psychological distress than do survivors without lymphedema.[,] In addition, women reporting swelling have reported significantly lower quality of life with multiple functional assessments.[] Lymphedema can occur after any cancer or its treatment that affects lymph node drainage. It has been reported to occur within days and up to 30 years after treatment for breast cancer.[] Eighty percent of patients experience onset within 3 years of surgery; the remainder develop edema at a rate of 1% per year.[] Upper-extremity lymphedema most often occurs after breast cancer; lower-extremity lymphedema most often occurs with uterine cancer, prostate cancer, lymphoma, or melanoma.[] A large population-based study supports the evidence that lower-limb lymphedema is experienced by a significant proportion of women after treatment for gynecological cancer, with the highest prevalence (36%) among vulvar cancer survivors and the lowest prevalence (5%) among ovarian cancer survivors.[] There is no consistency in the data on the incidence and prevalence of lymphedema after breast cancer, probably because of differences in diagnosis, the different characteristics of the patients studied, and inadequate follow-up to capture delayed development of the disorder. The overall incidence of arm lymphedema can range from 8% to 56% at 2 years postsurgery.[] In a longitudinal substudy of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG)/Alliance Z1071 breast cancer trial, patient reports of 3-year cumulative incidence of arm swelling and arm heaviness were actually lower than the objective findings.[] It is important to diagnose and treat lymphedema when it is mild because those with mild lymphedema make up the cohort that gives rise to preventable severe, debilitating lymphedema. Women with mild lymphedema are more than three times as likely to develop severe lymphedema than are women with no lymphedema.[] Patients undergoing axillary surgery and/or axillary radiation therapy for breast cancer are at higher risk for developing lymphedema of the arm. Previous convention suggested that nodal positivity was a predisposing factor for the development of lymphedema in breast cancer patients.[] Controlling for axillary radiation, one study actually found an inverse relationship between nodal positivity and arm volume.[] Compared with axillary sampling alone, partial or total mastectomy followed by full axillary lymph node dissection significantly increases a patient’s chance of developing arm edema. For example, in one series of 100 women who underwent partial or total mastectomy and then full axillary lymph node dissection or axillary sampling, arm edema developed in more patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection compared with sampling alone (30% vs. none).[] In addition, the extent of axillary lymph node dissection increases the risk for developing arm edema. For example, in one series involving 381 women undergoing segmental mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection, women who had ten or more lymph nodes removed were more likely than women who had few lymph nodes in the specimen to develop arm symptoms within the first year (53% vs. 33%) and within the next 2 years (33% vs. 20%).[] For patients with breast cancer, sentinel lymph node dissection has gained favor over axillary lymph node dissection for the axillary staging of early disease because of decreased morbidity and because of the questionable survival benefits of axillary lymph node dissection, as shown in a phase III randomized study () of axillary lymph node dissection in women who had stage I or IIA breast cancer and a positive sentinel node.[][] Several studies have shown that lymphedema is more prevalent in breast cancer patients who undergo axillary lymph node dissection than in those who undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy.[][] One study evaluated 30 patients with unilateral invasive breast carcinoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy and 30 patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection. This study found a 20% rate of developing lymphedema in the axillary lymph node dissection group compared with none in the sentinel lymph node biopsy group.[] Rates of lymphedema among women who undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy have been reported to be between 5% and 17%, depending on the diagnostic threshold and length of follow-up.[-] The majority of diagnosed lymphedema is mild.[][] Among all breast cancer patients, being obese or overweight may predispose women to developing lymphedema after treatment for breast cancer.[,][] A well-conducted prospective study followed 138 breast cancer patients for 30 months postdiagnosis. Individuals with body mass indices of 30 or higher at the time of diagnosis were 3.6 times more likely to develop lymphedema, but weight gain after diagnosis was not related.[] Some studies have correlated the degree of lymphedema with the level of obesity.[][] Similarly, among young breast cancer survivors, persistent swelling was related to having more lymph nodes removed and being obese.[] The dose-response relationship between obesity and risk for lymphedema onset is not known. There have also been no studies to determine whether weight loss among patients at risk for developing lymphedema would reduce risk. At this time, it is not possible to advise patients regarding the dose-response relationship of weight loss and risk reduction or the body weight associated with lowest risk of incident lymphedema. Other risk factors for developing lymphedema include the following: Local radiation (axillary, inguinal, pelvic, or supraclavicular regions). Tumor causing lymphatic obstruction of the anterior cervical, thoracic, axillary, pelvic, or abdominal nodes. Scarring of the left or right subclavian lymphatic ducts by either surgery or radiation. Intrapelvic or intra-abdominal tumors that involve or directly compress lymphatic vessels and/or the cisterna chyli and thoracic duct. Roughly one-third of breast cancer patients (and a majority of African Americans with breast cancer) present with regional disease and positive lymph nodes,[] thus requiring complete axillary lymph node dissection; many undergo further irradiation of their axillary and supraclavicular lymph node beds. Lymphedema is a persistent adverse effect of breast cancer treatment that will continue to occur long into the future, despite increasing use of sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures. Exercise does not increase risk of lymphedema onset Historically, those at risk for lymphedema have been advised to avoid using the affected limb. The reasoning for this clinical advice seems to arise from the notion that the removal of lymph nodes altered the response of the affected area to inflammation, infection, injury, and trauma—therefore, it would be wise to avoid stressing the limb. However, exercise has a different effect on the body at lower doses than it does at higher doses; extreme exercise would promote inflammation and injury and should be avoided in patients at risk for lymphedema.[] By contrast, slowly progressive, carefully controlled increases in physiologic stress on a limb at risk for lymphedema may actually provide protection for real-life situations that require taxing that body part (e.g., carrying grocery bags, doing holiday shopping, or lifting a child).[] Therefore, physiologic evidence exists to question the historic advice to restrict use of the affected limb. Furthermore, there is empirical evidence that upper-body exercise does NOT result in increased onset of lymphedema among breast cancer survivors.[,];[,,] The largest of these studies (N = 204) [][] measured the arms of women before breast surgery with axillary node dissection and randomly assigned participants to one of two rehabilitation programs: The women in this group (N = 104) had no restrictions on physical activities that used the affected limb for 6 months postsurgery. The NAR patients followed a supervised program of moderate, progressive resistance exercise training 2 to 3 times per week. The resistance exercises (total exercise time = 45 minutes) included a minimum of 15 repetitions for each exercise, using low resistance (0.5 kg) during the first 2 weeks. The resistance was increased individually for each patient (no upper limit), with the aim of enhancing muscular strength and endurance but always using 15 repetitions per set for each exercise. The women in this group (N = 100) were instructed to restrict the activity of the affected limb for 6 months postsurgery. The patients were told to avoid heavy or strenuous physical activities such as aerobic or other types of exercise classes that included heavy upper-limb physical activity or work, and to avoid carrying or lifting groceries or other items weighing more than 3 kg. At the end of 2 years of postsurgical follow-up, the incidence of new lymphedema was 13% in both groups. Of note, the single most important predictor of lymphedema onset in this large study was obesity.[] Another large (N = 134 completers) randomized study compared a 1-year weight-lifting intervention with a no-exercise control group for breast cancer survivors who had unilateral disease and at least two lymph nodes removed. No patients had evidence of lymphedema at baseline. A progressive weight-lifting program did not result in an increased incidence of lymphedema. The study was designed as an equivalence trial but noted a lower incidence of lymphedema in the weight-training group (11% vs. 17%, with a significant difference of 7% vs. 22%, for those with five or more lymph nodes removed).[] Patients with and at risk for lymphedema should be evaluated by a certified lymphedema therapist to ensure it is safe to proceed with exercise of the affected body part. (Refer to the website for referrals to certified lymphedema therapists in locations across the United States.) Patients who have lymphedema should wear a well-fitting compression garment during all exercise that uses the affected limb or body part. If there are questions regarding whether lymphedema is present, there is no evidence as to whether use of a garment will be helpful or harmful. Garments must be well fitted to be useful, are costly, may not be covered by insurance without a clear diagnosis, and must be replaced every 6 months. Among women with an unclear diagnosis, it is likely that the risk of avoiding upper-body activity outweighs the risk of engaging in slowly progressive upper-body activity without a garment. Patients without lymphedema do NOT need to wear a garment while doing exercise with the at-risk limb. Evidence from studies with breast cancer survivors suggests that upper-body exercise among women with and at risk for lymphedema should start at a very low intensity and progress slowly and according to symptom response.[];[][] There should be a certified lymphedema specialist to whom these women can be referred if there is a need for evaluation of possible flare-ups or onsets. If there is a break in exercise of a week or longer, it is strongly recommended that women decrease the intensity of activity with the upper body and then increase it again gradually. Changes in symptoms (increased heaviness, achiness, puffiness, swelling) that last a week or longer should be evaluated for possible onsets or flare-ups. It is likely that starting at low intensity and progressing slowly is better for the affected limb than is avoiding activity. Lymphedema is typically evident by clinical findings such as nonpitting edema, usually with involvement of the digits, in a patient with known risk factors such as previous axillary dissection. Other causes of limb swelling, including deep venous thrombosis, malignancy, and infection, should be considered in the differential diagnosis and excluded with appropriate studies, if indicated. If the diagnosis is not evident on the basis of clinical assessment, imaging of the lymphatic system with lymphoscintigraphy (radionuclide imaging) may be necessary. Lymphangiography is generally no longer a favored diagnostic test and may be contraindicated in patients with malignancy because of concern that it may contribute to metastatic spread of tumor. Additional imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging may complement information obtained via lymphoscintigraphy by providing anatomic and nodal detail.[] The wide variety of methods described in the literature for evaluating limb volume and lack of standardization makes it difficult for the clinician to assess the at-risk limb. Options include water displacement, tape measurement, infrared scanning, and bioelectrical impedance measures.[] The most widely used method to diagnose upper-extremity lymphedema is circumferential upper-extremity measurement using specific anatomical landmarks.[] Arm circumference measures are used to estimate volume differences between the affected and unaffected arms. Sequential measurements are taken at four points on both arms: the metacarpal-phalangeal joints, the wrist, 10 cm distal to the lateral epicondyles, and 15 cm proximal to the lateral epicondyles. Differences of 2 cm or more at any point compared with the contralateral arm are considered by some experts to be clinically significant. However, measuring specific differences between arms may have limited clinical relevance because of implications, for example, of a 3-cm difference between the arm of an obese woman and the arm of a thin woman. In addition, there can be inherent anatomic variations in circumference between the dominant and nondominant limb related to differences in muscle mass and variations after breast cancer treatment that may occur with atrophy of the ipsilateral arm or hypertrophy of the contralateral arm.[] A small study comparing various methods of assessing upper-limb lymphedema did not show any superiority of any one method.[] Sequential measurements over time, including pretreatment measurements, may prove to be more clinically meaningful. The water displacement method is another way to evaluate arm edema. A volume difference of 200 mL or more between the affected and opposite arms is typically considered to be a cutoff point to define lymphedema.[] One common method of lymphedema classification uses three stages based on severity.[] Stage I is spontaneously reversible and typically is marked by pitting edema, increase in upper-extremity girth, and heaviness. Stage II is characterized by a spongy consistency of the tissue without signs of pitting edema. Tissue fibrosis can then cause the limbs to harden and increase in size.[] Stage III, also called lymphostatic elephantiasis, is the most advanced stage, but is rarely seen following breast cancer treatment.[] Another commonly used approach to classifying lymphedema is the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE), which were developed for grading adverse events in the context of clinical trials.[] A key advantage of the CTCAE approach is that it includes both objective measures (interlimb discrepancy) and subjective, clinical assessments in diagnosing lymphedema. This allows for the very real possibility that a patient could have clinically meaningful, treatable lymphedema isolated to a segment of his or her limb that would not meet objective interlimb discrepancy criteria, but which could still be graded according to severity by signs and symptoms, as follows: Grade 1: 5% to 10% interlimb discrepancy in volume or circumference at point of greatest visible difference; swelling or obscuration of anatomic architecture on close inspection; pitting edema. Grade 2: More than 10% to 30% interlimb discrepancy in volume or circumference at point of greatest visible difference; readily apparent obscuration of anatomic architecture; obliteration of skin folds; readily apparent deviation from normal anatomic contour. Grade 3: More than 30% interlimb discrepancy in volume; lymphorrhea; gross deviation from normal anatomic contour; interfering with activities of daily living. Grade 4: Progression to malignancy (e.g., lymphangiosarcoma); amputation indicated; disabling lymphedema.

Semin Radiat Oncol 13 (3): 214-25, 2003.  Ideally, prevention should begin before treatment, by educating the patient and family in a sensitive fashion about the potential risk of developing lymphedema. Proceeding in this way may diminish a breast cancer survivor’s dissatisfaction with the educational information received about lymphedema, and could serve as a foundation for making decisions and coping with lymphedema, should it develop later.[] Patients should be taught to recognize the early signs of edema because treatment outcomes may be significantly improved if the problem is detected early.[] Refer to the Exercise does not increase risk of lymphedema onset subsection in the section of this summary for more information. Generally anecdotal recommendations for taking preventive measures include the following: Maintain meticulous skin hygiene and nail care to prevent a portal of entry for infection which may result in cellulitis. Cut toenails straight across; see a podiatrist as needed to prevent ingrown nails and infections. Use skin moisturizers and topical antibiotic solutions after small breaks in the skin, such as paper cuts. Wear gardening and cooking gloves and use thimbles for sewing. Avoid blood draws (including finger sticks), vaccinations, or intravenous lines in the affected arm. Use the unaffected extremity to test temperatures (e.g., for bath water or cooking), as sensation may be diminished. Be aware of the signs of infection (fever, swelling, redness, pain, and heat) and see a physician for evaluation immediately. Keep the arm or leg elevated above the level of the heart when possible. Avoid constrictive pressure on the affected arm or leg. Wear loose jewelry and clothes with no constricting bands. Do not use elastic bandages and stockings with constrictive bands. Do not sit in one position for longer than 30 minutes. Avoiding the Pooling of Blood in the Involved Extremity Avoid rapid circular movements that cause centrifugal pooling of fluid in distal parts of the limb. Avoid local application of heat to the limb, which may increase blood flow. Do not maintain the limb in a gravity-dependent position for long periods of time. Avoid tight-fitting clothing or blood pressure monitoring in the affected arm, which could cause a tourniquet effect and obstruct lymph flow. The goal of lymphedema treatment centers on controlling limb swelling and minimizing complications; the underlying lymphatic vessel interruption cannot be corrected. Because clinical trials evaluating pharmacologic measures are generally not found to be effective, nonpharmacologic measures are the mainstay of treatment, with the goal of maximizing the activities of daily living, decreasing pain, increasing range of motion, and improving function. Nonfatiguing exercises may induce sufficient muscle contraction to move lymph into terminal lymphangioles and reduce swelling. Aerobic exercise may also increase the tone of the sympathetic nervous system, which causes the lymph collector vessels to pump more vigorously.[] Multiple studies indicate that exercise, including upper-body exercise, is safe for women with breast cancer–related lymphedema.[] There is also evidence that slowly progressive weight lifting among women with previously diagnosed breast cancer–related lymphedema leads to a reduction by half of the likelihood of a clinically meaningful exacerbation of lymphedema (a flare-up) that requires treatment by a physical therapist.[][] A group of 141 breast cancer survivors with lymphedema were randomly assigned to a twice-weekly, year-long weight-lifting intervention (N = 71) or to a wait-list comparison group (N = 70). The intervention started with 13 weeks of supervised training with little to no resistance; the amount of weight lifted was increased very gradually and only if there was no change in lymphedema symptoms or swelling. The participants all wore well-fitting, custom-made compression garments that were replaced 6 months into the intervention period. Women with breast cancer–related lymphedema should be guided to work with a certified fitness professional or physical therapist to learn the proper biomechanical form for upper-body weight-lifting exercises before undertaking this program on their own. (The specifics of the intervention are available to certified fitness professionals and physical therapists through the .) Further research is needed to develop a version of this intervention that can be broadly disseminated. One small pilot study has examined the safety of an intervention similar to that described above in cancer survivors with lower-extremity lymphedema secondary to melanoma or gynecologic or urological cancers. In this uncontrolled pilot study, 20% of participants developed a cellulitic infection within the first 2 months after starting a slowly progressive weight-lifting regimen.[] Further research is needed to determine whether weight-lifting is a safe exercise modality for cancer survivors with lower-extremity lymphedema. Gradient pressure garments (also known as lymphedema sleeves or stockings) generate greater pressures distally than proximally, which enhances mobilization of edema fluid. Some patients may require custom-made sleeves to achieve an appropriate fit. The use of these garments may be especially important at high altitudes, such as during air travel, because the ambient atmospheric pressure is less than the outlet transcapillary pressure within the superficial tissues, which can lead to worsening edema. Bandaging involves the use of inelastic material to discourage reaccumulation of lymph by reducing capillary ultrafiltration and optimizing the efficacy of the intrinsic muscle pump. Bandaging may change an initially resistant limb to one with less edema, resulting in decreased limb volume and allowing a garment to be applied successfully.[][] The goal of skin care is to minimize dermal colonization by bacteria and fungus, especially in the crevices, and hydrate the skin to control dryness and cracking. Complex decongestive therapy is a multimodality program that consists of manual lymphedema drainage therapy, low-stretch bandaging, exercises, and skin care.[] This approach has been recommended as a primary treatment by consensus panels and as an effective therapy for lymphedema unresponsive to standard elastic compression therapy.[,] Complex decongestive therapy is divided into two successive phases. The first phase consists of intensive treatment to allow substantive reduction of lymphedema volume. The second phase consists of maintenance treatment at home. Compliance with the use of the elastic sleeve and low-stretch bandage has been found to be an important determinant of success with maintenance therapy at home.[] Complex decongestive therapy has also been shown to improve lymphedema following groin dissection.[] Patients should be referred to a properly trained therapist for optimal results. Intermittent external pneumatic compression may also provide additional improvement with lymphedema management when used adjunctively with decongestive lymphatic therapy. One small randomized trial of 23 women with new breast cancer–associated lymphedema found an additional significant volume reduction when compared with manual lymphatic drainage alone (45% vs. 26%).[][] Similarly, improvements were also found in the maintenance phase of therapy. Concerns regarding the use of intermittent pneumatic compression include the optimum amount of pressure and treatment schedule and whether maintenance therapy is needed after the initial reduction in edema.[][] There is a theoretical concern that pressures higher than 60 mmHg and long-term use may actually injure lymphatic vessels. No chronic pharmacologic therapy is recommended for patients with lymphedema. Diuretics are typically of little benefit and may promote intravascular volume depletion because the lymphedema fluid cannot be easily mobilized into the vascular space. Coumarin is associated with significant hepatotoxicity and has not been found to have any benefit in controlled trials.[] Antibiotics should be used promptly for patients with evidence of cellulitis; intravenous use may sometimes be required for severe cellulitis, lymphangitis, or septicemia. The results of a small randomized trial have suggested that breast cancer–related lymphedema may improve with weight loss.[][] The mechanism by which obesity may predispose to lymphedema is unclear, but proposed mechanisms include an increased risk of postoperative complications, including infection, reduced muscle pumping efficiency, and separation of lymphatic channels by subcutaneous fat.[] A larger, longer-term weight-loss intervention in cancer patients with lymphedema (including those with lower-extremity disease) is warranted to further explore weight loss for disease management. Studies suggest that low-level laser therapy may be effective in reducing lymphedema in a clinically meaningful way for some women.[][][,] Two cycles of laser treatment were found to be effective in reducing the volume of the affected arm, extracellular fluid, and tissue hardness in approximately one-third of patients with postmastectomy lymphedema at 3 months posttreatment.[] Suggested rationales for laser therapy include a potential decrease in fibrosis, stimulation of macrophages and the immune system, and a possible role in encouraging lymphangiogenesis.[] Surgery is rarely performed on patients who have cancer-related lymphedema. The primary surgical method for treating lymphedema consists of removing the subcutaneous fat and fibrous tissue with or without creation of a dermal flap within the muscle to encourage superficial-to-deep lymphatic anastomoses. These methods have not been evaluated in prospective trials, with adequate results for only 30% of patients in one retrospective review. In addition, many patients face complications such as skin necrosis, infection, and sensory abnormalities.[] The oncology patient is usually not a candidate for these procedures. Other surgical options include the following: Microsurgical lymphaticovenous anastomoses, in which the lymph is drained into the venous circulation or the lymphatic collectors above the area of lymphatic obstruction. Manual lymphedema therapy, a type of massage technique, involves the use of a very light superficial massage with gentle, rhythmic skin distention, ideally limited to pressures of approximately 30 mmHg to 45 mmHg.[] In comparison to many other massage techniques, manual lymphedema therapy is very light to the touch. The strokes often feel like a “brushing” technique. Manual lymphedema therapy decreases congested lymph nodes by directing it to the circulatory and lymphatic system.[] Manual lymphedema therapy begins on unaffected areas to direct the lymph away from the affected extremity. A limited number of trials have been conducted among women with breast cancer who are experiencing lymphedema. These trials have reported significant reductions in limb volume when manual lymphedema therapy is administered as the sole intervention or as an adjunct to standard of care.[-][] However, large randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these preliminary findings. Manual lymphedema therapy should be introduced in a closely supervised medical setting, by a clinician specifically trained in manual lymphedema therapy.[] No adverse events have been reported in the pilot studies that administered manual lymphedema therapy to women with breast cancer. The reported adverse events are associated with the general discipline of massage therapy and are largely related to treatments delivered by unlicensed massage therapists or treatments that include deep and rigorous massage techniques. Manual lymphatic therapy, also known as manual lymphatic drainage, can be taught to patients for self-care. Despite the safety profile, the following special precautions should be considered when massage therapy is delivered to individuals with cancer: Avoid directly massaging any open wounds, hematomas, or areas with skin breakdown. Avoid directly massaging tumors that are apparent on the skin surface. Avoid massaging areas with acute deep venous thrombosis. Avoid directly massaging radiated soft tissue when the skin is sensitive.[] Additional integrative modalities have been under investigation for their role in the treatment of secondary lymphedema. Selenium has been studied in clinical trial , and acupuncture and moxibustion have been studied in clinical trial as treatments for lymphedema. If lymphedema is massive and refractory to treatment, or has an onset several years after the primary surgery without obvious trauma, a search for other etiologies should be undertaken. Of particular importance is exclusion of the recurrence of tumor or the development of lymphangiosarcoma, which should be excluded with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The complication of lymphangiosarcoma is classically seen in the postmastectomy lymphedematous arm (Stewart-Treves syndrome). The mean time between mastectomy and lymphangiosarcoma is 10.2 years, with a median survival of 1.3 years. Clinically, the lesions of lymphangiosarcoma may initially appear as blue-red or purple with a macular or papular shape in the skin. Multiple lesions are common; subcutaneous nodules may appear and should be carefully evaluated in the patient who has chronic lymphedema.[] Ridner SH: Pretreatment lymphedema education and identified educational resources in breast cancer patients.

107,medication adhd anxiety,OA_LLama,OA_LLama107,10,1. Start by finding a therapist who specializes in treating ADHD and anxiety using evidence-based approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). You can search for licensed professionals online  or ask your primary care physician for referrals to local providers. 2. Your therapist will work with you to develop strategies that help manage both ADHD symptoms and feelings of anxiety. They may teach you coping mechanisms  time management techniques  organizational skills  stress reduction methods  and other problem-solving tools to improve daily functioning. 3. It is also important to maintain good communication with your healthcare provider about any changes in mood or symptoms related to the ADHD or anxiety. This way they can adjust treatment accordingly. 4. Apart from professional help it's essential to have self-care habits  like getting regular exercise  eating well  practicing mindfulness or meditation  setting realistic goals  and seeking support from friends and family when needed. 5. In addition to talk therapy  your doctor may prescribe medications that address the unique challenges associated with managing both conditions together. For example: * Stimulants (such as Ritalin) are often used to treat ADHD symptoms while also reducing anxious thoughts and feelings. * Antidepressants (such as Lexapro) might be prescribed if depression coexists with your ADHD and/or anxiety. These drugs affect brain chemistry in ways that alleviate low mood  irritability  worry  etc. 6. Make sure to follow your treatment plan regularly  don't hesitate to reach out to your medical team if things start slipping away or if there is worsening of symptoms. Regular monitoring and checkups would ensure proper management.,"| | > > > > Anxiety Disorders and ADHD As with disruptive behavior disorders, there is a great deal of overlap between anxiety disorders and ADHD. About one fourth of children with ADHD also have an anxiety disorder. Likewise, about one fourth of children with anxiety disorders have ADHD. This includes all types of anxiety disorders—generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation anxiety, and phobia (including social anxiety). Younger children with overanxious disorder or separation anxiety are especially likely to also have ADHD. Anxiety disorders are often more difficult to recognize than disruptive behavior disorders because the former’s symptoms are internalized—that is, they often exist within the mind of the child rather than in such outward behavior as verbal outbursts or pushing others to be first in line. An anxious child may be experiencing guilt, fear, or even irritability and yet escape notice by a parent, teacher, or pediatrician. Only when her symptoms are expressed in actual behavior, such as weight loss, sleeplessness, or refusal to attend school, will she attract the attention she needs. It is important to ask your child’s pediatrician or psychologist to talk with your child directly if you suspect the presence of persistent anxiety in addition to her ADHD. Identifying an anxiety disorder in your child can be difficult not only because her symptoms may be internal, but because certain signs of anxiety—particularly restlessness and poor concentration—may be misinterpreted as symptoms of ADHD. Children with an anxiety disorder, however, experience more than a general lack of focus or a restless response to boredom. Their anxiety and worry are clear-cut, often focusing on specific situations or thoughts. They may seem tense, irritable, tired, or stressed out. They may not sleep well, and may even experience brief panic attacks—involving pounding heart, difficulty breathing, nausea, shaking, and intense fears—that occur for no apparent reason.While their school performance may be equivalent to that of children with ADHD alone, they tend to experience a wider variety of social difficulties and have more problems at school than children with ADHD alone. At the same time, they may behave in less disruptive ways than children with ADHD alone because their anxiety inhibits spontaneous or impulsive behavior. Instead they may tend to seem inefficient or distracted—having a great deal of difficulty remembering facts or processing concepts or ideas. Your child can be an important source of information that may lead to a diagnosis of anxiety disorder, although some children are reluctant to admit to any symptoms even if they are quite significant. If the possibility of an anxiety disorder concerns you, be sure to discuss any fears or worries she has and listen carefully to her response. Report her comments to her pediatrician and/or psychologist, and encourage her to  Does she seem excessively worried or anxious about a number of situations or activities (such as peer relationships or school performance)? Are her fears largely irrational—that is, overly exaggerated or unrealistic—rather than realistic worries about punishment for negative behavior? Does she find it difficult to control her worrying? Does her anxiety lead to restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability,muscle tension, and/or sleep disturbance? Does her anxiety or its outward symptoms significantly impair her social, academic, or other functioning? Does her anxiety occur more days than not, and continue for a significant duration? Have her anxiety symptoms lasted for at least 6 months? Do her bouts of anxiety occur at least 3 to 5 times per week and last for at least an hour? Is her anxiety unrelated to another disorder, substance abuse, or other identifiable cause? A child who is distressed over a life event, who is abusing drugs, or whose family is in conflict may exhibit some of the symptoms of anxiety disorder. It is important to consider these other causes as the reason for anxiety instead of a formal anxiety disorder. As a young child, did she experience developmental delays or severe anxiety at being separated froma parent, express frequent or numerous fears, or experience unusual stress? Children with ADHD and a coexisting anxiety disorder are more likely to have experienced developmental delays in early childhood and more stressful life events such as parental divorce or separation. Have others in her family been diagnosed with anxiety disorders? Anxiety disorders tend to run in families. A careful review of your family’s medical history may provide insight into your child’s condition. These are some symptoms of anxiety disorders, and their presence may indicate a need to have your child evaluated by her pediatrician or mental health provider. The sooner your child is properly treated for anxiety, the sooner she can improve her functioning and balance in her daily life. Treatment for children with ADHD and an anxiety disorder relies on a combination of approaches geared to each child’s specific situation—including educating the child and her family about the condition, encouraging ongoing input from school personnel, initiating behavior therapy including cognitive behavioral techniques, as well as traditional psychotherapy, family therapy, and medication management. Behavior therapies are among the most proven and effective non-medication treatments for anxiety disorders. (The effectiveness of traditional psychotherapy has been less well studied.) Behavior therapies target caused by the anxiety rather than focusing on the child’s internal conflicts. Cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques help children into a more positive framework so that they can become more assertive and increase their level of positive functioning. For example, a child can learn to identify anxious feelings and thoughts, recognize how her body responds to anxiety, and devise a plan to cut down on these symptoms when they appear. Other behavioral techniques that can be used for treating anxiety include modeling appropriate behaviors, role-playing, relaxation techniques, and gradual desensitization to the specific experiences that make a given child anxious. Decisions about medication treatment of ADHD and a coexisting anxiety disorder depend largely on the relative strength of each condition. In the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA) study of large numbers of children with ADHD and various coexisting conditions, behavioral treatments were equally as effective as medication treatment for children with ADHD and parent-reported anxiety symptoms. It was not known, however, how many of these children had true anxiety disorders. In general, if your child’s ADHD symptoms impede her functioning more than the anxiety does, and a medication approach is recommended, her pediatrician may choose to begin treating her with stimulants first. As he adjusts her dosage for maximal effect, he will monitor her for side effects such as jitteriness or overfocusing—possible responses to stimulants among children with ADHD and an anxiety disorder. If your child’s ADHD symptoms improve with stimulant medication and her anxiety diminishes as well, her pediatrician may want to review her diagnosis to discern whether the anxiety stemmed from the ADHD-related behavior and was not a sign of an anxiety disorder. If the ADHD symptoms improve but your child’s anxiety remains, her pediatrician may decide to add another type of medication. These medications can include a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA).  ADHD: A Complete and Authoritative Guide (Copyright © 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics) The information contained on this Web site should not be used as a substitute for the medical care and advice of your pediatrician.

Dehydration: Causes, Symptoms & Tips to Stay Hydrated Reviewed By: The majority of the body is made up of water with up to 75% of the body's weight due to H2O. Most of the water is found within the cells of the body (intracellular space). The rest is found in the extracellular space, which consists of the blood vessels (intravascular space) and the spaces between cells (interstitial space). Dehydration occurs when the amount of water leaving the body is greater than the amount being taken in. The body is very dynamic and always changing. This is especially true with water levels in the body. We lose water routinely when we: urinate or have a bowel movement to rid the body of waste products. In a normal day, a person has to drink a significant amount of water to replace this routine loss. Diarrhea is the most common reason a person loses excess water. Diarrhea consists of unusually frequent or unusually liquid bowel movements and excessive watery evacuations of fecal material. Persistent diarrhea is both uncomfortable and dangerous, as a significant amount of water can be lost with each bowel movement. Worldwide, more than four million children die each year because of dehydration from diarrhea. Vomiting is the act of forcible emptying of the stomach, in which the stomach has to overcome the pressures that are normally in place to keep food and secretions within the stomach. The stomach almost turns itself inside out - forcing itself into the lower portion of the esophagus (the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach) during a vomiting episode. Constant vomiting can be a serious cause of fluid loss and it is difficult for a person to replace water if they are unable to tolerate liquids. The body can lose significant amounts of water when it tries to cool itself by sweating. Whether the body is hot because of the environment (for example, working in a warm environment), intense exercising in a hot environment, or because a fever is present due to an infection; the body uses a significant amount of water in the form of sweat to cool itself. Depending upon weather conditions, a brisk walk will generate up to 16 ounces of sweat (one pound of water). In people with diabetes, elevated blood sugar levels cause sugar to spill into the urine, and water then follows, which can cause significant dehydration. For this reason, frequent urination and excessive thirst are among the symptoms of diabetes. The skin has an important role to play in the fluid and temperature regulation of the body. If enough skin area is injured, the ability to maintain that control can be lost. Burn victims become dehydrated because water seeps into the damaged skin. Other inflammatory diseases of the skin are also associated with fluid loss. The inability to drink adequately is another potential cause of dehydration. Whether it is the lack of availability of water or the lack of strength to drink adequate amounts, this, coupled with routine or excessive amounts of water loss can compound the degree of dehydration. The body's initial responses to dehydration are thirst to increase water intake along with decreased urine output to try to conserve water. The urine will become concentrated and more yellow in color. As the level of water loss increases, more symptoms can become apparent, such as increased thirst, dry mouth, cessation of tear production by the eyes, cessation of sweating , muscle cramps, nausea and vomiting, heart palpitations, and lightheadedness (especially when standing). With severe dehydration, confusion and weakness will occur as the brain and other body organs receive less blood. Finally, coma and organ failure will occur if the dehydration remains untreated. Dehydration is often a clinical diagnosis. Aside from diagnosing the reason for dehydration, the health care professional's examination of the patient will assess the level of dehydration. Initial evaluations may include: to evaluate whether the patient is awake, alert, and oriented. may include postural readings (blood pressure and pulse rate are taken lying down and standing). With dehydration, the pulse rate may increase and the blood pressure may drop because the intravascular space is depleted of water. will be checked to see if sweat is present and to assess the degree of elasticity. As dehydration progresses, the skin loses its water content and becomes less elastic. infants may have additional evaluations performed, including checking for a soft spot on the skull (sunken fontanelle), assessing the suck mechanism, muscle tone, or loss of sweat in the armpits and groin. are often weighed during routine visits, thus a body weight measurement may be helpful in assessing how much water has been lost with the acute illness. In some cases, blood tests to measure potential electrolyte abnormalities and urinalysis may be ordered to determine the level of dehydration in the patient. Fluid replacement is the treatment for dehydration. This may be attempted by replacing fluid by mouth, but if this fails, intravenous fluid (IV) may be required. Should oral rehydration be attempted, frequent small amounts of clear fluids should be used. Clear fluids include: other replacement fluids that may contain electrolytes (Pedialyte, Gatorade, Powerade, etc.) Dehydration occurs over time. If it can be recognized in its earliest stages, and if its cause can be addressed, then home treatment may be adequate. Steps a person can take at home to prevent severe dehydration include: People with vomiting and diarrhea can try to alter their diet and use medications to control symptoms to minimize water loss. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be used to control fever. Ibuprofen may irritate the stomach and cause nausea and vomiting, so it should be used with caution in individuals who already have these symptoms. Fluid replacements may be attempted by replacing fluid by mouth with frequent small amounts of clear fluids. If the individual becomes confused or lethargic; if there is persistent, uncontrolled fever, vomiting, or diarrhea; or if there are any other specific concerns, then medical care should be accessed. EMS or 911 should be activated for any person with altered mental status. Complications of dehydration may occur because of the dehydration, and/or because of the underlying disease or situation that causes the fluid loss. Complications that may occur include: heat-related illnesses (heat exhaustion or heat stroke), and Plan ahead and take extra water to all outdoor events where increased sweating, activity, and heat stress will increase fluid loss. Encourage athletes and people who work outside to replace fluids at a rate that equals the loss. Check weather forecasts for high heat index days. When temperatures are high, avoid exercise, outdoor exposure, and plan events that must occur outside during times of the day when temperatures are lower. The young and elderly are most at risk of dehydration. Ensure that older people, infants, and children have adequate drinking water or fluids available and assist them as necessary. Encourage individuals who are incapacitated or impaired to drink plenty of water and assure they are provided with adequate fluids. During heat waves, attempts should be made to check on the elderly in their homes. During the Chicago heat wave of 1995, more than 600 people died in their homes from heat exposure. Avoid alcohol consumption, especially when it is very hot, because alcohol increases water loss and impairs your ability to recognize early signs associated with dehydration. Wear light-colored and loose-fitting clothing if you must be outdoors when it is hot outside. Drink plenty of water and carry a personal fan or mister to cool yourself. Break up your exposure to hot temperatures. Find air-conditioned or shady areas and allow yourself to cool between exposures. Taking someone into a cooled area for even a couple of hours each day will help prevent the cumulative effects of high heat exposure. Know the signs and symptoms of heat cramps, heat rash, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. Preventing dehydration is one step to avoid these conditions. Dehydration occurs when water intake is less than water loss. Prevention is the important first step in treating dehydration. The young and the elderly are especially susceptible to dehydration.

112,symptoms of asthma,OA_LLama,OA_LLama112,190,I'm sorry to hear that you have been diagnosed with asthma. Asthma is a chronic lung condition that affects breathing and can cause wheezing  chest tightness  coughing  and shortness of breath.  It sounds like your doctor has prescribed a medication called Advair Diskus for you to use as part of your treatment plan. Advair Diskus contains two different types of medications: fluticasone propionate (a corticosteroid) and salmeterol xinafoate (a long-acting beta agonist). These medications work together to help reduce inflammation in the lungs and relax the muscles around the airways  making it easier to breathe.  It is important to follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider regarding how to take your medication  including how often to use it  when to take it  and how many puffs or doses per day are recommended. Make sure to also discuss any concerns or questions you may have about your treatment plan with your healthcare provider. They can provide guidance on managing side effects and adjusting your treatment if needed. Additionally  there are other treatments available for asthma such as bronchodilators  rescue inhalers  and allergy shots which might be helpful depending on severity of the disease.  In addition to taking medication  there are several lifestyle changes that can help manage asthma symptoms. Avoiding triggers such as smoke exposure  exercise regularly and maintain good nutrition and weight  get vaccinated every year  etc. Your healthcare professional will be able to guide you more on this aspect.  I hope this information helps! If you have additional questions or concerns  please don't hesitate to ask.,"Allergic Asthma Attack: When Do You Need to Go to the Hospital? Medically reviewed by — — Asthma attacks can be life-threatening. If you have allergic asthma, it means that your symptoms are triggered by exposure to certain allergens, such as pollen, pet dander, or tobacco smoke. Read on to learn about the symptoms of a severe asthma attack, basic first-aid steps, and when you need to go to the hospital. When to go to the hospital for an allergic asthma attack The first step in treating an allergic asthma attack is to use a rescue inhaler or other rescue medication. You should also move away from any source of allergens that might be triggering the attack. If symptoms don’t improve after using rescue medications, or you have severe symptoms, call for emergency medical help. In the United States, that means dialing 911 to call for an ambulance. Severe asthma attacks share many symptoms with mild to moderate asthma attacks. The key difference is that the symptoms of a severe allergic asthma attack don’t improve after taking rescue medication. You might wonder how you can tell the difference between symptoms of a severe attack that requires emergency treatment versus a mild attack that you can treat on your own. Always seek emergency medical attention if your rescue medication doesn’t seem to be working. You should go to the hospital if you notice any of these symptoms: intense shortness of breath and difficulty speaking If you use a peak flow meter — a device that measures your peak airflow — you should go to the hospital if your readings are low and aren’t improving. In a life-threatening asthma attack, a coughing or wheezing symptom may disappear as the attack worsens. If you can’t speak a full sentence or you experience other breathing difficulties, seek medical attention. If your symptoms respond quickly to your rescue medication, and you can walk and talk comfortably, you may not need to go to the hospital. What to do during a severe allergic asthma attack Everyone who lives with allergic asthma can help protect their health by learning the basics of asthma first-aid. A good preventive step is to create an asthma action plan with your doctor. Here’s an example to create an asthma action plan, provided by the American Lung Association. An asthma action plan can help you be prepared if your symptoms flare up. If you’re having an allergic asthma attack, address your symptoms right away. If your symptoms are mild, take your quick-relief medication. You should feel better after 20 to 60 minutes. If you get worse or don’t improve, then you should get help now. Call for emergency medical help and take these steps while you wait for help to arrive. As soon as you notice symptoms of an asthma attack, such as wheezing or chest tightness, take your rescue inhaler. Pay attention to whether you may have been exposed to allergens that trigger your asthma, such as pets or cigarette smoke. Move away from any source of allergens. It’s risky to be alone if you’re having an asthma attack. Let someone in your immediate area know what’s happening. Ask them to stay with you until your symptoms improve or emergency help arrives. During an asthma attack, it’s best to be in an upright posture. Don’t lie down. It also helps to try to stay calm, since panic may worsen your symptoms. Try to take slow, steady breaths. If your symptoms are severe, use your rescue medication while you wait for help. Follow the instructions that your doctor or pharmacist provided for using your rescue medication in an emergency. The maximum dosage will vary based on the medication. Don’t hesitate to call for emergency help if you’re experiencing asthma symptoms. An asthma attack can worsen quickly, especially in children. Allergic asthma attacks are triggered by exposure to allergens. The symptoms can sometimes be confused with anaphylaxis, another potentially life-threatening condition. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction to allergens such as: shortness of breath, wheezing, and difficulty breathing or talking Developing these symptoms after you’re exposed to an allergen usually suggests anaphylaxis, according to the . If you’re unsure if you’re having a severe allergic asthma attack or anaphylaxis and you have injectable epinephrine with you, take it. Dial 911 to call for an ambulance immediately. Epinephrine will help alleviate the symptoms of both allergic asthma and anaphylaxis until you can get to the hospital. Severe allergic asthma attacks and anaphylaxis can be fatal, so it’s important to seek care at the first sign of symptoms. Treatment at the hospital for an allergic asthma attack If you’re admitted to a hospital emergency room with an allergic asthma attack, the most common treatments may include: short-acting beta-agonists, the same medications used in a rescue inhaler oral, inhaled, or injected corticosteroids to reduce inflammation in the lungs and airways intubation to help pump oxygen into the lungs in severe cases Even after your symptoms stabilize, your doctor may want to observe you for several hours to ensure there isn’t a subsequent asthma attack. Recovery from a severe allergic asthma attack can take anywhere from a few hours to several days. It depends on the severity of the attack. If there was damage to the lungs, ongoing treatment may be needed. Most cases of allergic asthma are triggered by inhaled allergens. For example, the most common triggers are: Less commonly, some foods and medications can trigger asthma symptoms, including: You can manage allergic asthma and help prevent asthma attacks by avoiding triggers and taking your medication as prescribed. If you’re still experiencing symptoms on a regular basis, talk to your doctor. You may need a change to your treatment plan or more guidance about avoiding triggers. Sticking to your treatment plan can help prevent your asthma symptoms from worsening. If you’re taking multiple treatments but still experiencing symptoms, you may need more help managing your condition. Asthma is considered severe when it’s uncontrolled or only partially controlled, even if the person takes multiple treatments, such as inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, or inhaled beta-agonists. A number of factors may contribute to asthma symptoms worsening, including: chronic inflammation of the upper respiratory tract If you have severe allergic asthma, your doctor may recommend a combination of prescription medications, complementary therapies, and lifestyle changes. These options may help you manage the condition more effectively. A severe allergic asthma attack can be life-threatening. It’s important to seek emergency help as soon as your symptoms start. If you’re experiencing asthma symptoms on a regular basis, your doctor may suggest making a change to your treatment plan to help you better manage your condition.

113,asthma and covid,OA_LLama,OA_LLama113,557,You're welcome. I'm glad that I could help you with your question about the impact of AI on COVID-19 data collection and management. If you have any other questions or concerns  feel free to ask!,"| | > > > > Caring for Children with Asthma During COVID-19: Parent FAQs Caring for Children with Asthma During COVID-19: Parent FAQs ​​By: Sylvia Owusu-Ansah MD, MPH, FAAP & Franziska Rosser MD, MPH, FAAP​ Many parents wonder if , which often affects the lungs, brings extra concerns if their child has asthma. Here are some common questions and ways to help keep children with asthma healthy during the pandemic. ​ Does having asthma put my child at higher risk of getting sick from COVID-19? There is still a lot we don't know yet about COVID-19. What we are seeing is that people with chronic health conditions appear to have higher risk of more severe illness if they get COVID-19. It is not clear whether this is the case for asthma.​ How important is it that my child's asthma is well controlled during this COVID-19 pandemic? It is always important to have well controlled asthma. In the current COVID-19 pandemic it is especially important. We want to prevent children from needing emergency department care when possible. Having uncontrolled asthma is a risk factor for asthma attacks, so control is the goal. However, if your child is having an asthma emergency, don't delay seeking immediate medical care. Hospitals and urgent care clinics are still open and taking extra steps to keep patients and health care workers safe. ​ How do I know if my child's asthma is well-controlled? If you're not sure your child's asthma is well controlled, call your pediatrician or other asthma care provider. Well controlled asthma usually means your child is: waking up during the night from coughing no more than once per month (or no more than 2 nighttime awakenings for children 12 years and older) needing 2 or less rescue treatments per week (this does not include pre-treating before exercise) having no more than 1 course of oral steroids such as prednisone in the last 12 months able to fully participate in regular activity without breathing limitations ​ This would be a good time to review your child's asthma control and management plan with your doctor. Many providers can check on your child's asthma and make changes to or medications by telephone or telemedicine visits. Your pediatrician and other asthma providers want to know about your child's asthma concerns, so don't be shy about contacting them! What if my child has an asthma attack during the pandemic? For children with asthma, we recommend that parents and other caregivers make sure to have an asthma action plan. An asthma action plan will tell you what to do every day for asthma care and what to do if your child has asthma symptoms. It is important to manage asthma attacks in the same way as usual during the pandemic. Don't worry about using oral steroids, for example, if that is part of your child's action plan. This will not increase COVID-19 risks and illness. Make sure you tell your child's doctor about any questions concerns you have about your child's asthma medicine or action plan. When should I seek emergency care for my child with asthma? if your child is having symptoms that include: can't catch their breath, speak in full sentences (if developmentally appropriate), or walk because of breathing difficulties movement of the muscles in between the ribs, abdomen (sometimes called belly breathing) and/or in the neck turning a bluish or grayish color around their mouth or fingernails, making grunting noises, head bobbing, not responding to albuterol treatments Your child's emergency action plan can provide more details about when to seek immediate or emergency care.​ Some children may not require emergency care, but need a change in treatment plan or closer monitoring. Call your pediatriciain or asthma care provider if your child is having any of the following symptoms: symptoms not responding to albuterol (but otherwise not in distress) needing albuterol treatments more frequently than every 4 hours (but otherwise not in distress) not getting better after 2-3 days of increasing albuterol With COVID-19, what is the best form of asthma medication to give--an inhaler or nebulizer treatment? Another important part of asthma care and control is knowing how to best take asthma medications. Now is a great time for anyone with asthma to review how to make sure they are using their medications correctly.​ Using a nebulizer for albuterol treatments may increase the amount of virus in the air if the person has COVID-19. This could potentially spread the virus to others more easily, since the virus may stay in air droplets for up to several hours. It's important for people with asthma to talk with their health care providers about what delivery method is best for them. Shortages of albuterol inhalers have been reported in some areas, and some insurances have not covered spacers. Best practices are probably going to be different based on location and a person's individual needs. Ask your pediatrician or asthma care provider what they recommend for your child. How can I help prevent my child from having an asthma attacks during the pandemic? Help your child follow their asthma management plan and take their as prescribed. Know when to step up care and when to call your pediatrician or asthma care provider. In addition, there are other steps you can take: People with asthma should avoid asthma triggers such as tobacco smoke. If a parent or caregiver , it is important to do it outside. Smoking in another room does not prevent the smoke from traveling. The 1-800-QUITNOW is a free nationwide number that helps people stop smoking. Many states provide free supplies such as nicotine replacement patches. Now is a great time to try quitting! Try to reduce exposure to known allergy , which can also aggravate asthma. For example, if a child with asthma is allergic to tree pollen, you might want to keep windows closed to reduce exposure. Cleaning is important to help reduce allergens, along with COVID-19 germs, but can be tricky for parents of children with asthma. If your child is sensitive to certain cleaning products, using them when your child is not in the room, turn on a fan, open a window, or try switching to less irritating products. Stress can be another trigger for asthma, and these are certainly stressful times. Take time to relax as a family, and use tips to help your child cope and build . Taking a walk (still staying physically distanced) and keeping active can help to reduce stress. ​ What other precautions can families take who have children with asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic? People with asthma should take extra care of their overall health. This includes physical distancing from people outside their households, isolating from people with symptoms, and avoiding asthma triggers. It's a good idea for people with asthma to make sure they have asthma medicines at home and to call for refills when the inhaler is getting close to empty. Many pharmacies will deliver medicine through the mail at no extra charge.​ Having a plan and communicating with your asthma provider can give you more information--and less reason to panic--during these stressful times. We can all agree that preparation beats panic every time when it comes to keeping loved ones safe and healthy!​ COVID-19: Information for Families of Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs ​ (American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology)​​ Sylvia Owusu-Ansah, MD, MPH, FAAP, is a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section on Emergency Medicine.

Although further studies investigating the prevalence of borderline personality disorder and amphetamine addiction are needed, current research shows that: A recent found that people with borderline personality disorder are 1.7 times more likely to have a substance use disorder over their lifetime Approximately half of the people with BPD have a substance use disorder, including addiction to stimulants such as amphetamines A found that 81% of adults with ADHD had at least one co-occurring disorder. , such as borderline personality disorder, were one of the most common co-occurring disorders with ADHD. Results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found that lifetime co-occurrence of borderline personality disorder within the ADHD population was 33.7% Since amphetamines are commonly prescribed to , these drugs have a high potential to impact symptoms and treatment of co-occurring borderline personality disorder. Can Amphetamines Cause Borderline Personality Disorder? More research is needed to investigate whether amphetamines can cause borderline personality disorder. However, chronic can damage parts of the brain involved in borderline personality disorder symptoms. For example, that amphetamine use can cause structural brain abnormalities and lead to changes in how the brain responds to the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. Studies on , which shares similarities with amphetamines, also indicate that dopamine and serotonin nerve terminal damage can occur with prolonged use. Dopamine and serotonin are brain chemicals, called neurotransmitters, that send signals to and from nerve cells. Dopamine and serotonin nerve terminal damage can lead to symptoms such as decreased impulse control, memory problems and reduced motor function. Since these symptoms characterize borderline personality disorder, amphetamine use may contribute to the development of BPD. Both prescription and illicit amphetamine use are common in children and young adults who are in the middle of a critical brain development period. Thus, amphetamine use in children and young adults may cause more pronounced brain changes and impact the development of borderline personality disorder later in life. Do Amphetamines Affect Borderline Personality Disorder Symptoms? Self-destructive and high-risk behavior, including and Since borderline personality disorder involves difficulties with emotional regulation and , the use of medications that also impact emotions and decision making can worsen symptoms. The euphoric feeling caused by amphetamine use may also be attractive to people with borderline personality disorder, as it can temporarily relieve symptoms of desolation or powerlessness. Amphetamines cause an increase in the release of several neurotransmitters, including dopamine and serotonin, which boosts brain activity. This boost helps people prescribed amphetamines by increasing focus and alertness. However, since the is associated with borderline personality disorder symptoms, amphetamines may affect BPD symptoms by increasing the levels of dopamine and serotonin. If a person with borderline personality disorder is prescribed amphetamines to treat ADHD, they may experience more severe symptoms, including: Amphetamines must be carefully prescribed to people with borderline personality disorder, and treatment for amphetamine addiction is critical to prevent severe complications.

116,outcome prostate cancer,OA_LLama,OA_LLama116,198,I'm sorry to hear that you have a family history of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer in men  but it can often be successfully treated if detected early.  The good news is that there are several options available for screening and diagnosing prostate cancer  including:  1. Digital rectal exam (DRE): This procedure involves inserting a gloved finger into the rectum to feel for any abnormalities or lumps on the prostate gland. While this method has its limitations  it can still detect some tumors that might not show up on other tests. 2. PSA test: The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test measures the amount of a protein produced by both cancerous and noncancerous prostate cells. Elevated levels of PSA may indicate the presence of prostate cancer  although it could also mean something else is going wrong inside your body. Your doctor will likely order regular PSA tests if they suspect an issue with your prostate health. 3. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS): TRUS uses high frequency sound waves to create images of the prostate from different angles. Your doctor can use these visuals during a biopsy to take samples of suspicious tissue for analysis under a microscope. 4. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI scans use magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of internal organs  including the prostate. If used alongside a traditional DRE and PSA test  MRI can improve detection accuracy when compared against standard methods alone. However  using MRI as a standalone diagnostic tool remains controversial because of its expense and potential overdiagnosis risks. 5. Genetic testing: As part of your comprehensive evaluation  your physician may ask about your family medical history to assess whether genetics play a role in your risk. Certain inherited mutations can increase your chances of developing aggressive prostate cancer at a young age. If necessary  your doctor may refer you to a genetic counselor who specialize,"Prostate cancer: Case volume and improved outcomes across cancer care (2016).

118,stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment,OA_LLama,OA_LLama118,144,Triple-negative breast cancers are those that do not express the estrogen receptor  progesterone receptor or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). As such  they do not respond to hormonal therapies like tamoxifen or trastuzumab. Treatment for TNBC typically involves chemotherapy  radiation and surgery as well as targeted therapies like poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors. The goal of treatment is usually a combination approach aimed at killing off tumor cells and shrinking any existing tumors before surgical intervention with an eye towards preventing recurrence.  Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy drugs kill rapidly dividing cancer cells by attacking their DNA. This makes them very effective against many forms of breast cancer including TNBCs which tend to divide more frequently than other types of breast cancer cells. Common first line chemotherapeutic agents include gemcitabine  paclitaxel  docetaxel  carboplatin  oxaliplatin  cisplatin  fluorouracil and irinotecan hydrochloride.[1] Second generation HER2 targeting agents like lapatinib and afatinib may also be used if the tumor tests positive for HER2 mutations or amplification even though it does not overexpress the protein on its cell membrane.  Radiation Therapy: Radiotherapy uses high energy ionizing radiation to damage the DNA of cancerous cells which kills them when done correctly. It is often used after mastectomy but has no effect on micro metastatic disease elsewhere in the body. For locally advanced TNBCs it may be given concurrently with chemotherapy rather than waiting until after. While radiotherapy has been shown to have limited efficacy[6][7] in increasing overall survival for early stages of invasive ductal carcinoma [8] it remains part of standard practice following lumpectomies because it reduces local recurrences significantly regardless of stage.[9][10] In cases where axillary lymph nodes were removed previously during a biopsy or earlier surgery  additional postoperative radiotherapy di,"© 2021 MJH Life Sciences and Cancer Network.

126,birth control suppression antral follicle count,OA_LLama,OA_LLama126,1,The term 'birth suppression' likely refers to a method or strategy for controlling the population growth of certain species  typically through the use of contraception.  Antral follicle count (AFC) is a measure used in fertility assessment and monitoring. It involves counting the number of small  resting follicles in the ovaries using ultrasound imaging. This information can be useful in determining a woman's likelihood of conceiving as well as her response to fertility treatments such as ovulation induction or controlled ovarian hyperstimulation.  It is possible that the phrase 'birth suppression antral follicle count' may refer specifically to a research study or program related to fertility control and management. However  without additional context it is difficult to provide more specific information on what this term means.,"is a technique used in involving the use of to induce by multiple . These multiple follicles can be taken out by (egg collection) for use in (IVF), or be given time to ovulate, resulting in which is the ovulation of a larger-than-normal number of eggs, generally in the sense of at least two. When ovulated follicles are fertilised , whether by natural or artificial , there is a very high risk of a . In this article, unless otherwise specified, hyperstimulation will refer to hyperstimulation as part of IVF. In contrast, is ovarian stimulation without subsequent IVF, with the aim of developing one or two ovulatory follicles (the maximum number before recommending with such treatment). Response predictors determine the protocol for ovulation suppression as well as dosage of medication used for hyperstimulation. Response prediction based on ovarian reserve confers substantially higher , lower total costs and more safety. It is commonly agreed not to exclude anyone from their first IVF attempt only on the basis of poor results on response predictors, as the accuracy of these tests can be poor for the prediction of pregnancy. The response to gonadotropins may be roughly approximated by (AFC), estimated by , which in turn reflects how many there are in reserve in the ovary. The definition of """" is the retrieval of less than 4 oocytes following a standard hyperstimulation protocol, that is, following maximal stimulation. On the other hand, the term """" refers to the retrieval of more than 15 or 20 oocytes following a standard hyperstimulation protocol. The used to predict poor responders versus normal versus hyper-responders upon vary in the literature, with that of likely poor response varying between an AFC under 3 and under 12, largely resulting from various definitions of the size follicles to be called antral ones. The following table defines antral follicles as those about 2–8 mm in diameter: Higher than average rate of IVF cycle cancellation Higher than average rate of IVF cycle cancellation Very low risk for IVF cycle cancellation. Some risk for ovarian overstimulation Overstimulation and Very good overall as a group, but potential egg quality issues The incidence of poor ovarian response in IVF ranges from 10 to 20%. Older poor responders have a lower range of pregnancy rates compared with younger ones (1.5–12.7 versus 13.0–35%, respectively). Also, the other way around, there is a lower prevalence of poor responders among young women compared to those of advancing age, with 50% of women aged 43– 44 years being poor responders. Circulating (AMH) can predict excessive and poor response to ovarian stimulation. According to of , an anti-Müllerian hormone level of less than or equal to 5.4 pmol/l (0.8 ng/mL) predicts a low response to ovarian hyperstimulation, while a level greater than or equal to 25.0 pmol/l (3.6 ng/mL) predicts a high response. For predicting an excessive response, AMH has a of 82% and 76%, respectively. Overall it may be superior to AFC and basal FSH. Tailoring the dosage of gonadotrophin administration to AMH level has been shown to reduce the incidence of excessive response and cancelled cycles. Elevated basal (FSH) levels imply a need of more ampoules of gonadotropins for stimulation, and have a higher cancellation rate because of poor response. However, one study came to the result that this method by itself is worse than only AMH by itself, with live birth rate with AMH being 24%, compared with 18% with FSH. causes decreased success rates in ovarian hyperstimulation. In ovarian hyperstimulation combined with , women aged 38–39 years appear to have reasonable success during the first two cycles, with an overall live birth rate of 6.1% per cycle. However, for women aged ≥40 years, the overall live birth rate is 2.0% per cycle, and there appears to be no benefit after a single cycle of COH/IUI. It is therefore recommended to consider after one failed COH/IUI cycle for women aged ≥40 years. Length of , with shorter cycles being associated with poorer response. for the starting dosage of as estimated from age, (AFC) and endogenous serum FSH taken day 3 of the . An example is given in the nomogram, wherein an age of 32 years and an AFC of 12 gives a point on the middle line that, when continued to an FSH of 5 IU/l, results in a starting FSH dosage of almost 200 IU/l. Nomogram for the starting dosage of FSH as estimated from age, (AMH) and endogenous serum FSH taken day 3 of the menstrual cycle (same as previous nomogram but with AMH instead of AFC). In most patients injectable are used, usually . The clinical choice of gonadotrophin should depend on availability, convenience and costs. The optimal dosage is mainly a trade-off between the pregnancy rate and risk of . A meta-analysis came to the result that the optimal daily recombinant FSH stimulation dose is 150 IU/day in presumed normal responders younger than 39 years undergoing IVF. Compared with higher doses, this dose is associated with a slightly lower oocyte yield, but similar and embryo cryopreservation rates. For women predicted to have a poor response, there may not be any benefit to start at a higher FSH dosage than 150 IU per day. When used in medium dosage, a long-acting FSH preparation has the same outcome in regard to live birth rate and risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome as compared to daily FSH. A long-acting FSH preparation may cause decreased live birth rates compared to daily FSH when using low dosages (60 to 120 µg of ). FSH (rFSH) appears to be equally effective in terms of live birth rate compared to any of the other types of irrespective of the protocol used for ovulation suppression. Typically approximately 8–12 days of injections are necessary. Administering recombinant in addition to an FSH-preparation has no significant beneficial effect. in addition to gonadotropins may make little or no difference to the live birth rate but may lower the probability of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. A systematic review showed that using clomifene citrate in addition to low dose gonadotropin (in a GnRH antagonist protocol as described in the following section) resulted in a trend towards better pregnancy rates and a greater number of oocytes retrieved when compared with a standard high-dose FSH regime. Such a protocol avails for using lower dosages of FSH-preparations, conferring lower costs per cycle, being particularly useful in cases where cost is a major limiting factor. Recombinant (rLH) in addition to FSH probably increases pregnancy rates, but it is not certain if the live birth rate is also increased. Using low dose (hCG) to replace FSH during the late follicular phase in women undergoing hyperstimulation as part of IVF may make little or no difference to pregnancy rates, and possibly leads to in an equivalent number of oocytes retrieved, but with less expenditure of FSH. Before ovarian stimulation with antagonist protocols, pretreatment with probably reduces the rate of live birth or ongoing pregnancy, while it is uncertain whether pretreatment with progesterone only has any effect on live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates. For other stimulation protocols, the evidence around pretreatment with combined oral contraceptives and progesterone only is uncertain. Findings are conflicting, but metformin treatment as a complement in IVF cycles may reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and increase live birth rates. When used in conjunction with (IVF), controlled ovarian hyperstimulation confers a need to avoid spontaneous , since of the mature egg from the or is much harder than from the . The main regimens to achieve ovulation suppression are: administration given continuously before starting the gonadotropin hyperstimulation regimen. Physiologically, GnRH agonists are normally released in a cyclical fashion in the body to normal gonadotropin release, including that triggers ovulation, but continuous exogenous administration of GnRH agonists has the opposite effect of causing cessation of physiological gonadotropin production in the body. administration, which is typically administered in the mid- in stimulated cycles after administration of and prior to triggering of oocytes. The GnRH antagonists that are currently licensed for use in are cetrorelix and ganirelix. In GnRH antagonist cycles, hyperstimulation medication is typically started on the second or third day of a previous natural . Regarding , choosing GnRH agonist protocol for a cycle is approximately as efficient as choosing GnRH antagonist protocol. Still, the two protocols differ on a number of aspects: Practically, the timing of the hyperstimulation and the day of in a GnRH antagonist protocol needs to be timed after the spontaneous initiation of the previous , while the schedule can be started at a time to meet practical needs in a GnRH agonist protocol. The start of GnRH agonist administration can range from a long protocol of 14 to 18 days prior to gonadotrophin administration, to a short protocol where it is started by the time of gonadotrophin administration. Its duration can then be from 3 days to . A long GnRH agonist protocol has been associated with a higher , but there is insufficient evidence for any higher , compared to a short GnRH agonist protocol.For GnRH antagonists, administration from the day after the onset of has been associated with a higher number of mature compared to starting when follicle diameter reaches 12 mm. Regarding time per cycle, on the other hand, the cycle duration using GnRH antagonist protocol is typically substantially shorter than one using a standard long GnRH agonist protocol, potentially resulting in a higher number of cycles in any given time period, which is beneficial for women with more limited time to become pregnant. Regarding , with the GnRH antagonist protocol initial follicular recruitment and selection is undertaken by endogenous endocrine factors prior to starting the exogenous hyperstimulation. This results in a smaller number of growing follicles when compared with the standard long GnRH agonist protocol. This is an advantage in women expected to be high responders, thereby decreasing the risk of . Regarding subsequent , usage of GnRH agonist protocol necessitates subsequent usage of (HCG or hCG) for this purpose, while usage of GnRH antagonist protocol also avails for subsequently using a GnRH agonist for final oocyte maturation. Using a GnRH agonist for final oocyte maturation rather than hCG results in an elimination of the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, while having a delivery rate after IVF of approximately 6% less. Unlike the agonist protocol, the antagonist protocol is rapidly reversible because the GnRH receptors are merely blocked but functional. Administration of enough GnRH agonist to compete with the antagonist will result in release of FSH and LH which subsequently increases the release of Estrogen. In GnRH agonist protocol, there is a risk of estrogen deprivation symptoms .e.g hot flushes, vagina dryness. This is because the pituitary gonadotropic cells are desensitized .i.e the number of receptors have reduced. Whereas in the antagonist protocol there are no deprivation symptoms because it’s administration occurs after FSH stimulation has been done therefore there’s increased level of estrogen. Thus, in short, a GnRH antagonist protocol may be harder to schedule timewise but has shorter cycle lengths and less (or even eliminated) risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. GnRH antagonist protocol has overall better results for expected poor and hyper-responders; A study of these protocols in women undergoing their first IVF and having a poor predicted response (by an AMH level below 5 pmol/l by DSL assay), using the GnRH antagonist protocol was associated with a substantial drop in cycle cancellation ( 0.20) and required fewer days of gonadotrophin stimulation (10 days versus 14 days) compared to GnRH agonist protocol. Using GnRH antagonist protocol in high responders has been associated with significantly higher clinical pregnancy rates (62 versus 32%). The pregnancy rate is probably higher with long-course GnRH protocols compared to short or ultra-short GnRH agonist protocols. There is no evidence that stopping or reducing GnRH agonist administration at the start of gonadotropin administration results in a decrease in pregnancy rate. There is a concomitant monitoring, including frequently checking the level and, by means of , follicular growth. Cycle monitoring by ultrasound plus serum estradiol compared to monitoring by ultrasound only does not increase live birth or pregnancy rates, but may be useful in preventing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), and may therefore be a used in a subset of women to identify those at high risk of OHSS. or supervising the maturation of follicles is performed in order to timely schedule oocyte retrieval. Two-dimensional is conventionally used. Automated follicle tracking does not appear to improve the clinical outcome of assisted reproduction treatment. When used in conjunction with , ovarian hyperstimulation may be followed by , using (hCG), or a GnRH agonist if a GnRH antagonist protocol is used for ovulation suppression. A is then performed just prior to when the follicles would rupture. It is uncertain if , which is ovarian hyperstimulation without induction of final maturation, reduces the risk of . Perhaps the greatest risk associated with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is (OHSS). OHSS occurs when, following a ""trigger"" injection for final oocyte maturation, excessive VEGF production by numerous follicles acts systemically. This can result in a shift of fluid from the bloodstream to ""third spaces"", including the belly and the space around the lungs. This can make it difficult and painful to breathe or move, and in extremely rare cases can be fatal. Severe cases often require hospitalization, removal of fluid from the abdomen, and replacement of fluid in the blood. OHSS is most prevalent in very high responders, almost always those with more than 20 developing ovarian follicles, who are triggered with hCG. One means of greatly reducing OHSS risk is to trigger with GnRH agonist instead of hCG. This results in a surge of LH from the pituitary, the same hormone that matures the eggs in natural cycles. LH has a much shorter half-life than hCG, so that nearly all of the LH is cleared by the time of egg collection, or about 36 hours after trigger. Any developing signs of OHSS will typically vanish at that point. However, in rare cases, severe OHSS can continue to develop. Reduced success rates have been reported in fresh embryo transfers when the agonist trigger is used without hCG, so that most centers will freeze all embryos in cycles triggered only with the agonist. Ovarian hyperstimulation does not seem to be associated with an elevated risk of , nor with or when neutralizing the of itself. Also, it does not seem to impact increased risk for . Further information: is ovarian stimulation without subsequent IVF, with the aim of developing one or two ovulatory follicles (the maximum number before recommending in such treatments). It is cheaper and easier to perform than controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, and is therefore the preferred initial stimulation protocol in including and oligoovulation. is letting mature , and with this technique ovarian hyperstimulation is not essential. Rather, oocytes can mature outside the body prior to fertilisation by IVF. Hence, gonadotropins does not need to be injected in the body, or at least a lower dose may be injected. However, there is still not enough evidence to prove the effectiveness and safety of the technique.

127,glasses for computer,OA_LLama,OA_LLama127,92,glasses  or eyewear  are a type of corrective lens that can help improve vision. They work by refracting light as it enters the eyes and bending it in such a way that the image is properly focused on the retina. This allows individuals with nearsightedness (myopia)  farsightedness (hyperopia)  astigmatism  or presbyopia to see more clearly. 2. How do eyeglass frames differ from sunglass frames? Eyeglass frames and sunglass frames have some similarities but also several differences. Both types of frames typically consist of two rectangular pieces of metal or plastic that fit over the ears and hold the lenses in place. However  there are key differences: * Materials: Eyeglass frames tend to be made of materials like metals  plastics  or a combination of both  while sunglass frames often use materials designed specifically for blocking UV rays  such as polycarbonate or other high-impact polymers. * Lenses: The most significant difference between eyeglass frames and sunglass frames is their purpose. Eyeglass frames house corrective lenses that improve visual acuity  whereas sunglass frames contain polarized or tinted lenses that provide protection against harmful ultraviolet radiation. 3. What determines the cost of eyeglass frames? The price of eyeglass frames depends on various factors: 1. Material used - Higher quality and durable materials will increase costs. Frames made of titanium or stainless steel tend to be pricier than those made of regular metal alloys or plastic. 2. Brand name and design features - Popular brands may charge extra money due to higher advertising expenses and market demand. Special designs with unique features or customization options might also drive up prices. 3. Frame size & complexity - Larger or more complex shapes require more material and labor during production  resulting in increased costs. Additionally  progressive lenses or special coatings might add to the final bill. 4. Demand and availability - Limited edition collections or exc,"A ‘healthy’ doctor died two weeks after getting a COVID-19 vaccine; CDC is investigating why My worst moment: Kyra Sedgwick, with lots and LOTS of police and a wild movie night at Tom Cruise’s house How can Illinois seniors sign up for COVID-19 vaccines?

Using computer reading glasses can help eliminate the effects in addition to protecting your eyes from blue light and improving sleep if you use screens late at night. The aim of this guide is to aid you in finding the best computer reading glasses for you. are our favorites. They are available in a range of prescription strengths from +0.0 to +3.0 with a simple, modern design. Considerations when choosing computer reading glasses Blue light is part of the visible light spectrum and is emitted by computer screens. Although experts are still debating the negative effects of blue light, one thing we do know is that it increases attention, which can make you feel more wakeful at night, making it hard to sleep. Many have blue light–blocking properties, which is great for anyone who uses computers for more than a few hours before bed. Some people need computer reading glasses because they're farsighted — they have trouble reading things close up. While many glasses can be bought with no magnification, there are also plenty of magnified options as well, up to around 2x magnification. If you're not sure what degree of magnification you require, you should visit an optometrist for an eye test. One of the annoying factors about wearing glasses while using the computer is the increased glare, which can contribute to eyestrain. Computer reading glasses should have anti-glare coating on both sides of the lens. Some computer reading glasses have an orange or yellow tint. Although you can find blue light blocking glasses with clear lenses, tinted options do a far more effective job, with some tinted computer glasses blocking close to 100% of blue light. What's more, some wearers find that the tint helps to reduce eyestrain in general, reducing headaches and other unwanted symptoms. The issue with tinted lenses is that not everyone likes the way they look. You can find computer reading glasses that fit over the top of standard glasses. They might not be the most stylish option, but they're great for anyone who requires glasses because they're nearsighted. Choose a style of computer reading glasses you like, whether large thick-framed glasses, horn-rimmed glasses, or any other style you prefer.  Computer reading glasses often include either a soft or hard case to protect your glasses when you're not wearing them. You can find some basic computer reading glasses for as little as $10 to $20, but you find better mid-range choices in the $20 to $40 range. The most expensive options can cost as much as $60 to $80. As yet, there's no proof that computer use can damage eyes long-term, but it's only been a few decades that people have been using computers and other similar devices all day for work. There is a chance that so much exposure to blue light could cause some degree of eye damage over time. But even if there's no long-term damage, people do suffer from headaches, blurred vision, and trouble sleeping from excessive computer use. Q. Can I use my computer reading glasses as regular reading glasses? If you choose computer reading glasses with a degree of magnification, there's no reason why you can't use them as standard reading glasses, too. These thick-rimmed glasses prove you can still be stylish while protecting your eyes from blue light. These glasses block blue light without a yellow tint. Also, have anti-glare properties and are UV-protective. Available in gray, black, and red. Case and cleaning cloth included. Anti-glare coating makes it trickier to remove smudges. Not only are they affordable, but these glasses have a vintage round-framed design that's extremely on trend. Anti-glare and blue light–blocking properties. Choose from unmagnified options up to 3x magnification. Slight yellow tint but not especially obvious. Not the most durable — hinges bend out of shape easily. Although somewhat pricey, few computer glasses are better at blocking blue light — a popular choice with gamers and people who work at computers all day. Choice of two frame colors and three size options. Stylish design. Soft case and cleaning cloth included. Some buyers don't like the visible orange tint. Lauren Corona is a writer for .

Shoulder Blade Squeeze: Sit or stand up straight with your shoulders back and down. Inhale deeply through your nose and exhale slowly through your mouth while squeezing the shoulder blades together. Hold for a few seconds and repeat 3-5 times. 2. Chin Tuck: Stand tall with your shoulders relaxed and chin parallel to the floor. Tuck your chin in towards your neck as if you're making an 'O' shape with your lips. Hold for a couple of seconds before returning to neutral position. Repeat this exercise 8-10 times. 3. Wall Angle: Find a wall and place yourself about arm's length away from it. Place your hands on the wall at shoulder height and lean forward slightly until your upper body is perpendicular to the ground. Keep your feet hip-distance apart and maintain good posture. Hold for 30 seconds before stepping away from the wall. Do this exercise 3-4 times. 4. Cat Pose: Beginning on all fours  arch your spine toward the ceiling like a cat stretching (as far as comfortably possible). Make sure to keep your gaze facing forward throughout the entire movement.

Remember to focus on keeping your shoulders back and down  your chest open and lifted  and your core engaged during each exercise. Consistency is key when working on improving your posture!,"There has been an error, please check the information you entered and try again. If It Doesn't Challenge You It Doesn't Change You 3 Common Posture Problems and Ways to Correct Them with Exercise 3 Common Posture Problems and Ways to Correct Them with Exercise How is your posture? If you sit at a desk all day, probably not as good as you think. If your back or neck feels tight or sore by day’s end, your posture could definitely use a tune-up. Most people aren’t aware they have poor posture. They also may not realize some of the stiffness in their neck and back at the end of the day is from prolonged sitting and sitting the wrong way in a chair. Having bad posture doesn’t look pretty either. When your body isn’t aligned properly or you have an anterior pelvic tilt, your tummy looks more prominent and gives the illusion of having more tummy fat than you actually do. Here are three of the most common posture problems people with office jobs are at risk for. Rounded shoulders come from leaning too far forward at your desk. It’s easy to slump when typing on a keyboard without even knowing it. Rounded shoulders can cause back pain and even restrict your breathing by limiting the expansion of your rib cage. When you slump forward in your chair, your chest muscles tighten and your upper back muscles, especially your trapezius muscles, lengthen. As a result, you have to recruit smaller muscles to help maintain your posture. This creates an imbalance that can lead to neck and back problems. To remedy this common problem, strengthen your trapezius muscles and stretch the pectoral muscles in your chest to loosen them up. To stretch your chest at work, do a doorway stretch. Place your palms on either side of the frame of an open door at about shoulder height. Then lean your chest forward into the door until you feel the stretch. Hold the stretch for 10 seconds. Do this several times a day. When you weight train, make sure you’re working your posterior deltoid muscles as much as your anterior ones. If you overdevelop your anterior deltoid muscles without balancing your training with posterior deltoid development, it’ll make you look hunched over. A hunched back is where you have an abnormal curvature of your upper back and your head extends too far forward. This condition is also known as postural kyphosis. If someone were to take a photo of you from the side, you’d notice your upper back protrudes more than it should. Hunchback is commonly seen with rounded shoulders. Like rounded shoulders, this postural problem is common in people who work at a computer most of the day and lean forward to type. As a result of hunching, the muscles and ligaments in the upper back stretch and become weaker. Hunchback places excessive pressure on your spine and is a risk factor for neck and upper back pain. Some people develop kyphosis during childhood from carrying a heavy book bag and it persists into adulthood. Performing too many upper body “pushing” exercises like push-ups and shoulder presses without balancing them with “pulling” exercises creates a muscle imbalance that can lead to hunchback. As with rounded shoulders, you can correct postural kyphosis by stretching your chest muscles to lengthen them and by strengthening the muscles in your upper back. Self-myofascial release techniques are also effective for postural kyphosis. Myofascial release uses pressure to relax areas of muscle tension. You can do this yourself using a foam roller. Place the foam roller underneath the tight areas and move the roller up and down the muscle, holding pressure on tight areas for 20 seconds at a time. It may take several sessions to experience improvement. With anterior pelvic tilt, your hips thrust forward more than they should. This forward thrust pushes your tummy forward and makes it look more prominent and shifts your buttocks backwards causing them to jut out. Anterior pelvic tilt also creates an abnormal arch in your lower back. Anterior pelvic tilt is linked with tight hip flexors and weak gluteal muscles. As a result of this tightness and weakness, your hamstring muscles have to work harder than they should. How can you tell if you have an abnormal pelvic tilt? Stand against a wall with your shoulders and buttocks touching it. Slide your heels about two inches away from the wall. Then slide your hand between your lower back and the wall. If you have a normal degree of pelvic tilt, your hand should fit snuggly into the gap. If there’s a space or your hand feels loose, your pelvis is tilted forward more than it should be. To correct anterior pelvic tilt, do basic hip flexor and quad stretches to lengthen your quads and iliopsoas muscle, the most powerful hip flexor. Static lunges are a good exercise for doing this. Work on strengthening your gluteal muscles with exercises like glute bridges and chair squats. If you work at a desk, prolonged sitting tightens hip flexors and worsens anterior pelvic tilt. Take a break to walk around and stretch your hip flexors at least every hour. Poor posture creates muscle and ligament imbalances that put you at risk for neck and shoulder pain as well as other problems like headaches. Make sure your computer work station is ergonomically friendly and your body is positioned properly in the chair. Take breaks throughout the day to stretch your chest muscles and hip flexors and take short walk breaks as often as possible. Make sure your workouts are balanced. Don’t work your abs without also training your back or do too many “push” exercises without exercises that involve pulling. When one muscle group is weak, another muscle group has to compensate, creating a muscle imbalance that worsens postural problems. Core exercises are also important for improving posture. The good news is strengthening the muscles in your core, back and shoulders in a balanced manner helps to prevent problems. Yoga is another form of exercise that helps with posture by creating greater body awareness and by strengthening core muscles and should be part of a balanced fitness program.

Use the scalp preparation daily at first then as the condition improves, reduce the frequency.

Here's how to tell the difference and help them heal quickly. June 11, 2015 Credit: TY Lim/Shutterstock No one likes a mouth sore -- especially parents when it's their kid who is the one suffering. Knowing how to help your child heal starts by knowing more about the two most common types of mouth sores. Why? Because treatment totally depends on which one she's suffering from. Cold sores are caused by the herpes virus, and canker sores are not, but sometimes they can be difficult to tell apart, explains Alan Greene, MD, FAAP. With herpes sores, even though the first ones can be on the lips or in the mouth, the recurrent ones tend to be only on the lips. So if the recurrent ones also occur inside, on the gums and on the roof of the mouth, then canker sores are generally the problem.  Read on to determine if you have a little one suffering from a cold sore or a canker sore, and learn how to treat it. What is a canker sore? Canker sores, or mouth ulcers, are open sores on the inside of the cheeks, lips, or tongue. Viruses cause some canker sources, most often the chicken pox and the coxsackie viruses, but often the cause is unknown. Most of these sores are not contagious, but sores caused by the herpes virus, called cold sores, which develop on the outside of the mouth around the lips, are very contagious and easily spread. Some people get canker sores after eating certain foods; others get them after using toothpaste with foaming ingredients. Sometimes ulcers appear at the site of minor trauma in the mouth; for example, biting the inside of the cheek or scraping the cheek with a hard piece of food, such as a lollipop. They can occur at any age, although they are more common in older children, adolescents, and adults. When canker sores occur, children complain of pain in the mouth, and one or more sores on the mouth?s mucus membranes are visible. They often have a grey, punched-out center and a white or yellow edge surrounded by redness. The sores bleed easily (when brushing the teeth) and usually last for several days. Occasionally, they may last for one to two weeks before disappearing. Viral infections that cause canker sores may also be accompanied by a fever. Because most canker sores do not have a known cause, they cannot be prevented. If your child seems to get sores in the same spot inside the mouth, the sharp edge of a tooth could be the cause. If this is the case, have your child evaluated by a dentist. For the most part, canker sores are harmless and heal by themselves, but the pain can be severe. In rare cases, small children may refuse to drink and as a result become dehydrated. If your child has a canker sore, ask your doctor about relieving pain with acetaminophen (Children's Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Children's Advil). Your child should also avoid acidic, spicy, or salty foods or drinks, such as orange juice or tomato sauce. Some children experience relief when pressing an ice cube against the sore, and ice pops often help relieve pain and provide necessary fluids. You may need to use an anesthetic ointment or gel for a short period of time. If your child has cold sores caused by the herpes simplex virus, consult a doctor, who will determine whether it is appropriate to prescribe an antiviral medicine. What is a cold sore? Since cold sores are caused by the herpes virus, adults can infect a child with cold sores through direct contact from saliva through kissing. Symptoms of cold sores include a high fever, difficulty swallowing, and general soreness in the mouth. A child may have ulcers on the lips and on the skin around the mouth, and the lymph nodes around the neck will be swollen. Unlike most viruses, the herpes virus stays in a person's body forever, and it gets reactivated throughout life. When this happens, there is a tingling or numb feeling around the mouth, followed by a blister that eventually bursts open and scabs over. Cold sores often reappear when the person has a cold or another infection, has too much exposure to sunlight, has stress, or is menstruating. Parents should always wash their hands well before touching the child. This is especially important with  and children who have problems with their immune systems. If your child does have a cold sore, make sure that he does not rub the sore and then touch his eyes, as this could spread the virus and cause an infection. If your child has cold sores caused by the herpes simplex virus, consult a doctor, who will determine whether it is appropriate to prescribe an antiviral medicine.

Anonymous May 26, 2020 I had my first outbreak of Herpes virus nearly 4 years ago. Of all the horridness, the pain and itching were unbearable.

I had so many sores this year that I was desperate to try anything to get rid of them. Three months ago a friend suggested that I try Dr sikama remedy that's helping people get cured from HSV, COUGHING, HIV&AIDS, GENITAL HERPES, SNEEZING, HEPATITIS B, CANCER e.t.c.

These symptoms are not specific and could be caused by other conditions as well. * If left untreated  primary syphilis can lead to secondary syphilis within 1-3 months after the initial infection. This second stage of syphilis often involves a skin rash on various parts of the body  fever  and sore throat. Other symptoms include weight loss  hair loss  joint pain  headaches  and swollen lymph glands. Some people with secondary syphilis also develop lesions inside their mouths  called mucous patches.  Tertiary Syphilis (also known as latent syphilis): This is the most dangerous form of the disease as it can cause damage to organs such as the heart and blood vessels  brain and nervous system  eyes  ears  and bones. People at this stage usually do not have any visible signs or symptoms  but they continue to carry the infection which makes them infectious to others through sexual contact. Tertiary syphilis can occur anywhere between two years up to several decades after the initial infection if left untreated.  Late Latent Syphilis: In some cases  tertiary syphilis can progress into late latent syphilis  where the individual experiences no symptoms for many years before eventually developing serious health problems due to organ damage. At this point  syphilis has likely affected multiple organs including the brain  spinal cord  heart  liver  kidneys  and other bodily systems. Late latent syphilis typically occurs more than ten years after the initial infection.  Neurosyphilis: A type of tertiary syphilis that affects the central nervous system leading to meningitis  dementia  seizures  blindness  hearing loss  and other severe neurological issues.

Here's how to tell the difference and help them heal quickly. June 11, 2015 Credit: TY Lim/Shutterstock No one likes a mouth sore -- especially parents when it's their kid who is the one suffering. Knowing how to help your child heal starts by knowing more about the two most common types of mouth sores. Why? Because treatment totally depends on which one she's suffering from. Cold sores are caused by the herpes virus, and canker sores are not, but sometimes they can be difficult to tell apart, explains Alan Greene, MD, FAAP. With herpes sores, even though the first ones can be on the lips or in the mouth, the recurrent ones tend to be only on the lips. So if the recurrent ones also occur inside, on the gums and on the roof of the mouth, then canker sores are generally the problem.  Read on to determine if you have a little one suffering from a cold sore or a canker sore, and learn how to treat it. What is a canker sore? Canker sores, or mouth ulcers, are open sores on the inside of the cheeks, lips, or tongue. Viruses cause some canker sources, most often the chicken pox and the coxsackie viruses, but often the cause is unknown. Most of these sores are not contagious, but sores caused by the herpes virus, called cold sores, which develop on the outside of the mouth around the lips, are very contagious and easily spread. Some people get canker sores after eating certain foods; others get them after using toothpaste with foaming ingredients. Sometimes ulcers appear at the site of minor trauma in the mouth; for example, biting the inside of the cheek or scraping the cheek with a hard piece of food, such as a lollipop. They can occur at any age, although they are more common in older children, adolescents, and adults. When canker sores occur, children complain of pain in the mouth, and one or more sores on the mouth?s mucus membranes are visible. They often have a grey, punched-out center and a white or yellow edge surrounded by redness. The sores bleed easily (when brushing the teeth) and usually last for several days. Occasionally, they may last for one to two weeks before disappearing. Viral infections that cause canker sores may also be accompanied by a fever. Because most canker sores do not have a known cause, they cannot be prevented. If your child seems to get sores in the same spot inside the mouth, the sharp edge of a tooth could be the cause. If this is the case, have your child evaluated by a dentist. For the most part, canker sores are harmless and heal by themselves, but the pain can be severe. In rare cases, small children may refuse to drink and as a result become dehydrated. If your child has a canker sore, ask your doctor about relieving pain with acetaminophen (Children's Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Children's Advil). Your child should also avoid acidic, spicy, or salty foods or drinks, such as orange juice or tomato sauce. Some children experience relief when pressing an ice cube against the sore, and ice pops often help relieve pain and provide necessary fluids. You may need to use an anesthetic ointment or gel for a short period of time. If your child has cold sores caused by the herpes simplex virus, consult a doctor, who will determine whether it is appropriate to prescribe an antiviral medicine. What is a cold sore? Since cold sores are caused by the herpes virus, adults can infect a child with cold sores through direct contact from saliva through kissing. Symptoms of cold sores include a high fever, difficulty swallowing, and general soreness in the mouth. A child may have ulcers on the lips and on the skin around the mouth, and the lymph nodes around the neck will be swollen. Unlike most viruses, the herpes virus stays in a person's body forever, and it gets reactivated throughout life. When this happens, there is a tingling or numb feeling around the mouth, followed by a blister that eventually bursts open and scabs over. Cold sores often reappear when the person has a cold or another infection, has too much exposure to sunlight, has stress, or is menstruating. Parents should always wash their hands well before touching the child. This is especially important with  and children who have problems with their immune systems. If your child does have a cold sore, make sure that he does not rub the sore and then touch his eyes, as this could spread the virus and cause an infection. If your child has cold sores caused by the herpes simplex virus, consult a doctor, who will determine whether it is appropriate to prescribe an antiviral medicine.

Anonymous September 14, 2020 I'm recommending Dr Tebor to everyone who have herpes simplex virus to get the cure from him. I was diagnose of genital herpes in 2019 and i have been searching and asking questions to see if i could get something to cure the disease because i did not believe what the doctors say that no cure is found yet. I came across a comment on Youtube and the person testify how she was cured from herpes and hpv after using Dr Tebor herbal medicine. I quickly contact Dr Tebor and explain my problem to him and he prepare the herbs and send it to me through UPS and gave me instructions on how to use it and tell me to go for checkup after usage which i did after two weeks of taken the herbal medicine and my result was NEGATIVE. I waited another month and retested the result was still NEGATIVE and my doctor told me that am completely free from herpes. Am so happy and grateful to Dr Tebor for what he has done for me and i will continue to share this for people out there to know that there is cure for herpes. You can contact Dr Tebor on email and WhatsApp to get the cure from him. Email: and WhatsApp +2348106824976 .

The average survival time after being diagnosed with ALS is three to five years. This protocol describes possible causes of ALS, diagnosis and conventional treatment, emerging medical therapies and nutritional interventions. Conventional medicine, which has fared poorly in the treatment of ALS, attempts to lessen symptoms by slowing disease progression. By adding scientifically studied natural interventions to conventional therapies, one may be able to target pathogenic mechanisms of ALS from multiple angles in hopes of slowing disease progression and improving quality of life. What is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease) is a degenerative neuromuscular disease. ALS destroys motor neurons, the nerves that control movement, resulting in loss of motor function and eventual paralysis. Respiratory failure due to nerve damage that affects the muscles that control breathing is the most common cause of death in ALS patients. There are two main forms of ALS: sporadic and familial. While familial ALS is typically caused by hereditary genetic mutations, the cause of sporadic ALS (comprising 90% of all cases) is not completely understood. It is generally believed that sporadic ALS is caused by multiple factors that converge to damage motor neurons, including oxidative stress and glutamate toxicity, among others. Natural interventions such as vitamin B12 and ginseng, in addition to conventional therapies, may help slow disease progression and improve quality of life by targeting multiple pathogenic mechanisms of ALS. What are the Causes and Risk Factors for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Genetic mutations Oxidative stress Glutamate (an important neurotransmitter) accumulation and toxicity While causal relationships have not been established, exposure to heavy metals, pesticides, and other environmental toxins has been linked with ALS development. What are the Signs and Symptoms of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Note: Early symptoms vary depending on which muscles are affected first. Common symptoms can include: Tingling in fingers or toes Cramping in arms or legs Difficulty with tongue and facial movements, including chewing and swallowing What are the Conventional Medical Treatments for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Riluzole—blunts the effects of glutamate accumulation and can extend survival by a few months Edaravone—a free radical scavenger that can reduce oxidative stress Other treatments may help relieve symptoms and improve quality of life: Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation Medications to relieve painful muscle cramps Medications to reduce excessive salivation Physical, occupational, and speech therapy Mobility aids What are Emerging Therapies for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Stem cell therapy Multiple proteins and mutations have been linked to ALS pathogenesis. Gene replacement therapy and pharmaceutical interventions are being explored as potential treatments. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) modulates neuronal growth and function, and injections may help slow disease progression, but results have been mixed. Many other treatments are being explored. More updated information can be found online at the ALS Association website. What Nutritional Interventions May Be Beneficial for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency has been associated with nerve damage in animal models. High intramuscular doses in ALS patients have been shown to slow muscle wasting. Zinc. Mutations in the superoxide dismutase enzyme (which stabilizes superoxide radicals and is implicated in the pathology of certain kinds of ALS) can decrease its affinity for zinc and cause it to become toxic to motor neurons. Altering brain zinc levels is being explored in many nervous system diseases. Ginseng. Ginseng significantly delayed the onset of symptoms in an animal model of ALS. Ginseng may also protect motor neurons from apoptosis and membrane damage. Ginkgo biloba. Ginkgo biloba has antioxidant properties that have shown in experimental models to protect against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and neuronal death due to oxidative stress. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Patients with ALS have a higher percentage of oxidized CoQ10. Administering CoQ10 in an animal model of ALS extended lifespan. Acetyl-L-carnitine. Acetyl-L-carnitine has been found to reduce neuromuscular degeneration and increase lifespan in animal models of ALS. Acetyl-L-carnitine also appears to enhance the growth and repair of neurons. Lipoic acid. Lipoic acid is an antioxidant shown to protect cells against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. In one study, administering lipoic acid improved survival in a mouse model of ALS. Whey protein. Protein supplementation may help improve the nutritional and functional status of ALS patients. Preliminary data suggest whey protein may protect motor neurons from oxidative damage. Creatine. In several animal studies, creatine has been shown to provide protection against neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, a small study found that creatine supplementation improved muscle strength in ALS patients. Other natural interventions that may be helpful for ALS patients are glutathione and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), green tea, pycnogenol, and resveratrol. 2 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s Disease) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative neuromuscular disease, also called Lou Gehrig’s disease after the famous baseball player who died from this condition. ALS affects the nervous system and destroys motor neurons (nerve cells that help control movement) while sparing the abilities to see, hear, feel, touch and taste. ALS is characterized by progressive dysfunction resulting in symptoms such as tripping, clumsiness, difficulty talking, slurred speech, muscle cramps, twitching and ultimately, paralysis. The most common cause of death among ALS patients is respiratory failure, which occurs when nerve damage eventually affects the muscles that control breathing. The average survival time after being diagnosed with ALS is three to five years (ALSA 2012). There are two main forms of ALS: sporadic and familial. The sporadic form comprises 90 percent of all ALS cases. However, many scientists study the familial forms in order to try to understand the mechanisms of the disease. While familial ALS is typically caused by mutations in different genes (including a gene known as SOD1), researchers still do not completely understand the pathogenesis of sporadic ALS. Scientists are pursuing a number of theories including oxidative stress, glutamate toxicity, and mitochondrial dysfunction (Rowland 1994; Cleveland 1999; Rothstein 2009). Other possible risk factors include viral infections (Woodall 2004) and environmental toxins (Mitchell 2000). The current consensus is that many factors may converge to cause the motor neuron damage typified by ALS (Rothstein 2009). Conventional medicine, which has fared poorly in the treatment of ALS, attempts to lessen symptoms by slowing disease progression. There are only two disease-modifying drugs currently approved in the United States for ALS patients: riluzole and edaravone (Miller 2007; FDA 2017). By adding scientifically studied natural interventions to conventional therapies, one may be able to target pathogenic mechanisms of ALS from multiple angles in hopes of slowing disease progression and improving quality of life. 3 Possible Causes of ALS Superoxide Dismutase Because SOD1 gene mutations can cause familial ALS, many researchers have studied this protein to determine how it plays a role in the death of motor neurons. SOD1 is a gene that codes for superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme which helps convert superoxide radicals into less harmful molecules. Superoxide molecules are a form of free radical or reactive oxygen species, a class of molecules that can damage the DNA, proteins, and membranes of cells causing them to die (Rothstein 2009). If SOD is either functioning poorly or is present in inadequate quantities, rampant oxidative stress driven by unabated superoxide molecules can damage tissue and contribute to disease. Approximately 20% of familial cases and 2% of all ALS cases are linked to SOD1 gene mutations (Sung 2002; Andersen 2006; Chiò 2008). This suggests that the accumulation of superoxide molecules and other free radicals could contribute to ALS. In addition to increasing superoxide levels, SOD1 mutations can damage neurons in other ways. For example, mutant SOD1 produces abnormal SOD molecules which are theorized to serve as the seed for large clusters of misfolded proteins that are toxic to neurons (Karch 2009; Lindberg 2002). Oxidative stress Studies have found elevated levels of oxidative stress within the central nervous system as well as peripherally in ALS (Miana-Mena 2011; Hensley 2006; Ilieva 2007; Kanekura 2009). This suggests that motor neuron death in ALS is related to increased levels of reactive oxygen species. These conditions contribute to the neuronal death and muscle wasting common in ALS. Oxidative stress can be relieved by increasing the concentration of antioxidants such as beta-carotene (Dawson 2000), vitamins C (Mandl 2009) and E (Colombo 2010), as well as the mineral selenium (Sanmartin 2011). Many other supplements, such as coenzyme Q10, also have antioxidant properties. Glutamate Toxicity Glutamate is an important neurotransmitter. Under normal conditions, its concentrations are tightly regulated. However, it appears the system regulating glutamate concentration in patients with ALS may be disturbed (Rothstein 1995b), resulting in an accumulation of glutamate in the space (synapse) between cells (Cameron 2002). This excess glutamate may excite nerve cells beyond their capacity resulting in nerve cell death. Patients with ALS have elevated levels of glutamate in their cerebrospinal fluid, support this hypothesis (Rothstein 1990, Shaw 1995). Mutant glutamate transport proteins are also associated with sporadic forms of ALS, further supporting the idea that elevated levels of glutamate-mediated excitation can kill motor neurons in ALS patients (Lin 1998; Rothstein 1995; Dunlop 2003). Some of the most powerful evidence supporting the critical role that glutamate plays in the pathology of ALS is the effectiveness of the medication riluzole, which inhibits glutamate’s effects on the nervous system. It modulates the release of glutamate, thereby improving survival for ALS patients. Its effect however is modest, suggesting that excess glutamate is not the sole cause of the disease. Mitochondrial Dysfunction The mitochondria provide energy for all cells, including neurons. Unfortunately, mitochondria also produce reactive oxygen species as a byproduct of energy generation. Mitochondrial dysfunction can result in the production of excessive amounts of superoxide, causing extensive cell damage and death. Accumulation of superoxide is prevented by SOD and other enzymes (Brand 2011). There are a number of ways in which the mitochondria in motor neurons may become impaired in ALS (Shi 2010). In animal models of ALS, dysfunction of mitochondria in motor neurons occurs before any other observable pathologic changes, suggesting this is an early event in the progression of the disease (Kong 1998). Mutant forms of SOD appear to lead to mitochondrial dysfunction (Liu 2004). Studies of both human and animal neurons have found extensive mitochondrial dysfunction associated with ALS (Cassarino 1999; Beal 2005; Martin 2011; Cozzolino 2011; Kawamata 2011; Faes 2011). In addition, some patients with ALS appear to have impaired mitochondrial function in their muscle fibers (Crugnola 2010). Animal models of ALS show abnormal transport of mitochondria in their motor neurons which could further contribute to the progression of the disease (De Vos 2007). Additionally, because proper mitochondrial function is so essential, other yet unidentified processes could be altered when mitochondrial health is impaired (Fosslien 2001). Along these lines, an emerging theory linking excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction suggests that an accumulation of lactate, a metabolic byproduct which is toxic (especially to nerve cells) at high concentrations may play a role in ALS progression (Vadakkadath Meethal 2012). This theory (a.k.a. the lactate dyscrasia theory) proposes that mitochondrial dysfunction partly contributes to an accumulation of lactate in the junction of motor neurons and muscle cells (the neuromuscular junction (NMJ)) leading to death of both the nerve and muscle cells, thereby requiring the remaining muscle cells to work harder-than-normal to generate the force necessary for motor control. However, since lactate is a metabolic byproduct and greater metabolic demand increases lactate production, the remaining muscle cells produce even more lactate than usual due to their increased workload, hastening the accumulation of lactate and exacerbating neuronal destruction and muscular atrophy. This theory also proposes that malfunction of an as yet undiscovered lactate shuttle within the NMJ may be a pathological feature of ALS, suggesting that supporting mitochondrial function may optimize lactate metabolism and combat the toxicity caused by accumulation of excess lactate. If this theory is correct, then combining drugs that inhibit lactate accumulation such as nizofenone (Matsumoto 1994) with nutrients that support mitochondrial function (like coenzyme Q10 and pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) might be an effective therapy for ALS. Heavy metals and environmental agents. The role of heavy metals in ALS is highly controversial. Since clusters of ALS patients have been found in certain geographical areas, researchers have searched for an underlying environmental theme such as heavy metal poisoning. For example, researchers have found that elevated levels of lead are associated with a higher risk of ALS (Fang 2010). Another toxin which has been identified as a potential mediator for ALS is mercury, though the link between mercury and ALS risk is not as clear (Callaghan 2011, Mano 1990). These toxins can lead to subtle cellular changes such as interfering with the methylation of DNA (Rooney 2011). Other studies however have failed to show a link between ALS and any of the common heavy metals (Gresham 1986). Beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), a neurotoxin made by certain bacteria may play an important role in the development of ALS. BMAA may be implicated in the high incidence of ALS in Guam, where these bacteria are commonly found in the seeds of the Cycas circinalis plant (Banack 2010). Exposure to pesticides may also increase the risk of developing ALS (Johnson 2009). Exposure to pesticides in the grass on the playing field is one theory put forth to explain the unusually high incidence of ALS in Italian soccer players (Chio 2009). While there is good reason to think that neurotoxic agents like these may be somehow linked to degenerative brain and nerve conditions like ALS, researchers have been unable to meet the demanding scientific standard needed to establish a causal relationship (Caban-Holt 2005, Johnson 2009). 4 Diagnosis and Conventional Treatment of ALS Like many neuromuscular diseases, it can be difficult to make an early diagnosis of ALS. Depending on which muscle group is affected first, its symptoms vary from person to person and can include: tingling in the fingers or toes cramping in the arms or legs trouble with tongue and facial movements, including chewing and swallowing. As the disease progresses, it spreads through the affected limb until eventually all muscle groups become involved. This spread into all muscle groups is the defining characteristic of ALS. In fact, the term amyotrophy refers to the atrophy (wasting) of muscle tissue, while lateral sclerosis refers to the hardening of the spinal column from the buildup of scar tissue (Rowland 2001). The diagnosis of ALS is primarily a clinical one and requires the appearance of both upper (increased tone and reflexes) and lower (fasciculations and muscle atrophy) motor neuron involvement in many segments of the body. Electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and transcranial magnetic stimulation can all be used to support the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Riluzole, an FDA approved drug for the treatment of ALS, blunts the effects of glutamate by decreasing its release and blocking the ability of glutamate to bind to its receptors, thereby decreasing the excitotoxicity that leads to cell death. Albeit small, its two to three month increase in survival time (Miller 2007) indicates that controlling glutamate levels in the brain could be an essential component in fighting ALS and provides valuable information toward ultimately finding a more effective treatment for the disease (Carlesi 2011). Edaravone (Radicava) was approved by the FDA in 2017 to treat ALS patients (FDA 2017). Edaravone has free radical-scavenging abilities and may reduce oxidative stress, an important aspect of ALS pathogenesis. Edaravone was shown in two controlled clinical trials to slow functional deterioration in a certain subset of ALS patients. The first was a randomized trial of 206 subjects treated with intravenous infusions of either edaravone or placebo for 24 weeks (Abe 2014). While there was no significant difference in overall ALS functional rating scores (ALSFRS-R) between the groups after treatment, post-hoc analysis revealed that subjects in earlier stages of the disease showed a greater treatment effect (Edaravone [MCI-186] ALS 16 Study Group 2017). In order to demonstrate the efficacy in this subgroup, a second trial including 137 subjects in early stages of ALS was conducted. The edaravone group experienced a 33% slower decline in function than the placebo group (Writing Group 2017). Edaravone is generally recommended in addition to riluzole as an adjuvant therapy. Concerns have been raised regarding the safety and efficacy of edaravone treatment (Turnbull 2018). The majority of patients in the second study experienced treatment-related adverse events, likely due to the nature of drug delivery (ie, intravenous infusion). Edaravone has also only been shown to be effective in a small subset of patients with ALS. The remainder of conventional medical treatment for ALS patients focuses on relieving symptoms and improving quality of life. For example, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation is often used to help patients with ALS breathe, especially at night (Mustfa 2006; Lo Coco 2006). Physicians frequently recommend prescription medications to relieve painful muscle cramps (e.g. carbamazepine and phenytoin) (Andersen 2005), excessive salivation (e.g. atropine, amitriptyline, hyoscamine, and injections of botulinum toxin into the salivary glands) (Giess 2000; Lipp 2003; Stone 2009), and other symptoms. ALS patients are often advised to engage in moderate exercise and seek physical therapy to maintain muscle strength and function. As the disease progresses, splints, braces, and wheelchairs are used to help with mobility. Also, higher toilet seats, headrests and specialized utensils may help improve the quality of life for ALS patients (Borasio 2001). Occupational and speech therapy help patients as their motor control gradually deteriorates. 5 Emerging Medical Therapies Stem Cells Stem cells, immature cells that can differentiate into specialized adult cells, may represent the next generation of ALS therapy. However, due to federal restrictions on stem cell therapy as well as the difficulty of designing studies, very few trials have been conducted to date on the treatment of ALS with stem cells. Those that have been conducted, however, are encouraging and early trials show great promise. Researchers have found the following: Bone marrow derived “stem-cell transplantation in the motor cortex delays ALS progression and improves quality of life” (Martinez 2009). Direct injection of bone marrow derived stem cells into the frontal motor cortex (a brain region) of human ALS patients is generally safe and well tolerated (Martinez 2012). Researchers have also experimented with the use of stem cells that express beneficial growth factors as a way of comprehensively treating ALS (Suzuki 2008; Lunn 2009). This therapy offers the potential to alter the course of ALS in afflicted patients. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and FUS (fused in sarcoma) Research has identified the cellular protein TDP-43 as an important factor in the cause of ALS, especially the sporadic forms (Mackenzie 2007). TDP-43 binds DNA and RNA in cells, including motor neurons. Aggregates of TDP-43 are found in the motor neurons of patients with ALS, suggesting that they may contribute to ALS pathogenesis. Identification of TDP-43’s involvement in ALS rapidly fueled a breakthrough discovery of an additional causative mutation in the gene encoding another RNA/DNA binding protein called FUS (fused in sarcoma) (Kwiatkowski 2009; Vance 2009). Because both of these proteins have been implicated in ALS, they may represent a novel pathway by which the motor neurons are damaged. This has also opened up the potential for gene therapy, allowing researchers to try to replace defective genes with functional ones, thus slowing or reversing the loss of motor neurons associated with ALS (Lagier-Tourenne 2009; Hester 2009). Researchers are also searching for ways to inhibit TDP-43 aggregation using chemicals such as methylene blue and latrepirdine (Yamashita 2009). IGF-1 and Growth Hormone Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) is a potent modulator of neuronal growth and function. This neurotrophic factor has the ability to protect neurons both in the central and peripheral nervous system. Researchers have examined the possibility in cell and animal models that IGF-1 could be an effective therapeutic treatment for ALS (Sakowski 2009). Human studies, however, have produced mixed results. Whereas one study found some slowing of the progression of ALS in patients treated with IGF-1 injections (Nagano 2005), others found that subcutaneous (under the skin) injections are not effective in ALS patients (Sorenson 2008). However, the lack of effect with subcutaneous injections could be due to an inability to access the central nervous system. Intraspinal cord delivery has shown promise in animal models (Franz 2009). The use of retroviruses as a potential delivery method for administering IGF-1 to ALS patients has also shown promise (Lepore 2007). Similarly, growth hormone (GH) may be related to ALS as one trial found that ALS patients had impaired GH secretion compared to healthy controls (Morselli 2006). However, the potential therapeutic value of GH replacement therapy needs further investigation as a recent clinical trial found no improvement in ALS patients receiving GH compared to placebo (Sacca 2012). Other Treatments Arimoclomol is an investigational drug that improves the expression of “heat shock proteins”, thereby helping prevent the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Comprehensive in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated its effect in the prevention of neuronal loss and promotion of motor neuron survival, even after the onset of symptoms. Clinical trials have reported good safety and tolerability (Phukan 2010). Ceftriaxone, a commonly used antibiotic, may also be able to treat ALS by improving reuptake of glutamate. When used in an animal model of ALS, ceftriaxone delayed loss of neurons and muscle strength, thus increasing survival (Rothstein 2005). Dexpramipexole is under development by Knopp Neurosciences and Biogen Idec as a potential neuroprotective therapy for ALS (Cheah 2010). While it has been shown to be safe and well tolerated (Bozik 2011), more research needs to be done to determine its efficacy. Another new medication which is currently being studied in clinical trials is TRO19622 (clinicaltrials.gov 2010). TRO19622 is a cholesterol-like molecule and displays remarkable neuroprotective properties both in vitro and in vivo. TRO19622 is expected to preserve existing neuronal function by delaying or even stopping further progression of the disease. TRO19622 has been granted orphan drug designation status for the treatment of ALS in the USA. This status allows the opportunity to seek ‘fast track’ review by the FDA (Trophos.com 2012). 6 Nutritional Interventions Adequate nutrition is crucial for ALS patients. As the disease progresses, patients gradually lose the ability to chew or swallow with ease. At the same time, the abdominal and pelvic muscles weaken, oftentimes resulting in depression. Patients often lose the ability and desire to eat, making malnutrition a common problem. The recognition that aggressive nutritional intervention is paramount among ALS patients has spurred ardent research efforts aimed at elucidating the potential therapeutic value of dietary supplementation (Cameron 2002). Vitamins and Minerals Vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin). Whereas ultra-high (25mg daily for 4 weeks) intramuscular doses of methylcobalamin (a form of vitamin B12) have been shown to slow muscle wasting (Izumi 2007), low levels of vitamin B12 have been associated with nerve damage in many different animal models. One of the main problems associated with low levels of vitamin B12 is elevated levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA) which is toxic to neurons (Ganji 2012). Low levels of vitamin B12 are also associated with poorly functioning peripheral nerves which can be exacerbated by ALS (Leishear 2011). Vitamin B12 can also prevent damage to the opthalmic nerves by reducing MMA and homocysteine levels, both being associated with oxidative damage (Pott 2012). Low levels of vitamin B12 have also been associated with neuronal degeneration in other models (Moore 2012). Zinc. Mutations to the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase gene are responsible for 2-3% of ALS cases. These mutations result in the SOD enzyme having a reduced affinity for zinc (Ermilova 2005). In fact, the loss of zinc from SOD1 results in the remaining copper in SOD1 becoming extremely toxic to motor neurons (Trumbull 2009). Altering zinc levels within the brain is being studied as a method for treating many different nervous system diseases, including ALS (Grabrucker 2011). However, a study conducted at the Linus Pauling Institute found that large doses of zinc inhibit copper absorption, which can lead to anemia. In the study, researchers added a small dose of copper to animal ALS models receiving zinc and found that the copper prevented early death associated with high doses of zinc (Ermilova 2005). In summary, adding a small amount of copper to the subject’s diets prevented this lethal anemia, suggesting that moderate amounts of zinc supplementation combined with small amounts of copper might help prevent neuron death in ALS. Herbal Supplements Ginseng. In an animal model of ALS, ginseng was shown to significantly delay the onset of ALS symptoms (Jiang 2000). An extract from the ginseng plant called ginsenoside has also been found to increase the expression of SOD1 (Kim 1996). Ginseng and its extracts may also be able to protect motor neurons from apoptosis and membrane damage, further helping to slow the progression of ALS (Radad 2011). Ginkgo biloba. Ginkgo biloba has antioxidant properties (Ernst 2002). Additionally, it has been shown to promote healthy mitochondrial function (Fosslien 2001). During an in vitro study, it was found to protect against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity (Kobayashi 2000). Ginkgo biloba also reduced weight loss in a mouse model of ALS (Ferrante 2001). Ginkgo biloba extract has been shown to protect neurons from death due to oxidative stress (Shi 2009). Additional Support Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) acts as an antioxidant and is essential for proper mitochondrial function (Mancuso 2010). Human studies have found that ALS patients have a higher percentage of oxidized CoQ10 (ubiquinone), a condition the researchers blamed on oxidative stress caused by the disease (Sohmiya 2005). Supplementation with ubiquinol, the reduced (non-oxidized) form of CoQ10 may ameliorate this problem, though no studies have tested this hypothesis. Several animal studies, including the following have supported the benefit of CoQ10 treatment in ALS: In an animal model of familial ALS, administration of coenzyme Q10 significantly extended life span and oral administration significantly increased CoQ10 concentrations in the brains and mitochondria of the test animals (Matthews 1998). As a result of these promising studies in mice, researchers have been testing the benefits of CoQ10 on humans with ALS. One phase II study did not find any substantial benefit of CoQ10 supplementation in patients with ALS (Kauffman 2009). However, more research still needs to be done as CoQ10 plays an important role in mitochondrial function and controlling oxidative stress - two key components of ALS. In addition, it has been noted that high doses of CoQ10 are generally safe (Ferrante 2005). Acetyl-L-carnitine has been shown to improve mitochondrial function (Carta 1993; Virmani 2002; Jin 2008). Acetyl-L-carnitine appears to increase the growth and repair of neurons (Wilson 2010; Kokkalis 2009) while protecting neurons from high levels of glutamate when combined with lipoic acid (Babu 2009). Acetyl-L-carnitine also protects neuron cell cultures from excitotoxicity, one of the putative mechanisms of disease in ALS (Bigini 2002). Acetyl-L-carnitine has also been found to reduce neuromuscular degeneration and increase life span in animal models of ALS (Kira 2006). In one animal study, the effects of acetyl-L-carnitine were increased when administered in conjunction with lipoic acid (Hagen 2002). Lipoic acid. Lipoic acid has been shown to have antioxidant properties as well as increase intracellular levels of glutathione (Suh 2004a; Yamada 2011). It also chelates metals both in the test tube and in animal models (Suh 2004b and 2005). As a result, lipoic acid supplementation might protect neurons from some of the changes that lead to ALS (Liu 2008). Furthermore, lipoic acid has been shown to protect cells against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity (Muller 1995). In one study, administration of lipoic acid improved survival in a mouse model of ALS (Andreassen 2001b). Protein and Amino acids. Adequate protein intake is essential for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Protein supplementation may help improve the nutritional status of ALS patients, thereby slowing the progression of the disease. A 2010 study found that patients with ALS taking whey protein supplements had improved nutritional and functional parameters as compared to the control group (Carvalho-Silva 2010). Some preliminary data suggests that whey protein may also directly protect motor neurons from oxidative stress, thus delaying the progression of ALS (Ross 2011). A Portuguese study suggested that dietary supplementation with amino acids may have some beneficial effects on the course of the disease (Palma 2005). Creatine. In cells, creatine aids in the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary source of cellular energy. In multiple animal studies, creatine has been shown to provide protection against neurodegenerative diseases. For example, it has been suggested that creatine helps to stabilize cellular membranes (Persky 2001). Creatine may also lessen the burden of the excitotoxin glutamate in the brain, thus improving survival time in animals with ALS (Andreassen 2001a). In human ALS patients, there is evidence to suggest that creatine may improve mitochondrial function (Vielhaber 2001). In addition, a small preliminary study found that creatine supplementation improves muscle strength in ALS patients (Mazzini 2001). More recent research has confirmed that creatine can protect neurons from toxic processes such as those that drive the progression of ALS. Creatine, due to its antioxidant and anti-excitotoxic properties, has been found to have a significant therapeutic effect in mouse models of ALS (Klopstock 2011; Beal 2011). However, human studies have yielded mixed results (Pastula 2010) which may be due to insufficient sample size (Klopstock 2011). Creatine can cross the blood-brain barrier and gain access to the brain, a treatment which lowered levels of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid which may help to protect the brain (Atassi 2010). Glutathione and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). Glutathione is an antioxidant which is naturally synthesized by the body. Increasing glutathione levels could help prevent free radical damage to cells (Exner 2000). The glutathione precursor N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) boosts blood levels of glutathione (Carmeli 2012). Patients with ALS tend to have higher levels of oxidized glutathione (glutathione that has already been used to protect the body from free radicals) (Baillet 2010). Increased levels of glutathione can also protect neurons from degeneration in models of ALS (Vargas 2008). Interestingly, cell culture models have shown that ALS is associated with reduced glutathione levels due to mitochondrial dysfunction, and that reduced glutathione levels can result in elevated levels of glutamate (D’Alessandro 2011). Along with being a glutathione precursor, NAC has antioxidant activity of its own. In animal models of ALS, NAC administration has been shown to decrease motor neuron loss, improve muscle mass, and increase survival time and motor performance (Andreassen 2000; Henderson 1996). In addition, NAC supplementation can help thin mucous secretions in the oral cavity which may make swallowing easier (Kuhnlein 2008). Green tea. Green tea contains high concentrations of catechins, flavonoids with strong antioxidant properties (Hu 2002). Green tea extract has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory properties as well (Hong 2000). One of these catechins known as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is of particular interest in the context of ALS. EGCG and other catechins may be able to protect neurons from a variety of diseases (Mandel 2008). EGCG has been found to protect cultures of motor neurons from death due to excessive levels of glutamate (Yu 2010). Motor neurons can also be protected from mitochondrial dysfunction with the addition of EGCG in culture (Schroeder 2009). EGCG can also bind to and inactivate iron, which may help protect motor neurons from the effects of ALS (Benkler 2010). Epidemiological data further supports the following role of tea in its potential protection of neurons: green tea consumption reduces the risk of neurodegenerative diseases (Mandel 2011) and people who drink tea may have a lower risk of developing ALS (Morozova 2008). Pycnogenol® is an extract of marine pine bark that includes procyanidins and phenolic acids (Packer 1999). It has been shown to have antioxidant properties (Packer 1999) as well as protective effects against glutamate excitotoxicity (Kobayashi 2000). Pycnogenol® is a common complementary therapy option among ALS patients (Cameron 2002). In addition, pycnogenol® increased the levels of SOD produced in an animal study (Kolacek 2010). Resveratrol is a powerful antioxidant found in red grape skins and Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum). Resveratrol has been found to suppress the influx of excitatory ions into some cell types which is associated with reduced glutamate-induced cell toxicity (Wu 2003). Another way resveratrol may target neurodegenerative diseases is by reducing oxidative stress, both on its own and by increasing the expression of SIRT1 (Sun 2010), a stress-response gene associated with longevity and protection against a number of cellular assaults. Although it is not known what role this gene plays in ALS, increasing SIRT1 expression via resveratrol administration helps protect motor neurons from ALS in cell culture (Kim 2007; Wang 2011). In addition, resveratrol can increase the activity of SOD in cells and protect them from apoptosis and oxidative stress (Yoon 2011). Adding the cerebrospinal fluid from ALS patients to rat motor neuron cell cultures causes the cultured cells to die. One of the intriguing aspects of resveratrol is that it can protect the motor neuron cell cultures from death which is something that riluzole, the only FDA approved drug for ALS, cannot do (Yanez 2011).

150,fish oil supplement dosage,OA_LLama,OA_LLama150,6,Fish oil is generally safe to take  but it's always best to follow the recommended daily allowance (RDA) on your specific product. The RDA for omega-3 fatty acids from a combination of food and supplement sources should not exceed 3 grams per day for healthy individuals or up to 4 grams per day for those with high triglycerides levels as directed by their doctor. However  some people may need less than this amount depending on factors such as age  weight  sex  dietary intake  etc.  so if you are unsure about how much to take  it's important that you speak with your physician before starting any new supplement regimen. Additionally  while most adults can tolerate fish oil supplements without issues  some individuals may experience side effects like nausea  diarrhea  or a 'fish burp' after taking them. If you have concerns or questions about your current dose  please consult your doctor.,"Going Herbal: Vitamins and Supplements for Multiple Sclerosis — — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic condition affecting the central nervous system (CNS). Its symptoms range from mild and intermittent to severe and permanently damaging. There’s currently no cure for MS, but many pharmaceutical and alternative treatments are available. Treatments for MS typically target the disease’s symptoms, as the cause of the disease isn’t known. The symptoms of MS stem from the breakdown of communication between the brain and the nerves. There are many symptoms of . Symptoms tend to become more severe as the disease progresses. a variety of sensations in the limbs, such as prickling, tingling, or numbness Certain treatments can be very effective in alleviating and even avoiding the unpleasant symptoms of MS. Before using any herbs, supplements, or alternative or complementary therapies to treat MS, discuss the benefits and risks with a healthcare provider. Although no drug or supplement can cure MS, some treatments may help people slow the disease’s progress. Other therapies can significantly reduce symptoms or prolong periods of remission. Around the world, people with MS use . turn to nonpharmaceutical treatments when Western medicine doesn’t work to improve their symptoms. Others decide to try these options when their healthcare provider makes a referral or when they hear about the promise of alternative treatments. Regardless of your reasons for seeking information on herbal and supplementary treatments for MS, always consult your healthcare provider before stopping prescribed medications or adding a new therapy to your treatment regimen. Some herbs, supplements, and alternative therapies can cause: The top herbs and supplements for MS (and what they offer) The following list doesn’t cover every available herbal or supplementary option for treating the symptoms of MS. Instead, the list offers a brief summary of the important information about each of the most common herbs and supplements that people with MS use. This is known by many names, including: Its berries, roots, and extracts are sometimes used for: Although into how ashwagandha can protect the brain has been promising, it’s not been studied well enough to know whether it can effectively treat multiple sclerosis or its symptoms. Chyawanprash is an herbal tonic commonly used in Ayurvedic medicine. Early animal studies indicate it may protect cognitive function by . Formal studies on humans are scarce. There’s not enough evidence to determine whether Chyawanprash is effective or helpful in managing MS symptoms. Gotu kola is a popular traditional medicine in Chinese and Ayurvedic history. It’s been promoted as an herb that can lengthen life and improve symptoms of eye diseases, swelling, inflammation, skin conditions, and fatigue. While for neuroprotection has shown promise, has been studied very little. Its actual impact on MS symptoms is unknown. It’s available in a wide variety of forms, and it’s generally considered safe in low doses. Renowned for its potential to improve memory and mental clarity, ginkgo has been used for a wide variety of ailments over the centuries. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), ginkgo extract or supplements are possibly effective for: It hasn’t been widely studied in individuals with MS, but ginkgo biloba by reducing inflammation and fatigue. Most people can safely take in supplement form, but it may interact with a wide variety of other medications and herbs. For this reason, it’s important to ask your healthcare provider before beginning the use of this supplement. This traditional Chinese medicine, used for its sedative properties for a variety of illnesses, is believed to soothe problems of the nervous system. Extracts from plants in the cannabis family have been studied for their role in reducing spasticity, neurodegeneration, and inflammation. Some practitioners believe that closely monitored use of specific members of this plant family can be for treating symptoms of MS, but its use in the clinical setting remains controversial.
