1,"What are the most common chronic diseases? What effects do chronic diseases have for the society and the individual?","Chronic diseases, also known as non-communicable diseases (NCDs), are long-lasting conditions that can cause significant health problems. Some of the most common chronic diseases include:

Cardiovascular disease - including heart attack, stroke, and high blood pressure
Diabetes mellitus - a condition characterized by high levels of sugar in the blood, often due to poor dietary choices or lack of physical activity
Cancer - a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth of cells
Chronic respiratory diseases - such as asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and lung cancer
Mental illnesses - including depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders
Arthritis - joint pain and inflammation caused by damage to cartilage and other tissues
Alzheimer's and other types of dementia - progressive brain disorders causing memory loss, confusion, and difficulty thinking and making decisions
Effects on Society:
The impact of chronic diseases on society is significant. They contribute significantly to the burden of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs, which affect individuals, families, communities, and entire countries. In many low-income countries, these diseases represent an increasing share of public spending on health care. According to WHO, NCDs account for more than 80% of deaths worldwide each year.

Effects on Individuals:
For individuals living with chronic diseases, the impact can be profound and far-reaching. These diseases can lead to reduced quality of life, decreased productivity, and financial stress. People may require frequent medical attention, medications, and hospitalization, all of which can be costly. The emotional toll of managing a chronic disease can also take its toll on individuals and their loved ones. Additionally, chronic diseases can impede social interaction and participation, further exacerbating feelings of isolation and loneliness.

In conclusion, chronic diseases are prevalent globally and can have severe effects on both societies and individuals. While prevention strategies are important in reducing the incidence of these diseases, early detection and effective treatment can help manage symptoms and improve outcomes. It is crucial for governments and policymakers to address the issue of chronic diseases through sustainable funding for research, education, and treatment programs, while encouraging behavioral changes at the individual level to promote better health practices and reduce risk factors for developing chronic diseases.",1

22,"my risk for developing type 2 diabetes","Type II diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder that affects the way your body processes glucose (blood sugar). There are several factors that can increase your risk of developing this condition, including:

1. Genetics: If you have close relatives with type 2 diabetes or if there is a history of the disease in your family, you may be at increased risk.
2. Obesity: Being overweight or obese increases your risk of insulin resistance and high blood sugar levels, which are hallmarks of type 2 diabetes.
3. Inactivity: Leading an sedentary lifestyle contributes to obesity, but also decreases insulin sensitivity independently of weight gain.
4. Diet: A diet that's high in calories, saturated fat, trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, refined carbohydrates, added sugars, alcohol consumption, processed foods, and low in fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants can lead to obesity, inflammation, oxidative stress, and other health issues that raise one's risk of diabetes.
5. Age: The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases as you get older, especially after age 45. This is because the ability to process glucose efficiently declines as we age.
6. Family History: As previously mentioned, having close relatives with the disease raises the risk significantly.",1
35,"Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?","The KETO/Keto Diet can be beneficial to some, but not all individuals. To determine if the KETO/Keto Diet is right for you or your friends and family members who have Diabetes please consult a medical professional as well as a registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN).

The Keto Diet may help manage blood sugar levels for those who are insulin resistant due to obesity; however, it may cause harm in Type 2 diabetic patients.[3]
Individuals taking the medication SGLT-2 Inhibitors should avoid the KETO/Keto Diet since these drugs work by blocking the reabsorption of glucose into the bloodstream via the kidneys which could lead to hypoglycemia or low blood sugar.[4][5]
Another study found that participants experienced a significant decrease in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels after following the Keto Diet compared to other Diabetic meal plans.[6]
Please remember these results do not reflect every individual's health outcome and should only serve as guidance when making informed decisions about one's health along with support from medical professionals.

45,"Can diabetes be cured?","The causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are not well understood, but current research suggests that it is a complex neurodevelopmental condition caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There is currently no single 'cure' for ASD, as the symptoms can vary greatly from person to person.

However, there are treatments available that can help manage some of the symptoms associated with ASD, such as behavior therapy, medication, and educational interventions. These approaches aim to improve communication skills, social functioning, and daily living abilities in individuals with ASD. Additionally, early diagnosis and intensive treatment during childhood may lead to significant improvements over time, although more research is needed on long-term outcomes. It's important for people with ASD to work closely with healthcare professionals to develop an individualized plan for managing their symptoms and improving their quality of life.",1
51,"What is holistic medicine and what does it include?","Holistic Medicine, also known as Integrative or Complementary Medicine, combines conventional (Western) medical practices with alternative therapies to promote healing. It emphasizes the whole person rather than just treating specific symptoms or diseases.

Holistic Medicine includes a wide range of approaches including:
- Acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine
- Ayurveda from India
- Herbal remedies
- Mind-body interventions such as meditation and yoga
- Nutrition
- Exercise
- Lifestyle changes and stress reduction techniques 
These are used alongside modern medical treatments in order to address underlying causes of illness, promote natural healing processes, enhance quality of life and prevent disease.",1
52,"What are the most common mental health problems? How can I prevent or manage the most common mental health problems?","Common mental health issues include anxiety, depression and OCD. Anxiety is often treated with therapy, as well as medications like benzodiazepenes (such as Xanax) or antidepressants (such as Prozac). Depression is typically treated using therapy, as well as antidepressant drugs such as fluoxetine.
For many people, their mental health may be impacted by factors in their environment that cause them stress. In these cases, it's important to identify those sources of stress and work towards reducing or eliminating them if possible. This could mean finding a new job or moving out of an undesirable living situation, for example.
Exercise is also believed to have benefits for the brain, and can help reduce symptoms of certain mental disorders.
When facing difficult situations, practicing mindfulness techniques can improve your ability to cope and maintain good mental health. Some simple examples of this include meditation or deep breathing exercises which might focus you on the present moment instead of worrying about things outside of your control or dwelling over past events. It is not uncommon to struggle with mental health at some point in life; seeking support from friends and family, or professionals such as counselors, psychiatrists, or therapists can provide additional tools to help address mental health challenges and make positive changes in one's life. Making sure that you prioritize taking care of yourself physically - getting enough sleep, eating nutritious meals, etc. - will better enable you to handle whatever comes up emotionally.",1

54,"What does multiple sclerosis diagnosis include? What does it change?","Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic disease of the central nervous system. It affects young adults and can be disabling over time. The most common symptoms include fatigue, vision problems, tremors and muscle weakness. There are many different types of MS which makes it difficult to diagnose. To confirm MS you will need an MRI scan as well as other diagnostics like blood work and spinal taps (Lumbar Puncture). Once confirmed there are many drugs that slow down progression and help manage symptoms. If not treated or managed properly it can lead to permanent damage to your body like paralysis or blindness",1
55,"How to manage multiple sclerosis?","Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic and often disabling disease of the central nervous system that affects about 2.5 million people worldwide. The condition causes damage to nerve fibres in the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves due to inflammation and scarring (sclerosis).
There are different types of MS including relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). While there’s no cure for MS yet, early treatment can help prevent or delay some of the physical problems caused by MS attacks.
Here's how you can best manage your health with this condition:
1. Get professional medical advice: Your doctor will be able to give you personalised recommendations on treatments and lifestyle changes based on your symptoms. They may also refer you to other specialists like physiotherapists, occupational therapists or speech pathologists. Make sure to attend all your appointments and ask as many questions as possible.

2. Monitor your MS: Keep track of any new symptoms or worsening old ones using an MS journal. This information will come handy when discussing treatment options with your neurologist. You could also use mobile apps like MyMSTeam which tracks symptoms and provides tools for managing medications, exercise schedules etc.
3. Adhere strictly to prescribed medications: Drugs used to treat MS work by altering the immune response within the body. It’s essential to take them exactly as directed by your doctor so that they remain effective. If you have trouble sticking to your drug regimen, talk to your pharmacist who might offer tips such as pill organizers or reminders via text message.
4. Exercise regularly: Regular activity helps strengthen muscles and improve balance reducing your chances of falls. Low impact exercises like swimming, yoga or cycling would be more comfortable for most people with MS. Start slow and gradually increase intensity over time.
5. Maintain a healthy diet: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health. Foods high in unsaturated fats like omega-3 fatty acids found in fish might even help reduce inflammation associated with MS. Consult a nutritionist if necessary.
6. Manage stress levels: Stress can trigger MS symptoms or make existing ones worse. Practice relaxation techniques like meditation, deep breathing exercises or yoga to keep calm during challenging times. Additionally, get enough sleep every night as lack of it heightens stress responses in the body.
7. Join support groups: Finding others going through similar experiences is helpful for mental wellbeing. Ask your neurologist or search online for local MS support group meetings near you. Connecting with peers reduces feelings of isolation and increases motivation towards self-care efforts.
8. Stay informed: Knowledge is power! Learn everything you can about MS from reputable sources like the National Multiple Sclerosis Society website or the International Progressive Alliance. Understanding what MS is and its effects makes decision making around care easier.",1

2. Deliberation and decision to change
3. Preparation and implementation of change plan
4. Maintenance of new behavior or identity
5. Termination/relapse if maintenance fails.

This model is used in psychotherapy, education, and organizational development to help individuals identify where they are on the continuum of readiness for change and develop a personalized strategy for achieving their goals.",1
58,"Risk to develop multiple sclerosis","There are several risk factors that can increase a person's chances of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). Some of the most common ones include:

* Age: MS is more common in people who are older, with peak onset occurring between 20 and 50 years old.
* Genetics: Having a family member with MS increases your risk of developing the condition.
* Gender: Women are at higher risk for MS than men.
* Environmental exposures: Certain viral or bacterial infections may trigger MS, as well as living far from the equator, which could be related to vitamin D deficiency.
* Autoimmune diseases: People with other autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or inflammatory bowel disease have an increased risk of developing MS.
* Smoking: Smokers are at greater risk of getting MS and progressing more quickly once they have it.

It's important to note that having these risk factors does not necessarily mean you will get MS. Conversely, if you don't have any known risks factors, you still might develop the disease. If you suspect you may have symptoms of MS, it's essential to speak with your doctor about further evaluation and potential diagnosis.",1

62,"disclosing multiple sclerosis at work,  how will colleagues react?","It is difficult to predict exactly how your colleagues will react when you disclose a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) at work. Some may be understanding and supportive, while others may have negative or uninformed attitudes towards the condition.

It's important for you to consider how much information about your MS you want to share with your coworkers, as well as what impact this could have on your job duties or working relationships. You may choose to provide only basic information about your symptoms and treatment plan, or you may feel more comfortable sharing details about your diagnosis in order to educate others about MS.

Regardless of their reactions, it can help to have a clear idea of your own needs and boundaries around discussing your health at work. This might include establishing communication preferences with your employer, such as setting up regular check-ins or designating someone to act as a point person for any questions or concerns related to your health.

If you are concerned about potential discrimination or other adverse effects on your job due to your MS diagnosis, you may wish to consult with an employment lawyer or seek guidance from a disability rights organization in your area. They can offer advice on navigating legal protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), negotiating reasonable accommodations with your employer, and advocating for yourself within the workplace.",1
63,"Will multiple sclerosis affect my career?","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) can have an impact on your career, but it depends on various factors such as the severity of the disease and how well you manage your symptoms. Some people with MS are able to continue working for many years without significant disruptions, while others may need to make adjustments or even stop working altogether.

It is important to discuss any concerns about work with your healthcare team and employer. They can help assess your abilities and provide support to accommodate any limitations that arise due to your condition. This might include flexible hours, modified tasks, or adaptive equipment. Additionally, there are resources available through government programs, non-profit organizations, and other sources that can assist with vocational counseling, job training, and financial assistance. It's also crucial to prioritize self-care and maintain a positive outlook, focusing on what activities you can still do rather than those you can no longer pursue. With proper management and support, living with MS does not necessarily mean giving up your career goals and aspirations.",1
68,"List of multiple sclerosis symptoms","Common symptoms include:
-Vision problems, such as double or blurry vision
-Problems with balance and coordination (ataaxia)
-Tingling sensations in the limbs (paraesthesias)
-Muscle spasms, stiffness, and weakness
-Fatigue
-Bladder and bowel issues
-Difficulty walking or standing up straight
-Speech problems and swallowing difficulties
-Cognitive impairment, including difficulty concentrating, memory loss, and confusion
Note that these are common symptoms. The severity and specifics vary greatly between people and stages of the disease. If you suspect you have MS, consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment options.",1
72,"Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe for people taking multiple sclerosis drugs?","Yes, the Covid-19 vaccines are considered safe for individuals who take medications to treat multiple sclerosis (MS). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone aged 6 months and older receive a COVID-19 vaccine if they haven't already been infected with or had COVID-19.

It is important for individuals who have MS to speak with their healthcare provider about any concerns regarding potential risks associated with receiving the vaccine. However, there is no evidence that suggests that getting vaccinated against COVID-19 will worsen symptoms of MS or interact negatively with disease-modifying therapies used to manage MS. In fact, getting vaccinated can help prevent serious complications from COVID-19 infection which could potentially worsen MS symptoms. Additionally, it is essential for individuals with MS to maintain good vaccination rates within their community to reduce transmission of COVID-19 to vulnerable populations such as those living with disabilities like MS.",1
77,"How do menopause symptoms relate to multiple sclerosis symptoms?","Menopausal symptoms and MS symptoms can be similar or even the same.  The most common ones include:
1) Fatigue - This is a primary symptom of both conditions.  In menopause, it's often due to hormonal changes while in MS, fatigue may come from several factors such as muscle weakness and spasticity.  
2) Cognitive difficulties - Both MSers and women going through menopause have experienced memory issues.  Some say they feel like their brain has turned into mush during these times.  These cognitive challenges also affect our ability to focus, concentrate and learn new things which makes work very difficult.  
3) Muscles Weakness - Women experiencing menopause report feeling weaker overall compared to premenopausal years while those with MS experience more pronounced muscle weakness that comes on suddenly but then goes away after resting for an extended period of time (typically overnight).
4) Spasms/Stiffness - Stretching your legs before getting out of bed or standing up too fast usually results in some sort of muscle reaction whether you have MS or are post-menopausal.  
5) Bladder problems - If you’re experiencing bladder issues, it could indicate either of these two things – however, if you also experience bowel problems along with the urinary issues, chances are good you might have Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalitis (PML), a rare but deadly complication of MS.
6) Vision Issues - Double vision or trouble seeing at night can point towards both menopause AND relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis where optic neuritis causes temporary blindness in one eye.  
7) Depression - Whether from being tired all the time or because life isn’t what was expected, depression is quite common during perimenopause and among people living with Multiple Sclerosis.",1
79,"Can I pass multiple sclerosis to other family members?","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. While there may be a genetic component to MS, it is not inherited in the same way as traits such as eye color or height.

While having a close relative with MS can increase your risk of developing the condition, it does not mean you will definitely develop MS yourself. Additionally, even if you have MS, your relatives are unlikely to develop the disease solely because they are related to you. The exact cause of MS is still unknown and more research is needed to understand how genetics play a role. If you have concerns about your risk for developing MS based on your family history, it's best to talk to your doctor who can provide personalized information and guidance.",1
81,"Can I work and study full-time with multiple sclerosis?","Yes, it is possible to work and study full-time with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the severity of symptoms can vary greatly from person to person. Some people may be able to continue working or studying without any major modifications, while others may need accommodations such as flexible schedules, modified assignments, or assistive technology.

It's important for individuals with MS to communicate their needs to their employer or educational institution in order to receive support and make necessary adjustments. Additionally, there are resources available through organizations like the National Multiple Sclerosis Society that provide information on legal rights at work, financial planning, and other topics related to living with MS. It may also be helpful to speak with a healthcare professional about treatment options that can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.",1
83,"Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?","An exacerbation or 'relapse' of MS is when there are new symptoms, worsening symptoms, or both. It's common for people with relapsing-remitting MS to have periods where their disease activity increases and they have more frequent attacks (also known as flare-ups).
It can be helpful to see your healthcare provider if you think that you may be having an attack so that you can discuss treatment options early on. If it is an acute attack then corticosteroids like Solu-Medrol would be administered intravenously over the course of five days in the hospital, this will speed up recovery from the attack. You should call 911 immediately though if you experience any sudden weakness in arms or legs along with loss of bladder or bowel control or vision changes; these could all be signs of a serious medical emergency.
Early intervention and proper management by healthcare professionals has been shown to help reduce the severity and duration of attacks and also increase the chances of full recovery after each one.",1

86,"Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis","I'm sorry, but 'secondary' is not a recognized term in the context of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is typically described as either relapsing-remitting MS or primary progressive MS. There are also several other forms of MS with different characteristics and courses of progression. If you have been diagnosed with a form of MS and are looking for more information on your specific situation, it may be helpful to consult with your healthcare provider who can provide you with personalized guidance based on your unique medical history and symptoms.",1
92,"causes of fatigue in MS","I apologize if my previous response was not helpful. Here is a more detailed answer to your question:

The `using` statement is used to ensure that the resources it declares are properly disposed or released after they are no longer needed by the program. It does this by calling the appropriate method on each resource, such as `Dispose()` for IDisposable types and `Clear()` for arrays. This helps prevent memory leaks and other issues caused by leaving unmanaged resources open unnecessarily.

In terms of the code you provided, the two using statements declare a local variable called 'reader' inside their block of code. The first one uses an instance of the StreamReader class, which implements IDisposable, while the second one uses a byte array. Neither of these resources need to be explicitly disposed because they are both stack-allocated variables, meaning they will automatically become eligible for garbage collection when they go out of scope at the end of the block.

However, there could still be some benefit to including the using statements even though they aren't strictly necessary. By doing so, you make clear that the resources should only exist within the scope of those blocks, which can help with readability and maintainability. Additionally, if the actual implementation of the reader changes later (e.g., to use a FileStream instead), you may want to use the same pattern consistently across all parts of the codebase to avoid having to manually dispose of the file handle elsewhere.

I hope this explanation better answers your questions! If you have any further concerns, feel free to ask.",1
93,"Does multiple sclerosis relate to sleeping problems and forgetfulness in older people?","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that affects both young and old individuals. While MS can cause sleep disturbances and cognitive changes such as memory loss or confusion, these symptoms are not necessarily related to aging itself but rather to the progression of the disease.

In some cases, age-related comorbidities like sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or depression may worsen preexisting sleep difficulties in older adults with MS. Additionally, certain medications used to manage MS symptoms could also contribute to sleep issues or cognitive impairment. It's crucial for healthcare providers to evaluate and address individual factors when managing sleep disorders and cognitive decline in older adults with MS.",1

Is there anything else you need help with?",1
96,"most efficient and sustainable diets","The answer to your question is complex, as it depends on many factors including the individual's health status, age, weight, gender, activity level, budget, ethnicity, religious beliefs and values.
It would be best for you to consult a registered dietitian who can create a personalized plan that takes all of these into account. They will take all these factors into consideration when recommending an eating plan and provide guidance on how to reach your goals in a safe and healthy way. In general, focus on whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, legumes and nuts and limit highly processed and sugary items. Additionally, make sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day.
In addition to making changes to your diet, incorporate regular physical activity into your daily routine and try to get enough sleep each night to help with weight loss and overall wellness. It may also be helpful to seek support from friends or family members or join a support group where you can share experiences and learn from others. Remember, change is not always easy but setting realistic goals and taking small steps towards them can lead to long-term success.",1
97,"benefits of physical activity","The term 'benefits' can have multiple meanings depending on the context. In general, it refers to advantages or positive outcomes that come from a particular action or situation.

In the context of physical fitness and exercise, there are several potential benefits:

1. Improved health: Regular physical activity has been shown to improve overall health by reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and depression. Exercise also helps maintain a healthy weight and improves muscular strength and endurance.
2. Better mental well-being: Physical activity has been linked to improved mood, reduced stress levels, increased self-esteem, and better cognitive function.
3. Enhanced athletic performance: For those who engage in sports or other high-performance activities, regular exercise can help build stronger muscles, increase speed and agility, and boost cardiovascular capacity.
4. Longer life expectancy: People who exercise regularly tend to live longer than sedentary individuals, due in part to the lower incidence of chronic illnesses associated with physical activity.
5. Better sleep: Engaging in moderate to vigorous exercise at least 150 minutes per week is known to improve sleep quality for most people. However, if you struggle to fall asleep after exercising close to bedtime, it may be best to avoid intense workouts late in the day.
6. Stronger bones: Weight-bearing exercise like running, jumping rope, and lifting weights stresses your skeleton which causes adaptations in the form of denser bone tissue, making them less prone to fractures. It's important not to overdo it though - excessive training without proper rest and recovery time could lead to injury or osteoporosis.
7. Higher resistance to common sicknesses: While this benefit applies primarily to short episodes of acute illness (like colds), being physically active generally leads to having fewer and milder illnesses throughout each year compared to living an inactive lifestyle. This makes sense when we consider that staying active supports strong immune system defenses through a variety of mechanisms including greater blood flow, enhancing white cell production, and reducing inflammation in our bodies.",1
98,"most common complications in pregnancy","Some of the most common complications that can occur during pregnancy include:

1. Gestational diabetes - a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy and can cause health problems for both mother and baby if left untreated.
2. Preeclampsia - a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high blood pressure, swelling, and other symptoms that can arise during pregnancy or after delivery.
3. Preterm labor - when contractions begin before 37 weeks gestation, which can lead to premature birth and potential health issues for the baby.
4. Pregnancy complications such as placenta previa, abruptio placentae, and chorioamniotis.
5. Anemia - low levels of red blood cells due to increased demand from the growing fetus, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
6. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) - these are more common during pregnancy due to changes in urine flow and an increased risk of bacterial infection.
7. Varicose veins - bulging veins caused by increased pressure on leg veins from the growing uterus, which can be painful and unsightly but typically not harmful.
8. Hemorrhoids - another common side effect of pregnancy is enlarged veins in the rectum and anus, causing bleeding and discomfort during bowel movements.
9. Mood changes - hormonal fluctuations can contribute to mood swings, anxiety, depression, and irritability during pregnancy.

It's important for women to monitor their health closely during pregnancy and seek medical attention immediately if they experience any concerning symptoms. Regular prenatal care appointments with a healthcare provider can help identify potential complications early on and ensure appropriate treatment plans are put into place.",1

107,"medication adhd anxiety","1. Start by finding a therapist who specializes in treating ADHD and anxiety using evidence-based approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). You can search for licensed professionals online, or ask your primary care physician for referrals to local providers.
2. Your therapist will work with you to develop strategies that help manage both ADHD symptoms and feelings of anxiety. They may teach you coping mechanisms, time management techniques, organizational skills, stress reduction methods, and other problem-solving tools to improve daily functioning.
3. It is also important to maintain good communication with your healthcare provider about any changes in mood or symptoms related to the ADHD or anxiety. This way they can adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Apart from professional help it's essential to have self-care habits, like getting regular exercise, eating well, practicing mindfulness or meditation, setting realistic goals, and seeking support from friends and family when needed.
5. In addition to talk therapy, your doctor may prescribe medications that address the unique challenges associated with managing both conditions together. For example:
* Stimulants (such as Ritalin) are often used to treat ADHD symptoms while also reducing anxious thoughts and feelings.

It sounds like your doctor has prescribed a medication called Advair Diskus for you to use as part of your treatment plan. Advair Diskus contains two different types of medications: fluticasone propionate (a corticosteroid) and salmeterol xinafoate (a long-acting beta agonist). These medications work together to help reduce inflammation in the lungs and relax the muscles around the airways, making it easier to breathe.

It is important to follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider regarding how to take your medication, including how often to use it, when to take it, and how many puffs or doses per day are recommended. Make sure to also discuss any concerns or questions you may have about your treatment plan with your healthcare provider. They can provide guidance on managing side effects and adjusting your treatment if needed. Additionally, there are other treatments available for asthma such as bronchodilators, rescue inhalers, and allergy shots which might be helpful depending on severity of the disease.

In addition to taking medication, there are several lifestyle changes that can help manage asthma symptoms. Avoiding triggers such as smoke exposure, exercise regularly and maintain good nutrition and weight, get vaccinated every year, etc. Your healthcare professional will be able to guide you more on this aspect.

Here are some common symptoms associated with BPD:

1. Unstable mood and relationships: People with BPD may experience rapid changes in their mood that can last for hours or days. They may also have difficulties maintaining stable personal relationships due to their extreme emotional reactions.
2. Impulsivity: Individuals with BPD often engage in risky behaviors without considering the potential consequences. This includes spending sprees, reckless driving, unsafe sex, and substance abuse.
3. Intense emotions: People with BPD tend to feel emotions more deeply than others, which can make them feel overwhelmed and lead to outbursts of anger or tears.
4. Fear of abandonment: Those with BPD have an intense fear of being left alone or rejected by important people in their lives, causing anxiety and depression.
5. Self-destructive behavior: Some individuals with BPD harm themselves through cutting, burning, or other forms of self-injury as a way to cope with negative emotions.
6. Empty feeling or boredom: Many people with BPD feel empty inside and struggle to find meaning and purpose in life. This can result in periods of intense boredom or feelings of dissatisfaction.
7. Poor self-image: Individuals with BPD typically have low self-esteem and may view themselves as unworthy, flawed, or undesirable.
8. Suicide attempts or threats: Due to the instability and pain caused by their disorder, many people with BPD have thoughts about ending their own lives or express intent to do so during times of crisis.
9. Substance abuse: Alcohol or drug use is common among those with BPD as they try to cope with difficult emotions or situations. However, this can exacerbate existing symptoms and create new ones.

116,"outcome prostate cancer","I'm sorry to hear that you have a family history of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer in men, but it can often be successfully treated if detected early.

The good news is that there are several options available for screening and diagnosing prostate cancer, including:

1. Digital rectal exam (DRE): This procedure involves inserting a gloved finger into the rectum to feel for any abnormalities or lumps on the prostate gland. While this method has its limitations, it can still detect some tumors that might not show up on other tests.
2. PSA test: The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test measures the amount of a protein produced by both cancerous and noncancerous prostate cells. Elevated levels of PSA may indicate the presence of prostate cancer, although it could also mean something else is going wrong inside your body. Your doctor will likely order regular PSA tests if they suspect an issue with your prostate health.
3. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS): TRUS uses high frequency sound waves to create images of the prostate from different angles. Your doctor can use these visuals during a biopsy to take samples of suspicious tissue for analysis under a microscope.
4. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI scans use magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of internal organs, including the prostate. If used alongside a traditional DRE and PSA test, MRI can improve detection accuracy when compared against standard methods alone. However, using MRI as a standalone diagnostic tool remains controversial because of its expense and potential overdiagnosis risks.
5. Genetic testing: As part of your comprehensive evaluation, your physician may ask about your family medical history to assess whether genetics play a role in your risk. Certain inherited mutations can increase your chances of developing aggressive prostate cancer at a young age. If necessary, your doctor may refer you to a genetic counselor who specializes in evaluating hereditary conditions associated wit",1

The outcome for Stage IV metastatic lung cancer can vary greatly depending on the specifics of each case, including factors such as the size and location of the tumors, whether or not they are sensitive to certain treatments, and the overall health of the patient.

In general, though, Stage IV lung cancer is considered incurable and typically treated with a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and/or palliative care to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. While some patients may experience remission or even long-term survival, others may have more rapid progression of their disease and require hospice care. It's important for individuals with this diagnosis to work closely with their medical team to develop an appropriate treatment plan based on their individual needs and goals.",1
118,"stage 4 triple negative breast cancer treatment","Triple-negative breast cancers are those that do not express the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). As such, they do not respond to hormonal therapies like tamoxifen or trastuzumab. Treatment for TNBC typically involves chemotherapy, radiation and surgery as well as targeted therapies like poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors. The goal of treatment is usually a combination approach aimed at killing off tumor cells and shrinking any existing tumors before surgical intervention with an eye towards preventing recurrence.

Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy drugs kill rapidly dividing cancer cells by attacking their DNA. This makes them very effective against many forms of breast cancer including TNBCs which tend to divide more frequently than other types of breast cancer cells. Common first line chemotherapeutic agents include gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, cisplatin, fluorouracil and irinotecan hydrochloride.[1] Second generation HER2 targeting agents like lapatinib and afatinib may also be used if the tumor tests positive for HER2 mutations or amplification even though it does not overexpress the protein on its cell membrane.

Radiation Therapy: Radiotherapy uses high energy ionizing radiation to damage the DNA of cancerous cells which kills them when done correctly. It is often used after mastectomy but has no effect on micro metastatic disease elsewhere in the body. For locally advanced TNBCs it may be given concurrently with chemotherapy rather than waiting until after. While radiotherapy has been shown to have limited efficacy[6][7] in increasing overall survival for early stages of invasive ductal carcinoma,[8] it remains part of standard practice following lumpectomies because it reduces local recurrences significantly regardless of stage.[9][10] In cases where axillary lymph nodes were removed previously during a biopsy or earlier surgery, additional postoperative radiotherapy directed at the affected arm is sometimes recommended.[11]

119,"best pillow neck pain","Here are a few potential reasons why you may be experiencing chronic pain in your right shoulder and arm:

1. Muscle imbalances or poor posture: If the muscles in your back, shoulders, and chest are weaker than those in your arms and hands, it can cause strain on the muscles in your upper body and lead to pain over time. Additionally, if you have poor posture or sit for long periods of time with your shoulders hunched forward, this can put stress on the muscles and joints in your upper body and contribute to pain.
2. Overuse injuries: Repetitive motions such as typing, writing, painting, playing sports, or lifting weights can lead to inflammation and injury in the muscles and tendons of your upper body. This can result in pain that persists even after you stop engaging in these activities.
3. Joint problems: Pain in the shoulder and arm could also be caused by issues with the joint itself, such as arthritis, bursitis, or rotator cuff tears. These conditions can cause pain and stiffness in the affected area and make it difficult to perform normal daily tasks without discomfort.
4. Nerve damage or compression: The nerves running through your upper body can become damaged or compressed due to trauma, repetitive movements, or other factors. This can cause numbness, tingling, and pain in your arm and shoulder.
5. Stress and anxiety: While not strictly physical causes, mental health concerns like stress and anxiety can manifest themselves physically in the form of tension and pain in the body. Chronic stress can cause tightening in the muscles, including those in the upper body.
6. Other medical conditions: A variety of underlying medical conditions can also cause persistent pain in the right shoulder and arm. For example, thyroid dysfunction, diabetes, fibromyalgia, or cardiovascular disease can all present with symptoms similar to what you're describing.

2. How do eyeglass frames differ from sunglass frames?
Eyeglass frames and sunglass frames have some similarities but also several differences. Both types of frames typically consist of two rectangular pieces of metal or plastic that fit over the ears and hold the lenses in place. However, there are key differences:
* Materials: Eyeglass frames tend to be made of materials like metals, plastics, or a combination of both, while sunglass frames often use materials designed specifically for blocking UV rays, such as polycarbonate or other high-impact polymers.
* Lenses: The most significant difference between eyeglass frames and sunglass frames is their purpose. Eyeglass frames house corrective lenses that improve visual acuity, whereas sunglass frames contain polarized or tinted lenses that provide protection against harmful ultraviolet radiation.
3. What determines the cost of eyeglass frames?
The price of eyeglass frames depends on various factors:
1. Material used - Higher quality and durable materials will increase costs. Frames made of titanium or stainless steel tend to be pricier than those made of regular metal alloys or plastic.
2. Brand name and design features - Popular brands may charge extra money due to higher advertising expenses and market demand. Special designs with unique features or customization options might also drive up prices.
3. Frame size & complexity - Larger or more complex shapes require more material and labor during production, resulting in increased costs. Additionally, progressive lenses or special coatings might add to the final bill.
4. Demand and availability - Limited edition collections or exclusive designer lines usually come at premium prices due to exclusivity and limited supply. Conversely, standard styles found in mass production could sell cheaper since manufacturers benefit from economies of scale.
5. Are eyeglass frames adjustable? How?
Yes, many eyeglass frames offer adjustments to ensure comfortable wear and secure positioning of lenses. Here's how you can adjust your eyeglass frames:
1. Nose pads: Adjust the nose pads if they slide around too much or cause discomfort. You can screw them backward (closer to the frame front) or forward (toward your face). If this doesn't solve any issues, try replacing the pads altogether.
1. Temple arms/bendables: Flexible temple pieces, known as 'bendables' or 'flex hinges,' can be bent to better wrap around the ear. Non-adjustable metal or plastic temples should match the shape of the arch for maximum stability. Note that these areas should not be twisted or bent beyond safe limits.
6. Bridge adjustment: Some frames include movable bridge elements connecting the two lenses. Depending on facial structure, tilting the bridge slightly upwards or downwards could make wearing more comfortable or reduce slipping. Your optician can assist with making bridge adjustments.",1

Primary Stage:

* Sores or rashes on the genitals and/or other areas of the body
* Fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue. These symptoms are not specific and could be caused by other conditions as well.
* If left untreated, primary syphilis can lead to secondary syphilis within 1-3 months after the initial infection. This second stage of syphilis often involves a skin rash on various parts of the body, fever, and sore throat. Other symptoms include weight loss, hair loss, joint pain, headaches, and swollen lymph glands. Some people with secondary syphilis also develop lesions inside their mouths, called mucous patches.

Tertiary Syphilis (also known as latent syphilis):
This is the most dangerous form of the disease as it can cause damage to organs such as the heart and blood vessels, brain and nervous system, eyes, ears, and bones. People at this stage usually do not have any visible signs or symptoms, but they continue to carry the infection which makes them infectious to others through sexual contact. Tertiary syphilis can occur anywhere between two years up to several decades after the initial infection if left untreated.

Late Latent Syphilis: In some cases, tertiary syphilis can progress into late latent syphilis, where the individual experiences no symptoms for many years before eventually developing serious health problems due to organ damage. At this point, syphilis has likely affected multiple organs including the brain, spinal cord, heart, liver, kidneys, and other bodily systems. Late latent syphilis typically occurs more than ten years after the initial infection.

Neurosyphilis: A type of tertiary syphilis that affects the central nervous system leading to meningitis, dementia, seizures, blindness, hearing loss, and other severe neurological issues.
