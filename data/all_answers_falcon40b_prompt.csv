57,"multiple sclerosis stages phases"," Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). The symptoms of MS can vary widely depending on which areas of the CNS have been affected by inflammation or demyelination. There are four main types of MS based on how they manifest clinically: 

1. Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS): This type of MS typically manifests as periods of relapse followed by remission in between attacks. It is characterized by sudden attacks of neurological symptoms such as weakness, numbness, balance problems, blurred vision, fatigue, and even paralysis. These episodes usually last for days or weeks before going into remission where there may be no noticeable signs of illness until the next episode occurs. In this stage, the immune system is still attacking myelin sheaths causing damage to nerve cells, but it's not permanent so there may be some remissions.

2. Secondary progressive MS (SPMS): Once RRMS progresses, patients enter what's called secondary progressive MS. SPMS has fewer relapses than RRMS but instead shows steady progression of disability without recovery periods. Over time, people with SPMS will experience worsening mobility issues, cognitive decline, bladder dysfunction, and spasticity. At this point, the damage caused during previous flare-ups becomes more severe and irreversible, leading to permanent disabilities.

3. Primary progressive MS (PPMS): PPMS accounts for around 15% of all cases. Unlike RRMS and SPMS, this form doesn't follow a pattern of relapses and remissions, instead showing gradual and continuous neurologic deterioration from onset. People with PPMS may have symptoms like those seen in RRMS at diagnosis, but over time their condition worsens steadily rather than having exacerbations interspersed with periods of stability.

4. Progressive relapsing MS (PRMS): PRMS is the rarest form of MS, accounting for only about 5% of diagnoses. As its name suggests, it combines both features of PPMS and RRMS. It starts out as an aggressive form of RRMS, but then evolves into a more slowly progressing form of the disease similar to PPMS. Symptoms include muscle weakness, sensory changes, and cognitive impairment.</s>

141,"sores in mouth herpes"," Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the most common cause of recurrent cold sores or fever blisters on or around the lips and mouth. Cold sores usually occur as single lesions that last for several days before crusting over and healing within two weeks. They can be very painful and itchy, but do not pose any serious health risks. The first outbreak of cold sores may appear after an individual has been infected with HSV type 1, either through contact with another person who already has the disease or from sharing personal items like razors or towels with someone else's open sore. However, once someone has had one episode of cold sores caused by the HSV type 1 virus, it stays dormant in their body and can reactivate at any time, especially during periods of stress or illness. This means that even if you have never had a cold sore before, there is still a chance you could develop them later on. To avoid getting cold sores, practice good hygiene habits such as washing your hands frequently, avoiding close physical contact with others when they have an active infection, and using lip balm with sunscreen protection to prevent chapped lips which can make them more susceptible to viral infections.</s>
