MyFitnessPal - a calorie tracker app that can help you track your food intake, exercise, and weight loss goals. It also has a feature to log glucose readings.  2. Fitbit - a wearable fitness tracker device with an accompanying app that tracks steps taken, distance covered, active minutes, calories burned, sleep, heart rate, and more. The app also allows users to set reminders to take medication or monitor their glucose levels throughout the day.  3. Lark DPP - A personalized digital Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) designed to help people reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes through healthy lifestyle changes such as increased physical activity.  4. Glucose Buddy - is a simple but powerful app that helps you keep track of your glucose levels, carbohydrate consumption, insulin injections, and other important information related to managing your diabetes.  5. Glooko - is another popular diabetes management app that syncs directly with various types of glucometers and continuous glucose monitors from major manufacturers like Dexcom and Abbott. Users can view trends over time and share data with caregivers if needed.  6. SugarWise - uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns and provide actionable recommendations based on the user's inputted meals and blood sugar measurements.  7. CarbMaster - a comprehensive app that provides detailed nutritional information about thousands of different food items, including serving sizes, macronutrient ratios, fiber content, and glycemic indices.  8. Blood Pressure Tracker - a dedicated app specifically geared towards monitoring blood pressure levels, complete with charts, graphs, and notifications for irregular readings.  9.

Genetic factors account to around 70-80% of the total risk, while being overweight accounts for another 15%. The remaining part is contributed by other environmental factors such as exercise habits and eating habits. Obese people who have a healthy lifestyle will still get Type 2 Diabetes but it will take longer compared to those who don't lead a healthier life style with similar BMI values. While this is generally true, there may be exceptions where even very thin or normal weighted people develop Type 2 Diabetes due to underlying hormonal disorders that affect metabolism.\",\n",

       "      <td>Nutrition The Keto Flu: Symptoms and How to Get Rid of It Written by Jillian Kubala, MS, RD on April 3, 2018 What It Is Symptoms How to get rid of it Why some people get it How Long It Lasts Who Should Avoid Keto Diets Bottom Line The ketogenic diet has gained popularity as a natural way to lose weight and improve health. The diet is very low in carbohydrates, high in fat and moderate in protein. While the diet is considered safe for most people, its associated with some unpleasant side effects. The keto flu, also called the carb flu, is a term coined by followers to describe the symptoms they experience when beginning the diet. This article investigates what the keto flu is, why it happens and how to ease its symptoms. What is the keto flu? The keto flu is a collection of symptoms experienced by some people when they first start the keto diet. These symptoms, which can feel similar to the flu, are caused by the body adapting to a new diet consisting of very little carbohydrates. Reducing your carb intake forces your body to burn ketones for energy instead of glucose. Ketones are byproducts of fat breakdown and become the main fuel source when following a ketogenic diet. Normally, fat is reserved as a secondary fuel source to use when glucose is not available. This switch to burning fat for energy is called ketosis. It occurs during specific circumstances, including starvation and fasting (1). However, ketosis can also be reached by adopting a very low-carb diet. In a ketogenic diet, carbohydrates are typically reduced to under 50 grams per day (2). This drastic reduction can come as a shock to the body and may cause withdrawal-like symptoms, similar to those experienced when weaning off an addictive substance like caffeine (3). Summary The keto flu is a term used to describe flu-like symptoms associated with beginning the very low-carb ketogenic diet. Symptoms Switching to a very low-carb diet is a major change, and your body may need time to adapt to this new wa</td>\n",

Top of the page Type 2 Diabetes: Can You Cure It? Topic Overview Can you \"\"reverse\"\" type 2 diabetes? Can you cure it? Diabetes can go into remission. When diabetes is in remission, you have no signs or symptoms of it. But your risk of relapse is higher than normal.footnote 1 That's why you make the same daily healthy choices that you do for active type 2 diabetes. Is there a cure for diabetes? There is no known cure for type 2 diabetes. But it can be controlled. And in some cases, it goes into remission. Keys to control For some people, a diabetes-healthy lifestyle is enough to control their blood sugar levels. That means losing weight if you are overweight, eating healthy foods, and being more active. But most people with type 2 diabetes also need to take one or more medicines or insulin. What is remission? Of those people who don't need diabetes medicine, some find that their diabetes does \"\"reverse\"\" with weight control, diabetes-healthy eating, and exercise. Their bodies are still able to make and use insulin, and their blood sugar levels go back to normal. Their diabetes is in remission. \"\"Complete remission\"\" is 1 year or more of normal A1c and fasting glucose levels without using diabetes medicine. When you have complete remission, you still get tested for high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and kidney and eye problems. You do regular foot</td>\n",

Hoehn Saric School of Medicine Research output: Contribution to journal  Article  peer-review Overview Fingerprint Abstract Psychotherapy is seen as a serie of cognitive emotional interactions between the patient and the therapist. The emotional impact of this interaction forms the basis of the patient therapist relationship, which provides the principal reinforcement in certain phases of therapy. The actual method of intervention depends on the training and the preference of the therapist, the condition of the patient, and the state of therapy. The emotional tone of the patient therapist relationship may vary from patient to patient, and also in the same patient during various states of therapy. Therapists generally aim to reduce anxiety and to clarify conditions, but often they have to temporarily provoke anxiety and disorganize their patients to modify the relationship and/or to induce a change of maladaptive attitudes. This paper outlines various techniques of interaction as they apply to psychotherapy in general, and their relative importance in various psychotherapies.

       "3   Nutrition The Keto Flu: Symptoms and How to Get Rid of It Written by Jillian Kubala, MS, RD on April 3, 2018 What It Is Symptoms How to get rid of it Why some people get it How Long It Lasts Who Should Avoid Keto Diets Bottom Line The ketogenic diet has gained popularity as a natural way to lose weight and improve health. The diet is very low in carbohydrates, high in fat and moderate in protein. While the diet is considered safe for most people, its associated with some unpleasant side effects. The keto flu, also called the carb flu, is a term coined by followers to describe the symptoms they experience when beginning the diet. This article investigates what the keto flu is, why it happens and how to ease its symptoms. What is the keto flu? The keto flu is a collection of symptoms experienced by some people when they first start the keto diet. These symptoms, which can feel similar to the flu, are caused by the body adapting to a new diet consisting of very little carbohydrates. Reducing your carb intake forces your body to burn ketones for energy instead of glucose. Ketones are byproducts of fat breakdown and become the main fuel source when following a ketogenic diet. Normally, fat is reserved as a secondary fuel source to use when glucose is not available. This switch to burning fat for energy is called ketosis. It occurs during specific circumstances, including starvation and fasting (1). However, ketosis can also be reached by adopting a very low-carb diet. In a ketogenic diet, carbohydrates are typically reduced to under 50 grams per day (2). This drastic reduction can come as a shock to the body and may cause withdrawal-like symptoms, similar to those experienced when weaning off an addictive substance like caffeine (3). Summary The keto flu is a term used to describe flu-like symptoms associated with beginning the very low-carb ketogenic diet. Symptoms Switching to a very low-carb diet is a major change, and your body may need time to adapt to this new wa   \n",

Top of the page Type 2 Diabetes: Can You Cure It? Topic Overview Can you \"\"reverse\"\" type 2 diabetes? Can you cure it? Diabetes can go into remission. When diabetes is in remission, you have no signs or symptoms of it. But your risk of relapse is higher than normal.footnote 1 That's why you make the same daily healthy choices that you do for active type 2 diabetes. Is there a cure for diabetes? There is no known cure for type 2 diabetes. But it can be controlled. And in some cases, it goes into remission. Keys to control For some people, a diabetes-healthy lifestyle is enough to control their blood sugar levels. That means losing weight if you are overweight, eating healthy foods, and being more active. But most people with type 2 diabetes also need to take one or more medicines or insulin. What is remission? Of those people who don't need diabetes medicine, some find that their diabetes does \"\"reverse\"\" with weight control, diabetes-healthy eating, and exercise. Their bodies are still able to make and use insulin, and their blood sugar levels go back to normal. Their diabetes is in remission. \"\"Complete remission\"\" is 1 year or more of normal A1c and fasting glucose levels without using diabetes medicine. When you have complete remission, you still get tested for high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and kidney and eye problems. You do regular foot   \n",

Hoehn Saric School of Medicine Research output: Contribution to journal  Article  peer-review Overview Fingerprint Abstract Psychotherapy is seen as a serie of cognitive emotional interactions between the patient and the therapist. The emotional impact of this interaction forms the basis of the patient therapist relationship, which provides the principal reinforcement in certain phases of therapy. The actual method of intervention depends on the training and the preference of the therapist, the condition of the patient, and the state of therapy. The emotional tone of the patient therapist relationship may vary from patient to patient, and also in the same patient during various states of therapy. Therapists generally aim to reduce anxiety and to clarify conditions, but often they have to temporarily provoke anxiety and disorganize their patients to modify the relationship and/or to induce a change of maladaptive attitudes. This paper outlines various techniques of interaction as they apply to psychotherapy in general, and their relative importance in various psychotherapies.
