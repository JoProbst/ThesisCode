A first attack of neurological symptoms in children with central nervous system (CNS) demyelination may represent a monophasic illness or be the first presentation of a chronic relapsing disorder such as multiple sclerosis (MS), a condition that is increasingly being recognized and diagnosed in childhood. Cranial, and possible spinal imaging, and lumbar puncture are key diagnostic tests. Acute management of demyelination usually involves initiation of corticosteroid therapy with IVIG, with plasma exchange required in severe cases. Once the diagnosis of MS is confirmed, immunomodulatory treatment should be initiated with the goal of reducing relapse rates and disability accrual. Safety and tolerability data support the use of these MS immunomodulatory therapies in pediatric MS. Neurological symptoms attributable to demyelination commonly include the following: Unilateral or bilateral visual loss (optic neuritis) Motor, sensory or urological deficits localizing to the spinal cord (transverse myelitis) Brainstem deficits (typically internuclear ophthalmoplegia or INO) Other monofocal or polyfocal neurological deficits Polyfocal neurological deficits with encephalopathy (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or ADEM) Optic neuritis should be considered in any child presenting with subacute monocular or binocular visual loss (see Figure 1). Ophthalmological features of optic neuritis typically include: Optic disc edema is sometimes seen, but may be absent in retrobulbar optic neuritis. Neurological abnormalities outside of the optic nerve may also be present. Neuroimaging, usually brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast, reveals optic nerve thickening and/or enhancement in approximately 55% of children (see Figure 2) and visual evoked potentials are abnormal in up to 88% of children. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), a non-invasive technique for measuring retinal nerve fiber thickness, may aid in diagnosis. Transverse myelitis should be considered in any child presenting with subacute onset of weakness and sensory deficits localizing to the spinal cord (see Figure 3). Typical symptoms of transverse myelitis include: Bilateral (may be asymmetric) lower extremity weakness Sensory paresthesias or hyperesthesias with a spinal sensory level L’Hermitte’s symptom (pain with forward neck flexion) indicating cervical spinal involvement Bowel or bladder dysfunction (lesions above the sacral cord cause urinary retention and constipation) While many children will experience partial TM, others may have complete cross-sectional cord involvement with clinical features of flaccid paresis with hyporeflexia and later hyperreflexia. Longitudinally-extensive transverse myelitis (spanning > 3 spinal segments) or transverse myelitis with concurrent or rapidly sequential optic neuritis should prompt consideration of neuromyelitis optica (see Figure 2). Of note, approximately 10% of children with MS have longitudinally-extensive spinal cord lesions. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) may be useful to confirm a spinal cord localization. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is defined by the presence of polyfocal neurological symptoms and signs with encephalopathy (either behavioral change or alteration in consciousness). Symptoms of ADEM are often preceded by a febrile illness or viral prodrome. ADEM may be the clinical manifestation of age-dependent demyelination as the majority of individuals with ADEM are under the age of 10 years. While ADEM is most commonly a monophasic illness, relapsing and multiphasic forms have been described. International consensus definitions for monophasic and relapsing forms of ADEM describe the clinical features and time course in detail. Typical brain MRI findings of ADEM are shown in Figure 4. Other presentations of acute demyelination include: Polyfocal neurological deficits without encephalopathy The cornerstone of MS diagnosis is demonstration of demyelination that is disseminated in both space and time. Specific consensus definitions have been proposed for childhood-onset MS requiring either (i) two discrete demyelinating attacks separated by at least 30 days and involving two separate areas of the CNS; (ii) one attack consistent with demyelination and MRI evidence of new lesions meeting criteria for dissemination in time (see below); or (iii) two non-ADEM attacks in a child with an initial ADEM presentation. As in adult-onset MS, MRI may be used as a surrogate marker for dissemination in space and time, facilitating earlier disease diagnosis. Specifically, new criteria proposed by Polman et al (2010) require that dissemination in space on MRI be defined as involvement of greater than or equal to one T2 lesion in at least two of the following four areas: i. periventricular ii. juxtacortical iii. infratentorial and iv. spinal cord with symptomatic brainstem or spinal cord symptoms not contributing towards the total lesion count. Dissemination in time may be fulfilled by demonstration of either: i. new T2 and/or gadolinium-enhancing spinal cord lesion(s) on follow-up MRI (irrespective of timing of baseline MRI) or ii. simultaneous presence of gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions. More than 95% of children with multiple sclerosis initially experience a relapsing-remitting disease course with reported relapse rates between 0.38 and 1.2 per year. Primary progressive disease (neurological deterioration in the absence of discrete relapses) is rare in the pediatric age group. Children with MS appear to experience more frequent relapses as compared to adult-onset MS patients in the first several years following diagnosis. The time from a first attack to a second neurological event is highly variable and may be greater in younger children. Childhood-onset MS patients may enter a secondary progressive phase, defined by disability progression in the absence of clear relapses, between 15 to 20 years following first attack. What other disease/condition shares some of these symptoms? Acutely, it is important to exclude central nervous system infection especially if neurological symptoms are accompanied by fever, encephalopathy, meningismus or other systemic signs. The combination of brain and/or spinal cord white matter abnormalities with multiple cranial neuropathies should raise suspicion of central nervous system Lyme disease (neuroborreliosis), especially if there has been recent travel to an endemic area or if a tick bite is recalled. While rare, malignancy, such as central nervous system lymphoma, should also be considered, particularly if MRI features are atypical for demyelination, or if spinal fluid examination reveals atypical cells. A history of persistent or increasingly frequent headache, seizures, or lumbar puncture evidence of an elevated opening pressure should prompt consideration of isolated CNS vasculitis or CNS vasculitis associated with systemic disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus). Children with CNS vaculitis usually respond to steroid therapy and experience an exacerbation of symptoms as steroids are tapered. Distinguishing vasculitis from MS has important therapeutic implications as vasculitis management requires long-term immunosuppression with medications such as cyclophosphamide. Neurological symptoms associated with renal or liver impairment, fever, lymphadenopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation should prompt consideration of macrophage activation syndrome. High serum ferritin and fasting triglycerides, unexpectedly low ESR, and the presence of hemophaocytic cells in a bone marrow aspirate or CSF are diagnostic. Repeated attacks of optic neuritis and transverse myelitis should raise suspicion of the diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica (NMO). The diagnosis of NMO is aided by testing for antibodies directed against Aquaporin 4. NMO is important to consider as the disease often has an aggressive course with rapid disability progression, requiring potent immunosuppressive agents to maintain disease control. See Figure 6. MS is thought to be a disease influenced by both genetic predisposing factors and environmental triggers of aberrant CNS directed autoimmunity. It is increasingly believed that MS predisposition is established during childhood, as evidenced by studies of immigrants to areas of high MS prevalence who acquire the MS risk of their new community only if they immigrated prior to age 15 years. What laboratory studies should you request to help confirm the diagnosis? How should you interpret the results? There is no laboratory test that can confirm MS diagnosis. The majority of laboratory evaluations are performed to exclude other conditions – a requirement prior to considering MS as the etiology of a patient’s clinical symptoms. However, several investigations are helpful in supporting an MS diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination is important in confirming the presence of CNS demyelination and for excluding other diagnoses. At first presentation, more that 50% of children with MS will have an elevated CSF leukocyte count, typically below 30 cells/microliter with a lymphocytic predominance. A higher leukocyte count or neutrophilic predominance should prompt consideration of CNS vasculitis, CNS infection, or NMO. CNS vasculitis is also often associated with an elevated opening pressure. CSF oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in CSF, but not detected in serum, may be found in up to 90% of childhood-onset MS patients at first presentation as compared to approximately 10% of children with ADEM or NMO. Isoelectric focusing methods have the highest diagnostic yield. It should be noted that MS patients may initially have undetectable CSF OCBs, but may develop them later in the disease course. Testing of visual, brainstem auditory, and visual evoked potentials is often useful for confirming the clinical demyelinating syndrome and for documenting subclinical disease. Almost 50% of children with MS in one study demonstrated subclinical abnormalities in at least one of these evoked potential pathways, most commonly visual. Visual evoked potentials are abnormal in over 85% of children with clinical optic neuritis. Would imaging studies be helpful? If so, which ones? Neuroimaging, especially brain and/or spinal MRI with contrast, is valuable in confirming the presence of inflammatory CNS lesions and in excluding other possible diagnoses. Lesion characteristics of younger children may differ from older children, with younger MS patients being more likely to have ill-defined brain MRI lesions and grey matter involvement. Large lesions with indistinct borders are typical for ADEM. One recent study suggested that the presence of two of the following MRI features may aid in distinguishing children with MS from those with ADEM with 81% sensitivity and 95% specificity: i. presence of T1 black holes ii. absence of diffuse bilateral pattern iii. presence of two or more periventricular lesions. MRI has now been incorporated into the diagnostic criteria for MS in children and adults and allows a diagnosis of MS even at first presentation if there is the simultaneous presence of gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions suggesting disease dissemination in time. Classification of Childhood Demyelinating Syndromes An algorithmic approach to the classification of childhood demyelination has been published (Banwell, Lancet Neurol 2007) and Yeh (Nature Reviews Neurol 2009 ). If you are able to confirm that the patient has Multiple Sclerosis, what treatment should be initiated? The care of children with MS revolves around management of acute relapses and longer-term immunomodulation with the goal of reducing relapse rates and disability accrual. The acute management of a first attack of demyelination or MS relapse usually relies on initiation of corticosteroid therapy. Doses in the range of 20-30 mg/kg IV per day (maximum 1 g per dose) for 3 to 5 days are typically used. Mild relapses that are not distressing to the patient and do not impair functioning may require supportive management, but not pharmacological therapy. Serum glucose, urine glucose, and blood pressure should be monitored during corticosteroid treatment. If children improve, with this initial course but have an incomplete resolution of symptoms, an oral prednisone taper starting at 1 mg/kg/day for 2-3 weeks could be considered. If children do not significantly improve or clinically worsen during the course of steroid therapy, evidence from published case series suggest that IVIG may be of benefit with a typical dose of 2 g/kg administered over 2 to 5 days. If symptoms of demyelination are severe and potentially life-threatening (for example, severe encephalopathy or respiratory depression), there is class I evidence in adult MS patients for the use of plasma exchange (PLEX), which is typically administered as 5 to 8 exchanges over 10 days. Class I evidence in adult-onset MS exists for the following therapies: interferon beta 1a, interferon beta 1b, and glatiramer acetate. Route of administration, doses, potential adverse effects, and associated laboratory abnormalities are summarized in Figure 5. While there have been no formal randomized-controlled trials of interferons or glatiramer acetate in children with MS, available case-series level evidence suggest that these treatments are safe and well-tolerated in childhood. Children who are receiving interferon treatments should have serum white blood cell counts and liver enzymes monitored monthly for the first 6 months and every 3 months thereafter. Thyroid function should be monitored yearly. Sexually active patients should be counselled regarding contraceptive use due to potential teratogenicity of some of these agents. Second-line therapies are offered to families if frequent relapses occur despite treatment with one of the first-line agents, or if treatment with these agents causes intolerable side effects. Cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, azahtioprine all have case-series level evidence to support their use in childhood MS. Case series have also recently been published reporting natalizumab use in pediatric MS patients. Fingolimod (FTY 720) has recently been licensed for use in adult-onset MS patients and increased efficacy and convenience of oral administration may make this an attractive therapeutic option for pediatric MS patients. The safety of this medication in children for whom the immune system is still maturing has not yet been definitively established and fingolimod does not have regulatory approval for use in children. Emerging therapies including cladribine, rituximab, alemtuzumab, dacluzumab, laquinimod and ocrelizumab also have the potential for improved efficacy and tolerabiltiy as compared to interferons or glatiramer acetate but the risks of life-threatening infection and malignancy must be carefully considered, especially for pediatric MS patients. What are the adverse effects associated with each treatment option? Corticosteroid therapy may be associated with the development of hypertension and hyperglycemia. Many children experience gastrointestinal irritation that can be reduced with use of H2 blocking agents. Agitation, mood disturbances, sleep disruption and personality changes are common in patients on high doses of corticosteroids, but typically resolve as doses are reduced. Longer-term use may be associated with osteopenia, weight gain, and adrenal suppression. Given that long-term (ie: more than 3 weeks) of corticosteroid therapy is not recommended and repeated monthly intravenous corticosteroids failed as a model for MS disease modulation, corticosteroids are reserved for acute relapse therapy. IVIG infusion may be associated with headache, nausea, flushing, back pain, and hyptotension. If any of these occurs during an infusion, the infusion rate may be slowed or the medication discontinued. Premedication with antihistamines or corticosteroids may be useful in preventing these symptoms. Rarely, IVIG may be associated with acute renal failure, cardiac failure, or thrombosis. Severe anaphylactic reactions have been described in patients with IgA deficiency. Aseptic meningitis is a well-described complication of IVIG administration. As in treatment with other blood products, transmission of infectious agents is possible. Treatment with PLEX may be associated with hypotension, pulmonary edema, metabolic alkalosis and electrolyte abnormalities (ex: hypocalcemia or hypokalemia) and therefore requires administration by a trained team of individuals and close monitoring. Anaphalaxis is rare but can occur as can significant hemorrhage (from heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) and infection. Side effects of commonly used first-line immunomodulatory therapies are summarized in Figure 5. What are the possible outcomes of Multiple Sclerosis? Almost 95% of children with MS experience a relapsing remitting course with attacks consisting of subacute onset of neurological symptoms separated by periods of relative disease quiescence. While recovery after an acute relapse is expected, residual deficits often perist. Persistent neurological deficits may significantly affect daily functioning. After a period of between 15 to 20 years, childhood-onset MS patients may enter a secondary progressive phase where there is disability accrual in the absence of discrete relapses. The goal of immunomodulatory treatment is to reduce relapse rate and long-term disabilty. The available first-line therapeutic agents have a similar efficacy in reducing relapse rates by approximately 18-30%. Medications differ in terms of route of administration, frequency of administration, and side effect profiles and therefore treatment choice must be individualized. Fatigue significant enough to limit daily activities and to affect school performance is experienced by up to 40% of children with MS. Non-pharmacological measures such as scheduling key activities for early in the day, and brief daytime napping may be sufficient for some MS patients, but pharmacological therapy is often required. Modafinil prescribed at a starting dose of 50 mg once daily and increased as needed up to 100 mg twice daily is often an effective pharmacological therapy. Childhood MS occurs during key academic years and ongoing CNS inflammation may interfere with learning and memory. Between 50- 70% of children with MS demonstrate evidence of cognitive impairment with formal testing. Cognitive impairment has been associated with younger age at first attack and longer disease duration. Impaired learning and scholastic difficulties have longer-term implications for global functioning and vocational choices. Children with MS may experience bowel and/or bladder dysfunction as well as sexual dysfunction. Mood disorders, most commonly depression, are often identified in pediatric MS patients. Health care practioners should be comfortable discussing these issues with adolescent patients. Childhood MS is being increasingly recognized and diagnosed. While the true incidence of pediatric MS remains to be precisely defined, it is estimated that 3-10% of all MS patients experience their first symptoms prior to the age of 18 years. Multiple sclerosis in both children and adults has been reported in many countries worldwide, but there is marked regional variation in MS prevalence. There is a well-described latitude gradient in MS, with greatest MS prevalence reported in countries further away (in either direction) from the equator. Early life place of residence appears to correlate with MS risk. A study of adult-onset MS patients demonstrated that immigration from areas of low reported MS prevalence (India and Pakistan) prior to the age of 15 years was associated with higher risk of being later diagnosed with MS as compared to immigration after age 15. A single center Canadian study of adult and childhood-onset MS patients showed that the two groups shared the common experience of having spent most of the childhood years in Canada, irrespective of self-reported familial ancestry. One of the factors that may explain regional variations in MS risk and especially the latitude gradient is sunlight exposure and consequent serum vitamin D status. Studies in adults have shown that MS risk is inversely related to daily oral vitamin D intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. A study of twins discordant for MS diagnosis showed that co-twins who reported higher sunlight exposure were less likely to subsequently develop MS. Risk of adult-onset MS is higher for individuals born in the spring as compared to the fall, suggesting that maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy may be an important determinant of MS risk. Both retrospective and prospective studies in children have shown that low serum 25(OH)D levels at first presentation are correlated with increased risk of MS diagnosis. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection has been implicated as a contributing factor to MS development in both children and adults. Three case-control studies in children have shown that children with MS more commonly demonstrate remote EBV seropositivity as compared to matched controls. One prospective Canadian study has shown EBV seropositivity at first attack of CNS demyelination to be more common in children later diagnosed with MS as compared to those individuals remaining monophasic. In seropositive individuals, antibody titres are also higher in children with MS as compared to controls. MS is more common in first-degree relatives of MS patients, as compared to the general population, and MS has a higher prevalence in monozygotic as opposed to dizygotic twins, suggesting that there may a genetic contribution to MS risk. The HLA DRB1 allele has been associated with increased risk of adult-onset MS in numerous studies. A recent prospective study in Canadian children with a first attack of central nervous system demyelination demonstrated that the HLA DRB1*15 allele was more common in those children later diagnosed with MS as opposed to children who remained monophasic. Several genome-wide studies have implicated other immune-related genes in MS, but all are felt to have a very low contribution to individual MS risk. What complications might you expect from the disease or treatment of the disease? Fatigue, cognitive impairment, and persistent neurological disability are all possible complications of MS in children (see above). Treatment-related side effects are discussed in the section describing therapies. Are additional laboratory studies available; even some that are not widely available? Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new non-invasive technique that enables measurement of retinal nerve fibre thickness. As significant numbers of axons are found in the retina, OCT is emerging as a potentially valuable tool in measuring the degree of axonal degeneration in MS. Applications of OCT in MS include estimation of visual prognosis after optic neuritis, demonstration of degree of axonal degeneration in MS patients without optic neuritis, and use as a surrogate outcome marker in MS treatment trials. To date, there is no known intervention that will prevent MS development. There is increasing evidence that vitamin D deficiency at first presentation of neurological symptoms increases risk of subsequent attacks and is associated with relapse rate in individuals with established MS. Future studies exploring the role of vitamin D supplementation are of considerable interest.

Resources:MS Society of Canada: National MS Society: . Ongoing controversies regarding etiology, diagnosis, treatment There is still considerable debate about definitions for many childhood demyelinating syndromes, especially recurrent and multiphasic forms of ADEM. It remains unclear whether these forms of ADEM represent discrete diagnostic entities with a favourable prognosis, or if these forms of ADEM represent an age-related early manifestation of MS. Treatment algorithms for childhood MS are largely derived from randomized controlled trials conducted in adults. There is a paucity of clinical trials that include pediatric participants. Inclusion of children with MS in large scale therapy trials will be increasingly important in the near future with the introduction of new potent immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatments for whom the effects on the developing immune system have yet to be defined.

Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common permanently disabling disorder of the central nervous system in young adults. Relapsing remitting MS is the most common type, and typical symptoms include sensory disturbances, Lhermitte sign, motor weakness, optic neuritis, impaired coordination, and fatigue. The course of disease is highly variable. The diagnosis is clinical and involves two neurologic deficits or objective attacks separated in time and space. Magnetic resonance imaging is helpful in confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Symptom exacerbations affect 85% of patients with MS. Corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for patients with acute, significant symptoms. Disease-modifying agents should be initiated early in the treatment of MS to forestall disease and preserve function. Two immunomodulatory agents (interferon beta and glatiramer) and five immunosuppressive agents (fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, and mitoxantrone) are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of MS, each with demonstrated effectiveness and unique adverse effect profiles. Symptom management constitutes a large part of care; neurogenic bladder and bowel, sexual dysfunction, pain, spasticity, and fatigue are best treated with a multidisciplinary approach to improve quality of life. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common permanently disabling disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) in young adults. The prevalence varies by geographic region, ranging from 110 cases per 100,000 persons in the northern United States to 47 per 100,000 in the southern United States. Women, smokers, and persons residing at higher latitudes or with a family history of MS are at increased risk of disease. Those with increased exposure to sunlight and higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are at decreased risk. Total costs associated with MS may exceed $50,000 per person annually.  Enlarge     Print Multiple sclerosis is a clinical diagnosis requiring two neurologic deficits or objective attacks separated in time and space. If clinical criteria are not met, magnetic resonance imaging can be used to make the diagnosis.

The disease-modifying agents interferon beta, glatiramer (Copaxone), fingolimod (Gilenya), teriflunomide (Aubagio), and dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) have been shown to decrease the frequency of exacerbations and progression of disease in patients with multiple sclerosis.

For information about the SORT evidence rating system, go to Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The most common type of MS is relapsing remitting MS . In the acute attack, T cells, B cells, and macrophages interact with adhesion molecules on blood vessel surfaces to traverse a blood-brain barrier weakened by matrix metalloproteinases. Once through, T cells and B cells release inflammatory mediators and immunoglobulins targeting the myelin sheath, while macrophages expose axonal surfaces and release harmful nitrous oxygen and oxygen free radicals. This cascade of events leads to demyelination and axonal injury.  Enlarge     Print Discrete attacks that evolve over days to weeks, followed by some degree of recovery over weeks to months; the patient has no worsening of neurologic function between attacks Initial relapsing remitting disease, followed by gradual neurologic deterioration not associated with acute attacks Primary progressive and progressive relapsing (10% of cases) Characterized by steady functional decline from disease onset; these types cannot be distinguished during early stages until attacks occur (progressive relapsing) or fail to occur (primary progressive); progressive relapsing is rarer than primary progressive *—Develops in about 50% of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.

Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Typical symptoms of MS include sensory disturbances, motor weakness, optic neuritis (monocular visual impairment with pain), Lhermitte sign (electrical sensation down the spine on neck flexion), fatigue, and impaired coordination. Patients may also present with or develop pain, depression, sexual dysfunction, bladder urgency or retention, and bowel dysfunction  .  Enlarge     Print Sensory disturbances (dysesthesias, numbness, paresthesias) Visual defects (internuclear ophthalmoplegia, optic disc pallor, red color desaturation, reduced visual acuity) Sensory disturbances (dysesthesias, numbness, paresthesias) Visual defects (internuclear ophthalmoplegia, optic disc pallor, red color desaturation, reduced visual acuity) Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Multiple diseases may be confused with MS . CNS pathologies to consider include other inflammatory, demyelinating, or degenerative diseases; infections; neoplasms; and migraines. Genetic diseases, nutritional deficiencies, and psychiatric diseases may also present in a manner similar to MS. The diagnosis of MS should be questioned in the presence of abrupt/transient symptoms, prominent cortical features (seizures, aphasia), peripheral neuropathy, and other organ (cardiac, hematologic) involvement, because these are not typical of MS.  Enlarge     Print Conditions Potentially Confused with Multiple Sclerosis Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Human immunodeficiency virus infection, Lyme disease, mycoplasma, syphilis Behçet syndrome, sarcoidosis, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus Arteriovenous malformation, herniated disk, neoplasm Cerebrovascular accident, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disease, migraine, vasculitis Alcohol, cocaine, isoniazid, lithium, penicillin, phenytoin (Dilantin) Folate deficiency, vitamin B deficiency, vitamin E deficiency Conditions Potentially Confused with Multiple Sclerosis Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Human immunodeficiency virus infection, Lyme disease, mycoplasma, syphilis Behçet syndrome, sarcoidosis, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus Arteriovenous malformation, herniated disk, neoplasm Cerebrovascular accident, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disease, migraine, vasculitis Alcohol, cocaine, isoniazid, lithium, penicillin, phenytoin (Dilantin) Folate deficiency, vitamin B deficiency, vitamin E deficiency Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care MS is a clinical diagnosis. Two neurologic deficits (e.g., focal weakness, sensory disturbances) separated in time and space, in the absence of fever, infection, or competing etiologies, are considered diagnostic.

In addition to MRI, evoked potentials (visual, auditory, and somatosensory) may provide objective evidence of deficits consistent with MS. Visual evoked potentials are especially helpful for persons with vision-related symptoms. Cerebrospinal fluid may be obtained, although this is not routinely recommended; analysis typically demonstrates oligoclonal bands and an increased immunoglobulin G concentration. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis is more useful in ruling out MS mimics and in diagnosing primary progressive MS than in diagnosing relapsing remitting MS.  Serologic testing is performed to exclude other diseases .  Enlarge     Print Serologic Tests to Rule Out Conditions That Mimic Multiple Sclerosis Rheumatologic disease, systemic lupus erythematosus Performed when appropriate to the clinical situation Autoantibody assays* (e.g., antineutrophil cytoplasmic, anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid, anti–SS-A, and anti–SS-B antibodies) Behçet syndrome, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis *—These tests are commonly ordered by neurologists on initial consultation.

Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Exacerbations affect 85% of patients with MS; infections and stress may play a role. For those with significant, acute symptoms, corticosteroids are the treatment of choice and have strong evidence of benefit. Although parenteral steroids build up to peak concentrations faster than oral preparations, a Cochrane review indicates no difference in effectiveness (as measured by clinical or radiologic markers) or safety between oral and parenteral preparations. If the disease is unresponsive to steroids, plasmapheresis may be performed. Plasma exchanges are relatively well tolerated and are usually performed every other day for 14 days. Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The goal of disease-modifying therapy is to forestall disease, preserve function, and sustain healthy immune function while suppressing the T-cell autoimmune cascade thought to be responsible for demyelination and axonal damage. Early treatment at or before the diagnosis of clinically confirmed MS may delay damage to the CNS.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved seven agents for the treatment of MS: interferon beta, glatiramer (Copaxone), fingolimod (Gilenya), teriflunomide (Aubagio), dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), natalizumab (Tysabri), and mitoxantrone . Because of the chronic nature and evolving treatment of MS, disease-modifying treatment is typically managed by a neurologist with expertise in prescribing these potentially toxic agents.  Enlarge     Print Disease-Modifying Agents for Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Injection site reactions (e.g., edema, inflammation, pain); influenza-like symptoms; leukopenia; elevated liver enzyme levels; depression and suicidal thoughts (increased with preexisting depression, neutralizing antibodies) Decrease in progression: RR = 0.69; (0.55 to 0.87) Injection site reactions, facial flushing, chest tightness, palpitations Decrease in disability at two years: MD = 0.33; (0.08 to 0.58) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.18 vs. 0.40 Bradycardia (contraindicated in recent heart disease or arrhythmia); elevated liver enzyme levels Decrease in progression at two years: HR = 0.70; (0.55 to 0.87) Melanoma, macular edema, herpes encephalitis (only occurs at higher doses) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.37 vs. 0.54 Alopecia, diarrhea, nausea, decreased white blood cell count, elevated liver enzyme levels, peripheral neuropathy Decrease in progression: HR = 0.76; (0.51 to 0.97) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.17 vs. 0.36 Flushing, abdominal pain, lymphocytopenia, elevated liver enzyme levels Decrease in progression: HR = 0.62; (0.44 to 0.87) Infusion reactions, headache, fatigue, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Decrease in progression at two years: RR = 0.74; (0.62 to 0.89) Myelosuppression, elevated liver enzyme levels, decreased cardiac function, leukemia Decrease in progression: OR = 0.30; (0.09 to 0.99) HR = hazard ratio; MD = mean difference; OR = odds ratio; RR = relative risk. *—Estimated retail price of treatment for one year based on information obtained at .

Interferon beta, an immunomodulatory agent with more than 20 years of safety data, is effective in decreasing exacerbations and the progression of relapsing remitting MS. Interferon beta is available in three injectable formulations. Common adverse effects include local reactions and influenza-like symptoms. Interferon treatment may be associated with suicidal thoughts, so other agents should be considered in patients with depression. Glatiramer is an alternative immunomodulatory daily injection for relapsing remitting MS with a good safety record. Glatiramer decreases relapse and progression of disability at two years. Common adverse effects include local and systemic injection reactions (e.g., chest tightness, palpitations). Glatiramer should be avoided in persons with known hypersensitivity to this agent. Fingolimod is the first oral agent that is FDA approved for disease modification in relapsing remitting MS. A study of 1,272 patients between 18 and 55 years of age with relapsing remitting MS compared fingolimod with placebo, and demonstrated a decrease in annual exacerbations and progression of disease at two years. Bradycardia is a known adverse effect; patients should be observed for six hours after taking their first dose, and the medication is contraindicated in those with recent heart disease or arrhythmia. The FDA has approved two additional oral agents. Teriflunomide, approved in September 2012, has been shown to decrease relapse rates compared with placebo. Adverse effects include elevated transaminase levels, alopecia, and diarrhea. Teriflunomide carries an FDA warning for hepatic toxicity. Dimethyl fumarate, approved in March 2013, has been shown to decrease relapses and disease progression. Adverse effects include flushing, abdominal pain, decreased lymphocyte counts, and elevated transaminase levels. All of these oral agents suppress the immune system and put patients at risk of opportunistic infections. Because of this, these agents are typically used when the disease does not respond to, or the patient is unable to tolerate, an immunomodulatory agent. Natalizumab and mitoxantrone are immunosuppressive agents reserved for disease that does not respond to first-line agents. Although both are effective, natalizumab carries an FDA warning for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and mitoxantrone carries a warning for cardiotoxicity. Ongoing trials are evaluating the effectiveness and safety of additional agents in the treatment of MS to include the injectable daclizumab and oral cladribine and siponimod. Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Multidisciplinary treatment of primary and associated symptoms is essential in enhancing the quality of life in younger and older patients with MS. More than 70% of patients with MS have urinary tract dysfunction, with 10% demonstrating urinary symptoms at initial diagnosis. Urinary dysfunction can be classified as failure to store or empty, and can be differentiated with postvoid residual testing. Failure-to-store symptoms are typically treated with anticholinergic medications, although patients should be cautioned about adverse effects, such as dry mouth and confusion. Nocturia may respond to limited evening fluid intake or intranasal desmopressin; if desmopressin is prescribed, patients should be cautioned about the potential for hyponatremia. Injectable onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) may be used if symptoms do not respond to these agents. Failure-to-empty symptoms are treated with clean intermittent catheterization, although some may respond to an alpha adrenergic blocker. Up to 75% of patients with MS experience constipation, incontinence, or both. Treatment should include dietary fiber, bulk-forming agents, and adequate hydration. Rectal stimulants, stool softeners, and enemas may be used if needed. Colostomy is an option for patients with intolerable symptoms. About 50% to 90% of men and 40% to 85% of women with MS have some type of sexual dysfunction. Although sexual dysfunction may have a considerable negative impact on quality of life, it is often unaddressed. Men are primarily treated with peripherally acting phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. There is no established pharmacologic agent for women. Collaboration with a sex therapist or couples counselor may be beneficial. Approximately 85% of patients with MS report pain during the course of their illness. Those with pain report poorer health and poorer psychological functioning. Trigeminal neuralgia and dysesthetic (neuropathic) limb pain are common. Trigeminal neuralgia is initially treated with carbamazepine (Tegretol) and baclofen (Lioresal), as it is in persons without MS. Neuropathic pain in MS may be treated with tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Hydrotherapy has also been shown to be helpful in pain management, and is beneficial for the spasticity associated with MS. Cannabinoid therapy may be helpful for pain symptoms. It is estimated that 70% to 80% of patients with MS experience muscle spasticity. These symptoms are best treated with a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating modalities such as physical, occupational, and electromagnetic therapy. Baclofen is a first-line agent and works by decreasing alpha motor neuron activity. Oral baclofen has a short half-life and is associated with daytime sedation and muscle weakness. Intrathecal baclofen can be used to avoid daytime sedation, although muscle weakness may still occur. Diazepam (Valium) and gabapentin (Neurontin) may be used alone or in conjunction with baclofen. OnabotulinumtoxinA, with or without concomitant physical therapy, may also be helpful. Although cannabinoid therapy has been used for spasticity, the evidence for its effectiveness is mixed. The American Academy of Neurology states that patients should be counseled that these agents are probably ineffective for objective spasticity. More than 90% of patients with MS report fatigue; one-third report it to be their most troubling symptom, and many present with it. Although fatigue may occur as a result of comorbid depression, it also may appear independently. Fatigue has profound impacts on quality of life and is a leading cause of disability claims. Treatment for fatigue is multifocal. After evaluating for comorbid causes of fatigue (e.g., sleep disorders, thyroid disease, vitamin B deficiency, anemia), environmental manipulation, such as controlling heat and humidity levels, may help prevent flare-ups. Energy conservation measures such as napping and the use of assistive devices for mobility may be recommended based on the individual patient. Amantadine has been used off label in a limited number of trials and has been found to be beneficial for fatigue, although it is associated with insomnia and confusion. Other medications, such as modafinil (Provigil), have been tried with mixed results, and are not FDA approved for patients with MS. Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and other vascular comorbidities in patients with MS is similar to that in the general population. The presence of these conditions may worsen the course of MS. In addition to using targeted MS and symptom-modifying therapies, physicians should also manage these comorbidities. Surveys show that more than 50% of patients with MS seek treatments such as acupuncture, chiropractic manipulations, massage, yoga, and herbal therapies.  Physicians should ask patients if they are using integrative treatments, and should be prepared to help them find quality information on the risks and benefits of the treatments they choose. provides information and resources on traditional and integrative treatments for MS.  Enlarge     Print Multiple Sclerosis Resources for Patients and Physicians Cleveland Clinic: Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis General information: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/multiple_sclerosis_center/default.aspx Information on integrative therapies: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/4%20Alternative%20and%20Complementary%20Therapies%20for%20MS.pdf http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/integrative-medicine.pdf Information on integrative therapies: Information on integrative therapies: General and integrative medicine information: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/multiplesclerosis.html General information: Information on integrative therapies: http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Complementary-Alternative-Medicines Multiple Sclerosis Resources for Patients and Physicians Cleveland Clinic: Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis General information: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/multiple_sclerosis_center/default.aspx Information on integrative therapies: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/4%20Alternative%20and%20Complementary%20Therapies%20for%20MS.pdf http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/integrative-medicine.pdf Information on integrative therapies: Information on integrative therapies: General and integrative medicine information: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/multiplesclerosis.html General information: Information on integrative therapies: http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Complementary-Alternative-Medicines : A PubMed search was completed using the keyword and medical subject heading multiple sclerosis.

CALABRESI, M.D., Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland Abstract Abstract Multiple sclerosis, an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, is characterized pathologically by demyelination and subsequent axonal degeneration. The disease commonly presents in young adults and affects twice as many women as men. Common presenting symptoms include numbness, weakness, visual impairment, loss of balance, dizziness, urinary bladder urgency, fatigue, and depression. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis should be made by a physician with experience in identifying the disease. Diagnosis should be based on objective evidence of two or more neurologic signs that are localized to the brain or spinal cord and are disseminated in time and space (i.e., occur in different parts of the central nervous system at least three months apart). Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast, especially during or following a first attack, can be helpful in providing evidence of lesions in other parts of the brain and spinal cord. A second magnetic resonance scan may be useful at least three months after the initial attack to identify new lesions and provide evidence of dissemination over time. It is critical to exclude other diseases that can mimic multiple sclerosis, including vascular disease, spinal cord compression, vitamin B deficiency, central nervous system infection (e.g., Lyme disease, syphilis), and other inflammatory conditions (e.g., sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome). Symptom-specific drugs can relieve spasticity, bladder dysfunction, depression, and fatigue. Five disease-modifying treatments for multiple sclerosis have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. These treatments are partially effective in reducing exacerbations and may slow progression of disability. Multiple sclerosis (MS) typically presents in adults who are 20 to 45 years of age. Occasionally, the disease presents in childhood or late middle age. Twice as many women are affected as men, and persons of Northern European descent appear to be at highest risk for the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging should be performed or repeated three months after a clinically suspicious episode to facilitate early diagnosis of MS. Corticosteroid therapy should be used to shorten the duration of MS relapses and accelerate recovery. Disease-modifying treatment should be started early in the course of MS to minimize irreversible axonal damage. Glatiramer and the beta interferons have different mechanisms of action. Patients with MS who have an unsatisfactory response to beta interferons should be considered for glatiramer therapy. Patients with worsening forms of MS may be referred for mitoxantrone therapy; however, this agent has acute short-term adverse effects, as well as serious long-term adverse effects that include cardiotoxicity. A = consistent, good quality patient-oriented evidence; B = inconsistent or limited quality patient-oriented evidence; C = consensus, disease-oriented evidence, usual practice, opinion, or case series. See page 1845 for more information. Magnetic resonance imaging should be performed or repeated three months after a clinically suspicious episode to facilitate early diagnosis of MS.

See page 1845 for more information. The onset of MS may be insidious or sudden. Common presenting symptoms include monocular visual impairment with pain (optic neuritis), paresthesias, weakness, and impaired coordination . Frequent accompanying signs and symptoms include bladder urgency or retention, constipation, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, depression, diplopia, gait and limb ataxia, and Lhermitte’s sign (electrical sensation down the spine on neck flexion). Lhermitte’s sign (electrical sensation down the spine on neck flexion) Decreased perception of pain, vibration, or position Impaired visual acuity or red color perception with optic disc pallor and afferent pupillary defect; disconjugate eye movements Lhermitte’s sign (electrical sensation down the spine on neck flexion) Decreased perception of pain, vibration, or position Impaired visual acuity or red color perception with optic disc pallor and afferent pupillary defect; disconjugate eye movements MS frequently is overlooked because initial symptoms resolve spontaneously in most patients. Relapses occur within months or years. In some patients, however, MS has a primary progressive course from onset. Abstract The diagnosis of MS is based on the presence of central nervous system (CNS) lesions that are disseminated in time and space (i.e., occur in different parts of the CNS at least three months apart), with no better explanation for the disease process. Because no single test is totally reliable in identifying MS, and a variety of conditions can mimic the disease , diagnosis depends on clinical features supplemented by the findings of certain studies. CNS infection (e.g., Lyme disease, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, human T-lymphotrophic virus type I) CNS inflammatory condition (e.g., sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome) CNS microvascular disease (e.g., disease caused by hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vasculitis, CADASIL) Genetic disorder (e.g., leukodystrophy, hereditary myelopathy, mitochondrial disease) Structural or compressive condition of the brain and spinal cord (e.g., cervical spondylosis, tumor, herniated disc, Chiari’s malformation) Vitamin B deficiency CNS = central nervous system; CADASIL = cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be highly sensitive in detecting clinically silent MS plaques. Consequently, findings of this imaging modality are included in diagnostic criteria that have been proposed by one set of investigators.  The major advantage of the proposed criteria is that an early diagnosis of MS can be made if an MRI scan performed three months after a clinically isolated attack demonstrates formation of a new lesion. The proposed diagnostic criteria also define MRI lesion characteristics that increase the likelihood of MS, including number of lesions (nine or more), location of lesions (position abutting the ventricles; juxtacortical, infratentorial, or spinal position), and lesion enhancement with the use of contrast medium . MRI Lesion Characteristics Suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis High signal on T-weighted and FLAIR MRI sequences (more than nine lesions) When actively inflamed, often enhanced with gadolinium contrast Position abutting ventricles (often perpendicular) Involvement of brainstem, cerebellum, or corpus callosum Incomplete cross-sectional involvement (dorsolateral common) MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; FLAIR = fluid attenuation inversion recovery; STIR = short tau inversion recovery.

A brain MRI scan is the most useful test for confirming the diagnosis of MS. MS lesions appear as areas of high signal, predominantly in the cerebral white matter or spinal cord, on T-weighted images . MRI scanning is useful for detecting structural pathology in regions that can be difficult to image by computed tomography, such as the posterior fossa, craniocervical junction, and cervical cord. A brain MRI scan performed with a high-field magnet (1.5 tesla or greater) is abnormal in almost all patients who have clinically definite MS.

This image shows multiple high-signal periventricular and white-matter lesions.

Sagittal images using the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) protocol reveal multiple high-signal lesions within the spinal cord, consistent with demyelination. These lesions, which also can be seen on the transverse cuts, often are situated dorsolaterally, and are usually less than one vertebral body in length. The lesions rarely cause cord swelling. MRI scans of the spinal cord in a patient with MS. Sagittal images using the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) protocol reveal multiple high-signal lesions within the spinal cord, consistent with demyelination. These lesions, which also can be seen on the transverse cuts, often are situated dorsolaterally, and are usually less than one vertebral body in length. The lesions rarely cause cord swelling. Evoked potentials (visual, brainstem auditory, and somatosensory) may be useful in demonstrating the presence of subclinical lesions in sensory pathways or in providing objective evidence of lesions suspected on the basis of subjective complaints. Of the sensory evoked potential tests, the visual evoked potential is the most useful because it can provide objective evidence of an optic nerve lesion that may not be evident on an MRI scan. In approximately 90 percent of patients with definite MS, the CSF IgG concentration is increased relative to other CSF proteins (e.g., albumin), and CSF gel electrophoresis reveals oligoclonal bands that are not present in a matched serum sample. However, an increased CSF IgG index and the presence of oligoclonal bands are not specific for MS and therefore are not diagnostic of the disease. CSF analysis probably is most useful for ruling out infectious or neoplastic conditions that mimic MS. Peripheral blood tests may be helpful in excluding other disease processes. Testing frequently includes determination of the vitamin B level, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and anti-nuclear antibody titers, as well as a test for Lyme disease, and a test for syphilis (rapid plasma reagin test). In unusual cases, a more extensive evaluation may include tests for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-phospholipid antibodies, Sjögren’s syndrome A and B, angiotensin-converting enzyme, human T-lymphotrophic virus type I, and very long chain fatty acids (for adrenoleukodystrophy). Rarely, human immunodeficiency virus infection and opportunistic infections can mimic MS. Certain clinical or laboratory red flags should alert physicians to a possible diagnostic error. These flags include symptoms that could be explained by localized disease; the presence of steadily progressive disease; the absence of clinical remission; the absence of oculomotor, optic nerve, sensory, or bladder involvement; and normal CSF findings. However, none of these findings excludes the diagnosis of MS. Abstract Mild spasticity may be managed by stretching and exercise programs such as water therapy, yoga, and physical therapy. Medication is indicated when stiffness, spasms, or clonus interferes with function or sleep. Baclofen (Lioresal), tizanidine (Zanaflex), gabapentin (Neurontin), and benzodiazepines are effective antispastic agents . Intrathecal baclofen therapy has a major impact on medically intractable spasticity and has largely supplanted chemical rhizotomy or myelotomy. Baclofen (Lioresal), 10 to 40 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Tizanidine (Zanaflex), 2 to 8 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Gabapentin (Neurontin), 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Gabapentin, 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Carbamazepine (Tegretol), 100 to 600 mg three times daily; in high doses, causes rash and neurologic side effects; requires monitoring of complete blood count and liver function Amitriptyline (Elavil), 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Oxybutynin (Ditropan), 5 mg once daily to 20 mg per day in divided doses; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention Tolterodine (Detrol), 2 to 4 mg twice daily; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention (these side effects occur less often than with oxybutynin) SSRIs preferred because of activating properties; can have sexual side effects Alternatives to SSRIs when sexual side effects occur: extended-release venlafaxine (Effexor) 75 to 225 mg per day, or sustained-release bupropion (Wellbutrin), 150 mg per day to 150 mg twice daily Third-line drug or for use when a patient has a sleep disorder or concomitant headaches: amitriptyline, 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Amantadine (Symmetrel), 100 mg twice daily; can cause rash, edema, and anticholinergic effects Modafinil (Provigil), 100 to 200 mg given in the morning; can cause jittery sensation and palpitations Baclofen (Lioresal), 10 to 40 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Tizanidine (Zanaflex), 2 to 8 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Gabapentin (Neurontin), 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Gabapentin, 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Carbamazepine (Tegretol), 100 to 600 mg three times daily; in high doses, causes rash and neurologic side effects; requires monitoring of complete blood count and liver function Amitriptyline (Elavil), 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Oxybutynin (Ditropan), 5 mg once daily to 20 mg per day in divided doses; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention Tolterodine (Detrol), 2 to 4 mg twice daily; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention (these side effects occur less often than with oxybutynin) SSRIs preferred because of activating properties; can have sexual side effects Alternatives to SSRIs when sexual side effects occur: extended-release venlafaxine (Effexor) 75 to 225 mg per day, or sustained-release bupropion (Wellbutrin), 150 mg per day to 150 mg twice daily Third-line drug or for use when a patient has a sleep disorder or concomitant headaches: amitriptyline, 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Amantadine (Symmetrel), 100 mg twice daily; can cause rash, edema, and anticholinergic effects Modafinil (Provigil), 100 to 200 mg given in the morning; can cause jittery sensation and palpitations In most instances, dystonic spasms respond well to carbamazepine (Tegretol) can be treated effectively with anticonvulsants or amitriptyline (Elavil). In patients with new bladder symptoms, urinalysis and culture should be performed to rule out infection, with appropriate treatment provided if needed. The first step in medical management of the neurogenic bladder is to determine whether the problem is a failure to empty urine or a failure to store urine. The history may or may not be helpful. A postvoid residual urinary volume is the best means of determining urinary retention. The anticholinergic drugs oxybutynin (Ditropan) and tolterodine (Detrol) are effective for symptoms of failure to store urine (in the absence of infection or overflow incontinence). Drug treatment of urinary retention usually is ineffective, although some patients benefit from attempts to decrease bladder neck tone using an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist such as terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura), or tamsulosin (Flomax). Bethanechol (Urecholine) may be helpful in patients with a flaccid bladder. Definitive treatment of urinary retention involves teaching the patient to perform intermittent self-catheterization, if possible. In some patients, inhaled desmopressin (DDAVP) can be used to suppress nocturnal urinary production. Constipation is common in patients with MS. It should be managed aggressively to avoid long-term complications. Fecal incontinence is rare; when it occurs, the addition of fiber can provide enough bulk to the stool to allow a partially incompetent sphincter to hold in the bowel movement long enough for the patient to reach a bathroom. Short-term use of anticholinergics or antidiarrheal agents may be effective in combating incontinence associated with diarrhea. A careful sexual history may reveal problems such as feelings of sexual inadequacy, impaired libido, or direct sexual dysfunction resulting from erectile dysfunction, impaired lubrication, spasticity, or heat-related sensory dysesthesias. Counseling, a review of the sexual side effects of medications, and medical therapy may be appropriate. In some patients with MS, erectile dysfunction can be managed effectively with sildenafil (Viagra). Depression occurs in more than one half of patients with MS. Patients with mild, transient depression can be cared for with supportive measures. Those with more severe depression should be treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are less sedating than other antidepressants. Bedtime administration of amitriptyline can be useful in depressed patients who also are having difficulty sleeping or have headaches or other pain syndromes. This symptom often responds to rest or medication. Amantadine (Symmetrel), 100 mg twice daily, may be effective. Modafinil (Provigil), a narcolepsy drug that acts as a CNS stimulant, has been found to be effective in patients with MS; the drug is given in a dosage of 200 mg once daily in the morning. Occasionally, SSRIs can relieve fatigue in patients with MS. Amantadine has the added advantage of having anti–influenza-A properties and may be given from October to March. In a patient with an apparent relapse of MS, it is important to rule out a treatable infection such as sinusitis, bronchitis, or urinary tract infection. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of symptomatic relief for an acute relapse of MS. These agents work through immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, restoration of the blood-brain barrier, and reduction of edema. They also may improve axonal conduction. Corticosteroid therapy shortens the duration of acute relapses and accelerates recovery. However, corticosteroids have not been shown to improve the overall degree of recovery or to alter the long-term course of MS. If a patient is having acute disability from an attack, the physician should consider treatment with a three- to five-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone (or equivalent corticosteroid) in a dosage of 1 g administered intravenously in 100 mL of normal saline over 60 minutes once daily in the morning. In patients with MS, physical therapy always should be considered because it improves function and quality of life independent of drug therapy. Supportive care in the form of counseling, occupational therapy, advice from social workers, input from nurses, and participation in patient support groups are all part of a united health care team approach to the management of MS. Some patients require temporary disability status. Patients with MS often are tempted to try alternative therapies such as special diets, vitamins, bee stings, a compound “off-label” transdermal medication (i.e., Prokarin), or acupuncture. Although definitive proof of the effectiveness of these treatments in MS is lacking, patients sometimes use them in a complementary fashion. Sole reliance on alternative therapies should be discouraged because patients then may be deprived of therapies that have been shown to be effective in the treatment of MS. Four disease-modifying therapies for the initial management of MS are available in the United States: intramuscular interferon beta-1a (Avonex), subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (Rebif), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron), and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone). A fifth agent, mitoxantrone (Novantrone), has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of worsening forms of relapsing-remitting MS and secondary progressive MS .

Montvale, N.J.: Medical Economics Data, 2004. Cost to the patient will be higher, depending on prescription filling fee. The beta interferons are naturally occurring cytokines with a variety of immunomodulating and antiviral activities that may account for their therapeutic effects. The three FDA-approved beta interferons that are used for MS have been shown to reduce relapses by about one third and are recommended as first-line therapy or for use in glatiramer-intolerant patients who have relapsing-remitting MS. In randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials, use of beta interferons resulted in a 50 to 80 percent reduction in inflammatory lesions visualized on brain MRI scans. There also is evidence that these drugs improve quality of life and cognitive function. The major difference in the beta interferon drugs is that intramuscular interferon beta-1a is given once a week and subcutaneous interferon beta-1a and interferon beta-1b are given three times a week, or every other day, respectively. The adequacy of weekly dosing has been questioned. There appears to be a modest dose-response effect with the beta interferons. One study of double-dose (60-mcg) intramuscular interferon beta-1a administered once a week found no benefit over the single-dose regimen. Whether the benefit of more frequent dosing is sustained remains unclear. An increased incidence of neutralizing antibodies with the more frequent subcutaneous dosing also must be considered. Influenza-like symptoms, including fever, chills, malaise, muscle aches, and fatigue, occur in approximately 60 percent of patients treated with interferon beta-1a or interferon beta-1b. These symptoms usually dissipate with continued therapy and premedication with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Dose titration at the initiation of beta interferon therapy also is a useful strategy. Other side effects of the beta interferons include injection-site reactions, worsening of pre-existing spasticity, depression, mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated transaminase levels. These side effects usually are not severe and rarely lead to discontinuation of treatment. Treatment with any beta interferon can result in the development of neutralizing antibodies. Although study results are variable, once-weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a therapy has been reported to have the lowest incidence of neutralizing antibody development. The effect of neutralizing antibodies on the long-term efficacy of beta interferon therapy remains to be fully defined because titers and durations of antibody positivity (some neutralizing antibodies resolve with time) are variable. This drug is a polypeptide mixture that was originally designed to mimic and compete with myelin basic protein. Its mechanism of action is distinct from that of the beta interferons; therefore, patients may respond differently to the drug. Glatiramer in a dosage of 20 mg administered subcutaneously once daily has been shown to reduce the frequency of MS relapses by approximately one third. The drug also is recommended as a first-line treatment in patients with relapsing-remitting MS and in the treatment of patients who cannot tolerate beta interferon therapy. Glatiramer therapy results in a one-third reduction in the inflammatory activity seen on MRI scans. Glatiramer generally is well tolerated and is not associated with influenza-like symptoms. Immediate postinjection reactions include local inflammation and an uncommon idiosyncratic reaction consisting of flushing, chest tightness with palpitations, anxiety, or dyspnea, which resolves spontaneously without sequelae. Routine laboratory monitoring is not considered necessary in patients treated with glatiramer, and the development of binding antibodies does not interfere with therapeutic efficacy. A phase-III, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial found that mitoxantrone, an anthracenedione antineoplastic agent, reduced the number of treated MS relapses by 67 percent and slowed progression on the Expanded Disability Status Scale, Ambulation Index, and MRI measures of disease activity. Mitoxantrone is recommended for use in patients with worsening forms of MS. Acute side effects of mitoxantrone include nausea and alopecia. Because of cumulative cardiotoxicity, the drug can be used for only two to three years (or for a cumulative dose of 120 to 140 mg per m). There also is some concern about treatment-related leukemia. Mitoxantrone is a chemotherapeutic agent that should be prescribed and administered only by experienced health care professionals. Natalizumab (Antegren) is in the final stages of phase-III clinical trails and is under accelerated review by the FDA. In a phase-II clinical trial, this drug appeared promising in that it reduced active MRI lesions by 90 percent and decreased MS relapses by more than 50 percent. Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is directed against an adhesion molecule called VLA-4. The drug is administered intravenously once a month. Despite lack of FDA approval and definitive evidence of efficacy, several other drugs commonly are used in patients with MS. A number of small clinical trials support the modest effect of intravenous IgG, azathioprine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide, either alone or in combination with standard therapy. Abstract Accumulating evidence indicates that the best time to initiate disease-modifying treatment is early in the course of MS. Data indicate that irreversible axonal damage may occur early in relapsing-remitting MS, and that drug therapies appear to be more effective in preventing new lesion formation than in repairing old lesions. With disease progression, the autoimmune response of the disease may become more difficult to suppress. Both intramuscular interferon beta-1a therapy and subcutaneous interferon beta-1a therapy have been shown to reduce the cumulative probability of the development of clinically definite MS in patients who present with a first clinical demyelinating episode and have two or more brain lesions on an MRI scan. Based on these data, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society supports the initiation of immunomodulating therapy at the time of diagnosis. The physician must weigh evidence and recommendations against the practical concerns of young patients for whom the prospect of starting therapy that requires self-injection may be frightening and burdensome. Furthermore, few long-term data (more than 10 years) are available on the safety and sustained efficacy of disease-modifying drugs. A patient may opt to defer therapy, hoping to be among the minority of persons with benign MS; however, certain MRI and clinical features should prompt the physician and patient to reconsider this approach. An MRI scan with contrast-enhancing lesions, a large burden of white matter disease, or any T low-signal lesions (black holes) suggests a relatively poor prognosis. It may be useful to repeat brain MRI scanning in six months or one year to determine how quickly the disease process is evolving. The presence of spinal cord lesions or atrophy also suggests a poor prognosis. Clinical features may be less useful for assessing prognosis. Once definite disability develops, it may be too late to treat that component of the disease. The ability to diagnose and treat MS has improved considerably in the past 10 years because of the availability of MRI and partially effective immunomodulating therapies. The limited efficacy of immunomodulating drugs in the later, noninflammatory stages of MS highlights the importance of developing remyelinating and neuroprotective strategies for the disease.

beae909e-91b1-48ab-8f20-4d74b9035d68,"EMA's CHMP issues positive opinion for approval of Genzyme's LEMTRADA in Europe Genzyme, a Sanofi company (EURONEXT: SAN and NYSE: SNY), announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued a positive opinion for approval of LEMTRADA™ (alemtuzumab) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. “The superior Lemtrada vs. Rebif in the clinical trials, which was sustained despite infrequent administration, represents an approach to treatment that promises to reshape the future for many people with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.” In addition, the CHMP issued a positive opinion on new active substance designation (NAS) for AUBAGIO (teriflunomide). Earlier this year, the CHMP issued a positive opinion recommending the approval of AUBAGIO for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting MS. The European Commission (EC) is expected to render a final decision to grant marketing authorizations for LEMTRADA and AUBAGIO in the EU in the coming months. ""Today's CHMP opinions set the stage for the approval of two important new treatment options for MS patients. Treatments to-date have addressed some of the unmet needs in MS, but still have limitations,"" said David Meeker, MD, Genzyme President and CEO. ""Upon approval, physicians will have the ability to prescribe LEMTRADA for appropriate relapsing remitting patients based on their impressions of clinical or imaging characteristics regardless of duration of disease or treatment history. Expectations among the MS community are high for LEMTRADA and with today's positive CHMP opinion we are a step closer to making this very innovative treatment available for MS patients in Europe."" The positive CHMP opinion for approval of LEMTRADA was based on data from the CARE-MS I and CARE-MS II trials, in which LEMTRADA was significantly more effective than Rebif(subcutaneous interferon beta-1a 44 mcg three times weekly) at reducing relapse rates. In CARE-MS II, accumulation of disability was significantly slowed in patients given LEMTRADA vs. Rebif, and importantly, patients treated with LEMTRADA were significantly more likely to experience improvement in pre-existing disability. ""Today's announcement from Genzyme represents a key milestone in the extensive program evaluating LEMTRADA in multiple sclerosis,"" said Professor Alastair Compston, Head of the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom. ""The superior efficacy of Lemtrada vs. Rebif in the clinical trials, which was sustained despite infrequent administration, represents an approach to treatment that promises to reshape the future for many people with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis."" WHO highlights leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide from 2000 to 2019 Oxford University and AstraZeneca release their COVID-19 vaccine results Convalescent plasma in COVID-19 can be effective, especially early in disease LEMTRADA has a novel dosing and administration schedule of two annual treatment courses. The first treatment course of LEMTRADA is administered via intravenous infusion on five consecutive days, and the second course is administered on three consecutive days, 12 months later. The LEMTRADA clinical development program included two randomized Phase III studies comparing treatment with LEMTRADA to Rebifin patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had active disease and were either new to treatment (CARE-MS I) or who had relapsed while on prior therapy (CARE-MS II), as well as an ongoing extension study. A large randomized Phase II study provided the foundation for the Phase III program. Safety results were consistent across both the CARE-MS I and CARE-MS II studies. The most common adverse events associated with LEMTRADA were infusion-associated reactions, including headache, rash, fever, nausea and hives. Infections were common in both the LEMTRADA and Rebif groups. Infections more common on LEMTRADA treatment included upper respiratory and urinary tract infections, herpes viral infections, and influenza. Most infusion-associated reactions and infections were mild to moderate in severity and responded to standard treatments. In both CARE-MS I and CARE-MS II, the incidence of serious adverse events was similar between the two treatment arms. As previously reported, autoimmune disorders were more frequent in patients treated with LEMTRADA, primarily autoimmune thyroid disease which was observed in an estimated 36% of patients during extended follow-up. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) developed in 1.4 percent of LEMTRADA-treated patients through extended follow-up and 0.3% developed glomerulonephritis. Autoimmune disorders were detected soon after onset through a monitoring program, and were generally managed using standard treatments. A comprehensive risk management program has been proposed to support early detection and management of adverse events. In the U.S. the FDA has accepted for review the company's supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) file seeking approval of LEMTRADA (alemtuzumab) for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). FDA recently extended the review cycle for LEMTRADA by three months; no additional clinical studies have been requested, therefore FDA action on the application is expected in late 2013.

Can't wait till it is available in the US! Wonder if it is possible to go to the UK and get it? I agree that Lemtrada sounds like the most promising treatment for r-r MS yet. It would be worth going to the UK to get it.  If any one could give me some pointers on what would be involved and the approximate cost, I would appreciate it.  Thanks.

Multiple sclerosis, a leading cause of neurological disability affecting roughly 2.3 million people worldwide, is triggered when the immune system attacks and damages the myelin sheath. Earlier research in Tiwari-Woodruff's lab showed the ligand chloroindazome (IndCl) and its analogues are able to remyelinate -- add new myelin to -- damaged axons. Remyelination of axons speeds up nerve impulses, suggesting IndCl and similar drugs may represent a promising new avenue of treating the underlying loss of myelin in multiple sclerosis. Tiwari-Woodruff's collaborators are John Katzenellenbogen at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Scott Eliasof at Frequency Therapeutics. The project, titled ""Remyelination and Immunomodulation with analogues of Chloroindazole,"" will analyze compounds for , potency, and dosing schedule, after evaluating their pathology, immunology, and functional remyelination outcomes in mouse models of multiple sclerosis. Eventually, we will evaluate the safety pharmacology of two compounds with the best efficacy, pharmacokinetics and central nervous system exposure. Our overall goals through this Fast Forward grant, organized together with our commercial partner, Frequency Therapeutics, are tightly focused on obtaining critical safety and efficacy information on a set of verified candidates needed to identify the best of IndCl analogues."" Seema Tiwari-Woodruff, Professor of Biomedical Sciences, School of Medicine, University of California, Riverside New therapy may help treat or prevent multiple sclerosis Simple sugar in human breast milk can promote myelin repair in multiple sclerosis patients New approach can help identify novel treatments for autoimmune diseases Specifically, IndCl stimulates ERβ, an estrogen receptor in the body. Because ERβ is present not only in oligodendrocytes, the mylenating cells of the central nervous system, but also microglia, neurons, and T-cells, IndCl may have therapeutic benefits for other autoimmune and demyelinating diseases in addition to multiple sclerosis. Tiwari-Woodruff explained that pharmaceutical agents currently approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis reduce relapse rates but do not prevent neurodegeneration or initiate myelin repair. ""Accumulating evidence indicates that estrogens are both neuroprotective and immunomodulatory, thereby making them attractive candidates to fulfill these needs,"" she said. ""However, although estrogens display immense potential for treating multiple sclerosis, they possess several deleterious side effects, including male feminization and increasing risk of breast and endometrial cancers. Our research has focused on the development of ERβ-selective compounds for the treatment of multiple sclerosis that would be most suitable for commercial development."" The two-year grant will support a lab technician and, partially, a postdoctoral researcher.

45b3d808-7efe-412f-a015-8cb7d28d39ac,"New nanobiosensor can help diagnose early-stage multiple sclerosis Researchers at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) in Sorocaba (state of São Paulo, Brazil) have developed a technique to diagnose early-stage multiple sclerosis, a disease of the central nervous system, and distinguish it from neuromyelitis optica, a rare yet severe autoimmune inflammatory process also affecting the central nervous system. The immune system of a person with these diseases produces antibodies that attack and damage part of the myelin sheath, an insulating layer that protects nerves, including those in the brain and spinal cord, and aids the transmission of electrical impulses. Permanent lesions form in brain regions over time. Using a nanobiosensor originally developed to detect herbicides, heavy metals and other pollutants, the UFSCar group created a method for observing myelin basic protein (MBP) peptides interacting with antibodies in samples from patients under an atomic force microscope (AFM). Atomic force spectroscopy can detect the presence of specific antibodies for each of these two diseases in cerebrospinal fluid and blood serum. If the antibodies are attracted by the peptides deposited on the sensor during the test, this is a sign that the patient has the disease. The device is highly sensitive and can detect a small amount of antibodies, so the method can diagnose the disease at an early stage."" Fabio de Lima Leite, researcher in UFSCar's Science and Technology for Sustainability Center and last author of an article on the method published in Leite began researching nanobiosensors over ten years ago with a Young Investigator Grant from FAPESP and has since continued to study the subject as a principal investigator for UFSCar's Nanoneurobiophysics Research Group (GNN). His main motivation for shifting his research focus from detecting herbicides to identifying antibodies was the difficulty in diagnosing demyelinating and neurodegenerative disorders. Multiple sclerosis is usually diagnosed clinically on the basis of symptoms reported by the patient and by MRI scanning to identify lesions in certain brain regions. ""Our method is more accurate, avoiding diagnostic errors, as well as being cheaper. An AFM can cost about 20,000 dollars, whereas an MRI machine costs upwards of 400,000 dollars,"" Leite said. For researchers, the earlier these diseases are diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin with less risk of complications. ""There's no cure, but early diagnosis can give patients quality of life and better treatment,"" said Ariana de Souza Moraes, a researcher at UFSCar and a coauthor of the article. World’s largest proteomics centre accelerates biomarker discoveries to improve people’s lives Multiple fractionation approach for measuring cancer biomarker enrichment in exosomes New biomarker of Alzheimer's may lead to enhanced diagnostic methods In the study, the researchers used serum and cerebrospinal fluid from patients who were at different stages of multiple sclerosis and receiving treatment at the hospital run by São Paulo State University's Botucatu Medical School (FMB-UNESP) under the responsibility of Doralina Guimarães Brum, a researcher at the school, and Paulo Diniz da Gama, a neurologist affiliated with the Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo (PUC-SP) in Sorocaba. The samples were purified by Luís Antonio Peroni's firm RheaBiotech with FAPESP's support under its Innovative Research in Small Business Program (PIPE). To develop the sensor, it was necessary to synthesize MBP peptides. This was done at the University of São Paulo's Peptide Chemistry Laboratory, headed by Maria Teresa Machini. ""The cerebrospinal fluid and serum were purified, leaving only antibodies in each sample. This enabled us to detect specific antibodies for multiple sclerosis, such as anti-MBP 85-99. If these antibodies are circulating in a patient, they probably have multiple sclerosis. Our next step in the study is to produce a sensor that doesn't require purified samples,"" Leite said. In another study published recently in , UFSCar researchers identified patients with neuromyelitis optica and distinguished them from patients with multiple sclerosis. ""A biomarker for the disease exists, so it was possible to detect the anti-aquaporin 4 antibody in patient samples by the same method as that used to detect multiple sclerosis,"" Moraes said. Neuromyelitis optica can currently be diagnosed by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), a widely available method that is inexpensive and hence affordable for most patients. ""However, this method isn't as sensitive as the nanoimmunosensor and can't detect the disease in its early stages,"" Moraes said. Another advantage of the sensor is that it can distinguish the two diseases, avoiding a common diagnostic error. ""The two disorders have similar symptoms but different action mechanisms and treatments,"" Moraes said. ""An immunomodulator is recommended for one and an immunosuppressant for the other. An incorrect diagnosis can aggravate the disease. If a patient with neuromyelitis optica is treated for multiple sclerosis, optic nerve inflammation is accelerated and can't be reversed. The sensor is expected to represent a major advance for patients with demyelinating disorders.""

0bef39d2-0f4f-4cd5-a6fd-1a9156ed36b7,"Compound in fruit peels can reduce and reverse neuronal damage in multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS), characterized by increasing muscle weakness and paralysis, has a number of treatments that help stall progression of the disease when used early on in the disease. But the current treatments can hardly reverse damage that has already occurred in brain cells called neurons. New research suggests that a compound found in the peels of fruits such as apples and prunes, and some herbs, can reduce further damage to neurons, and also help rebuild the protective sheaths covering neurons, reversing the damage. Although the evidence is preliminary - our data is from animal models of disease - it's encouraging to see a compound that both halts and repairs damage in MS, in the lab.""   Guang-Xian Zhang, Ph.D., co-senior author and Professor of Neuroscience at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) on Monday April 6th. ""There is additional work we must do to test the safety of this compound, ursolic acid"" says co-senior author A.M. Rostami, MD, PhD, chair of the department of Neurology at the Vickie and Jack Farber Institute for Neuroscience - Jefferson Health. ""But this is a great new lead for disease treatment."" The researchers used a lab-grade purified form of ursolic acid in mice that had established MS disease. ""Many experiments have looked at mice in the acute phase, when disease is just starting or at the peak,"" says Dr. Zhang. ""Instead, we tested whether this compound was effective in chronic disease, once there has already been chronic damage to tissues of central nervous system."" Drs. Zhang, Rostami, together with first author Yuan Zhang and colleagues used an established mouse model of multiple sclerosis that develops the disease slowly over the course of its life, mimicking human disease. At about day 12, the mouse begins the acute phase of the disease, when signs of MS, partial paralysis, appear, and when currently-available medications are most effective. The researchers, however, started treating mice at day 60, - a far more advanced stage of the disease when chronic tissue damage has been formed in brain and spinal cords, which needs to be repaired and regenerated. Study reveals new biomarker for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Anti-inflammatory therapy helps slow progression of multiple sclerosis in a preclinical model USF researchers discover promising new compound to open constricted airways Researchers treated the mice for 60 days, and began to see an improvement at day 20 of treatment. The mice which were paralyzed at the start of the experiment, regained the ability to walk around again, although with weakness, after treatment. ""It's not a cure, but if we see a similar response in people, it would represent a significant change in quality of life. And most significantly, it's a reversal, which we really haven't seen before with other agents at such a late stage of disease,"" says Dr. Zhang. The researchers also investigated just how ursolic acid acted on cells. They observed that it suppressed Th17 cells - a type of immune cell that is one of the main drivers of the pathological autoimmune response in MS. Many currently active therapies appear to suppress Th17. But the Jefferson researchers showed that the compound could activate precursor cells to mature into much needed myelin-sheath-making cells, called . ""This maturation effect is the most crucial,"" says Dr. Zhang. ""Myelin-sheath-making oligodendrocytes are depleted in MS. And the stem cells that produce new oligodentrocytes are dormant and unable to mature. This compound helps activate those stem cells into making new oligodendrocytes, and is likely responsible for the reversal of symptoms we saw."" The next steps for the investigators include testing the compound for safety. Although ursolic acid is available as a dietary supplement, it could be toxic at high doses. ""There are still a number of tests to complete before the first clinical trials,"" says Dr. Rostami. ""However, we are moving quickly with this promising approach.""

acd5f7da-ddcd-4703-96a5-a457ba56d385,"Multiple sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disorder that damages the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, leading to problems with muscle movement, balance and vision. The illness is an example of a demyelinating disease, where the protective coating called myelin that surrounds nerve fibres becomes damaged. Integrin b3 and ACE2 linked by short linear motifs enabling endocytosis and autophagy of SARS-CoV-2 Study finds higher suicide rate among people with neurological disorders Drug prices beat inflation all the way even with discounts Multiple sclerosis follows a different course in every individual but there are three main ways in which the disease can progress depending on which form of the illness a patient has. Around 80% of all individuals with multiple sclerosis have the relapsing remitting form of the disease. These individuals have periods where their symptoms are mild or absent (remission), followed by periods of symptom relapse. Symptoms may occur suddenly and in acute bouts or exacerbations. During these periods of relapse, symptoms may become worse each time and the relapsing remitting form of this condition may eventually progress to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, where there are few or no periods of remission. Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis may be diagnosed when two episodes of relapse are separated by more than 30 days or there has only been one relapse but there is MRI evidence of newly scarred or damaged myelin three months later. Patients with this form of multiple sclerosis often experience phases of relapse followed by remission at first, but this later gives way to progressive disease, characterized by worsening symptoms and few or no periods of remission. The least common form of multiple sclerosis is the primary progressive form which occurs in about 10% to 15% of all cases and usually in people aged over 40 years. In this form of the condition, symptoms get worse over time rather than occurring in bouts or as sudden attacks. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis may be diagnosed if there have been no previous symptoms of relapse but the patient has become increasingly disabled over a period of at least one year. http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Multiple-sclerosis/Pages/Causes.aspx www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/tutorials/multiplesclerosis/nr229105.pdf http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/Atlas_MS_WEB.pdf http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/10930/29202/29202.pdf Last Updated: Aug 23, 2018 Dr. Ananya Mandal is a doctor by profession, lecturer by vocation and a medical writer by passion.

0b67a1c5-7dd6-41c5-a9c6-3fcfa0b9932c,"Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is an uncommon form of MS that affects approximately 10-15% of MS patients. In PPMS, symptoms steadily get worse over time without frequent relapses or remission. Unlike relapse-remitting MS (RRMS), which affects women more than men, PPMS affects an equal number of both genders. PPMS is usually diagnosed in older individuals between the ages of 40 to 60, yet it is sometimes diagnosed beyond this range. Early symptoms in PPMS develop slowly over a period of time and usually involve issues with walking and general mobility. The pace and progress of PPMS can vary from patient to patient. In some people with PPMS, relapses can occur along with steady disease progression. This is referred to as progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS). The diagnosis of PPMS is particularly difficult as it is diagnosed in the 40s and 50s when other health issues related to mobility tend to develop. Since PPMS is characterized by a gradual and steady accumulation of disability over time, the criteria for diagnosis of PPMS are different from that of other forms of MS. Worsening of neurological function for one year without remission Indications of immune activity in the CNS (such as elevated IgG index) These criteria often take a long time to develop, hence PPMS diagnosis usually taking two to three years more than diagnosis of RRMS. Treatment for PPMS mainly aims at managing neurological symptoms. Ongoing drug trials focus on reducing relapses and slowing down the disease progression rate as well as the build-up of disability. Currently, no FDA-approved medications are available for the treatment of PPMS. This is mainly because most approved therapies work towards reducing inflammation, which is not a characteristic of PPMS. Many clinical trials are underway to find an effective drug for this disease. Drug prices beat inflation all the way even with discounts Integrin b3 and ACE2 linked by short linear motifs enabling endocytosis and autophagy of SARS-CoV-2 Study sheds light on myelin's role in 'chemobrain' and multiple sclerosis Wellbeing and rehabilitation of people affected with PPMS is important and can be achieved by following a healthy diet and exercise regimen. Unsteadiness in walking and muscle weakness can be tackled with the help of an occupational therapist and a physiotherapist, while a dietician can help develop an appropriate meal plan based on the patient’s individual mobility levels. Neurologic examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) must be performed at least once a year to evaluate disease progression and activity. Characterizing the disease course at regular intervals is important as it helps in updating treatment methods. If PPMS is active with relapses or fresh MRI activity, a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) should be started so as to mitigate the risk of an attack. If PPMS is stable with no progression or activity, treatment should focus on rehabilitation so as to maintain function and symptom management. If PPMS is inactive with no relapses or activity, but with disease progression and build-up of disability, treatment should aim at maintaining function and promoting independence of the patient. PPMS does not involve relapses due to inflammation; hence, patients with this type of MS have fewer lesions or plaques in the brain with fewer inflammatory cells. Relapsing forms such as RRMS and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) are characterized by frequent inflammatory attacks. The age of onset for relapsing forms of MS is about 10 years earlier than that for PPMS. PPMS tends to affect walking and mobility more than other functions, while relapsing MS types cause numbness, spasticity, vision problems, and cognitive decline. http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Types-of-MS/Primary-progressive-MS/Treating-Primary-Progressive-MS http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Types-of-MS/Primary-progressive-MS https://www.mssociety.org.uk/what-is-ms/types-of-ms/primary-progressive-ppms Last Updated: Feb 27, 2019 Susha has a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Chemistry and Master of Science (M.Sc) degree in Biochemistry from the University of Calicut, India.

8e5738cd-4ac0-4916-bc79-bb18a104583b,"FDA approves immune-modulating therapy for treatment of multiple sclerosis The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved ozanimod, an immune-modulating therapy invented at Scripps Research, for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The drug is also in advanced clinical development for adults and children with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. In patient studies supporting ozanimod's New Drug Application, those who took the once-daily oral medicine experienced significantly less disease progression--including fewer relapses and preservation of the brain from atrophy--than those who received standard care, with very few side effects. The drug, licensed to Bristol Myers Squibb, will be sold under the trademarked name Zeposia. Today's FDA approval of ozanimod is a celebratory milestone for the multiple sclerosis community, which is in need of new, intelligent drug interventions to help patients control the progression of their disease."" Hugh Rosen, MD, Ph.D., who invented ozanimod along with fellow Scripps Research professor Edward Roberts, Ph.D., and their laboratory colleagues Nearly 1 million people in the United States are living with multiple sclerosis, according to the National MS Society, and approximately 85 percent of those patients are diagnosed with the relapsing forms of the disease that ozanimod is designed to treat. In multiple sclerosis, the immune system mistakenly attacks myelin sheath, the protective layer that surrounds nerves in the brain. This disrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the brain and body, bringing about symptoms that can range from numbness and bladder issues to vision problems and muscle paralysis. Ozanimod works by acting on certain types of immune cells called lymphocytes that are centrally involved in the autoimmune attack on myelin sheath. It binds to receptors on the cells' surface, keeping them from reaching the brain. As a result, the number of activated lymphocytes is decreased, diminishing the immune attack. Research suggests seaweed used in traditional Chinese medicine could protect against COVID-19 Dutch research on mental health during COVID-19 in vulnerable children Not all masks protect the same: Research suggests no mask better than an old mask The fundamental discoveries that led to ozanimod were reported by Rosen, Roberts and their Scripps Research colleagues in a series of papers from 2002 to 2008. In 2009, Scripps Research licensed ozanimod to biotechnology startup Receptos, which Celgene purchased in 2015 for $7.2 billion. Celgene was acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb in 2019. Ozanimod is also being studied as a treatment for forms of inflammatory bowel disease, with late-stage clinical trials underway for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, for which it is a first-in-class treatment. The ozanimod approval for multiple sclerosis is the latest in a string of FDA-approved drugs to originate from Scripps Research's laboratories, following on most recent approval of tafamidis for the rare but often fatal heart disease known ATTR-CM. Scripps Research also invented drugs that have been brought to market to treat more than a dozen other high-need conditions including arthritis, lupus, respiratory distress syndrome, gastric cancer, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, hemophilia, anthrax inhalation and neuroblastoma. Additional drugs are in development for more than 10 other conditions, ranging from osteoarthritis to Parkinson's disease, with several in clinical trials. ""There are hardly any other academic institutions in the world that have the multidisciplinary expertise to discover a new disease-modifying compound and generate clinical data in support of its development,"" Rosen says. Additional molecules developed by Rosen and Roberts at Scripps Research are currently in phase 2 clinical trials for major depressive disease and anxiety, and in phase 1 studies for treatment of autism.

66afa428-1b2c-4a70-afc7-15f005798fe4,"Research provides new roadmap for repairing damaged brain cells in multiple sclerosis Research published today in the journal provides new understanding about how drugs can repair damaged brain cells that cause disability in patients with multiple sclerosis. Led by researchers at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, the study suggests new drug targets and potent early-stage drug candidates could lead to regenerative medicines for multiple sclerosis and other debilitating neurological diseases. Multiple sclerosis, a chronic and progressive disease affecting millions worldwide, is characterized by damage to the protective sheath that surrounds nerve cells. Without this insulating layer, called myelin, nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord struggle to transmit electrical impulses. As a result, multiple sclerosis patients suffer progressive loss of motor skills, vision and balance. The new study describes how drugs work to replenish myelin destroyed by multiple sclerosis. While the brain is known to have some capacity to regenerate new myelin during the early stages of multiple sclerosis, this innate repair process is overwhelmed as the disease progresses. ""Many labs, including at Case Western Reserve, had identified drug candidates that kickstart the formation of new myelin, but exactly how each of these molecules affected brain cell function wasn't clear,"" said Drew Adams, PhD, the Thomas F. Peterson, Jr. Professor of Novel Therapeutics and assistant professor of genetics and genome sciences at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. ""We were shocked to find that almost all of these previously identified molecules share the ability to inhibit specific enzymes that help to make cholesterol. This insight reorients drug discovery efforts onto these novel, druggable targets."" This study builds on prior work by co-author Paul Tesar, PhD, the Dr. Donald and Ruth Weber Goodman Professor of Innovative Therapeutics and associate professor of genetics and genome sciences at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. In work reported in 2015 in , Tesar identified a drug typically used to treat athlete's foot, called miconazole, as a potent enhancer of new myelin. In the current study, teams led by Adams and Tesar demonstrated that miconazole enhanced myelin formation by inhibiting an enzyme used by brain stem cells to produce cholesterol. Subsequent experiments identified more than 20 new drugs that enhance myelin formation by inhibiting closely-related cholesterol-producing enzymes. Surprisingly, drugs identified previously by labs across the world as enhancing new myelin also inhibited these same enzymes. ""The idea that almost all drug candidates that promote myelin repair inhibit the same enzyme targets represents a bold new paradigm for the field and may redirect the course of ongoing drug discovery efforts,"" said Tesar. New study may help improve walking capacity in people with multiple sclerosis New therapy may help treat or prevent multiple sclerosis Researchers identify a promising method to treat multiple sclerosis Normally, cellular pathways are crisscrossed, complex diagrams. But cholesterol biosynthesis is linear, said Adams, who is also a Mount Sinai Scholar. ""There is only one way in, and one way out. So when you block enzymes in the cholesterol pathway, the metabolites simply accumulate."" In the Adams laboratory, lead authors Zita Hubler and Dharmaraja Allimuthu, PhD, could detect distinct cholesterol intermediaries as they accumulated, allowing them to pinpoint which enzymes were being blocked by which drugs. Notably, several drugs accelerated myelin repair in mouse models of multiple sclerosis. Mouse experiments were performed in collaboration with Robert H. Miller, PhD, the Vivian Gill Distinguished Research Professor and professor of anatomy and cell biology at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences. To measure the formation of human myelin in the laboratory, the team used a new three-dimensional nerve cell culture model that closely mimics human brain tissue. Here too, the drug candidates promoted human myelin formation by blocking cholesterol pathway enzymes. A study describing this innovative model, developed in Tesar's laboratory, was also published today in . ""Together these studies provide new drug targets, new drug candidates, and new cholesterol pathway biomarkers to propel the development of medicines that can replenish lost myelin in patients with multiple sclerosis and related diseases,"" said Adams. While clinical candidates based on this work are not expected to enter clinical trials until 2019, say the authors, the new understanding of myelin repair provides a promising new path toward novel, regenerative multiple sclerosis treatments.​ Posted in: | | Tags: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Simple sugar in human breast milk can promote myelin repair in multiple sclerosis patients Study reveals new biomarker for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Study identifies determinants of unemployment in individuals with multiple sclerosis Study shows how autoimmune diseases may be targeted using Treg-based cellular therapies Novel compound appears to protect myelin and nerve fibers Anti-inflammatory therapy helps slow progression of multiple sclerosis in a preclinical model Study shows how genetic predisposition contributes to the development of multiple sclerosis Gene therapy can effectively treat mice with tuberous sclerosis complex, shows study The opinions expressed here are the views of the writer and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of News Medical.

Tourbah, Tatyana Trushnikova, Antonio Uccelli, M. Vachova, Martin Valis, Laszlo Vecsei, Sandrine Wiertlewski, M. Zaffaroni, Tomasz Zielinski Background: Opicinumab is a human monoclonal antibody against LINGO-1, an inhibitor of oligodendrocyte differentiation and axonal regeneration. Previous findings suggested that opicinumab treatment might enhance remyelination in patients with CNS demyelinating diseases. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of opicinumab in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Methods: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 study (SYNERGY) at 72 sites in 12 countries. Participants (aged 18–58 years) with relapsing multiple sclerosis (relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with relapses) were randomised in a 1:2:2:2:2 ratio by an interactive voice and web response system to opicinumab 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, or 100 mg/kg, or placebo. An identical volume of study drug was administered intravenously once every 4 weeks. All participants self-administered intramuscular interferon beta-1a as background anti-inflammatory treatment once a week. The primary endpoint was the percentage of participants achieving confirmed disability improvement over 72 weeks, which was a multicomponent endpoint measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, the Timed 25-Foot Walk, the Nine-Hole Peg Test, and the 3 s Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. The primary endpoint was analysed under intention-to-treat principles. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01864148. Findings: Between Aug 13, 2013, and July 31, 2014, 419 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned either placebo (n=93) or opicinumab 3 mg/kg (n=45), 10 mg/kg (n=95), 30 mg/kg (n=94; one patient did not receive the assigned treatment), or 100 mg/kg (n=92). The last patient visit was on March 29, 2016. Confirmed disability improvement over 72 weeks was seen in 45 (49%) of 91 patients assigned to placebo, 21 (47%) of 45 assigned to opicinumab 3 mg/kg, 59 (63%) of 94 assigned to opicinumab 10 mg/kg, 59 (65%) of 91 assigned to opicinumab 30 mg/kg, and 36 (40%) of 91 assigned to opicinumab 100 mg/kg. A linear dose-response in the probability of confirmed disability improvement was not seen (linear trend test p=0·89). Adverse events occurred in 79 (85%) patients assigned placebo and in 275 (85%) assigned any dose of opicinumab. The most common adverse events of any grade in patients assigned any dose of opicinumab included influenza-like illness (140 [43%] with any dose of opicinumab vs 37 [40%] with placebo), multiple sclerosis relapses (117 [36%] vs 30 [32%]), and headache (51 [16%] vs 23 [25%]). Serious adverse events reported as related to treatment were urinary tract infection in one (1%) participant in the the placebo group, suicidal ideation and intentional overdose in one (1%) participant in the 30 mg/kg opicinumab group, bipolar disorder in one (1%) participant in the 100 mg/kg opicinumab group, and hypersensitivity in four (4%) participants in the 100 mg/kg opicinumab group. One patient in the opicinumab 30 mg/kg group died during the study due to a traffic accident, which was not considered related to study treatment. Interpretation: Our findings did not show a significant dose-linear improvement in disability compared with placebo in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Further studies are needed to investigate whether some subpopulations identified in the study might benefit from opicinumab treatment at an optimum dose. Funding: Biogen.

Previous findings suggested that opicinumab treatment might enhance remyelination in patients with CNS demyelinating diseases. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of opicinumab in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Methods: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 study (SYNERGY) at 72 sites in 12 countries. Participants (aged 18–58 years) with relapsing multiple sclerosis (relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with relapses) were randomised in a 1:2:2:2:2 ratio by an interactive voice and web response system to opicinumab 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, or 100 mg/kg, or placebo. An identical volume of study drug was administered intravenously once every 4 weeks. All participants self-administered intramuscular interferon beta-1a as background anti-inflammatory treatment once a week. The primary endpoint was the percentage of participants achieving confirmed disability improvement over 72 weeks, which was a multicomponent endpoint measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, the Timed 25-Foot Walk, the Nine-Hole Peg Test, and the 3 s Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. The primary endpoint was analysed under intention-to-treat principles. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01864148. Findings: Between Aug 13, 2013, and July 31, 2014, 419 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned either placebo (n=93) or opicinumab 3 mg/kg (n=45), 10 mg/kg (n=95), 30 mg/kg (n=94; one patient did not receive the assigned treatment), or 100 mg/kg (n=92). The last patient visit was on March 29, 2016. Confirmed disability improvement over 72 weeks was seen in 45 (49%) of 91 patients assigned to placebo, 21 (47%) of 45 assigned to opicinumab 3 mg/kg, 59 (63%) of 94 assigned to opicinumab 10 mg/kg, 59 (65%) of 91 assigned to opicinumab 30 mg/kg, and 36 (40%) of 91 assigned to opicinumab 100 mg/kg. A linear dose-response in the probability of confirmed disability improvement was not seen (linear trend test p=0·89). Adverse events occurred in 79 (85%) patients assigned placebo and in 275 (85%) assigned any dose of opicinumab. The most common adverse events of any grade in patients assigned any dose of opicinumab included influenza-like illness (140 [43%] with any dose of opicinumab vs 37 [40%] with placebo), multiple sclerosis relapses (117 [36%] vs 30 [32%]), and headache (51 [16%] vs 23 [25%]). Serious adverse events reported as related to treatment were urinary tract infection in one (1%) participant in the the placebo group, suicidal ideation and intentional overdose in one (1%) participant in the 30 mg/kg opicinumab group, bipolar disorder in one (1%) participant in the 100 mg/kg opicinumab group, and hypersensitivity in four (4%) participants in the 100 mg/kg opicinumab group. One patient in the opicinumab 30 mg/kg group died during the study due to a traffic accident, which was not considered related to study treatment. Interpretation: Our findings did not show a significant dose-linear improvement in disability compared with placebo in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Further studies are needed to investigate whether some subpopulations identified in the study might benefit from opicinumab treatment at an optimum dose. Funding: Biogen."", author = ""D.

Miller The change of brain lesion load, measured on T-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using computer-assisted techniques, is a widely used secondary endpoint for phase III clinical trials in multiple sclerosis (MS). Collection, transfer, and analysis of the electronic data across multiple centers have all proved challenging and give rise to potential errors. However, many new acquisition schemes and postprocessing techniques have been developed; these may reduce scan times and result in better lesion conspicuity or lessen the human interaction needed for data analysis. This review considers many aspects of the use of MRI in clinical trials for MS and provides international consensus guidelines, derived from a task force of the European Magnetic Resonance Networks in Multiple Sclerosis (MAGNIMS) together with a group of North American experts. The main points considered are the organization of correctly powered trials and selection of participating sites; the appropriate choice of pulse sequences and image acquisition protocol given the current state of technology; quality assurance for data acquisition and analysis; accuracy and reproducibility of lesion load assessments; and the potential for the application of quantitative methods to other MRI-derived measures of disease burden.

Baranzini, Philip L. de Jager, Multiple sclerosis is a heterogeneous disease with an unpredictable course and a wide range of severity; some individuals rapidly progress to a disabled state whereas others experience only mild symptoms. Though genetic studies have identified variants that are associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis, no variants have been consistently associated with multiple sclerosis severity. In part, the lack of findings is related to inherent limitations of clinical rating scales; these scales are insensitive to early degenerative changes that underlie disease progression. Optical coherence tomography imaging of the retina and low-contrast letter acuity correlate with and predict clinical and imaging-based outcomes in multiple sclerosis. Therefore, they may serve as sensitive phenotypes to discover genetic predictors of disease course. We conducted a set of genome-wide association studies of longitudinal structural and functional visual pathway phenotypes in multiple sclerosis. First, we assessed genetic predictors of ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer atrophy in a discovery cohort of 374 patients with multiple sclerosis using mixed-effects models adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, optic neuritis and genetic ancestry and using a combination of single-variant and network-based analyses. For candidate variants identified in discovery, we conducted a similar set of analyses of ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer thinning in a replication cohort (n = 376). Second, we assessed genetic predictors of sustained loss of 5-letters in low-contrast letter acuity in discovery (n = 582) using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. We then evaluated candidate variants/pathways in a replication cohort. (n = 253). Results of both studies revealed novel subnetworks highly enriched for connected genes in early complement activation linked to measures of disease severity. Within these networks, C3 was the gene most strongly associated with ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer atrophy (P = 0.004) and C1QA and CR1 were top results in analysis of sustained low-contrast letter acuity loss. Namely, variant rs158772, linked to C1QA, and rs61822967, linked to CR1, were associated with 71% and 40% increases in risk of sustained LCLA loss, respectively, in meta-analysis pooling discovery and replication cohorts (rs158772: hazard ratio: 1.71; 95% confidence interval 1.30–2.25; P = 1.3 × 10; rs61822967: hazard ratio: 1.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.16–1.68; P = 4.1 × 10). In conclusion, early complement pathway gene variants were consistently associated with structural and functional measures of multiple sclerosis severity. These results from unbiased analyses are strongly supported by several prior reports that mechanistically implicated early complement factors in neurodegeneration.

Results of both studies revealed novel subnetworks highly enriched for connected genes in early complement activation linked to measures of disease severity. Within these networks, C3 was the gene most strongly associated with ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer atrophy (P = 0.004) and C1QA and CR1 were top results in analysis of sustained low-contrast letter acuity loss. Namely, variant rs158772, linked to C1QA, and rs61822967, linked to CR1, were associated with 71% and 40% increases in risk of sustained LCLA loss, respectively, in meta-analysis pooling discovery and replication cohorts (rs158772: hazard ratio: 1.71; 95% confidence interval 1.30–2.25; P = 1.3 × 10-4; rs61822967: hazard ratio: 1.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.16–1.68; P = 4.1 × 10-4). In conclusion, early complement pathway gene variants were consistently associated with structural and functional measures of multiple sclerosis severity. These results from unbiased analyses are strongly supported by several prior reports that mechanistically implicated early complement factors in neurodegeneration.

30c124f4-0535-41d8-8afe-54d8b8ab9c54,"Bryostatin-1 alleviates experimental multiple sclerosis , Matthew D. Smith, Hasti Atashi Shirazi, , , Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disorder targeting the central nervous system (CNS). The relapsing-remitting phase of MS is largely driven by peripheral activation of autoreactive T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 lymphocytes. In contrast, compartmentalized inflammation within the CNS, including diffuse activation of innate myeloid cells, characterizes the progressive phase of MS, the most debilitating phase that currently lacks satisfactory treatments. Recently, bryostatin-1 (bryo-1), a naturally occurring, CNS-permeable compound with a favorable safety profile in humans, has been shown to act on antigen-presenting cells to promote differentiation of lymphocytes into Th2 cells, an action that might benefit Th1-driven inflammatory conditions such as MS. In the present study, we show that bryo-1 provides marked benefit in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an experimental MS animal model. Preventive treatment with bryo-1 abolishes the onset of neurologic deficits in EAE. More strikingly, bryo-1 reverses neurologic deficits after EAE onset, even when treatment is initiated at a late stage of disease when peak adaptive immunity has subsided. Treatment with bryo-1 in vitro promotes an anti-inflammatory phenotype in antigen-presenting dendritic cells, macrophages, and to a lesser extent, lymphocytes. These findings suggest the potential for bryo-1 as a therapeutic agent in MS, particularly given its established clinical safety. Furthermore, the benefit of bryo-1, even in late treatment of EAE, combined with its targeting of innate myeloid cells suggests therapeutic potential in progressive forms of MS.

Boyko, , O. O. Favorova Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common complex neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. It develops with autoimmune inflammation and demyelination. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) serve as a powerful tool for investigating the genetic architecture of MS and are generally used to identify the genetic factors of disease susceptibility, clinical phenotypes, and treatment response. This review considers the main achievements and challenges of using GWAS to identify the genes involved in MS. It also describes hypothesis-driven studies with extensive genome coverage of the selected regions, complementary to GWASs. To date, over 100 MS risk loci have been identified by the combination of both approaches; 40 of them were found in at least two GWASs and meet genome-wide significance threshold (p ≤ 5 × 10) in at least one GWAS, whereas the threshold for the rest of GWASs was set in our review at p < 1 × 10. Yet, MS risk loci identified to date explain only a part of the total heritability, and the reasons of “missing heritability” are discussed.

Thirty patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and 17 healthy control subjects underwent single-voxel MEGA-PRESS (MEscher-GArwood Point RESolved Spectroscopy) magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3 T, to quantify gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in the prefrontal cortex, right hippocampus and left sensorimotor cortex. All subjects were assessed clinically and underwent a cognitive assessment. Multiple linear regression models were used to compare differences in gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations between patients and controls adjusting for age, gender and tissue fractions within each spectroscopic voxel. Regression was used to examine the relationships between the cognitive function and physical disability scores specific for these regions with gamma-aminobuytric acid levels, adjusting for age, gender, and total N-acetyl-aspartate and glutamine-glutamate complex levels. When compared with controls, patients performed significantly worse on all motor and sensory tests, and were cognitively impaired in processing speed and verbal memory. Patients had significantly lower gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in the hippocampus (adjusted difference = -0.403 mM, 95% confidence intervals -0.792, -0.014, P = 0.043) and sensorimotor cortex (adjusted difference = -0.385 mM, 95% confidence intervals -0.667, -0.104, P = 0.009) compared with controls. In patients, reduced motor function in the right upper and lower limb was associated with lower gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration in the sensorimotor cortex. Specifically for each unit decrease in gamma-aminobutyric acid levels (in mM), there was a predicted -10.86 (95% confidence intervals -16.786 to -4.482) decrease in grip strength (kg force) (P < 0.001) and -8.74 (95% confidence intervals -13.943 to -3.015) decrease in muscle strength (P < 0.006). This study suggests that reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid levels reflect pathological abnormalities that may play a role in determining physical disability. These abnormalities may include decreases in the pre- and postsynaptic components of gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission and in the density of inhibitory neurons. Additionally, the reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration may contribute to the neurodegenerative process, resulting in increased firing of axons, with consequent increased energy demands, which may lead to neuroaxonal degeneration and loss of the compensatory mechanisms that maintain motor function. This study supports the idea that modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission may be an important target for neuroprotection in multiple sclerosis.

Kynurenine pathway metabolomics predicts and provides mechanistic insight into multiple sclerosis progression Kynurenine pathway metabolomics predicts and provides mechanistic insight into multiple sclerosis progression , Article number:  () Activation of the kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan metabolism results from chronic inflammation and is known to exacerbate progression of neurodegenerative disease. To gain insights into the links between inflammation, the KP and multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis, we investigated the KP metabolomics profile of MS patients. Most significantly, we found aberrant levels of two key KP metabolites, kynurenic acid (KA) and quinolinic acid (QA). The balance between these metabolites is important as it determines overall excitotoxic activity at the N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor. We also identified that serum KP metabolic signatures in patients can discriminate clinical MS subtypes with high sensitivity and specificity. A C5.0 Decision Tree classification model discriminated the clinical subtypes of MS with a sensitivity of 91%. After validation in another independent cohort, sensitivity was maintained at 85%. Collectively, our studies suggest that abnormalities in the KP may be associated with the switch from early-mild stage MS to debilitating progressive forms of MS and that analysis of KP metabolites in MS patient serum may have application as MS disease biomarkers. Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that inflammation contributes to neurodegeneration and is linked to multiple sclerosis (MS) progression. Weiner HL (2009) described how the adaptive immunity mediated by auto-reactive T-cells, fuels the early stages of MS (i.e. relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; RRMS), while monocytic cells of the innate immunity contribute to further neuronal degeneration that exacerbates disease progression leading to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). However, it is not well understood why approximately 50% of RRMS patients progress to secondary progressive MS, while 50% do not. We sought to better understand the mechanistic drivers of this switch. As the kynurenine pathway (KP) of the tryptophan metabolism is highly inducible in inflammatory environments, we hypothesized that changes in the KP may be associated with the progressive switch in MS. The kynurenine pathway (KP) is the major route that breaks down tryptophan subsequently leading to the production of NAD. In the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the KP is induced by activation of its first enzyme, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1). Metabolites produced along the KP can have neurotoxic or neuroprotective effects. Quinolinic acid (QA) is perhaps the most important, leading acutely to human neuronal death and chronically to dysfunction by at least 7 separate mechanisms, of which, N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor excitotoxicity is the best characterised. Within the brain and CNS, QA is produced by activated microglia and infiltrating macrophages but not in neurons or astrocytes. Kynurenic acid (KA), produced by astrocytes, is an antagonist of ionotropic glutamate receptors and thus blocks the excitotoxic effects of QA, KA also has antioxidant activity, readily scavenging hydroxyl, superoxide anion and other free radicals. Indeed, in disease states where excess QA is produced, it is thought that there is insufficient KA to block QA. Accordingly, we examined the role of the KP in MS progression as it potentially links inflammation-induced activation of the KP, the production of the glutamatergic (NMDA)-modulatory metabolites, KA and QA, to excitotoxic neurodegeneration. This metabolic shift may explain why the inflammatory milieu in RRMS changes to a neurodegenerative one in SPMS and may even constitute a unique metabolic biomarker of MS progression. Currently, there are no biomarkers that can identify this transition, and a suitable biomarker would be useful for assessing patient prognosis and potentially new therapeutics. All studies were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the relevant institutional human research ethics committee and approved by St Vincent’s Hospital Sydney (HREC– H03/037) and Macquarie University (HREC – 5201300333). Our study adheres to ‘The code of ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki)’ for experiments involving human subjects. Written consent was obtained from respective sources that provided the samples. In order to thoroughly profile KP metabolism in MS, samples were obtained through the Accelerated Cure Project for Multiple Sclerosis (ACPMS), USA, and consisted of serum samples from patients with RRMS, SPMS, primary progressive (PPMS) and healthy controls (HC) subjects. Exclusion criteria included MS patients currently receiving disease modifying drugs or who had corticosteroid within the past 3 months, or presence of other medical conditions. Randomized samples were age and gender matched between the experimental groups (i.e. RRMS, SPMS, PPMS and HC) where possible. As repeated blood samples collected over two years were available, offered the ability to track changes in the KP longitudinally and was obtained through the Tasmanian MS Longitudinal Study conducted between 2003 and 2005. To further validate our study, we sourced another cohort of MS patients () with matched same-patient serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from The Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Resource Center (HBSFRC), USA. All samples were unsorted and re-labelled for blinding prior to analysis. All reagents and KP metabolites were analytical reagent grade and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO), unless otherwise stated. Deuterated internal standards were purchased from Medical Isotopes, Inc (Pelham, NH). KP metabolites were extracted using 10% (/) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) with equal volume of serum samples in accordance with methods previously described. CSF samples were prepared similarly to serum samples except that deproteinization with TCA was not performed. Concurrent analysis of tryptophan, kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynrenine (3-HK), 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA), and anthranilic acid (AA) was performed with UHPLC as described by Jones ., using an injection volume of 20 μL of the prepared extract from each samples. KA detection was performed using a gradient mobile phase comprise of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer supplement with 25 mM zinc acetate (dihydrate) to enhance fluorescence intensity and 2.25% acetonitrile as organic modifier (Solvent A), and 10% acetonitrile (Solvent B). Each sample (10 μL) was injected into a Poroshell RRHT C-18, 1.8 μm 2.1 × 100 mm column (Agilent Technologies, Inc, Santa Clara, CA) maintained at 38 °C for 12 min run time at a unison flowrate of 0.75 mL/min. The gradient elution consisted of 100% solvent A for 3 min and then 50% solvent A and 50% solvent B for 2 min, followed by 100% B for 2 min and 100% solvent A (run time 10 min). This gradient ensures sufficient time for KA retention while minimizing potential build-up of pressure due to precipitation of the high salt buffer. Detection of KA used fluorescence (excitation and emission wavelengths of 344 and 388 nm, respectively with a retention time of 1.5 min). Agilent OpenLAB CDS ChemStation (Edition C.01.04) was used to analyze the chromatograms (). For GCMS, 50 μL of the prepared extract were derivatized. Concurrent analysis of PA and QA were carried out as described by Smythe . with slight modification using an Agilent 7890 A GC system coupled with Agilent 5975 C mass spectrometry detector and Agilent 7693 A autosampler (Agilent Technologies, Inc, Santa Clara, CA) with one microliter of derivatized mixture. Separation of PA and QA were achieved with a DB-5MS column, 0.25 μm film thickness, 0.25 mm × 30 m capillary column (Agilent Technologies, Inc, Santa Clara, CA) within 7 min but the assay run time was set for 12 min to prevent sample carryover. Concentrations of PA and QA were analyzed using Agilent GC/MSD ChemStation software (Edition 02.02.1431) and interpolated from the established six-point calibration curves based on the abundance count ratio of the metabolites to their corresponding deuterated internal standards within each standards and samples (). The intra- and inter-assay CV was within the acceptable range of 4–8% for UHPLC assays and 7–10% for GCMS assays calculated from the repeated measures of the metabolites standards incorporated during the sequence run. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) was measured with 20 μL of neat serum using a previously described method. Quantification of multiplexing cytokines, chemokines and growth factors was performed using commercial 27-plex magnetic bead based immunoassay kits (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) on . Each assay was performed in accordance to manufacturer’s instructions at the Australian Proteome Analysis Facility, as described by A. Khan. Final readout of the sample concentration was expressed as picogram per millilitre (pg/mL) based on the standard curves integrated in the assay using the Bio-Plex Manager v5.0 software with reproducible intra- and inter-assay CV of 5–8%. The normality of the variables, where required, was checked by Shapiro-Wilk and/or Kolmogorov Smirnov normality tests and equality of the variances by Levene’s test for equality of variances. Comparisons between different MS subtypes and control group were performed by either ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis test, depending on the normality and equal variances analyses. Correlations between variables in were assessed by Pearson’s correlations; where required, log transformation of the variables was made before calculating correlations. A -value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests, depending on the distribution of the variables were applied to investigate the changes to the inflammatory mediators and KP variables from where the patients were observed between the years 2003 (baseline, cohort enrollment) and 2005. Four classification methods were used to identify the relative predictive value of each of the variables in each MS subtype in (Training set) and then validated against (Test set). These methods included the Classification and Regression Tree, Support Vector Machines, Discriminant Analysis and C5.0 Decision Tree. A classification model was considered successful when it consistently returned high predictive accuracy rates across all three MS subtypes and control group. The model predictions were compared to random predictions (class specific lifts) to decide which model was best for future predictions. In addition, class-specific statistical powers were compared to identify the best classification model. All classification models were developed using IBM SPSS Modeler 14.2, and R incorporated with various R packages such as Rcmdr, Lawstat, MASS, CAR and Lattice. To investigate whether changes to the CSF KP profiles mirrored serum KP profiles in the controls and MS subtypes of , we developed a series of models to identify the best relationships between the CSF KP variables and serum KP variables in the experimental groups. In the first model (model 1), we investigated whether it was possible to predict the CSF value for a KP variable based on its paired serum sample variable. In the second model (model 2), we added the experimental groups as covariates to model 1 to predict the CSF variables. In the last model (model 3), we used model 2 but adjusted for potential confounding factors from all other serum KP variables. We compared these models based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) and adjusted R, to identify the best model(s). made up a total of 136 participants consisting of 50 RRMS, 20 SPMS, 17 PPMS and 49 HC. Age differences between the subtypes were adjusted accordingly in the subsequent analysis. Similarly a total of 59 participants consisting of 44 RRMS and 15 SPMS from were included in this study. Each participant provided a baseline and follow-up (1.72 years ±0.27) serum samples for analysis. A total of 36 participants from met exclusion criteria and provided CSF and matching serum. Accordingly, consisted of 10 patients with RRMS, 20 patients with SPMS and 6 HC. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects in all cohorts are summarized in . KP activation occurs when the activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1; the first enzyme in the KP) is significantly higher, leading to the consumption of kynurenine and higher kynurenine/tryptophan (K/T) ratio. In all the MS subtype groups the K/T ratio was significantly increased compared to the HC group (p < 0.0001, ; see for complete KP profile). These data also emphasize the importance of analyzing both TRP and KYN to determine KP activation, as relying on a single metabolite can lead to misinterpretation of data. Abnormal downstream KP metabolites production in MS indicating excitotoxicity As noted above, KA is capable of preventing glutamate-induced excitotoxicity induced by QA. Significantly, we found that KA levels were highest in the RRMS group relative to HC and progressive MS groups (p < 0.0001, ). However, KA levels were significantly lower in the progressive MS groups relative to controls. Picolinic acid, another known neuroprotective KP metabolite, showed a similar trend to KA, being highest in the RRMS but lowest in the PPMS, groups (p < 0.0001, ). Production of QA increased uniformly in concert with disease severity and was particularly elevated in the PPMS group (p < 0.0001, ). We also found decreased NAD+ in all MS patient groups (p < 0.0001, ) which is also indicative of net QA elevation. The QA/KA ratio is indicative of excitotoxic potential with higher QA/KA ratio value favoring excitotoxicity. The QA/KA ratio was higher in both PPMS and SPMS groups compared to controls and the RRMS group (p < 0.0001, ). 3-HK, another potential neurotoxin, was found to be significantly higher in MS groups compared to healthy control (p < 0.0001, ). These data support our hypothesis that toxic KP metabolites fuel neurodegeneration in MS. KP profile changes involving innate immunity are associated with MS disease severity and subtype Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that the KP variables correlated significantly to Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores suggesting that perturbed KP metabolism may reflect the progression of the disease. Notably, the QA/KA ratio has the strongest correlation with EDSS (r = 0.62, p < 0.0001) underscoring the potential significance of these key KP parameters to the disability and severity of MS (). Using the Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired data analysis, we showed that the K/T ratio significantly increased over time (p = 0.029) in patients with RRMS demonstrating increased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1) activity (). We also found increased expression of the innate immunity signature proteins, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α (p = 0.004) and MIP-1β (p = 0.001) over time in RRMS that are produced by infiltrating macrophages (). This is accompanied by decrease in adaptive immune respond evident by decreased IL-2 level. Although IL-7 was shown to be significantly increased over time, however, the degree of change is very small (from 13 to 18 pg/ml) and unlikely to be clinically relevant. The KP and immune profiles predict the course of disease in MS Currently, there are no validated biomarkers of MS but our data suggests that certain metabolic KP signatures may discriminate MS subtype. To further explore the utility of KP metabolites as MS biomarkers, we applied predictive analytics. Initially, a predictive model was developed incorporating KP metabolites, inflammatory mediators and patient demographic information. The predictive model was then used to yield classification results, i.e., successful identification of MS subtype. From a total of 37 potential predictors, we found six that were the most critical determinants successfully predicting MS subtype (). These were KA, QA, tryptophan, PA, fibroblast growth factor-basic and tumour necrosis factor-α (in order of relevance). Using various classification models in Training Set, a C5.0 Decision Tree provided the best overall prediction achieving an accuracy of 91% shown in . We further validated the model using a Test set () and obtained a predictive accuracy of 83% (). This confirmed that our panel of 6 predictors can be used as a MS subtype biomarker. To confirm that a facile blood-based KP biomarker for MS is feasible, we correlated CSF KP variables to patient-paired serum profiles (Cohort 3). After adjusting for confounding factors (stratification of clinical grouping and presence of other KP parameters), our regression analysis indicated that serum KP metabolites were able to explain 62.9% (p < 0.001) of changes observed in patient-paired CSF KP variables () with a moderately strong (65%) to strong (79.3%) correlation between CSF and serum KP metabolites. We evaluated the KP in MS in order to explore the links between inflammation, the KP and MS disease progression. Our data indicates that KP metabolism is aberrant in MS, as shown by elevated K/T ratio in MS patients compared to healthy controls, confirming previous studies. Increased IDO-1 activity (as reflected by higher K/T ratios) is known to suppress the T-cell mediated response in MS via activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). We recently showed that kynurenine, the by-product of IDO1, is an endogenous ligand of the AhR that inhibits the inflammatory response in chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice model of MS. Indeed, inhibition of IDO1 in EAE mice leads to exacerbation of disease progression. Initially, induction of the KP (i.e., up-regulation of IDO-1) may be beneficial as IDO-1 mediates an immunomodulatory effect in MS that partially explains the therapeutic effect exerted by interferons and vitamin D in early-mild stages of MS. This is also reflected in our longitudinal data (Cohort 2) with elevated K/T ratio (i.e., increased IDO1 expression) in RRMS but not SPMS to maintain a stable EDSS. However, chronic IDO-1 activation changes the excitotoxic balance due to increased QA production and may also disrupt the biosynthesis of serotonin and melatonin in the brain, as these neurotransmitters are produced in separate branches of the KP that are dependent on tryptophan (). Considering that lower serotonin and melatonin have been associated with depression in MS and decreased melatonin is known to correlate to increased risk of MS relapse, restricted tryptophan availability caused by KP activation, may play a role in depression or relapse in MS. Given that the KP is known to be induced by inflammation, we found surprisingly few correlations between inflammatory mediators and KP modulations. However, a positive correlation was found between interferon (IFN)-g-inducible protein (IP)-10 with K/T ratio (r = 0.31, p < 0.001) and QA (r = 0.2, p < 0.001) indicating an IFN-γ mediated response. Although we did not see significant up-regulation/correlation with IFN-γ and the KP, this may reflect the acute-phase nature of IFN-γ. Considering that the innate immunity markers (MIP-1α and MIP-1β) increased over time in the longitudinal RRMS patient samples (), this implies that even with stable EDSS, the innate immune activity is still constitutively active. Activated innate cells such as macrophages or microglia are known to be the major source of pathophysiological concentrations of QA. We previously showed that oligodendrocytes exposed to QA from activated microglia take up QA leading to oligodendrocyte death. This was reversed by targeting QA production, either by a KP inhibitor or a specific QA targeting antibody. Collectively, our data provides evidence that, over time, the initially suppressive T-cell effect mediated by IDO-1 changes to a more chronic form of KP activation that leads to MS progression by the production of excitotoxic QA (and increased QA/KA ratio) by infiltrating macrophages. Our data support the concept that targeting innate cells may be a feasible immunotherapeutic approach to retard MS disease progression in MS which warrants further investigation. Increased levels of neuroprotective metabolites, KA and PA, were only observed in RRMS but not in SPMS or PPMS, while toxic metabolites, 3-HK and QA level were progressively increased in both SPMS and PPMS. These observations may imply a role for neurotoxic KP metabolites in mediating neurodegeneration in MS. As described above, QA mediates potent excitotoxicity at the NMDA receptor, whereas KA plays a neuroprotective role as it antagonizes QA excitotoxicity at this receptor. Hence, the balance between QA and KA (expressed as the QA/KA ratio) defines the overall glutamatergic activity at the NMDA receptor and determines whether QA-mediated neurodegenerative excitotoxicity prevails. The observed increased level of KA only in RRMS may be a compensatory mechanism in early-stage disease against QA-induced excitotoxicity, as suggested by the moderately strong correlation between QA/KA ratio and MS severity. It also indicates that the KP shunts towards production of KA, but not QA, during early disease course, whereas in later disease stages, the KP is shunted differently, favoring production of QA instead of KA. The mechanism(s) of this differential shunting remains unclear, but delineating these may suggest new therapeutic options. Additionally, as 3-HK is known to potentiate QA-induced excitotoxicity, the higher 3-HK levels in SPMS and PPMS patients observed in our study might also be relevant to the neurodegenerative process in MS. Our results are also consistent with the increased levels of 3-HK and QA found in tissues of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rat model of MS. Considered collectively, our results suggest that NMDA receptor mediated excitotoxicity is highly relevant in the neurodegeneration associated with progressive MS and may constitute a key threshold event in the switch from RRMS to SPMS. To our knowledge, this is the first study using targeted KP metabolomics as a blood-based prognostic biomarker capable of distinguishing MS subtype. Previously, decreased tryptophan was found in MS patients and described as a potential biomarker. However, this study only detected tryptophan and was not capable of detecting other downstream KP metabolites. This study also failed to distinguish between MS subtype. We showed that tryptophan and 3 other metabolites of the KP were important predictors of MS subtype and correlated to disease severity scores. Indeed, the four KP predictors accounted for approximately 90% of the predictive power of our built model with the two inflammatory mediators only adding 10% predictive power. This suggests that tryptophan metabolism is more relevant to MS pathology than general inflammation. The validity of model was confirmed when applied to an alternate and independent blinded set (Test set, ) where we observed a reproducible accuracy of 83%. One potential limitation of a blood based biomarker for neurological disease may be that blood parameters may not necessarily mirror those of the CNS. However, a previous study demonstrated that the blood KP profile followed closely with changes of the KP profile in CNS and our analysis (which included 3 more KP variables, i.e. K/T ratio, KA and PA) showed generally good to-strong plasma-CNS KP metabolite correlations in the range 65–79.3%. Potential factors limiting these correlations may include the inherent differences in the magnitude of CSF parameters relative to serum values and the fact that the length of storage time (over 10 years) in some of these samples may have led to the partial degradation of some analytes. Although, the key metabolites kynurenine and QA have been reported as relatively stable even after many years of storage. Notwithstanding these points, the moderately strong correlations between CSF and serum, confirms that the serum KP profile is a suitably sensitive blood-based predictor of disease progression in MS. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that KP parameters have a strong association with MS subtype, correlating with disease severity scores. The changing levels of KP metabolites we observed also provides a mechanistic insight that may explain the transition from the milder RRMS form to the more debilitating SPMS disease form. KP profiling is likely to be relevant to the pathogenesis of other diseases characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration, like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and ALS, where aberrant KP metabolism has been reported. Our results also suggest that strategies aimed rebalancing the KP, particularly in terms of QA/KA levels, could be useful therapeutic approaches in slowing neurodegeneration in MS. Lim, C. K. .

Systematic screening of generic drugs for progressive multiple sclerosis identifies clomipramine as a promising therapeutic Systematic screening of generic drugs for progressive multiple sclerosis identifies clomipramine as a promising therapeutic , Article number:  () The treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) is unsatisfactory. One reason is that the drivers of disease, which include iron-mediated neurotoxicity, lymphocyte activity, and oxidative stress, are not simultaneously targeted. Here we present a systematic screen to identify generic, orally available medications that target features of progressive MS. Of 249 medications that cross the blood–brain barrier, 35 prevent iron-mediated neurotoxicity in culture. Of these, several antipsychotics and antidepressants strongly reduce T-cell proliferation and oxidative stress. We focus on the antidepressant clomipramine and found that it additionally inhibits B-lymphocyte activity. In mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model of MS, clomipramine ameliorates clinical signs of acute and chronic phases. Histologically, clomipramine reduces inflammation and microglial activation, and preserves axonal integrity. In summary, we present a systematic approach to identify generic medications for progressive multiple sclerosis with the potential to advance rapidly into clinical trials, and we highlight clomipramine for further development. Multiple sclerosis is a multifactorial inflammatory condition of the CNS leading to damage of the myelin sheath and axons/neurons followed by neurological symptoms. Approximately 85% of multiple sclerosis patients present with a relapsing-remitting phenotype and the majority of these evolve to a secondary-progressive disease course after 15–20 years. 10–15% of the patients experience a primary progressive disease course with slow and continuous deterioration without definable relapses. While there have been tremendous successes in the development of medications for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis during the last decade, nearly all studies conducted in progressive multiple sclerosis have failed such as the recently published INFORMS study on the sphingosine-1-phosphate inhibitor fingolimod. However, the results of two Phase 3 trials of ocrelizumab in primary progressive and siponimod in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis were announced recently to have met their primary outcomes. Orcelizumab has since been approved for use in primary progressive MS. The reasons for the general lack of medications in progressive multiple sclerosis are manifold. One explanation is that the underlying pathology of progressive multiple sclerosis has profound differences to the relapsing-remitting form. Examples include the more pronounced neurodegenerative aspects of the progressive disease in conjunction with significant mitochondrial damage, iron accumulation which contributes to the elevated oxidative stress from several sources, and the more common representation of B-cell follicular structures underneath the meninges in progressive cases. Moreover, the blood–brain barrier in progressive multiple sclerosis appears to be repaired compared to the breach in relapsing-remitting disease, so medications will require the capacity to enter the CNS. Another pathologic feature seen in all types of multiple sclerosis but appears exacerbated in progressive cases is intense focal microglia activation. We previously conducted a systematic screen on microglia inhibition using the drug library of the NINDS Custom collection II (US Drug Collection); the majority of compounds in this library are generic medications. Out of 1040 compounds, 123 reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production by activated microglia by over 50%. Based on this research, we expanded our screen to investigate other features relevant to progressive multiple sclerosis, including the potential of generic compounds to affect iron-mediated neurotoxicity, maintain mitochondria integrity, and scavenge free radicals. We sought also to shortlist a compound for further activity against T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes, given that the adaptive immune response continues to be active within the CNS compartment in progressive multiple sclerosis, and we sought to interrogate whether the compound affects experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Out of 249 investigated medications, 35 prevented iron-mediated neurotoxicity in culture. Out of these, several reduced the proliferation of T-lymphocytes and had antioxidative potential. The tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine also affected B-lymphocyte proliferation, reduced clinical signs in acute EAE concomitant with improved histology, and improved the chronic phase in two EAE models. Generics protect against iron and rotenone neurotoxicity Of the 1040 compounds available in the NINDS Custom Collection II, we first conducted a search of available information to exclude those that were either experimental, agricultural, not available as oral drug, not listed at Health Canada, steroid hormones or veterinary medications. Moreover, we omitted those that were not known to cross the blood–brain barrier. We note that while we selected drugs that are orally available, for ease of use, this does not imply that injectable medications would not be effective medications in progressive multiple sclerosis, as illustrated by ocrelizumab recently. Out of the original list, 791 compounds were thus excluded and 249 were selected for further testing. The detailed information of each of the 249 compounds is provided in Supplementary Dataset . The 249 compounds were first tested against iron toxicity to human neurons in culture. Neurons were pre-incubated with each compound for 1 h followed by application of FeSO. Ferrous iron (25 and 50 μM) is very toxic to neurons, with >80% loss of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2)-labeled neurons by 24 h in most experiments compared to the control condition (Supplementary Figs. –, Supplementary Data set ). An example of iron toxicity and a drug screen is shown in Fig. . Of all drugs tested, 35 compounds showed statistically significant protection from FeSO-mediated neurotoxicity (Fig. ). Of these, antipsychotics, such as clozapine or periciazine, and tricyclic antidepressants, such as clomipramine or desipramine, exhibited strong protection, as shown after normalization across at least 2–4 experiments ( of four wells of cells per experiment per test condition) to the number of neurons of the respective control conditions (Fig. ). For example, while the average loss of neurons over 24 h in response to FeSO was 85.5% (i.e., 14.5% of surviving neurons compared to 100% of controls), clomipramine at 10 μM completely prevented neuronal loss (107.3% of controls). Other categories of medications with neuroprotective actions against iron included antihypertensives and some antibiotics. We note that minocycline, an antibiotic that reduces the conversion of a first demyelinating event to clinically definite multiple sclerosis in a Phase 3 clinical trial, was not included in the 1040 compounds; in a separate study, we find minocycline to completely prevent iron neurotoxicity as well. Live-cell imaging over 12 h supported the neuroprotective effects of drugs. We selected indapamide and desipramine for live imaging studies. Figure  and Supplementary Video  show that while the number of neurons with intracellular propidium iodide (PI), a dye that leaks across a compromised plasma membrane, in response to FeSO exposure increases progressively over 12 h, this was significantly attenuated by indapamide and desipramine. The 35 hits were further narrowed concerning their ability to cross the blood–brain barrier according to drugbank.ca, their side effect profile and tolerability. Although antipsychotics are not well tolerated they were further included in the screening due to their good blood–brain barrier penetrance. Out of these, a group of 23 compounds was chosen for their ability to prevent mitochondrial damage using rotenone, which inhibits the electron transfer from complex I of the respiratory chain to ubiquinone. Rotenone induced strong neurotoxicity to neurons (Fig. ). The tricyclic antidepressant trimipramine, the antipsychotics clozapine and periciazine, promethazine and the antihypertensives labetalol, methyldopa and indapamide reduced neurotoxicity, while clomipramine trended toward a protective activity (Fig. ). The effect size of rescue by medications was, however, small. Of note, rotenone induced marked morphological neuronal changes with retraction of neurites (Fig. ). Hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity of medications The biochemical cell-free hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity (HORAC) assay investigates the prevention of hydroxyl radical-mediated oxidation of fluorescein in comparison to the strong antioxidant gallic acid. The generation of hydroxyl radicals by a cobalt-driven Fenton-like reaction oxidizes fluorescein with progressive loss of fluorescence. The presence of an antioxidant reduces the loss of fluorescence over time. As noted in Fig. , gallic acid reduced the loss of fluorescence (upward shift) compared to a blank Fenton-driven reaction that is without antioxidant, while indapamide has an even higher activity. We compared the area under the curve of test compounds to that elicited by gallic acid to obtain the gallic acid equivalent (GAE). A GAE of 1 represents hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity similar to that of gallic acid, while a compound without antioxidant activity would produce a GAE close to 0. Some of the compounds tested exhibited stronger antioxidative properties than gallic acid with HORAC-GAEs >1 (Fig. ). These included indapamide (mean HORAC-GAE 4.1;  < 0.05; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis vs. gallic acid), mitoxantrone (5.6;  < 0.001), chlorpromazine (5.9;  < 0.001), clozapine (4.6;  < 0.05), and trimipramine (4.2;  < 0.05). Although not statistically significant compared to gallic acid, clomipramine had a HORAC-GAE of 2.1. Regarding the comparison to the blank condition (i.e., no antioxidant present), there was a significant upward shift by clomipramine of the slope over 60 min ( < 0.0001; two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis) (Fig. ). Thus, although clomipramine lacked significance against the strong antioxidative gallic acid, the compound exhibited strong antioxidative effects against the blank situation (in the absence of any antioxidant). Interestingly, the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine had strong oxidative effects (HORAC-GAE −5.00;  < 0.0001). Proliferation of T-lymphocytes is reduced by antidepressants We tested the capacity of compounds to affect T-cell proliferation (Fig. ). Splenocytes activated by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 to trigger the proliferation of T-cells had reduced incorporation of [H]-thymidine upon treatment with dipyridamole (mean reduction 89.3%;  < 0.0001; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis compared to activated splenocytes), cefaclor (23%;  < 0.01), labetalol (26.8%,  < 0.0001 for this and subsequent compounds listed here), mefloquine (62.3%), mitoxantrone (99.7%), trimeprazine (43.3%), chlorpromazine (99.4%), periciazine (28%), promethazine (74.6%), clomipramine (68.2%), desipramine (92.2%), imipramine (66.4%), trimipramine (54%), and doxepin (85.3%, all  < 0.0001). Of note, methyldopa and memantine increased proliferation (methyldopa 41.4%,  < 0.0001; memantine 17.5%,  < 0.05). Mitoxantrone and chlorpromazine, however, had toxic effects (data not shown). As indapamide did not reduce T-cell proliferation, we did not pursue it further in the T-cell prominent disease, EAE. Focus on clomipramine in vitro and in acute and chronic EAE We selected clomipramine for further study as it is a well-tolerated antidepressant and crosses the blood–brain barrier very well (drugbank.ca). Moreover, in our assays, clomipramine showed strong effects against iron-mediated neurotoxicity (mean % anti-MAP-2-positive cells normalized to control of 107.3%, representing complete protection against iron toxicity) (Fig. ), had antioxidative properties (HORAC-GAE 2.1 where the effect of the antioxidant gallic acid is normalized at 1) (Fig. ), and reduced T-lymphocyte proliferation (by 68.2%) (Fig. ). We began with a concentration response with the intent of investigating lower concentrations since plasma concentration in human of clomipramine as an antidepressant average 122 ng/ml (387 nM), but can peak to more than 600 nM in some individuals. Figure  shows that clomipramine had a progressive significant increase in neuroprotection against iron toxicity from 100 nM. The effect was mediated in part by chelation with iron, as washing away clomipramine from neurons led to cell death, while pre-incubation with iron before application to neurons totally preserved neuronal viability (Fig. ). We were able to observe the protection by clomipramine in a live-cell imaging study, in which the increasing number of PI-positive neurons over time in response to iron was attenuated by clomipramine (Fig. , Supplementary Video ). T-lymphocyte proliferation was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by clomipramine but significant reduction occurred only from 5 µM ( < 0.01; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis compared to activated T-lymphocytes) (Fig. ). This was reflected by a cell cycle arrest with more cells in G1 ( < 0.05) and less in the S-phase ( < 0.05) from 2 µM (Fig. ). Due to the growing knowledge about the importance of B-cell follicular structures for progressive multiple sclerosis, we sought to evaluate the effect of clomipramine on B-cell activation. BCR/anti-CD40L/IL-4 activation of B-cells increased their proliferation and production of TNF-α (Fig. ) and these were reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by clomipramine from 2 µM. We then investigated clomipramine in acute EAE. Therapy with clomipramine from day 5 after induction of MOG-EAE delayed onset of clinical signs by 2 days with a significantly better early disease course between days 11 and 18 (Fig. ), which was reflected in an overall lower burden of disability (Fig. ). However, eventually, clomipramine-treated animals succumbed to EAE and increased disability (Fig. ). We then sought to investigate whether initiation of treatment from the day of MOG-induction could improve the outcome of EAE. Remarkably, early treatment initiation completely suppressed the manifestation of clinical signs (Fig. ). While most animals in the vehicle group had a high disease burden, as shown by the sum of scores for each individual animal (Fig. ) and weight loss (Fig. ), this was profoundly ameliorated in treated mice over the course of study. PCR analyses of the spinal cord revealed that the significant elevation in vehicle-EAE mice of transcripts encoding ,,, and were abrogated in clomipramine-EAE mice (Fig. ). Investigation of serum levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine (DMCL), in mice sacrificed 1 h after the last of 16 daily clomipramine injections showed mean concentrations of 751 and 101 nM, respectively (Fig. ). Incredibly, the corresponding mean spinal cord levels were 28 and 1.5 μM; a similar high brain to plasma ratio of clomipramine was reported by Marty et al. in mice injected with a single 8 mg/kg clomipramine IP. There was a strong correlation of serum and spinal cord levels for both clomipramine and DMCL across mice (Fig. ). Histological analysis of the spinal cord showed profound parenchymal inflammation in vehicle-treated animals with a histological score of 4.3, whereas clomipramine-treated animals only had few inflammatory cells in the meninges (score 1.7;  < 0.001; non-parametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney test) (Fig. ) that were inadequate to produce clinical manifestations as noted in Fig. . Infiltration in vehicle-treated animals was accompanied by massive microglial activation, whereas clomipramine treatment prevented microglial activation, as assessed by Iba1 staining ( < 0.01) (Fig. ). Furthermore, clomipramine-treated animals had significantly less axonal damage ( < 0.01) (Fig. ). Infiltration and microglial activation correlated with axonal injury (Spearman  = 0.7599,  < 0.01; Spearman  = 0.774,  < 0.01, respectively; non-parametric two-tailed Spearman correlation with 95% confidence interval) (Fig. ). We next set out to investigate the effect of clomipramine in chronic EAE. We first evaluated clomipramine initiated only after the first relapse when mice were in remission (day 31). In our hands, using the more sensitive 15-point EAE scoring system (rather than the conventional 5-point scale), MOG-EAE mice can be documented to undergo a second relapse after a remission period. Clomipramine did not affect the severity of the second relapse when initiated in mice at remission (Fig. ), likely because substantial neural injury had already occurred from a prolonged EAE course. In another experiment, we treated MOG-immunized C57BL/6 mice from the first onset of clinical signs (day 13, Fig. ). Treatment with clomipramine attenuated the marked rise in clinical disability and had a significant positive effect during days 14–20 ( = 0.0175; non-parametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney test). During remission, likely because the severity of disability was low, the vehicle and clomipramine-treated groups did not differ. Disease was then followed by a second increase in clinical scores in vehicle-treated mice, which was prevented by clomipramine (days 42–50;  = 0.0007). Another model of chronic EAE, thought to model secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, is immunization with spinal cord homogenate (SCH) in the Biozzi ABH mouse. Clomipramine treatment was started at the onset of clinical signs where it reduced clinical severity throughout the period of treatment ( = 0.0062) (Fig. ). In summary, clomipramine reduced clinical severity in acute and chronic EAE in two different mouse models. Figure  schematizes that the initiation of clomipramine treatment from onset of clinical signs of EAE attenuates the clinical disability observed during relapses or in chronic disease. Unlike relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, trials in progressive multiple sclerosis have largely failed so far. One important explanation is the lack of directed actions of medications against features that drive the pathophysiology of progressive multiple sclerosis, and the lack of consideration of penetration of agents into the CNS. The latter is important as the blood–brain barrier appears relatively intact in progressive compared to the relapsing-remitting form, and pathogenic processes ongoing within the CNS may not be amendable to periphery-acting medications. To circumvent these challenges, we have employed bioassay screens that model aspects of progressive multiple sclerosis. Moreover, we have opted to test generic medications that have data of good access into the CNS. One pathogenic hallmark important for the progression of multiple sclerosis is iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Iron accumulates in the CNS age dependently and iron deposition concomitant with T-cell infiltration and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in microglia in the deep gray matter correlates with progression and is associated with neurodegeneration. The deposition of iron amplifies inflammation and exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction through oxidative stress, eventually leading to neurodegeneration. Targeting iron is thus considered a promising therapeutic approach in progressive multiple sclerosis. Based on a screen of potential microglial inhibitors performed by our group, we investigated the potential of promising generic compounds to prevent iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Out of 249 compounds screened, 35 medications which prevented against iron-mediated neurotoxicity were in the drug classes of antidepressants ( = 5), antibiotics ( = 4), antipsychotics ( = 3), antimalarials ( = 2), and others. Some of the drugs had consistent outstanding neuroprotective effects, and these included antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants. The high number of antipsychotics and antidepressants as positive hits in the screening was striking. In addition to the rescue effect against iron-mediated neurotoxicity, several drugs showed promising results in other modes of toxicity; these were desipramine, clozapine, indapamide, and labetalol which were active against damage to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Data were corroborated by the investigation of antioxidative potential and the influence on splenocyte proliferation. Clomipramine showed outstanding effects in several in vitro settings such as against iron-mediated neurotoxicity, hydroxyl scavenging capacity, and inhibition of T-cell and B-cell proliferation; in mice, clomipramine treatment suppressed occurrence of disease in EAE completely, concomitant with reduced transcripts of chemotactic and inflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord, reduced inflammation, microglial activation, and preservation of axons. Moreover, clomipramine ameliorated clinical signs in chronic EAE in two different EAE models, C57BL/6 and Biozzi ABH mice. The work presented here constitutes a systematic approach to identify generic compounds that could be useful for the treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis. First, we focused on ameliorating major hallmarks of progressive multiple sclerosis such as iron-mediated neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and immune cell proliferation. Second, we chose generic drugs which are available as oral formulations. The drugs have a well-known safety profile, as there exists long-lasting experience in research and clinical use. Third, safety studies in patients with multiple sclerosis for these generic compounds will have to be conducted but they do not have to be exhaustive; thus, their translation into phase II and III clinical trials can be expedited. The screening approach herein has limitations, which should be addressed. First, the screening was limited to a circumscribed number of generic medications contained within the NINDS library; it was fortunate that we found several hits to pursue. A second limitation is that due to the high number of compounds tested, only one concentration (10 µM) was investigated for the majority of compounds. This may lead to misses, as higher or lower concentrations of a particular drug may have to be administered in humans to reach effectiveness. A third limitation is the lack of a well-accepted animal model of progressive multiple sclerosis to test the promising drugs identified from the tissue culture studies. We utilized the acute EAE model as proof of concept for a drug’s effectiveness in vivo followed by investigation in chronic EAE in C57BL/6 mice and Biozzi ABH EAE. While treatment from remission after the first relapse might not have been successful due to marked damage induced during the early phase of EAE, positive effects with early treatment during chronic disease in two models support potential effectiveness in human. Another limitation was the statistical analysis of the chronic experiments. Due to spontaneous remission of vehicle-treated animals, statistical significance would have been masked had the whole experiment been analyzed as a group, since vehicle-treated animals along with clomipramine-treated mice remitted to a very low disease score between days 25 and 42 (Fig. ). Hence, for statistical analyses, we focused on the differences of the acute and chronic relapse phases outside of the period of remission (Fig. ), as this would be more meaningful for a drug’s utility in MS. As no models of EAE are strongly suited for all aspects of progressive multiple sclerosis, we hope that the results of the current study will lead to a clinical trial in the ultimate test subjects: patients with progressive multiple sclerosis. Another limitation of the screening approach was the sequence of the tests employed, beginning with amelioration of iron-induced neurotoxicity to effects on T-cells. This sequence is not a reflection of which pathophysiology is most important for progressive multiple sclerosis, but simply because the protection of neurons against death in culture was an easily observed (through microscopy of living neurons) and therefore obvious outcome. Had the screen been sequenced in a different manner, other lead candidates might have emerged. Nonetheless, through the sequence that we employed, a testable medication in patients with multiple sclerosis, clomipramine, has emerged. Moreover, although a larger library could have been used, the NINDS collection was the largest grouping of generic medications available at the time of our study. We reiterate our focus on generics as their potential to advance faster into clinical studies is much higher, given that there would be knowledge of their spectrum of side effects in human use. Some of the compounds that prevented iron-mediated neurotoxicity in our screen have been described previously to have neuroprotective properties and will be highlighted here, as they may be of interest not only to progressive multiple sclerosis but also other CNS disorders with neurodegenerative features. Strong neuroprotective effects were induced by tricyclic antidepressants. The antidepressant desipramine has been used in a Huntington's disease model where it inhibited glutamate-induced mitochondrial permeability at the concentration of 2 µM and led to reduced apoptosis of primary murine neurons. Furthermore, desipramine induces the antioxidative enzyme heme-oxygenase 1 in Mes23.5 dopaminergic cells and increases Nrf2 accumulation in the nucleus, thus preventing neuronal cell death mediated by rotenone and 6-hydroxydopamine. We could not confirm the inhibition of rotenone-mediated cell death in our study of primary human neurons and we did not choose to pursue desipramine further as it promoted the formation of hydroxyl radicals in the HORAC assay. In murine EAE, desipramine reduces CCL5 in cortical homogenates and positively affects anxiety-related behavior but not clinical signs. Of interest, efficacy of desipramine in depression in multiple sclerosis has been shown in a Cochrane analysis and was associated with fewer adverse effects than paroxetine. Besides desipramine, other tricyclic antidepressants had strong effects against splenocyte proliferation. Imipramine, which showed good neuroprotective properties, enhances PEP-1-catalase in astrocytes, leading to neuroprotection in the hippocampal CA1 region in an ischemia model. Additionally, it prevents apoptosis of neural stem cells by lipopolysaccharide, mediated by the brain-derived neurotrophic factor and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Another novel compound recently developed, quinpramine, which is a fusion of imipramine and the antimalarial quinacrine, decreased the number of inflammatory CNS lesions, antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokines in EAE. Due to structural similarities between clomipramine, imipramine, and trimipramine it may be speculated that these compounds may be relevant for trials in progressive multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, we showed previously that doxepin reduces microglial activation to 46% without inducing toxicity; clomipramine, however, did not have microglia inhibitory activity. In the synopsis of effects contributing to progressive multiple sclerosis, tricyclic antidepressants are interesting for further development and might even be suitable as combination therapy with other compounds targeting features of progressive multiple sclerosis. Some antipsychotics also displayed strong protection against iron and oxidative stress. Clozapine has been described to reduce microglial activation through inhibition of phagocytic oxidase-generated reactive oxygen species production, mediating neuroprotection. The strong antioxidative properties of clozapine in the HORAC assay support these results. Due to the side effect profile with enhanced risk of agranulocytosis, we refrained from usage in EAE; nevertheless, in multiple sclerosis patients with psychiatric comorbidities and eligible for antipsychotic treatment, it may be reasonable to use clozapine. With regard to liothyronine, atenolol or carvedilol that prevented iron-mediated neurotoxicity beyond levels of controls, these do not penetrate the CNS (probability of 68% for all three, drugbank.ca) as well as clomipramine (97.9% chance for entering the CNS according to drugbank.ca). Thus, we did not explore their utility in EAE. Mitoxantrone is used in some countries as a treatment for progressive multiple sclerosis, but has so far not yet been described as being neuroprotective. Although the blood–brain barrier permeability probability is poor (0.7979), it may be postulated that the effect in progressive multiple sclerosis, in addition to its toxic effects on T-lymphocytes, is induced by its capacity to limit iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Indapamide exhibited strong neuroprotective effects against iron toxicity in culture, which has not yet been described previously. More interestingly, indapamide also overcomes mitochondrial damage. As indapamide has no effect on T-lymphocyte proliferation, the drug may not overcome acute-EAE, but may be interesting in longer-term multiple sclerosis models such as the Biozzi ABH mouse model, which shows immune cell-independent neurodegeneration and a chronic disease course. We opted to test clomipramine in the acute-EAE model due to its strong effects on immune cells, its antioxidative properties and its prevention against iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant which is used to treat depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and panic disorders, usually in a dosage of 100–150 mg/d, sometimes up to 300 mg/d. It inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine uptake. Clomipramine reduces the seizure threshold and overdose can lead to cardiac dysrhythmias, hypotension, and coma (drugbank.ca). Usually, clomipramine is well tolerated, but side effects include among others increase in weight, sexual dysfunctions, sedation, hypotension and anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth, sweating, obstipation, blurred vision, and micturition disorder (according to the manufacturer leaflet). Clomipramine crosses readily into the CNS with a probability to cross the blood–brain barrier of 0.979 according to predicted ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) features (drugbank.ca). Clomipramine reduces the production of nitric oxide and TNF-α in microglia and astrocytes; the authors reported neuroprotective properties in a co-culture model of neuroblastoma cells and microglia. Clomipramine increases the uptake of cortisol in primary rat neurons and promotes the release of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor in glioblastoma cells, suggesting a protective effect on neurons. The drug has been also studied in experimental autoimmune neuritis, where it decreases the number of IFN-γ secreting Th1 cells and ameliorated the clinical course. Clomipramine has been used previously in mice in different dosages to study conditions such as antinociception (0.5 mg/kg), Chagas disease (7.5 mg/kg), and neurotransmitter and histone deacetylase expression (50 mg/kg). In humans taking clomipramine as an antidepressant, mean serum levels after a mean daily intake of 127 ± 91 mg/d have been reported to be 122 ng/ml (387 nM, considering a molecular weight of 314.9). Of note, clomipramine levels after oral intake in humans have a wide range, leading to plasma concentrations of more than 600 nM in some individuals, which is in the range of neuroprotection against iron in our in vitro experiments. The injection of 20 mg/kg IP in CD1 mice leads to peak plasma concentrations of 438 ng/ml (1.4 μM) with a half-life of 165 min and in our experiments animals (sacrificed 1 h after the last injection) had mean serum clomipramine concentrations of 236.5 ng/ml (751 nM). These plasma levels are close to the ones measured in humans (average of 387 nM, and up to 600 nM), especially keeping in mind that plasma levels drop faster in mice due to the relatively bigger liver:body mass and that the half-life of clomipramine in humans is between 17.7 and 84 h compared to about 2.5 h in mice. We found that clomipramine levels in the spinal cord of the EAE-afflicted mice averaged an incredibly high 28 µM; levels achieved in the brains of humans are not known. Thus, the dosage of 25 mg/kg clomipramine tested in our EAE study reflects standard doses used in humans in that both attain similar plasma levels. In summary, we discovered several generic compounds in this systematic screening approach that exhibit neuroprotective properties against iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Additionally, some of those compounds prevent mitochondrial damage to neurons, inhibit immune cell proliferation, and show antioxidative capacities. They may thus be interesting for further development in progressive multiple sclerosis, and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's dementia, Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. Tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics, and indapamide may be useful for further development in progressive multiple sclerosis due to their manifold properties. Clomipramine showed particular promise due to its capacity to reduce iron-mediated neurotoxicity and T-cell and B-cell proliferation, its antioxidative effect, and its complete suppression of disease in acute-EAE and positive effects in chronic EAE. As these features are relevant in progressive multiple sclerosis, we propose clomipramine for a trial in the unmet need of progressive multiple sclerosis. Human neurons were isolated from brain tissues of therapeutically aborted 15–20-week-old fetuses, in accordance with ethics approval of the University of Calgary ethics committee, after written informed consent of the pregnant donors. Neurons were isolated as follows in brief: brain specimens were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove blood, followed by removal of meninges. Tissue was mechanically dissected, followed by digestion in DNase (6–8 ml of 1 mg/ml; Roche), 4 ml 2.5% trypsin and 40 ml PBS (37 °C, 25 min). Thereafter, the digestion was stopped by addition of 4 ml fetal calf serum. The solution was filtered through a 132 µm filter and centrifuged (three times, 1200 rpm, 10 min). Cells were cultured in feeding medium of minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 µM sodium pyruvate, 10 µM glutamine, 1× non-essential amino acids, 0.1% dextrose, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all culture supplements from Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada). The initial isolates of mixed CNS cell types were plated in poly-L-ornithine-coated (10 µg/ml) T75 flasks and cultured for at least two cycles in medium containing 25 µM cytosine arabinoside (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Canada) to inhibit astrocyte proliferation and to deplete this major contaminating cell type. For experiments, the neuron-enriched cultures were re-trypsinized and cells were plated in poly-L-ornithine pre-coated 96-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/well in 100 µl of the complete medium supplemented with cytosine arabinoside. Medium was changed to AIM V Serum Free Medium (Invitrogen) after 24 h. After a period of 1 h, respective drugs were added in a concentration of 10 µM, followed by application of FeSO or rotenone after 1 h. All conditions were performed in quadruplicates. A day later cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde and stored in PBS at 4 °C. We note that in tissue culture, the toxicity of iron to neurons begins immediately. Thus, it has been our experience that pretreatment with test protective agents is necessary. With the continuous insult that occurs in multiple sclerosis, a pretreatment paradigm with test compounds against iron neurotoxicity in our experiments can be justified as that simulates the protection against the next injury in the disease. Drugs tested were contained within the 1040-compound NINDS Custom Collection II, which was purchased from Microsource Discovery (Gaylordsville, CT, USA) and used as previously described. Briefly, there were 80 compounds located in specific wells on each plate (e.g., B07). 3B07 would thus refer to position B07 of plate 3. Each compound was supplied at a concentration of 10 mM dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The iron stock solution was prepared using 27.8 mg iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO) (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Canada), 10 μl of 17.8 M sulfuric acid, and 10 ml deionized distilled water. After filtering with a 0.2 µm filter, FeSO was added to cells in a final concentration of 25–50 µM in a volume of 50 µl medium to the cells. Rotenone was dissolved in DMSO and used in a final concentration of 10 µM. Selected compounds that prevented iron-mediated neurotoxicity were analyzed for their antioxidative properties using the HORAC assay, in accordance with the procedure outlined in Číž et al. In this assay, hydroxyl radicals generated by a Co(II)-mediated Fenton-like reaction oxidize fluorescein causing loss of fluorescence. The presence of an antioxidant reduces the loss of fluorescence and this can be monitored every 5 min over a period of 60 min with a Spectra Max Gemini XS plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and the software SoftMax Pro version 5. For monitoring fluorescence, we used an excitation wavelength of  = 485 nm and an emission wavelength of  = 520 nm. A previously published protocol was used for isolating and activating T-cells. Spleens from female C57BL/6 mice were harvested and after mechanical dissociation the cell suspension was passed through a 70 µm cell strainer and separated by Ficoll gradient (1800 RPM, 30 min). Splenocytes were plated (2.5 × 10 cells in 100 µl/well) in anti-CD3 antibody-coated 96-well plates (1000 ng ml plate-bound anti-CD3 and 1000 ng ml anti-CD28 suspended in media) to activate T-cells. Directly before plating, wells were treated with respective drugs in a final concentration of 10 µM. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 µM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% HEPES, and 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (all supplements were from Invitrogen). After 48 h, H-thymidine was added in a concentration of 1 µCi per well, and cells were harvested after 24 h on filter mats. Mats were then evaluated for radioactivity (counts per minute, cpm) using a liquid scintillation counter. Venous blood from healthy volunteers was obtained and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation (1800 RPM, 30 min). From PBMCs, B-cells were isolated by positive selection with CD19-directed microbeads (Stemcell Technologies). Purity was assessed by FACS after staining for CD19 (Stemcell Technologies). Cells were plated at a concentration of 2.5 × 10 cells/well in X-VIVO™ medium (Lonza) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% Glutamax and treated with drugs for 1 h. Cells were then activated with 10 µg/ml IgM BCR cross-linking antibody (XAb) (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 1 µg/ml anti-CD40L and IL-4 20 ng/ml for 24 h as described previously. Conditioned media were harvested after 24 h for ELISA. Medium as well as respective drugs were re-added followed by application of H-thymidine in a concentration of 1 µCi per well to investigate proliferation. After 24 h, cells were harvested on filter mats and after drying cpm were measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Two days after activation and drug treatment splenocytes were harvested, washed with PBS followed by resuspension in PBS with 2% FBS. Cell cycle analysis was performed taking advantage of PI staining using an established protocol. Cells were washed in cold PBS and resuspended in PI/Triton X-100 staining solution (10 ml 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS with 2 mg DNAse-free RNAse A and 0.4 ml of 500 µg/ml PI), followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. Stained cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur™ with the software CellQuest™ (BD Biosciences). Cell cycle analysis was conducted using the software ModFit LT, version 3.3 (Verity Software House Inc.). Cells were identified by gating into the lymphocyte population, followed by single cell gating to exclude doublets and aggregates. This was followed by identification of the G0/G1 population and processing with the software ModFit LT, version 3.3 (Verity Software House Inc.) to calculate the percentage of cells in different cell cycles. Staining was performed at room temperature. A blocking buffer was first introduced for 1 h followed by incubation with primary antibody overnight in 4 °C. Neurons were stained using mouse anti-MAP-2 antibody, clone HM-2 (dilution 1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number M4403, species mouse). Primary antibody was visualized with Alexa Fluor 488 or 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (dilution 1:250, Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada). Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst S769121 (nuclear yellow). Cells were stored in 4 °C in the dark before imaging. Images were taken using the automated ImageXpress imaging system (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) through a 10× objective microscope lens, displaying 4 or 9 sites per well. Images were analyzed with the software MetaXpress (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using the algorithm “multiwavelength cell scoring”. Cells were defined according to fluorescence intensity and size at different wavelengths. Data from all sites per well were averaged to one data point. Neurons were prepared as described above. Directly after the addition of FeSO to healthy neurons, the live cell-permeant Hoechst 33342 (1:2 diluted in AIM-V medium, nuclear blue; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA) and the live cell-impermeable PI (1:20 diluted in AIM-V medium) were added in a volume of 20 µl (Sigma-Aldrich). In compromised cells, PI could now diffuse across the plasma membrane. Live-cell imaging was performed using the automated ImageXpress imaging system under controlled environmental conditions (37 °C and 5% CO). Images were taken from nine sites per well at baseline and then every 30 min for 12 h. After export with MetaXpress, videos were edited with ImageJ (NIH) in a uniform manner. Nuclei were pseudo colored in cyan, PI-positive cells in red. EAE was induced in 8–10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, Montreal, Canada). Mice were injected with 50 µg of MOG (synthesized by the Peptide Facility of the University of Calgary) in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10 mg/ml Mycobacterium tuberculosis subcutaneously on both hind flanks on day 0. In addition, pertussis toxin (300 ng/200 µl; List Biological Laboratories, Hornby, Canada) was injected intraperitoneal (IP) on days 0 and 2. Animals were treated with clomipramine (25 mg/kg; 100 µl of 5 mg/ml solution) by IP injection from day 0 or day 5 (Figs. , ), from day 30 at remission (Fig. ), or from 13 at onset of clinical signs (Fig. ). The solution of clomipramine was prepared daily in PBS. The Biozzi ABH mouse model was used as a model of progression. EAE was induced in Biozzi ABH mice aged 8–10 weeks by the subcutaneous application of 150 µl emulsion in both sides of the hind flanks. The emulsion was prepared as follows: Stock A consisted of 4 ml of incomplete Freund's adjuvant mixed with 16 mg M. tuberculosis and 2 mg M. butyricum. 1 ml of stock A was mixed with 11.5 ml incomplete Freund's adjuvant to become stock B. Stock B was mixed in equal volume with SCH in PBS before injection. SCH was used in a concentration of 6.6 mg/ml emulsion each for 2 injections (days 0 and 7). The number of animals was chosen according to experience with previous experiments (Fig. : 8/8 (vehicle/clomipramine); Fig. : 8/7; Fig.  10/10; b 5/6; c 5/5), and animals were randomized after induction of EAE. Animals were handled according to the Canadian Council for Animal Care and the guidelines of the animal facility of the University of Calgary. All animal experiments received ethics approval (AC12–0181) from the University of Calgary’s Animal Ethics Committee. Mice were scored daily using a 15-point scoring system, the investigator was not blinded. 1 h after the last administration of clomipramine animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, blood was taken by an intracardiac puncture for serum, and animals were then subjected to PBS-perfusion. Spinal cords and cerebella were removed. The thoracic cords were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, followed by embedding in paraffin. Cervical and lumbar cords were snap frozen. Tissue was further processed as previously described. Briefly, the thoracic spinal cord was cut longitudinally from the ventral to the dorsal side with sections of 6 µm thickness. Sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin, Iba1 (dilution 1:250; Wako, catalog number 019-18741, species rabbit) to visualize microglia and Bielschowsky’s silver stain to visualize axons. Sections for Iba1 and Bielschowsky's silver stain were blinded, before images depicting area of maximal microglial activation or axonal damage were chosen for blinded rank order analysis by a second investigator. Lumbar spinal cords were harvested, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in −80 °C. Samples were homogenized in 1 ml Trizol followed by the addition of 200 µl chloroform. The suspension was shaken, centrifuged (11,500 RPM for 15 min at 4 °C) and the RNA-containing upper phase was transferred into a new tube and precipitated with equal amounts of 70% ethanol. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen). RNA concentrations were measured using a Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA preparation was performed using the RT First Strand kit (Qiagen) with 1 µg of RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR was performed using the QuantStudio 6 Flex (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies) with FAST SYBR Green and primers for (Qiagen) as housekeeping gene, (Qiagen, QT01038821), (Qiagen, QT00104006), (SABiosciences, PPM03023A-200), and (Qiagen, QT00167832). Relative expression was calculated using the ΔΔCT method with as housekeeping gene. Data were normalized to gene expression in naïve mice. The assay is a modification of the LC-MS assay of Shinokuzack et al. For preparation of samples, 100 μl of ice cold methanol were added to 100 μl of serum in each sample after addition of the internal standard maprotiline. The tubes were vortexed and left on ice for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x  for 4 min. An equal amount of distilled water was added to each supernatant. Spinal cord samples were each homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold 80% methanol. 20 μl of o-phosphoric acid were added to all samples after addition of internal standard (maprotiline). The tubes were vortexed and left on ice for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x  for 4 min and an equal volume of distilled water was added to each supernatant. An HLB Prime μelution plate was employed for sample cleanup for both serum and spinal cord samples. After running the supernatants described above through the wells, all wells were washed with 5% methanol in water and allowed to dry completely before elution with 100 μl 0.05% formic acid in methanol:acetonitrile (1:1). The eluents were transferred to low volume μl glass inserts (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and 10 µl from each eluent were injected into the LC-MS system. Analyses were conducted with a ZQ Mass detector - 2695 Separations module from Waters. The control of instrument, and the acquisition and processing of results were enabled by Mass Lynx 4.0 software. HPLC runs were processed by a 3 μm, 3.0 × 100 mm Atlantis dC18 column with similar material for the guard column. The mobile phases A and B were 0.05% formic acid constituted in water and acetonitrile respectively. The procedure started with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min comprising of 80% of A and 20% of B. This was elevated in 15 min to 80% B and then restituted to starting conditions. The sample cooler and column heater were maintained at 4 and 30 °C, respectively. The optimized positive electrospray parameters had specifications of 1.2V Rf lens voltage; 3.77 kV capillary voltage; 110 °C source; 300 °C desolvation temperature; 80 L/h cone gas flow (nitrogen) and 300 L/h of desolvation nitrogen gas flow. Cone voltage was varied for each compound: clomipramine 25 V; N-desmethylclomipramine 22 V; and maprotiline 25 V. The / ratios for clomipramine, N-desmethylclomipramine, and maprotiline (internal standard) were 315, 301, and 278, respectively. Calibration curves consisting of varying amounts of authentic clomipramine and N-desmethylclomipramine and the same fixed amount of maprotiline as added to the samples being analyzed were run in parallel through the procedure described above and the ratios of clomipramine and N-desmethylclomipramine to maprotiline were used to determine the amount of drug and metabolite in the serum and spinal cord samples. Statistical analysis was performed using the Graphpad Prism software version 7 (La Jolla, CA, USA). For cell culture experiments, one-way ANOVA with different post hoc analyses was applied, as stated in the respective figure legends. EAE scores were analyzed using two-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparison as post hoc analysis or non-parametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney test. Sum of scores and rank order analysis were analyzed with the non-parametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney test. Animal weight and drug levels were analyzed with an unpaired two-tailed -test. Correlations of drug levels were calculated using a linear regression model. Correlations of rank order analyses were performed using non-parametric two-tailed Spearman correlation. Statistical significance was considered as  < 0.05 (*),  < 0.01 (**),  < 0.001 (***), and  < 0.0001 (****). All experiments were performed in quadruplicates, if not otherwise specified.

Neuronal vulnerability and multilineage diversity in multiple sclerosis , –() Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease with a relapsing–remitting disease course at early stages, distinct lesion characteristics in cortical grey versus subcortical white matter and neurodegeneration at chronic stages. Here we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to assess changes in expression in multiple cell lineages in MS lesions and validated the results using multiplex in situ hybridization. We found selective vulnerability and loss of excitatory -expressing projection neurons in upper-cortical layers underlying meningeal inflammation; such MS neuron populations exhibited upregulation of stress pathway genes and long non-coding RNAs. Signatures of stressed oligodendrocytes, reactive astrocytes and activated microglia mapped most strongly to the rim of MS plaques. Notably, single-nucleus RNA sequencing identified phagocytosing microglia and/or macrophages by their ingestion and perinuclear import of myelin transcripts, confirmed by functional mouse and human culture assays. Our findings indicate lineage- and region-specific transcriptomic changes associated with selective cortical neuron damage and glial activation contributing to progression of MS lesions.

Reaching an evidence-based prognosis for personalized treatment of multiple sclerosis , –() Personalized treatment is ideal for multiple sclerosis (MS) owing to the heterogeneity of clinical features, but current knowledge gaps, including validation of biomarkers and treatment algorithms, limit practical implementation. The contemporary approach to personalized MS therapy depends on evidence-based prognostication, an initial treatment choice and evaluation of early treatment responses to identify the need to switch therapy. Prognostication is directed by baseline clinical, environmental and demographic factors, MRI measures and biomarkers that correlate with long-term disability measures. The initial treatment choice should be a shared decision between the patient and physician. In addition to prognosis, this choice must account for patient-related factors, including comorbidities, pregnancy planning, preferences of the patients and their comfort with risk, and drug-related factors, including safety, cost and implications for treatment sequencing. Treatment response has traditionally been assessed on the basis of relapse rate, MRI lesions and disability progression. Larger longitudinal data sets have enabled development of composite outcome measures and more stringent standards for disease control. Biomarkers, including neurofilament light chain, have potential as early surrogate markers of prognosis and treatment response but require further validation. Overall, attainment of personalized treatment for MS is complex but will be refined as new data become available. Personalized treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) depends on prognostication at baseline, a shared treatment decision between the physician and patient, and early assessment of response to therapy. Prognosis can be evaluated soon after diagnosis on the basis of demographic and environmental factors, clinical features, MRI measures and biomarkers. Individuals with poor prognostic features should be recommended high-efficacy therapies early on; studies are underway to investigate whether most patients with relapsing–remitting MS could benefit from initial aggressive therapy. During the treatment discussion between the neurologist and patient, factors such as comorbidities, pregnancy planning, patient preferences, risk tolerance, safety, cost and treatment sequencing should be considered in addition to prognosis. Early assessment of treatment response is important to identify the need to switch therapy; composite outcome measures that incorporate clinical and MRI data are best for predicting long-term disability. Personalized MS therapy is currently limited by a lack of evidence-based biomarkers; newer biomarkers, such as neurofilament light chain, have potential, but further validation and standardization of assays are required.

To assess the efficacy and side effects of oral Δ-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and rectal THC-hemisuccinate (THC-HS) in SCI patients. Twenty-five patients with SCI were included in this three-phase study with individual dose adjustment, each consisting of 6 weeks. Twenty-two participants received oral THC open label starting with a single dose of 10 mg (Phase 1, completed by 15 patients). Eight subjects received rectal THC-HS (Phase 2, completed by seven patients). In Phase 3, six patients were treated with oral THC and seven with placebo. Major outcome parameters were the spasticity sum score (SSS) using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and self-ratings of spasticity. Mean daily doses were 31 mg with THC and 43 mg with THC-HS. Mean SSS for THC decreased significantly from 16.72 (±7.60) at baseline to 8.92 (±7.14) on day 43. Similar improvement was seen with THC-HS. We observed a significant improvement of SSS with active drug (=0.001) in the seven subjects who received oral THC in Phase 1 and placebo in Phase 3. Major reasons for drop out were increase of pain and psychological side effects. THC is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of spasticity. At least 15–20 mg per day were needed to achieve a therapeutic effect. Preparations of the hemp plant ( L.) have a long history in medical treatment of neurological disorders. The oldest reports of medicinal applications originate in China and Egypt two thousand years BC. A traditional Chinese herbal ascribed to the Emperor Shen-nung who lived in the third millennium BC recommends the use of cannabis for the treatment of pain and beriberi, among other indications. As beriberi, a vitamin deficiency disease of thiamine (vitamin B1), is accompanied by several neurological symptoms it can be assumed that cannabis was used to alleviate these problems. In India the Ayurvedic tradition of using cannabis dates back to early pre-Christian centuries, its applications including epilepsy, neuralgic pain and tetanus. Indian hemp found its way into modern western medicine in the 19th century. Many physicians of the time including Sir John Russell Reynolds, personal physician of Queen Victoria, praised the analgesic and muscle relaxing effects of the drug. It was not before the 1960s that the chemical structure of the main active compound of cannabis, (−)-trans-Δ-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, dronabinol) was characterized, allowing first clinical studies with exact doses. Surveys among patients with multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury (SCI), who used cannabis to treat their symptoms, case reports and small clinical studies with dronabinol and other synthetic cannabinoids suggest that cannabis and single cannabinoids may be useful medicines in spasticity and spasms. As the detection of an endogenous cannabinoid system consisting of specific cannabinoid receptors (CB and CB) and their endogenous ligands, so called endocannabinoids, in the late 1980s and 1990s our understanding of the mechanisms of action of THC has considerably improved. THC binds to both CB and CB receptors. Both cannabinoid receptor types are coupled through inhibiting G proteins, negatively to adenylate cyclase and positively to mitogen-activated protein kinase. In addition, CB receptors are coupled to several ion channels. CB receptors are found in particularly high concentrations within the central nervous system. They are also present in certain peripheral organs and tissues, including peripheral nerve terminals. Within the central nervous system, the distribution pattern of CB receptors is heterogeneous and can account for several prominent pharmacological properties of cannabinoid receptor agonists. For example, there is evidence that the basal ganglia are richly populated with CB receptors and that these receptors mediate the well documented ability of CB receptor agonists to alter motor function. Spasticity in SCI is difficult to treat with drugs that are currently available. In a review by Tarrico , intrathecal administration of baclofen resulted in a significant improvement in the Ashworth Scale and activities of daily living (ADL). Tizanidin resulted in improved spasticity scores, but did not improve ADL and side effects (sleepiness, xerostomia) were common. Other oral drugs (gabapentin, clonidin, diazepam and oral baclofen) were not shown to be efficacious compared to placebo. In addition to systemic treatment, focal treatment for spasticity in those with SCI includes injections with botulinum toxin and surgical interventions. In many cases treatment results are unsatisfactory, raising the need for new therapeutic options. Recent larger placebo-controlled trials investigating the efficacy of cannabis and THC in spasticity have been restricted to MS patients. In contrast to spasticity in MS, that may be of supra-spinal and spinal origin, spasticity in patients with SCI is solely based on spinal lesions. We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel study (Phase 3) of oral THC (dronabinol, Marinol™) in patients with SCI to investigate its effects on spasticity of spinal origin (Phase 3). This double-blind trial was proceeded by an open label dose finding study with oral THC (Phase 1) and an open label dose finding study with rectal THC-HS (Phase 2). Twenty-five patients (two females, 23 males) with traumatic SCI aged 19–73 years (mean: 42.6 years) participated in the study (see ). Eleven were paraplegics, 14 tetraplegics. Participants terminated taking all spasmolytic medication at least three half-life periods before enrolling in the study. They had to be free of illegal drugs, documented with a negative urine drug screen at baseline. Pregnant subjects or those with severe somatic and known psychiatric diseases were excluded. Spasticity without any spasmolytic treatment had to be ≥3 points on the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) in at least one muscle group. Active treatment consisted of oral synthetic THC (dronabinol, Marinol™) containing either 2.5, 5 or 10 mg Δ-THC in sesame oil and was delivered by Solvay (Unimed/Roxane) Pharmaceutical Inc., OH, USA. Solvay also delivered the placebo capsules containing only sesame oil. THC-HS suppositories were delivered by ElSohly Laboratories Inc., Oxford, MS, USA. THC-HS suppositories contained an equivalent of 5 and 10 mg THC. The export of the material from the USA has been approved by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the import to Switzerland by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (BAG permit No. 92). The Ethics Committee of the University of Basel approved the study design (protocol No M3/96), which followed the Helsinki Declaration. To assess spasticity the MAS (see ) was performed consecutively by two independent physicians. The original scale (0, 1, 1+, 2, 3, 4) has been recoded to 0–5. Tests were carried out bilaterally for six joints: arm abductors/adductors, elbow extensors/flexors, wrist extensors/flexors, hip extensors/flexors, knee extensors/flexors, foot extensors/flexors. For every joint, four values were documented (left/right/examiner 1 and 2). Spasticity sum score (SSS) was calculated by addition of all examinations divided by 4. Ergometry was performed with arm crank Ergoline Cardiovit AT-10/Schiller (Baar, Switzerland), pulmonary function tests were performed with a Spirovit SP-10/Schiller (Baar, Switzerland). Bladder cystomanometry was examined with UROSKOP D 3/Siemens (Munich, Germany) and included the following parameters: first desire to void (FDV), maximum cystometric capacity (MCC), intravesical pressure (IP), bladder compliance (BC), postvoid residual urine volume (PVV), volume at first detrusor contraction (VFC). The functional independence measure (FIM) was used to assess ADL and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) to measure mood alterations. Standardized computerized neuropsychological tests included the continuous performance test (CPT) for sustained attention and the Deux Barrages (DB) test for selective spatial attention. For self-ratings of spasticity, pain, attention, mood and side effects, a seven-point scale from 0 to 6 was used. For spasticity and pain it was 0=no spasticity/pain, 1=minimal, 2=minor, 3=moderate, 4=strong, 5=very strong, 6=intolerable. Both mood and attention were scaled as follows: 0=very bad, 1=bad, 2=rather bad, 3=moderate, 4=rather good, 5=good, 6=very good. Baseline examinations were performed on day 0. On day 1, patients received either oral THC (Phase 1) or rectal THC-HS (Phase 2) and were switched medications after completing the phase they began, including at least 1 week of a washout period. Phase 3 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study with oral THC (see ). Initially we intended to perform a three arm study with 6 weeks of oral THC (Phase 1), 6 weeks of rectal THC-HS (Phase 2), followed by a 6 weeks randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial with oral THC and rectal THC-HS (Phase 3). Owing to logistical problems with the import of THC-HS we had to terminate Phase 2 after seven patients were enrolled. The design of Phase 3 was also modified from a crossover to a parallel study. Most of the study participants were outpatients who entered the hospital on day 0 for baseline investigations, stayed there until the evening of day 1 or until day 2. Dose escalations were usually discussed with the patients by phone or during unscheduled visits to the hospital. On days 8 and 43 of each phase participants visited the hospital for interviews and examinations. Some of the study subjects were inpatients for longer periods. Baseline investigation included blood tests (hemogram, CRP, GOT, GPT, -GT, alkaline phosphatase, creatine, urea, urea acid, sodium, potassium, urine test, urine drug screen), pulmonary function test, ergometry, physical and neurological examinations, bladder cystomanometry, neurological and physical examination, neuropsychological tests, FIM, HRSD (see ). Twenty-two patients received oral THC for 6 weeks. Phase 1 was completed by 15 participants (seven drop outs) (see ). On day 1, a single dose of 10 mg oral THC was administered at 0900 hours after a standardized breakfast. Investigations of MAS, reflexes, heart rate and blood pressure were performed at 0900, 1000, 1100, 1300, 1400, 1700 and 1900 hours. On day 2, a dose titration phase was begun, which was usually completed after 10–14 days. Dose titration was performed on an individual basis without a fixed scheme until the maximum tolerated dose or the treatment aim was achieved. The treatment aim was a maximum reduction of spasticity and improvement of motor function, which had to be balanced against the loss of muscular strength by the medication. Daily doses were divided into 3–5 doses, the evening dose usually being higher than the other doses. On day 8, physical, neurological and neuropsychological examinations were performed. Spasticity according to the MAS was measured 2 h after administration of the morning dose. Mood alterations according to HRSD were examined; side effects and self-ratings were monitored and discussed with the patients. Self-ratings for spasticity, pain, attention, mood, side effects were documented by the patients on a daily basis to estimate mean symptom intensity during the proceeding 24 h. All examinations of day 0 (baseline) were repeated on day 43 (last day of treatment). Eight patients received rectal THC-HS for 6 weeks. Phase 2 was completed by seven participants (one drop out). Two dropped out after completing this phase. The same procedure as in Phase 1 was applied with regard to dosing and measurement procedures. Phase 2 had to be stopped due to logistical problems with the import of the study medication after finishing seven patients. Thirteen patients were included in this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel phase. Six patients received oral THC at their individual maximum dose determined during the dose escalation phase of Phases 1, 7 patients received the corresponding placebo doses. The rhythm of examinations was the same as in Phases 1 and 2. Blinding and randomization for Phase 3 was performed by the Institute of Hospital Pharmacy, University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland. intraindividual comparisons of outcomes in patients within the two open label phases (Phases 1 and 2) at different times of investigations (comparisons of baseline values with values under treatment on days 1, 8 and 43), intraindividual comparisons of outcomes in patients who received oral THC in Phase 1 and rectal THC-HS in Phase 2 (five patients), intraindividual comparisons of outcomes in patients who received oral THC in Phase 1 and placebo in Phase 3 (seven patients), intraindividual comparisons of outcomes in patients who received oral THC in Phase 1 as well as in Phase 3 (six patients). We decided not to compare the outcome on the six patients who received oral THC and the seven patients who received placebo in Phase 3 because there was a major difference in baseline scores on the SSS (18.8 11.6). Our analysis was restricted to intraindividual comparisons within the Phases 1 and 2 (comparison a), between Phases 1 and 2 (comparison b) and between Phases 1 and 3 (comparisons c and d). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was applied to evaluate the treatment effect between baseline (day 0) and day 1, 8 and 43 over time. Individual mean scores for each trial period were compared using the corresponding contrast of the repeated measure ANOVA or nonparametric Wilcoxon test (if the sample size was relatively small). Treatments during the double-blind phase were also compared using repeated measure ANOVA with phase as within and patient and treatment as between factors. Relations between ratings of the two examiners were calculated by means of Spearman rank correlation. Differences between scores were evaluated with the Wilcoxon matched-paired test. Results of all statistical tests were considered significant at -values <0.05 and trend at -values <0.1. Owing to the multiple interdependencies of the variables, we did not correct the -values of these calculations. Their results therefore have to be considered as exploratory. All data analyses were performed with SPSS 10.07 of SPSS Inc., Chicago. After dose adaptation the average daily dose of oral THC was 31 mg (range: 15–60 mg), the average daily dose of rectal THC-HS was 43 mg (range: 20–60 mg). Two hours after administration of a single dose of 10 mg oral THC on day 1 (Phase 1, =15), spasticity was significantly reduced (<0.001) (see ). On day 8, a highly significant reduction of the SSS was seen 2 h after administration of the THC dose (<0.001). There was a significant reduction of spasticity on day 43 (<0.05). Mean SSS for oral THC decreased by 7.8 points, from 16.72 (±7.60) to 8.92 (±7.14) from baseline to day 43. In Phase 2 (rectal THC-HS, =7), reduction of spasticity was significant at all points of investigation (see ). Mean SSS decreased from 22.71 (±11.68) to 9.21 (±9.25) from baseline to day 43. Seven patients of Phase 1 received a placebo in Phase 3. Spasticity was significantly lower with active treatment in Phase 1 on day 1 after 1, 2, 8 and 10 h after administration of oral THC in this group compared to placebo in Phase 3 (see ). After 1 h mean values of SSS were 12.00 (±6.11) with placebo compared to 7.57 (±7.37) with oral THC. The SSS with placebo showed an increase 1 h after dose administration while it was reduced with oral THC. Comparing the spasticity scores during the whole treatment period, they were reduced on average by 4.89 points with verum compared to placebo (=0.001, ANOVA with repeated measures) (see ). There were no significant differences in the spasticity scores of the five patients who completed both Phases 1 and 2 after oral THC and rectal THC-HS (see ). To investigate the intraindividual fluctuation of spasticity, we compared the baseline spasticity scores of the 13 patients who underwent both Phases 1 and 3. There were minimal, nonsignificant differences between the baseline values (15.4±7.2 14.7±6.2). There was a nearly parallel course of the spasticity scores in the six patients who received oral THC both in Phases 1 and 3 (see ). The observed difference of a higher SSS on day 1 in Phase 3 was due to a single subject who presented with an extensor spasticity, which had a strong subjective component. To examine the reliability of the MAS and the performance of the two assessing physicians, all baseline values of all patients (=22) were compared. There was a highly significant correlation in the assessments produced by the two examiners (=0.001, correlation coefficient: 0.94). Mean SSS was 1.3 points lower in physician 2 during the whole study. Self-ratings were compared in seven patients who received oral THC in Phase 1 and placebo in Phase 3 (see ). Baseline ratings were almost identical (3.9 3.7 points). On day 1, spasticity was perceived as minor (1.9 points) with oral THC and as strong and unaltered (3.7 points) with placebo (=0.033, Wilcoxon test). On days 8 and 43, there were no significant differences between the values with oral THC and placebo. There were no significant differences in self-ratings of spasticity between Phases 1 and 3 in patients who received oral THC in both phases (data not presented). Patients of Phase 1 perceived a significant reduction of pain with oral THC on day 1 compared to baseline (=0.047). However, there was no significant reduction of pain compared to placebo on day 8 and day 43. There were no significant differences in mood and attention between oral THC and placebo, nor between baseline values and values on treatment days. However, there was a trend (=0.066) to a worsened attention with oral THC compared to placebo on treatment day 1, but this trend disappeared despite continued treatment. Data were available for 12 patients who received oral THC in Phases 1 and 6 patients with rectal THC-HS in Phase 2. Four patients could not be included due to bladder pacemaker, ileum conduit, permanent catheterization and one refusal. All patients presented with an upper motor neuron bladder (UMNB). Half of the patients of Phase 1 showed an increase and half a decrease of MCC. So there were no significant changes compared to baseline in this subgroup. Of the six patients who received rectal THC-HS, five showed an increase and one a decrease in MCC, resulting in a trend for improved MCC in patients of Phase 2 (=0.075). There were no significant changes or trends in other parameters. After 6 weeks of treatment with oral THC, 13 patients of Phase 1 showed a significant improvement of vital capacity from 65 to 71% of the nominal value (=0.028). Results from two patients could not be evaluated. Seven patients who received the placebo in Phase 3 also had a significant improvement in their vital capacity from 71 to 78%; thus, the improvement in pulmonary function could not be interpreted as a treatment effect. Five of the seven patients who received oral THC in Phase 1 and placebo in Phase 3 were available for analysis of their arm crank test. Two of the participants could not be included due to poor motor function of their hands. No significant improvement in physical work capacity and no alterations of the ECG were seen. With oral THC, maximum systolic blood pressure decreased from 146 at baseline to 140 mmHg (−4%) after 6 weeks of treatment, while it increased with placebo from 146 to 159 mmHg (+9%). Differences between the values after 6 weeks of treatment were marginally significant in the Wilcoxon test (=0.04). No significant differences were observed between baseline, placebo and active treatment in all groups. Five of the seven patients who received oral THC in Phase 1 and placebo in Phase 3 were available for analysis. Two persons with tetraplegia could not perform the tests because of compromised motor function of their hands. There were no differences in the Continuous CPT between active treatment and placebo, demonstrating that attention and sustained attention were unaffected by THC. In the Divided Attention Test, reaction time decreased both with THC and placebo during the 6 weeks of treatment, possibly due to a training effect. However, reaction time with active treatment was worse compared to placebo on day 43 (=0.043). In the DB test, the number of correct marks increased during the 6 weeks with both oral THC and placebo. On day 1, there were significantly more correct marks with THC, but also more omissions (=0.043). As with the other neuropsychological tests we observed a training effect in both Phases 1 and 3 in the DB test. All parameters were stable with the exception of a transient mild increase of liver transaminases in one patient, who received oral THC. Urine drug screen at baseline was negative in all subjects. No significant changes were found in ADL functions. Still, there was some benefit for some patients. For example, one tetraplegic could perform self-catheterization for the first time in several years due to an improved motor coordination of his hands. While four patients (18%) noted pain relief, five subjects (23%) reported pain augmentation and four of them dropped out (see ). Thus, the increase in pain was one of the major reasons for dropping out. Xerostomia was reported by seven patients (32%), sleepiness by eight patients (36%) and anxiety by seven patients (32%). Both oral THC (dronabinol, Marinol™) and rectal THC-HS proved to reduce spasticity in spinal cord injured patients in our study. Maximum effects following a single dose of 10 mg oral THC administered on day 1 were noted between 1 and 5 h after drug administration. In contrast to several other trials in SCI and MS patients, which found no or minor effects on objective spasticity measures, there were significant differences between placebo and verum as well as between baseline and treatment values in the SSS. From previous research on the bioavailability of rectal THC-HS compared to oral THC, we expected considerably lower maximum doses for the rectal administration. Brenneisen determined an almost doubled bioavailability of rectal THC-HS compared to oral THC. However, in our study the mean daily tolerated doses for oral THC of 31 mg, which was somewhat lower than for rectal THC-HS (mean: 43 mg). Possibly, the physical loss of the medication in patients with anal sphincter incontinence was the reason for the comparatively high rectal THC-HS doses observed in our study. There may be three major reasons for a significant influence of THC on objective measures of spasticity in our study compared to previous reports: (1) individual dose titration, (2) comparatively high daily THC doses and (3) discontinuation of antispastic medication before inclusion into the study. Many earlier studies used low and sometimes fixed doses of THC that may have been an important reason for lack of efficacy. Killestein applied a capsulated cannabis extract and oral dronabinol to 16 MS patients with maximum daily doses of 2 × 5 mg. No differences in spasticity scores were found compared to placebo. Ungerleider in his study with 13 MS patients found that at least single doses of 7.5 mg oral THC were necessary to achieve a significant reduction in spasticity. As there is a low margin between sought after therapeutic effects and psychological side effects, and because there is a high interindividual variability in susceptibility to THC, a flexible design with individually adjusted doses and dosing intervals is required to get optimum results in the treatment of spasticity. Pertwee suggested starting with at least 2.5 or 5 mg oral THC twice daily. Even higher single doses may be tolerated at the beginning of a study. Brenneisen treated two patients with 10–15 mg of oral THC without causing relevant side effects. The interindividual variability of THC effects is appreciated for several indications. In a study by Clifford, two of eight MS patients with severe tremor showed objective improvement, one with a single dose of 5 mg oral THC, the other with a single dose of 15 mg THC, 5 and 10 mg being completely ineffective in this patient. Daily doses in recent studies on spasticity in MS and SCI varied between 5 and 10 mg oral THC, 10–25 mg, 15–30 mg and 2.5–120 mg, underlining the high interindividual variability. In our study, we determined comparatively high tolerated daily doses of 15–60 mg for oral THC, the mean dose being 31 mg compared to average daily doses of 0.46 mg THC/kg body weight. In addition to interindividual variability, susceptibility to THC may vary in different patients' groups. Helwig determined a maximum daily dose of 0.15 mg THC/kg body weight in advanced cancer patients. However, higher doses may be tolerated by some subjects in this patients' group. In contrast to many other studies, in which previous medication was continued, participants in our investigation had to stop their antispastic drugs before inclusion in the study. Thus, we were able to compare oral THC with placebo without interference due to interaction effects with other medications. The benefit of discontinuing other medications for the treatment of spasticity is twofold. First, it is much more difficult to achieve additional measurable therapeutic effects if antispastic medication is continued. As side effects of THC and other antispastic medication may be additive, for example, sedation and dizziness with baclofen and benzodiazepines, it may also be more difficult to achieve higher doses if concomitant medication is administered. The Ashworth Scale was shown to be a reliable tool for the measurement of spasticity, as proven in our study by the high correlation between the spasticity scores determined by the two examiners. However, the Ashworth Scale may not be sensitive enough to reveal small changes. Several studies did not find objective changes in spasticity but subjective improvement. Spasticity is a very complex phenomenon, with contributions from patient symptoms, physical functioning and psychological impact. The validity of the Ashworth Scale has been questioned since it is a rather rough measure and may not include all relevant aspects of spasticity. Shakespeare suggested that sensitive, validated spasticity measures need to be developed. It is unclear why there were no subjective improvements in spasticity with oral THC compared to placebo at the end of the study period, while there was a significant difference on the first treatment day. A possible reason may be a habituation to the improved state that was no longer perceived as an improvement or tolerance to the treatment effects may have developed. However, the second explanation seems unlikely since the development of tolerance should also have been detected in the spasticity scores over the study. The exact mechanism of the antispastic effects of THC is not known. In spasticity there is increased activity of alpha motoneurons and excitatory interneurons, and decreased activity of inhibitory interneurons. This results in facilitation of excitatory glutamate neurons, and inhibition of inhibitory GABA neurons. A separate ceruleus–spinal projection also modulates the activity of spinal motoneurons via a noradrenergic mechanism. Besides spasticity, flexor and extensor spasms, clonus and ataxia, as well as acute, chronic and paroxysmal pains are often features of MS and SCI. There are many reports indicating that CB receptor agonists enhance GABA function in the brain. It is generally accepted that CB receptor agonists reduce transmitter release, via decreasing calcium-channel conductance, decreasing action potential generation and via increasing potassium-channel conductance. Also, CB receptor agonists have been found to inhibit presynaptic glutamic acid release. In animal models of MS, CB receptor agonists improved specific signs of spasticity and tremor, while a CB receptor antagonist not only reversed the effects of agonists but administered alone caused an exacerbation of both symptoms, indicating that the endocannabinoid system is tonically active. The strength of our study results is limited by the small number of subjects eligible for analyses. Owing to logistical problems, we had to modify the study design. Originally, we intended to conduct a double-blind crossover study in Phase 3 after finishing two open label phases with oral and rectal THC-HS. Fortunately, the baseline spasticity scores in Phases 1 and 3 had a similar level, which allowed us to make intraindividual comparisons between the spasticity scores following the administration of oral THC and placebo. The changes in the Ashworth Scale were so impressive that, even with the low number of patients, there was a highly significant difference between verum and placebo. There is a limited amount of data available on THC effects on spasticity in SCI. Most of studies have studied the effects of THC in MS patients. Our results support previous investigations with SCI patients. Maurer found significant effects of 5 mg oral THC in one SCI patient on sleep, pain and spasticity. Brenneisen observed improvements in joint function and mobility in two spastic patients, one with MS and one with SCI following 10–15 mg oral THC. Wade included subjects with different ailments in his pilot study (MS, SCI, brachial plexus convulsion) and found improvements in pain and spasticity. A problem that is difficult to treat in MS and SCI patients is lower urinary tract symptoms or hyper-reflexive bladder. Anecdotal reports suggest that cannabinoids may alleviate bladder dysfunction, conducted an open trial with cannabis and THC in 21 patients with advanced MS and refractory lower urinary tract symptoms. Urinary urgency, the number and volume of incontinence episodes, frequency and nocturia all decreased significantly following treatment. In our study, we only observed minor effects that may have occurred by chance alone – that is, a trend for increased MCC in patients receiving rectal THC-HS. Some participants experienced subjective improvement of micturition. For a considerable number of patients, psychological side effects are a major problem in the treatment with high doses of THC. Müller-Vahl found no significant side effects on neuropsychological performance of single dose of oral THC at 5.0–10.0 mg in 12 patients with Tourette's syndrome. There were no significant differences after treatment with verum compared to placebo in verbal and visual memory, reaction time, intelligence, sustained attention, divided attention, vigilance or mood. In our study, several participants dropped out due to anxiety and other psychological problems, but those who completed at least one phase showed remarkably low impairment in the applied neuropsychological test battery. Thus, THC may be a very effective antispastic agent for that proportion of patients who tolerate comparatively high doses. No subjects dropped out due to lack of drug efficacy. An unusual observation, in contrast to previous trials, was the increase of pain in five participants compared to a decrease in four subjects. Neuropathic pain may be an important indication for the treatment with THC and cannabis. There are several reports of pain reduction in MS by THC and cannabis, in central neuropathic pain from brachial plexus avulsion and in neuropathic pain in HIV positives. However, Attal were not able to confirm the efficacy of THC in chronic refractory neuropathic pain in an open study with eight patients who received daily doses of up to 25 mg dronabinol. In healthy subjects, increase in pain intensity is a common observation. Clark found hyperalgesic effects with cannabis after thermal stimuli in 16 regular cannabis users. Hill made similar observations following an electrical stimulus. Naef used heat, cold, pressure, single and repeated transcutaneous electrical stimulation to investigate the analgesic effects of oral THC in 12 healthy subjects. The cannabinoid did not significantly reduce pain. In the cold and heat tests it even produced hyperalgesia. Raft treated eight subjects who underwent tooth extractions with intravenous THC (0.022 and 0.044 mg/kg body weight). Two experienced analgesia, the other six hyperalgesia. To our knowledge, there is only one clinical study with cannabinoids in chronic pain patients that found increased pain perception. Jochimsen conducted a double-blind, 5-way crossover designed study with placebo, two doses of codeine sulfate (60 and 120 mg), and two doses of benzopyranoperidine (2 and 4 mg), a synthetic derivative of THC with 35 patients who required analgesics for chronic pain due to malignancies. The cannabinoid appeared to augment pain. Our study with SCI patients confirms that cannabinoid receptor agonists may cause hyperalgesia in some pain patients. THC may be a useful drug in the treatment of spasticity in patients with SCI. In particular, patients with tetraplegia who present with decreased pulmonary function may benefit from a medication with a cannabinoid because it will not depress respiration. However, many patients may not tolerate the doses needed. Comparatively high doses of at least 15–20 mg of the drug were required in our study to achieve a therapeutic effect. As tolerance to the psychological effects shows a high interindividual variability, this is one of the major limiting factors and makes the cannabinoid unsuitable for a number of patients. To our surprise, not only anxiety, but also augmentation of pain was an important reason for a drop out. We recommend starting with low doses with subsequent slow dose escalation over days or weeks to find the appropriate individual dosage and to minimize the occurrence of adverse events. For some patients our entrance dosage of a single dose of 10 mg oral THC may have been too high, and necessitate starting with a lower dose. Psychological side effects may decrease in the course of a treatment with THC, as tolerance develops. The systemic bioavailability of rectal THC-HS is about twice as high as that of oral THC. However, there may be no advantage of the rectal preparation due to the physical loss and lack of availability of the medication due to anal sphincter incontinence. Further clinical studies are needed to define the role of THC in the treatment of spasticity in SCI. THC should not only be compared to placebo, but it should also be evaluated against established antispastic medications. Mechoulam R . The pharmacohistory of . In: Mechoulam R (ed). .

What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis in Children and Teens (Pediatric MS)? At What Age Can Multiple Sclerosis Start? Who Has MS? What Medications Are Used for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis? What Drug Therapies Are Used for the Treatment and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? What Is the Prognosis and Life Expectancy for MS in Adults, Teens, and Children? Is It Fatal? When Should You Seek Medical Care for Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis is caused by damage to tissues surrounding nerve fibers. () is a condition that results from damage to myelin, the tissues surrounding nerves of the brain and . Damage to the myelin is a result of an autoimmune disease in which the body produces an immune response against its own tissues. is more common in women than in men. Symptoms and signs of are extremely variable and range from mild to severe, and may include: Some people with MS may have no symptoms to mild symptoms; about 30% of those affected will have significant disability after 20-25 years with the condition. The average age of onset for MS is about 34 years of age; but children and teens also get the condition. There is no cure for MS, but disease-modifying drugs can reduce the symptoms, delay disability, and reduce progression of the condition as seen on . The body's immune system attacks nerve sheaths, causing multiple sclerosis.. Multiple sclerosis (MS) can be thought of as an immune-mediated inflammatory process involving different areas of the () at various points in time. As the name suggests, the condition affects many areas of the central or CNS. Normal nerves are surrounded by a myelin sheath to insulate and protect them from damage. This sheath also allows effects how fast nerve signals get from the brain or spinal cord (CNS) to the affected body part. As this sheath is destroyed, the nerve conduction to that body area or part decreases or is interrupted completely. The destruction is caused by the body's immune system attacking the myelin sheath. The reason that the body's immune system attacks the sheath is not understood fully, but it is believed to be related to a combination of a genetic predisposition and acquired or environmental influences. What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? The signs and symptoms of MS in adults, children, and teens are similar; however, children and teens with the disease (pediatric MS) also may have and complete that adults with MS do not experience. Moreover, symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis differ from person to person. Visual, sensory, and motor signs and symptoms are all part of MS; however, there is a wide range of symptoms that can appear. Some people have mild cases of MS with little or no disability over the years. Others have more severe types of MS, requiring confinement to a wheelchair or bed. Over 30% of those affected with MS will have a significant disability after 20 to 25 years. Still, others may live their entire lives symptom-free (some individuals without multiple sclerosis symptoms are found incidentally to have multiple sclerosis lesions by MRI or individuals in whom an examination of their brain after death unexpectedly reveals that they were affected by the disease). This variability makes it difficult in some cases to diagnose multiple sclerosis. Often the signs and symptoms are mistaken as being psychiatric in origin. 5 Early Warning Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis The of multiple sclerosis are often . Large number of people with multiple sclerosis develop optic neuritis (inflammation of the , which is an extension of the central nervous system), described as a painful vision loss. If a patient is diagnosed with optic neuritis early, treatment could change the course of the disease. Before the actual loss of vision, the patient may have visual changes described by many people as blurred or hazy vision, flashing lights, or alterations in color. The tissues around the eye and moving the eye may be painful. Most people recover over several months. Others are left with permanent visual defects. Double vision occurs when the eyes move in different directions and is another common symptom of multiple sclerosis. Multiple Sclerosis Pictures, Symptoms and Treatment What Are the Common Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis commonly affects the cerebellum, the portion of the brain responsible for balance and fine motor coordination. Consequently, people with multiple sclerosis often have difficulty maintaining their balance when walking and performing delicate tasks with their hands. The unexplained dropping of a cup or other objects, or unusual weakness can occur. Electrical-type pain sensations in the chest, abdomen, arms, or legs There appears to be a relationship between multiple sclerosis, higher temperatures, and the worsening of symptoms. occur in about 5% of people with multiple sclerosis. Those with MS may complain of disturbances, , or may feel that they are experiencing changes in attention span or memory. Many symptoms of multiple sclerosis lead to other complications, such as infections of the bladder (urinary infections), kidney, or blood. Any area of the body can be involved, making this disease difficult to distinguish from other nervous system disorders. What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis in Children and Teens (Pediatric MS)? The signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis in children and teens are similar to those experienced by adults; however, they also may have seizures and extreme or lethargy. Children with MS are considered to have the form of MS known as relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord. They process information from our environment and control voluntary muscle movements to allow the body to do certain things. When you touch something hot, for example, signals are sent from sensory nerve endings in your hand up long nerves in your arm, eventually reaching the spinal cord. From there, the signal is transferred up your spinal cord to your brain, where the information is processed. Your brain then sends a signal back down the spinal cord to the nerves in your arm. These nerves cause the muscles in your arm to contract, pulling your hand away from the heat. This system works efficiently, unless there is a disease process affecting the nerve pathways in the spinal cord and brain. MS is one of the diseases that can affect these pathways. The nerves in the body are covered by a fatty substance called myelin (myelin sheath). The myelin sheath insulates the nerves and allows them to transmit information to and from the brain in a fraction of a second. If the myelin is disrupted in any way, the transmitted information is not only delayed, but it may also be misinterpreted by the brain. This autoimmune destruction of the myelin sheath leads to areas of (also known as plaques) in the brain and spinal cord. These plaques disrupt the transmission of information by nerves in the CNS and lead to the symptoms seen in MS. At What Age Can Multiple Sclerosis Start? Who Has MS? MS is more common in individuals of northern European descent. Women are more than twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men. Multiple sclerosis usually affects people between the ages of 20 and 50 years, and the average age of onset is approximately 34 years. Multiple sclerosis can affect children and teens (pediatric MS). It has been estimated that 2%-5% of people with MS develop symptoms prior to age 18. What Is Multiple Sclerosis? MS Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis Diagnosing multiple sclerosis is difficult. The vague and nonspecific nature of this disease mimics many other diseases. Doctors combine history, physical exam, laboratory work, and sophisticated medical imaging techniques to arrive at a diagnosis. More often than not, a specialist is required to make a diagnosis. Examples of tests and procedures used to diagnose MS include: A (), blood chemistry, , and often spinal fluid evaluation ( or “”) are all routine laboratory tests used to rule out other conditions and help confirm the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. An MRI, which creates an image of the brain or the spinal cord, is used to search for changes within the brain or spinal cord that are unique to multiple sclerosis. What Medications Are Used for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis? There are several treatment options for multiple sclerosis. Listed examples below are US FDA-approved drugs to treat multiple sclerosis. These are known as disease-modifying therapies for MS. Disease-modifying therapies have been found through clinical trials to reduce the number of relapses, delay the progression of disability, and limit new disease activity that is observed on MRI. Examples of drugs used to treat MS include: Beta interferons, for example: (Mavenclad) oral tablets is a drug used to treat two forms of multiple sclerosis; relapsing forms that include relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease in adults. Generally, cladribine is used in people with MS who have tried other that were not tolerated well or ineffective. People with clinically isolated syndrome not take cladribine. () is a agent that has been approved by the FDA to treat multiple sclerosis. Treatment with mitoxantrone requires monitoring of cardiac function, and there is a fixed limit to the dose that can be administered to patients. It also carries the long-term risk of . For these reasons, Novantrone is typically reserved for patients with more aggressive forms of multiple sclerosis. New research and treatment methods are currently being investigated and are expected to offer some hope to people with multiple sclerosis. In particular, new research studies have shown that skin patches containing myelin peptides may be a promising therapy. Consult your healthcare team for options. What Drug Therapies Are Used for the Treatment and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? In addition to drugs that target the disease process, other medications used to relieve certain symptoms of MS. Muscle relaxants, for example, () Selective reuptake inhibitor () The oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, for example, (), (, Adcirca), and ) (, Staxyn ODT) What Is the Prognosis and Life Expectancy for MS in Adults, Teens, and Children? Is It Fatal? Most people with the form of MS progress to a stage where relapses become much less frequent, but they continue to accumulate disabling symptoms. This new phase of the disease is termed secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Symptoms of this type of MS are intermittent and worsen neurologic symptoms, which can last several days or weeks before returning to their original state of health. Some people, however, are left with residual deficits (residual disability) after some attacks. A few people have a form of MS. In this type, people have relapses superimposed on a pattern of continuous progression of disability. Rarely, people with multiple sclerosis have a pure progressive () forms of the disease. Their disability progresses in the absence of attacks over time. Most people with MS usually die from diseases such as or heart attacks, especially in those who are bedridden. Currently, there is no cure for multiple sclerosis. As of yet, no true way of preventing multiple sclerosis has been found. When Should You Seek Medical Care for Multiple Sclerosis? The symptoms of multiple sclerosis are very variable and differ from patient to patient. They can also be confused with symptoms of many other conditions. You should talk with your physician if you or someone you know has any of the signs and symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis or if you have any concerning symptoms. Several of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis may be severe enough to send the patient to a hospital's emergency department. Go to the nearest Emergency Department if you have any of the following symptoms: Visual changes and painful eye movements. Optic neuritis, one of the most common early signs of multiple sclerosis, causes these symptoms. If you experience personality changes or sudden loss of strength in the arms and legs. These symptoms are common with multiple sclerosis, but they can also be signs of other serious diseases that require urgent treatment such as , infection, or chemical imbalances. Managing Symptoms of MS with Diet, Exercise, and Alternative Treatments Some people with MS explore alternative forms of therapy and treatments, including many who are already taking drugs for the disease. Some people with multiple sclerosis have benefited from: Restorative, maintenance, and preventive rehabilitation Talk to your healthcare team about alternative treatments for MS.

MS Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis Reviewed By: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). In MS, the immune system attacks and damages or destroys myelin, a substance that surrounds and insulates the nerves. The myelin destruction causes a distortion or interruption in nerve impulses traveling to and from the brain. This can result in a wide variety of symptoms. Multiple sclerosis is estimated to affect 2.8 million people worldwide. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, though it can also occur in young children and the elderly. Multiple sclerosis is three times more common in women than in men. In addition, nearly all women afflicted with MS get the condition before menopause. This could mean that hormones play an important role in the disease’s development. Usually, MS in men is more severe than it is in women. They typically get MS in their 30s and 40s, just as their testosterone levels begin to decline. Although MS is more common in women than men overall, one form of the disease contradicts this pattern. People with primary progressive (PP) MS are about as likely to be male as female. (The four main types of MS are described later). People who smoke are more likely to develop MS, and to develop it more severely and with a faster progression. MS is more prevalent among Caucasians than other ethnicities. MS is believed to have a genetic component as people with a first-degree relative with the disease have a higher incidence than the general population. We don't know exactly what causes multiple sclerosis, but it is believed to be some combination of immunologic, environmental, infectious, and/or genetic factors. Some theories have been proposed, though there is not enough evidence to establish any one cause. Theories as to what causes MS include: Exposure to chemical solvents such as amines, esters, ethers, and ketones Viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly perceives its own myelin (the protective sheath around the nerves) as an intruder and attacks it, as it would a virus or other foreign infectious agent. To understand how this harms the body, it helps to understand how nerves work. A nerve can be seen by the naked eye, but it is made up of hundreds or even thousands of microscopic nerve fibers wrapped by connective tissue. Nerves conduct messages to and from the brain by way of electrical impulses. Often the nerve fibers that make up a nerve are all individually wrapped in myelin, a protective sheath that causes electric impulses to conduct down the nerve much faster than fibers that lack myelin. (The same principle is used to improve electric wires by covering them with a plastic outer layer.) In multiple sclerosis, the immune system's T cells attack the myelin sheath. By attacking myelin, the immune system in a person with MS causes inflammation and degeneration of the myelin that can lead to demyelination, or stripping of the myelin covering of the nerves. It can also cause scarring (the ""sclerosis"" in the name “multiple sclerosis”). This causes electrical impulses to travel more slowly along the nerves resulting in deterioration of function in body processes such as vision, speech, walking, writing, and memory. While multiple sclerosis is not hereditary, genetics are believed to play a role. In the U.S., the chances of developing MS are one in 750. Having a first-degree relative (parent, sibling) increases the risk to up to 5%. An identical twin of someone with MS has a 25% chance of being diagnosed with the disorder. It is thought there is an outside trigger, as genetics only makes certain people susceptible to getting MS, which is why the disease is not considered hereditary. Genes may make a person more likely to develop the disease, but it is believed that there still is an additional outside trigger that makes it happen. There are four different types of multiple sclerosis that have been identified and each type can have symptoms ranging from mild to severe. The different types of MS can help predict the course of the disease and a patient's response to treatment. The four types of MS are discussed on the next four slides. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS, RRMS or RMS) is the most common type of MS, affecting about 85% of MS sufferers. RR-MS is defined by inflammatory attacks on the myelin and nerve fibers causing a worsening of neurologic function. Symptoms vary from patient to patient, and symptoms can flare up (called relapses or exacerbations) unexpectedly, and then disappear (remission). Primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS, PPMS) is characterized by steady worsening of neurologic functioning, without any relapses or remissions. There may be occasional plateaus, but overall, the progression of the disability is continuous. This form of MS occurs equally in men and women, and the age of onset is about 10 years later than in relapsing-remitting MS. Secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SP-MS, SPMS) is a form of MS that follows relapsing-remitting MS. Most people diagnosed with RR-MS will eventually transition to having SP-MS. After a period of relapses (also called attacks, or exacerbations) and remissions the disease will start to progress steadily. People with SP-MS may or may not experience remissions. Progressive-relapsing multiple sclerosis (PR-MS, PRMS) is the least common form of MS, occurring in about 5% of MS patients. People with PR-MS experience steady disease progression and worsening neurological function as seen in primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS), along with occasional relapses like people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS). Symptoms of multiple sclerosis may be single or multiple. They may range from mild to severe in intensity. They may also be long-term or short-term in duration. Multiple sclerosis is often difficult to diagnose as symptoms are so varied and can resemble other diseases. It is often diagnosed by a process of exclusion – that is, by ruling out other neurological diseases – so the diagnosis of MS may take months to years. A physician will do a complete history and neurological exam, along with tests to evaluate mental, emotional and language functions, strength, coordination, balance, reflexes, gait, and vision. Tests to Help Confirm a Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis Cerebrospinal fluid exam (spinal tap, lumbar puncture) One of the main ways to diagnose multiple sclerosis is an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. Characteristic areas of demyelination will show up as lesions on an MRI scan. On the left is a brain MRI scan of a 35-year-old man with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis that reveals multiple lesions with high T2 signal intensity and one large white matter lesion. The right image shows the cervical spinal cord of a 27-year-old woman representing a multiple sclerosis demyelination and plaque (see arrow). There are several aspects to treating multiple sclerosis. Modifying the disease – there are several drugs that can reduce the severity and frequency of relapses Treating exacerbations (or attacks) with high dose corticosteroids Rehabilitation both for fitness and to manage energy levels Treatment for multiple sclerosis may include drugs to manage attacks, symptoms, or both. Many medications carry the risk of some side effects, so patients need to manage their treatment with their doctors. Corticosteroids are drugs that reduce inflammation in the body and affect the function of the immune system. They are often used to manage MS attacks, but can have numerous side effects. There are several medications approved for disease modification, including the following: Many medications are used to treat and manage symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis. Here are some common multiple sclerosis symptoms, followed by the medical treatments often used to treat them. Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol): Solu-Medrol is given intravenously during the acute attack, sometimes followed up with an oral corticosteroid. Continued from the last slide, here are some common multiple sclerosis symptoms, followed by the medical treatments often used to treat them. : Anti-convulsants like carbamazepine (Tegretol) or gabapentin (Neurontin) are used for face or limb pain. : Anti-depressants or electrical stimulation are used for pricking pain, intense tingling, and burning. : Antibiotics are used to manage infections : Vitamin C and cranberry juice are used to prevent infections : Used for bladder dysfunction This is usually treated by increasing fluids and fiber to the diet. Often resistant to treatment. Sometimes drugs or surgery are used if tremors are severe. There has been a lot of progress over the years in managing multiple sclerosis, and research is ongoing into new therapies. There are several new avenues of current research. Scientists hope to find further associations between lifestyle and illness progression. They want to learn ways to repair and reverse the damage MS causes. And they hope to learn the ultimate cause of this disease. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that progressively damages the nerves of the brain and spinal cord. Any sensory or motor (muscular) function in the body may be affected by the nerves damaged from MS. The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic, immunological, infectious, and/or environmental factors. There are four different types of multiple sclerosis and symptoms range from mild to severe. The different types of MS can help predict the course of the disease and, to some degree, the patient's response to treatment. What Is Multiple Sclerosis?

aa6439fb-43d6-41b3-89dd-3e37342b2613,"Published: April 03, 2010. Updated: April 03, 2010 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease, a non-contagious chronic autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system which can present with a variety of neurological symptoms occurring in attacks or slowly progressing over time. The prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) is approximately 350,000 cases in the United States and more than 2.5 million worldwide. There are at least 10,000 newly diagnosed cases of MS annually. In northern Europe, continental North America, and Australasia, about one of every 1000 citizens suffers from multiple sclerosis, whereas in the Arabian peninsula, Asia, and continental South America, the frequency is much lower. In Sub-Saharan Africa, MS is extremely rare. With important exceptions, there is a North-South gradient in the Northern hemisphere and a South-North gradient in the Southern hemisphere, with very low frequencies near the equator (between latitudes 40 degrees North and 40 degrees South. Climate, diet, geomagnetism, toxins, sunlight, genetic factors, and infectious diseases have been discussed as possible reasons for these regional differences. It has been postulated that an environmental factor during childhood might play an important role for the development of MS later in life. This was based on several studies in migrants demonstrating that if migration occurs before the age of 15, the migrant acquires his new region’s susceptibility to MS. If migration takes place after 15, the migrant keeps the susceptibility of his home country. MS occurs mainly in the Caucasian race. It is 20-fold lower in the Inuits of Canada than in other Canadians living in the same region. It is also rare in the Native American tribes of North America, the Australian Aborigine and the Maoris of New Zealand. These few examples point out that the genetic background plays an important role in the development of MS (see below). As observed in many autoimmune disorders, MS is more common in females than males; the mean sex ratio is about two females for every male. In children, who rarely develop MS, the sex ratio may reach three females for each male, whereas MS occurring in the fifth decade more commonly affects males. Onset of symptoms usually occurs between 20 to 40 years of age, rarely below 15 or above 60, although both is possible. MS is not strictly a hereditary disease. However, MS is a disease influenced by a variety of factors, one of which is the genetic background of an individual. There is no single gene known to be responsible for MS, though a few genes have been demonstrated to increase the risk of development. Although these genes are of scientific interest and continue to play a part in research, they are not enough to diagnose an individual with MS. Overall, an average one of every 25 siblings of an individual with MS will also be afflicted. Up to every second identical twin of a MS-affected person will develop MS, but only one of 20 fraternal twins. If one parent is affected by MS, only about 1 of 40 of his children will develop MS later in life. There also seems to be an association with specific HLA antigens (HLA-DR2). The ultimate cause of MS is unknown. It is hypothesised that a viral infection or other environmental factor in childhood might prime the immune system for an abnormal reaction later in life. On a molecular level, there might be a structural similarity between an unidentified infectious agent and components of the central nervous system, causing confusion in the immune system later in life (a process called “molecular mimicry”). However, so far there is no known “MS virus”. Certainly MS is not an infectious disease and not contagious. The importance of genetic factors has been discussed above. It is widely accepted that a special subset of white blood cells, called T cells, play a key role in the development of MS. Under normal circumstances, these lymphocytes can distinguish between self and non-self. In a person with MS, however, these cells recognize healthy parts of the central nervous system as foreign, and attack them as they would a virus. In MS, the part of the nervous system primarily attacked is myelin. Myelin is a fatty substance that covers the axons of nerve cells, and which is important for proper nerve conduction. Normally, there is a tight barrier between blood and brain, called the blood-brain barrier (BBB), built up of endothelial cells lining the blood vessel walls. Lymphocytes (blue) surrounding blood vessel (center) within MS lesionIn MS, the BBB breaks down; autoreactive T cells cross the BBB and trigger an inflammatory process, also mediated by other immune cells, such as cytokines and antibodies. Due to this abnormal behavior of the immune system, MS is considered to be an autoimmune disorder. The inflammatory process finally leads to a destruction of myelin called demyelination. Repair processes, called remyelination, also play an important role. This is one of the reasons why, especially in early phases of the disease, symptoms tend to decrease or disappear temporarily after days to months. Nevertheless, axonal damage and irreversible loss of neurons occur early during the course of the disease. However, due to its plasticity the brain can often compensate for some portion of the damage. MS symptoms develop as a result of multiple lesions in the brain and spinal cord, and can vary greatly between different individuals, depending on where the lesions occur. In general, relapses tend to occur more frequently during spring and summer than during autumn and winter. Infections like the common cold, influenza or unspecific diarrhea increase the risk for a relapse. In contrast, influenza vaccination is safe and does not trigger relapses as demonstrated in several recent studies. It can therefore be recommended for MS patients, especially for those at risk for influenza (e.g. healthcare workers). Tetanus vaccination is considered to be safe as well, although so far it has not been studied in that respect. In general, vaccinations with living, attenuated viruses increase the risk of relapses. Pregnancy can directly effect the susceptibility for relapse. The last three months of pregnancy offers a natural protection against relapses, whereas during the first few months after pregnancy, especially during the first six weeks, the risk for a relapse is increased 20-40%. According to current knowledge, pregnancy doesn’t seem to influence long term disability. MS does not increase the risk of bearing a handicapped child. Statistically, there is no good evidence for triggering of relapses through trauma or operations. In principle, surgical procedures require no special precautions if not dictated by existing disability. Participation in sports is possible, although extremes, such as marathon running, should probably be avoided. Emotional stress may cause a relapse, although study data has been inconsistent. Heat can transiently increase symptoms, in something known as Uhthoff’s phenomenon. This is why some patients avoid saunas or even hot showers. However, heat is not an established trigger of relapses. Extensive exposure to the sun should be avoided, since ultraviolet radiation is a strong stimulus for the immune system. Currently there are no clinically established laboratory investigations available to predict prognosis or therapeutic response, although promising approaches have been undertaken that need further confirmation, such as treatments based on the two antibodies anti-MOG and anti-MBP, and TRAIL, a TNF-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand. In most cases MS starts with an acute flare-up of symptoms within hours to days, called a relapse, exacerbation, bout, episode, or attack. Inflammation of an optic nerve (optic neuritis), causing painfulness of eye movement and visual deterioration frequently is the first symptom. However, not all patients with optic neuritis develop MS. Sensory disturbances such as numbness or tingling sensations are other frequent initial symptoms. In principle, MS can start with any of the symptoms mentioned in the section above. Especially in early phases of the disease, symptoms frequently decrease or resolve spontaneously within days to months. Therefore, this disease course is called relapsing remitting. New relapses can occur within weeks to many years and can include formerly experienced and/or new symptoms. However, MRI studies have shown that nerve damage can continue in relapsing remitting patients even if symptoms subside. It has long been known that “MS never sleeps”. This highlights the importance of preventive treatment if and when it is available. In many cases, the disease course changes after several years and symptoms start to deteriorate slowly with or without superimposed relapses. This course is called secondary chronic-progressive, or just secondary progressive. However, some patients stay in a relapsing remitting course for the rest of their lives. About 10% of all MS-affected individuals experience chronic progression without relapses from onset of symptoms. This course is called primary progressive and frequently comes along with weakness of the legs, gait and bladder disturbances. Degenerative processes and not inflammation are thought to play the most important role in this clinical disease course. Chronic progression from onset of symptoms with superimposed relapses is referred to as relapsing progressive. MS is suspected in a female, between 15 and 60 years old and usually of Northern European, Northern US or Canadian descent. Affected individuals may experience a wide variety of symptoms, such as vision loss, double vision, nystagmus, difficulty with speech, various kinds of tremor, clumsiness of the hands, unsteady gait, weakness, spasticity, numbness, and bladder (urgency, hesitancy), bowel, as well as sexual dysfunction. Various cognitive impairments are also common, such as difficulty performing multiple tasks at once, difficulty following detailed instructions, loss of short term memory, depression, and fatigue. Symptoms and signs may partially disappear after a few days or weeks. MS plaques appear hyperintense on T2 weighted studies. They usually are oval in shape, and appear in the periventricular region or corpus callosum. Detection of gadolinium enhancement can help differentiate active from chronic lesions and could help in establishing the temporal dissemination of the disease on follow up. A lumbar puncture, which is a procedure done to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, is useful for providing evidence of chronic inflammation of the central nervous system, often indicated by oligoclonal banding. Nerve conduction studies of optic, sensory and motor nerves can provide further evidence for MS, as the process of demyelination results in reduced nerve conduction velocities. The diagnostic process is completed by several laboratory tests to exclude other diseases that can mimic MS, such as Sarcoidosis, Vasculitis, and Lyme disease). A definite diagnosis of MS requires evidence for dissemination of lesions within the central nervous system both in space and in time. This means that not only must there exist evidence of at least two distinct lesions, verifiable by clinical symptoms or by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), there must also be evidence of an occurrence of new symptoms or lesions within a time interval of at least 30 days. Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is made using the 2005 revised McDonald diagnostic criteria [1]: Generally speaking, three parameters are used to assess the diagnosis. An attack refers to an episode of neurological disturbance that has lasted for at least 24 hours. This is usually a subjective report by the patient and should be backed by objective findings. A clinical lesion refers to a neurological lesion detected by history and physical examination. A paraclinical lesion refers to a lesion that is detected by MRI, evoked response testing or urodynamic studies. In addition to the assessment of the three parameters discussed above, the criteria require that evidence for dissemination of lesions in both space (spatial dissemination) and time (temporal dissemination). 2005 revised McDonald Diagnostic Criteria for Multiple Sclerosis Two attacks (temporal dissemination) + two clinical lesions (spatial dissemination) Two attacks (temporal dissemination) + one clinical lesion + one paraclinical lesion (spatial dissemination). One attack + one clinical lesion + evidence of spatial dissemination by MRI, CSF + evidence of temporal dissemination by MRI or evidence of second clinical attack. One year of disease progression + two of the following There is no known definitive cure for multiple sclerosis. However, several drugs have proven to be effective in its treatment. Intensive research is underway to study a variety of promising new drugs. Treatment is aimed at maintaining a maximum quality of life. Physiotherapy plays an important role. There are three primary forms of medication used to treat the symptoms: During an exacerbation, corticosteroids (such as prednisone or methylprednisolone) used at high dosages (500 mg - 2 g per day intravenously for a course of 3 to 5 days) can accelerate regression of symptoms. Subsequent tapering with pills may be reasonable in certain cases. There is clear evidence that sole treatment with oral steroids at dosages of 100 mg per day or less and subsequent tapering is inferior to intravenous high dose treatment. In principle, steroid treatment during pregnancy is possible. There is no good evidence that corticosteroids influence longterm outcome. Long-term treatment can influence the course of the disease: Interferon-beta1a or beta1b (Avonex; Betaseron [in Europe Betaferon]; Rebif) has been shown to reduce the relapse rate by about 30%, decrease the number of new MRI lesions and slow progression of disability. Interferon-beta is a cytokine that under natural conditions is produced by the body during viral infections; as a drug it is extracted either from special mammalian cells or special bacteria. All preparations must be injected into either muscle or skin every second day to once per week, depending on the preparation. Attempts to develop pills containing Interferon-beta have not been successful so far. Some of the interferons have been proven to be effective not only in relapsing remitting MS, but also in secondary progressive MS, as long as superimposed relapses occur. Main side effects include flu-like symptoms which tend to decrease during ongoing therapy and which can be alleviated, for example, by paracetamol or ibuprofen. Another frequent side effect is inflammatory skin reactions at the injection site if Intereferon-beta is injected into the skin. Regular blood monitoring is required. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) has also been shown to reduce the relapse rate by about 30%, decrease the number of new MRI lesions and slow progression of disability. Concerning its therapeutic effect it is approximately comparable to Interferon-beta. Glatiramer acetate consists of synthetic peptides made of four different amino acids, which are basic modules of all proteins in the human body. Once per day must be injected into the skin. Attempts to develop pills containing glatiramer acetate have also been unsuccessful. Copaxone is effective in the treatment of relapsing remitting MS. So far, beneficial effects in secondary progressive MS have not been convincingly demonstrated. Main side effects include inflammatory skin reactions at the injection site, and a rare but transient and perturbing “post-injection” reaction manifested by flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, breathlessness, and anxiety. A post-injection reaction does not require discontinuation of therapy. In general, Copaxone is considered to cause fewer side effects than Interferon-beta. However, most MS patients injecting Interferon-beta also tolerate their therapy well. Regular blood monitoring is required. Azathioprine is an agent available as a pill approved for the treatment of relapsing remitting MS in some countries. However, its effectiveness has not been proven as stringently as for the interferons and glatiramer acetate, and an effect in secondary progressive MS has not been demonstrated. In general, it is well tolerated. After longtime therapy the risk of cancer increases slightly (after 10 years of therapy about fourfold). Regular blood monitoring is required. There is some evidence that immunoglobulins (antibodies) are effective in the treatment of relapsing remitting MS, a large clinical trial (PRIVIG) is presently continuing. Immunoglobulins have not been proven to be effective in secondary progressive MS. The currently most effective drug in the preventive treatment of MS is Mitoxantrone. It has been proven to be effective in relapsing remitting and in secondary progressive MS. In most cases it is administered every three months intravenously. Therapy with Mitoxantrone is generally well tolerated, however, since with ongoing therapy the risk for damage of the heart muscle increases, at an average Mitoxantrone can only be administered for 3 to 4 years. This is why Mitoxantrone is only used in cases of rapid disease progression. Mitoxantrone treatment requires monitoring of the heart function during therapy. Regular blood monitoring is required. With these precautions Mitoxantrone treatment is safe. A family of cholesterol-lowering drugs, the statins, have shown anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of MS. However, so far there has not been provided sufficient evidence that statins are beneficial in the treatment of human MS patients with normal cholesterol levels. Recently, scientists found women who took vitamin D supplements were 40% less likely to develop multiple sclerosis than women who did not take supplements. However, this study does not allow to conclude that vitamin D has a beneficial influence on ongoing MS. Furthermore it could not distinguish between a beneficial effect of vitamin D and multivitamin drugs including vitamin E and various B vitamins which may also exert a protective effect. Primary progressive MS is very difficult to treat. High dose corticosteroids every three months can show some effect. In principle, there is no efficient preventive treatment for primary progressive MS available. Symptomatic therapy as described in the next paragraph and physiotherapy play an important role. A variety of medications are used to treat symptoms without influencing the inflammatory nature of the disease (symptomatic treatment): Baclofen and tizanidine can be useful against spasticity. There is no convincing evidence that cannabinoids (marijuana) can improve spasticity. The anticonvulsant drugs Gabapentin and Carbamazepine and the antidepressant amitriptyline can improve pain and tingling sensations in certain cases. SSRIs be used for depression, as well as for fatigue. Fatigue can also be influenced by amantadine and modafinil. There is also treatment for bladder disturbances available which is effective in many cases. Examples are oxybutynin and trospium chloride. Treatment with sildenafil (Viagra) or similar substances can improve male erectile dysfunction in many cases. Additional treatment options include plasmapheresis (“washing the blood”, showing similarities to dialysis) for severe, non-steroidresponsive relapses. Because of improved treatment for complications such as lung and bladder infections, the life expectancy of those diagnosed with MS is only slightly reduced. The earlier in life disease onset occurs, the slower disability progresses. This is due to more frequent chronic progressive courses with faster accumulation of disability when onset occurs at a higher age. Disability after 5 years correlates well with disability after 15 years: 2/3 of MS patients with low disability after 5 years will not markedly deteriorate during the next ten years. Further MS cases in the family do not influence disease progression. 1 of 3 patients will still be able to work after 15-20 years. Visual loss as the initial symptom is a marker for a rather good prognosis; gait disturbance, weakness or numbness for a rather poor prognosis. Rapid regression of initial symptoms, age at onset below 35, only a single symptom at onset, rapid development of initial symptoms and short duration of the last relapse indicate a good prognosis. When the initial disease course is relapsing remitting, the statistical duration until a wheelchair is needed, is 20 years. This means that many MS patients will never need a wheelchair. If the disease course is primary progressive then a wheelchair at an average will be needed after 6 to 7 years. It has to be noted that most of this longterm data was acquired before the advent of modern immunomodulatory drugs about 10 years ago, which have been shown to delay disease progression over a period of several years.

This increases the importance of long-term, specialized care in a comprehensive MS center to maintain independence and quality of life. As a National Multiple Sclerosis Society affiliated center for comprehensive care, we provide MS specialty services and coordinated rehabilitation therapy services that address the full spectrum of MS related problems. Our program includes the expertise of health care professionals from neurology, urology, pain medicine, psychiatry, nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology. Our team of specialists aim to promote independence, comfort, and health and wellness. Rehabilitation is an integral part of comprehensive multiple sclerosis care, aiding in the management of the diverse set of problems many patients encounter. provides education, exercises, assistive devices and tools designed to improve and maintain function at all stages of the disease. eases problems related to walking and mobility. Exercises are designed to improve issues related to balance (including dizziness), posture, energy, and strength. Physical therapy may also include training in the use of mobility aids, such as canes and wheelchairs. focuses on enabling independence and safety in self-care activities (e.g. dressing, bathing), productive activities (e.g. work, home management), and leisure activities (e.g. recreational interests). Occupational therapists also perform mobility evaluations to determine the most appropriate mobility device for a particular situation. provides techniques for improving memory, learning, and thinking. helps individuals identify distressing thoughts, change their thinking and initiate behavioral change. CBT is used for depression, anxiety and adjustment difficulties. addresses problems related to speech and swallowing. Speech-language pathologists evaluate your speech patterns and facial muscular control to help you regain and maintain speech abilities. People with multiple sclerosis are at a greater risk for deconditioning, or the loss of muscle tone and fitness due to prolonged physical inactivity. One of the best ways to maintain your health while managing multiple sclerosis is through a regular exercise and weight lifting program. Studies have demonstrated that aerobic exercise helps people with MS achieve improved overall health and better perform activities of daily living. 30 minutes of aerobic activity four to five days per week (two to three days per week when recovering from a relapse) can help ease symptoms. Improved bone density and reduction in fracture risk Reduced muscle stiffness and involuntary muscle spasms It is important to consult with your doctor before beginning any type of exercise program. Your exercise program should fit your capabilities and limitations to prevent risk of strain to an already compromised muscular system. Our neurologists and physical therapists can work with you to develop a personal exercise program that meets your needs.

It can cause symptoms that come and go, including numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, vision problems and trouble walking or talking. In this protocol, learn about the causes of MS and what treatments are available. Discover how an imbalanced immune system contributes to the inflammation that drives the disease. Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to modulate the immune response in MS and help improve symptoms, in some clinical trials. What is Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease characterized by destruction of the myelin sheath—the coating that insulates and protects neurons. This demyelination causes disruptions in neural communication and potentially neuronal death, leading to disability. MS may follow several disease courses, the most common of which is relapsing remitting. Relapsing remitting MS is characterized by clearly defined acute attacks followed by periods of remission. Natural interventions such as vitamin D and essential fatty acids may help relieve inflammation and improve symptoms of MS. What are the Risk Factors for Multiple Sclerosis? Genetic predisposition Viral infection (eg, Epstein-Barr virus) Vitamin D deficiency Hormonal imbalance Exposure to organic solvents Food sensitivities Smoking What are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? Note: Symptoms of MS vary widely, depending on the location of affected nerve fibers. Symptoms may include: Fatigue Numbness or tingling in limbs Impaired vision Muscle weakness, clumsiness Loss of balance, dizziness, potential nausea and vomiting Bladder dysfunction Changes in memory, reasoning, and spatial perception What are Conventional Medical Treatments for Multiple Sclerosis? Note: There is currently no cure for MS. Treatments include therapies to calm acute attacks, slow or modify the disease course, and alleviate symptoms. Several experimental therapies are currently being evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. Therapies for acute attacks: Corticosteroids Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange to remove inflammatory factors and antibodies) Disease-modifying therapies: Beta interferons to reduce inflammation and slow disease progression Glatiramer acetate, an immunomodulator Immunosuppressant drugs (eg, mitoxantrone) Monoclonal antibodies (eg, natalizumab) Dalfampridine, a potassium channel blocker, to increase the ability of nerve cells to conduct impulses Symptom management may include: muscle relaxants medications to reduce fatigue antidepressants What are Additional Therapies for Multiple Sclerosis? Physical therapy Occupational therapy Speech therapy Cognitive rehabilitation Vocational rehabilitation Swank low-fat diet Hormone therapy What Natural Interventions May Be Beneficial for Multiple Sclerosis? Vitamin D. As vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for MS, supplementation may be helpful. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that MS patients taking vitamin D had fewer relapses and less inflammation. Essential fatty acids. Omega-3 (ie, DHA and EPA) and certain omega-6 (ie, GLA) fatty acids have been shown to reduce inflammation and improve some symptoms of MS. Antioxidants. Oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of MS, and MS patients tend to have low levels of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione peroxidase. Supplementing with selenium, vitamin E, vitamin C, and/or N-acetylcysteine may boost glutathione peroxidase levels for potential benefits. Lipoic acid. Lipoic acid has been shown to inhibit the activity of ICAM-1, a protein believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Supplementation with lipoic acid reduced ICAM-1 levels and T-cell migration into the central nervous system in patients with MS. Vitamin B12. Patients with MS may be deficient in vitamin B12. Supplementation has been shown in several studies to improve symptoms and the clinical course of the disease in patients with MS. Biotin. Biotin (vitamin B7) has demonstrated positive effects in patients with MS. Studies showed high doses of biotin improved measures of MS-related disabilities in some patients. Other natural interventions that may benefit patients with MS include coenzyme Q10, ginkgo biloba, green tea, and curcumin. 2 Introduction Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease of autoimmunity and inflammation characterized by destruction of the myelin sheath that insulates and protects neurons. When a patient experiences an ""attack,"" or episode of increased disease activity, the resultant impairment of neuronal communication can manifest as a broad spectrum of symptoms, affecting sensory processing, locomotion, and cognition. Scientific research suggests both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of the disease. Current medical treatments for MS include potent immunosuppressive drugs, which reduce immune function, and anti-inflammatory medications as well as invasive procedures such as plasma exchange, which attempts to reduce inflammatory mediators in a patient's blood. Largely ignored and discounted by mainstream medicine, nutrients offer immune-modifying benefits that can help complement pharmacological and clinical interventions and improve quality of life for MS patients. Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests vitamin D may be a missing link in virtually all autoimmune diseases, including MS. This single vitamin has the ability to modulate the immune system in ways that even pharmaceutical drugs cannot. A multitude of epidemiological studies have revealed that individuals with low levels of vitamin D in their blood are at considerably increased risk for developing MS; in fact, up to 90% of MS patients are deficient in vitamin D.1 3 Understanding Multiple Sclerosis Within the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) a vast network of neurons are constantly communicating amongst themselves, and with the peripheral nervous system (outside of the brain and spinal cord), to control every aspect of human function, from sight and hearing, to cognition and mobility. The efficiency and accuracy of communication between individual neurons form the basis for our ability to do things as diverse as complete simple daily tasks and comprehend complex philosophical or mathematical ideas. Neuronal communication is similar to the transmission of an electrical current through a series of wires. Droves of neurons work together to deliver messages to every corner of the body by transmitting signals along their long, cylindrical mid-sections called axons and passing it on to the next neuron. This is repeated until the message reaches its destination. Like electrical wires, neuronal axons require insulation to ensure that they are able to transmit a signal accurately, and at high speeds. Specialized cells called oligodendrocytes provide this insulation to neurons by wrapping the axons in an insulating material called myelin. Without this myelin sheath, neuronal communication becomes nearly impossible, and neurons become susceptible to damage. Multiple sclerosis is a disease which ultimately leads to the inability of neurons to communicate amongst themselves. Because multiple sclerosis is not selective for specific neurons, and can progress through the brain and spinal cord randomly, each patient's symptoms may vary considerably. During the initial stages of the disease, symptoms often emerge for a finite time before regressing for an extended period. 4 Pathology of Disease Progression Demyelination MS is an immuno-inflammatory disease in which immune cells enter the central nervous system (CNS) and destroy the myelin sheath. Immune cells, which become activated through complex mechanisms migrate into the CNS, and attack the myelin sheath. The resultant demyelination is thought to be carried out by T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and macrophages, three primary classes of immune cells, which are routinely found in MS lesions.2 Loss of myelin followed by subsequent lack of neural communication and neuronal death is accepted as the primary cause of disability in MS patients.3 Axonal transection, or the severing of axons, occurs under conditions of both acute and chronic demyelination.4-6 Remyelination Remyelination is the process by which demyelinated axons are naturally re-wrapped with myelin, restoring nerve conduction and functionality.7 This phenomenon is the result of oligodendrocytes repairing the damage to the myelin sheath that occurs during an episode of increased disease activity. However, as the disease progresses over years (usually decades) the oligodendrocytes begin to lose their ability to repair the damage, and symptoms become progressively worse and episodes more frequent due to remyelination failure. In addition to developing therapies that slow MS disease progression, many laboratories are developing novel therapeutics that aim to promote remyelination and reverse existing CNS damage. Inflammation In addition to immune-mediated loss of myelin, another characteristic feature of MS is inflammation caused by a class of white blood cells called T cells.8,9 Some of the damage in the CNS is directly carried out by two subpopulations of T lymphocytes called T helper 1 and T helper 17 which produce pro-inflammatory factors.10 Recent studies have identified that chemical mediators, interleukin-23 (IL-23) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), contribute to the autoimmune characteristics of these T cells. Data suggest absence of these pro-inflammatory signals was sufficient to prevent inflammation in the brain.11 This suggests that therapeutic strategies directed at blocking the production of inflammatory mediators could be effective for treating MS. Vitamin D and Multiple Sclerosis: A Panacea? Mainstream medicine has failed to recognize the pivotal role of vitamin D in regulating the overactive immune system in MS patients. Greater than 30 years have passed since vitamin D was originally hypothesized to be an important environmental determinant of the prevalence of MS.12,13 During the three decades following the initial linking of vitamin D and MS, evidence has continued to mount. It is now known that MS occurs more frequently in individuals with lower blood levels of vitamin D. A study published in the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association found that, compared to those with the highest vitamin D blood levels, those with the lowest blood levels were 62% more likely to develop MS. MS attacks occur less frequently during seasons corresponding with the highest exposure to sunlight; since vitamin D synthesis depends upon exposure of the skin to sunlight, the summer months also bring the highest blood levels of vitamin D.14 A recent study has quantified the impact of vitamin D blood levels on risk for MS relapse—for each 4 ng/ml increase in 25-hydroxy vitamin D in the blood, the risk for MS relapse is reduced by 12%. The investigators who conducted this study concluded that ""Clinically, raising 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels by [20 ng/ml] could halve the hazard of a relapse.""15 Vitamin D mediates these disease-modifying effects through complex and powerful interactions with the immune system. Hostile immune cells, which attack the myelin sheath, are calmed upon exposure to vitamin D. In fact, when aggressive immune cells taken directly from MS patients are exposed to the active form of vitamin D, the cells divide and reproduce much more slowly, indicating that vitamin D has the ability to impede the aberrant autoimmunity that is a driving force in MS. However, vitamin D does more than just arrest damaging immune cells; it also supercharges protective immune cells. T-reg cells are specialized components of the immune system that help keep immunity balanced. If too few T-reg cells are present, the immune system becomes overactive, as in autoimmune diseases like MS. Vitamin D increases the number of protective T-reg cells, restoring equilibrium to an overactive immune system.16 In a randomized controlled trial, supplementation with doses of vitamin D ranging from 10,000 IU to 40,000 IU daily over the course of 52 weeks resulted in a reduction in relapses and a reduction in the number of aggressive immune cells in patients with MS.17 Despite robust findings across a range of studies on the link between vitamin D and MS, mainstream medicine and the federal government have only just recently begun to realize the need to initiate federally funded trials. Results of a large scale, randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess the effects of vitamin D in MS are currently pending.1 Life Extension customers should not be surprised if vitamin D emerges as a frontline treatment for MS in the coming years. However, instead of waiting for mainstream physicians to begin recommending vitamin D to MS patients, Life Extension suggests all individuals monitor their blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and maintain a blood level of 50–80 ng/mL. This is because low vitamin D levels are also an emerging risk factor for numerous other diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.18-22 The amount of supplementation required to achieve this blood level varies from person to person, but it appears many individuals require supplementation of 5,000‒8,000 IU vitamin D daily to reach these levels. More information about the role of vitamin D in health is available in the compelling Life Extension Magazine article entitled ""Startling Findings About Vitamin D Levels in Life Extension Members."" 5 Risk Factors for MS Genetics and Family History Studies have established a definitive role for genetics as contributing factor for developing MS. The most compelling data reveal that while unrelated adopted siblings have a 0‒2% disease risk, identical twins demonstrate a 25% disease risk.23 Several studies have identified susceptibility genes related to many aspects of immune function.24-28 While these genetic links are helpful in understanding MS population clusters, findings such as the 25% disease risk among identical twins and the geographic distribution of MS suggest that up to 75% of MS must be attributable to non-genetic or environmental factors. Infection Infection is one of the more widely suspected non-genetic risk factors for MS. Data suggest that, in genetically predisposed individuals, exposure to an infectious agent may lead to MS.29 One common theory, molecular mimicry, proposes that presentation of foreign antigens that are molecularly similar to self-antigens leads to an autoimmune response.30,31 In other words, viruses involved in the development of autoimmune diseases could possibly display very similar proteins to the proteins found on nerves making these nerves also a target for antibodies. Investigators have probed the involvement of several viruses including: herpes simplex virus (HSV), rubella, measles, mumps, and Epstein Barr virus (EBV).32 Currently, the strongest evidence for the involvement of an infectious agent implicates EBV. Virtually all patients who have MS are infected with the EBV.32 Further, levels of antibodies to EBV are strongly correlated with the risk of developing the disease.33 Low Vitamin D Levels Considering the regulatory role that vitamin D plays in immune system reactivity, it is not surprising that population-based studies have consistently found lower levels of vitamin D in the blood of patients with MS compared to healthy control subjects. Data from the Nurses' Health Study (more than 92,000 women followed from 1980 to 2000) and the Nurses' Health Study II (more than 95,000 women followed from 1991 to 2001), support the notion of a protective effect for vitamin D against the risk of developing MS. The incidence of MS was 33% lower in women that consumed the most vitamin D as compared to those that consumed the least. In addition, those that consumed at least 400 IU daily of vitamin D from supplements had an astounding 41% lower incidence of MS.18 In a recent study, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco discovered low 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood levels in African Americans with MS as compared to controls.34 The senior author, who is also the associate director of UCSF Multiple Sclerosis Center concluded, ""It seems relatively clear low vitamin D levels are a risk factor for developing multiple sclerosis."" Hormones Studies have shown that MS is more common in women than men, and that the disease course is affected by the fluctuation of steroid hormones during the female menstrual cycle.35 It is also widely reported that MS patients who become pregnant experience a significant decrease in relapses, enabling women who have MS to bear children safely.36 Animal models of multiple sclerosis have shown that the pregnancy hormone, estriol, can ameliorate disease and can cause an immune shift.36,37 Other studies note that pregnant women who have MS tend to experience a rebound of their disease within three months post-delivery.38 These findings suggest hormones can regulate the course of MS, and this theory is further supported by research demonstrating that steroid hormones (eg, estrogens, testosterone, progesterone, and, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]) can modulate the immune system.39-41 The specific relationship of hormones to the disease process of MS is complex, with ratios between the individual hormones also playing a role. For example, during a human study that examined the presence of MS lesions by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), patients with high estradiol and low progesterone levels had more lesions that those who had low levels of both hormones. Further, patients with a high estrogen to progesterone ratio had a significantly greater number of ""active,"" inflamed lesions than patients who had a low ratio.42 These studies suggest that maintaining youthful hormone balance may ease the symptoms of MS. A study from Italy provided further evidence that abnormal hormone levels may play a role in the development of MS. The investigators measured hormone levels in 35 women and 25 men with MS, and in 36 people without the disease. Women with low testosterone levels were found to have more brain tissue damage, as determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The women with MS had lower levels of testosterone throughout their monthly cycle compared to women who did not have the condition. Testosterone levels did not vary between men with MS and unaffected men. However, men with MS who had the highest levels of the female hormone estradiol were found to have the greatest degree of brain tissue damage.43 More information about optimizing and balancing hormone levels can be found in Life Extension's ""Male Hormone Restoration"" and ""Female Hormone Restoration"" protocols. Organic Solvents In the mid-1990s, researchers in Sweden evaluated 13 studies investigating the connection between solvent exposure and autoimmune disease. Organic solvents include chemicals such as toluene, paint thinner, and acetone, the latter of which is commonly found in nail polish remover. Ten of those studies indicated a significant relationship between organic solvent exposure and MS. All of the analyses suggested exposure to solvents increases a person's relative risk of developing MS.44 In another study scientists analyzed the occupational health records of more than 57,000 workers in Norway, covering a 16-year period. They concluded that workers, such as painters, who are routinely exposed to organic solvents, had twice the risk of developing MS than those who were not occupationally exposed. These results were compatible with the hypothesis that organic solvents are a possible risk factor for MS.45 Individuals interested in protecting themselves from organic solvents and other environmental toxins should read Life Extension's ""Metabolic Detoxification"" protocol. Food Sensitivities Sensitivities to certain foods may also play a role in the development or exacerbation of MS. Antibodies to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, is more common in patients with MS.46,47 MS is also most prevalent in areas where consumption of wheat gluten and milk are also high.48 This relationship led scientists to explore a possible link between antibodies produced to bovine milk proteins and the ability of those antibodies to cross-react to the protective sheathes around nerves triggering an MS episode. Indeed, this immunologic cross-reactivity has been demonstrated in the laboratory in rodents that have MS.49,50 Further investigations have revealed that in MS patients, higher levels of these antibodies are produced within the central nervous system.51 Additional studies are still needed to understand how this cross-reactivity plays into the development and progression of MS. To help rule out food sensitivities, Life Extension suggests blood testing such as the Food Safe Allergy test and the Celiac Disease Antibody Screen. Call 800-226-2370 for more information on how to obtain this type of testing. Additional information about food allergies is available in the Life Extension Magazine article entitled ""What's Really Making You Sick?"" Smoking A recently published literature review, evaluating more than 3,000 MS cases and 450,000 controls, supports the emerging consensus that smoking increases the risk of developing MS by approximately 50%.52 It is unlikely that smoking alone accounts for the worldwide variation in MS prevalence, and thus, the interplay between genetic markers and smoking has also been investigated. One such study reported that smokers that have two known genetic markers for MS had two times the risk for developing MS than their non-smoking counterparts.53 Another study has also verified that smokers diagnosed with MS but in remission have 3.5 times the risk of reactivating and progression of their disease than their non-smoking counterparts.54,55 6 Symptoms and Diagnosis MS can affect people of all ages; however, the average age of disease onset is between 20 and 40 years.48 Fatigue, numbness in the limbs, impaired vision, muscle weakness, loss of balance, and bladder dysfunction are frequent symptoms. Symptoms of multiple sclerosis vary widely, depending on the location of affected nerve fibers.48 Symptoms affecting mobility tend to appear early in the course of MS and they may include weakness, clumsiness, leg dragging, stiffness, and a tendency to drop objects. Common sensory symptoms include numbness, sensations of heaviness, tingling, and electrical sensations. Visual symptoms are also common, affecting more than one-third of all people who have MS. The classic visual disturbances, such as blurred or foggy vision and eyeball pain, usually appear early in the course of the disease. MS can also interfere with the nerves that supply the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear, which is where balance is perceived. This can result in dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. In the later stages of the disease, involvement of the genitourinary tract may result in loss of bladder, sexual, and bowel function.56 Over 40% of MS patients suffer from changes in memory, reasoning, spatial perception, and verbal fluency.57 Symptoms of MS are often triggered or worsened by an increase in body temperature. MS is a tremendously variable and unpredictable disease. Different patients will experience different symptoms, rates of disease progression, and responses to treatment. Four Disease Courses Have Been Identified in MS Progressive relapsing (PR) MS, which is the least common disease course, shows progression of disability from onset but with clear acute relapses, with or without full recovery. Approximately 5% of people with MS appear to have PRMS at diagnosis. Secondary progressive (SP) MS begins with an initial relapsing-remitting disease course, followed by progression of disability. Typically, secondary-progressive disease is characterized by: less recovery following attacks, persistently worsening functioning during and between attacks, and accompanied by progressive disability. Many patients with RRMS do develop SPMS ultimately. Primary progressive (PP) MS is characterized by progression of disability from onset, without plateaus or remissions or with occasional plateaus and temporary minor improvements. A person with PPMS, by definition, does not experience acute attacks. Ten percent of diagnosed MS are PPMS. Relapsing remitting (RR) MS represents 85% of clinical diagnoses of the disease. It is characterized by clearly defined acute attacks with full recovery or with residual deficit upon recovery. Periods between disease relapses are characterized by a lack of disease progression. Diagnosis No single test gives a definitive diagnosis for MS, and variable symptoms and disease course make early diagnosis a challenge. Most presumptive diagnoses of MS are based on the clinical symptoms seen in an acute attack. These presumptions are then supported by a combination of diagnostic imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), antibody testing of the fluid found in the CNS, measurements to evaluate how efficiently nerves conduct impulses (since demyelination slows nerve conduction) and evaluation of how the symptoms progress through time.58 7 Conventional Therapies A cure for MS has yet to be discovered, and although recent efforts have brought advances in available treatments, substantial room for improvement remains. Presently, conventional medical treatment typically focuses on strategies to treat acute attacks, to slow the progression of the disease, and to treat symptoms. Conventional Medical Treatments to Treat Acute Disease Flares Corticosteroids. For acute MS flares, corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, are commonly administered in high doses to suppress the immune system and decrease the production of proinflammatory factors. These drugs are often prescribed for short periods and can be effective at alleviating the symptoms of MS. Corticosteroids should not be used for long-term therapy, however, because of their many side effects, including increased risk of infection, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, cataracts, elevated blood sugar, mood swings and weight gain. Also, while corticosteroids may reduce the symptoms of the disease, they have no effect on its progression.59 Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis). Plasmapheresis is a process in which whole blood is separated into blood cells and plasma, the liquid part of blood. In MS patients the plasma contains unusually high levels of antibodies and proinflammatory factors that exacerbate symptoms. Plasma exchange helps remove these factors quickly and is sometimes used to help combat severe symptoms of multiple sclerosis relapses in people who are not responding to intravenous steroids. Conventional Medical Treatment to Modify the Course of the Disease Beta interferons. Beta interferons (Avonex, Betaseron) reduce inflammation and slow progression of the disease, but like many medications used in conventional medical treatment of MS, the mechanism of action is poorly understood60,61 This specific treatment may be accompanied by adverse effects such as suicidal depression, liver damage, flu-like symptoms, and injection site reactions.62 Glatiramer acetate. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is an MS treatment that yields fewer adverse side effects than beta interferon while still remaining clinically effective. Glatiramer has a chemical structure similar to the protective myelin sheath around nerves and serves as a decoy for antibodies that would otherwise attack this sheath.63 Side effects may include flushing, rapid heartbeat, nausea, shortness of breath after injection, and injection site reactions.64 Mitoxantrone and fingolimod. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) and fingolimod (Gilenya) are immunosuppressants. Clinical data show these drugs can slow the rates at which disability progresses and the rate at which new lesions form in the brain and spinal cord. These therapies, however, are not used as a first-line treatment as they can cause severe side effects including heart disease, leukemia, decreased white blood cell counts, and increased rates of infection.65 Natalizumab. Natalizumab (Tysabri) is thought to block a protein that allows white blood cells to enter the brain and spinal cord and cause disease progression in MS. Due to an association with three cases of a potentially fatal infection of the CNS,66 this is a controversial drug that is only available for patients enrolled in the Tysabri Outreach Unified Commitment to Health (TOUCH) program.67 This medication is reserved for people who do not see results from other types of treatments. Dalfampridine. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is a medication approved in 2010 that increases the ability of nerve cells to conduct impulses.68 This drug represents a new class of therapies that is aimed at addressing neurologic deficits directly. Medications to Treat Symptoms Muscle relaxants. Multiple sclerosis patients may experience painful or uncontrollable muscle stiffness or spasms, particularly in the legs. Muscle relaxants such as baclofen (Lioresal) and tizanidine (Zanaflex) may improve muscle spasticity. However, baclofen may increase weakness in the legs, and tizanidine may cause drowsiness or a dry mouth. Medications to reduce fatigue. Drugs such as amantadine (Symmetrel) may help reduce fatigue. Other medications. Medications may also be prescribed for depression, pain and bladder or bowel control problems that may be associated with multiple sclerosis. Medications on the Horizon There are approximately 20 experimental therapies that are on the pathway to approval by the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA). Investigators are making progress toward developing treatments that may be capable of protecting the CNS as well as encouraging repair of brain and spinal cord lesions. Many of these drugs are potentially valuable as treatments for MS, but are months or years from traversing all phases of the FDA process. Laquinimod. Laquinimodhas been shown to decrease proinflammatory factors and increase factors that promote nerve protection without increasing risk of infection. Laquinimod was well tolerated by most patients, with only a few reports of adverse effects.69 Alemtuzumab. Alemtuzumab (Campath) is an antibody specific for mature white blood cells that targets them for destruction by the immune system. This drug is approved for the treatment of certain types of lymphoma and leukemia. In one study, it was shown to be more effective than beta interferon in reducing disability progression and relapse rate, however, the trial was discontinued early due to serious side effects.70 Fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a substance that has been used in the treatment of psoriasis and shows promise in MS to decrease white blood cell infiltration into the spinal cord.71 Therapy and Rehabilitation to Improve Quality of Life In addition to one or more drug-based therapies, MS patients will often participate in rehabilitation programs intended to maintain or improve their ability to perform at home and at work. More specifically these programs focus on general fitness and aim to address problems related to mobility, speech and swallowing, and cognitive deficits. Common rehabilitation strategies include: Physical therapy. Practices that aide mobility and functionality through structured physical activity on a scheduled basis. Occupational therapy. Skills aimed at using work, self-care, and leisure activities to foster development and limit disability. Speech therapy. Work with speech therapists can help MS patients overcome speech and language difficulties and help with troublesome swallowing. Cognitive rehabilitation. Assistance in managing difficulties with memory, high order thinking, and perception. A variety cognitive rehabilitation options are available. For example, playing chess regularly is a great way to promote neuronal function and communication; computer-based ""brain training"" programs are also helpful. Vocational rehabilitation. Support in making career plans, gaining job skills, and approaches to remaining gainfully employed. 8 Multiple Sclerosis Nutritional Protocol Most patients that employ complementary treatments for MS do so as an accompaniment with conventional drug treatments and find both classes of therapy to provide clinical benefits.72 The following section outlines key details and evidence-based findings concerning the latest complementary approaches to treating MS. Vitamin D As previously mentioned, mainstream medicine has overlooked a critical missing link in MS management—vitamin D. This hormone-like vitamin is capable of safely interacting directly with the genome to modulate a variety of physiological functions, including aspects of immune function involved in autoimmune diseases like MS. Two human clinical trials demonstrated that individuals with MS using vitamin D tended to have fewer relapses and less inflammation.17,73,74 In a year-long Vitamin D study, recurrence rate of MS ""attacks"" was 27% lower compared to baseline.74 In another large-dose Vitamin D trial, MS patients given 28,000‒280,000 IU weekly were found to have fewer active lesions during the 28-week long study.75 In light of the accumulating epidemiological and clinical evidence of the importance of vitamin D in this disease, supplementing the diet with vitamin D appears to be a low cost means to address this risk. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) are polyunsaturated FAs which cannot be synthesized in humans and therefore must be provided via dietary sources. Both plant and animal foods are potential sources of omega-3 FAs. For example, linolenic acid, found in flaxseed, flaxseed oil, and preferably, fish and fish oils have very high levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A small study looking at the effects of omega-3 FAs on MS found that immune cells from treated patients and healthy controls produced significantly fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines after three months of treatment with 6 grams of fish oil per day.76 One double-blind placebo-controlled study exists to date looking at the effect of omega-3 FAs on MS disease progression. In this study 312 patients were given either fish oil or olive oil placebo for two years. The results of this trial exhibited a trend toward decreased disease severity in the omega-3 FA group when compared with control.77 More recent studies have shown that MS patients given 10 grams of fish oil per day for three months exhibited significantly reduced levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a factor correlated with disease progression, and also had greater concentrations of omega-3 FAs in their red blood cell membranes.78 Other work has shown that MS patients, while on a low-fat diet with omega-3 FA supplementation, experienced significantly reduced fatigue and lower relapse rates.79 Based upon clinical data and patient accounts, omega-3 FAs appear to be well tolerated and safe with no reports of adverse events. Linoleic Acid and Omega-6 Fatty Acids Linoleic acid is converted to gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), a beneficial omega-6 FA, after it is taken orally. However, this conversion is occasionally impaired, especially during inflammatory disease states.48,80 GLA has been shown to quell inflammation and research involving an animal model of MS has demonstrated that GLA administration significantly improved clinical outcomes when compared with control treatment.81 Some studies have shown significantly reduced relapse rates and disease progression scores, while others have found no differences between treatment and control groups.81-83 A closer look at data from these trials revealed that patients with lower levels of disability at the beginning of the trial exhibited a smaller increase in disability over the study period than did controls. In addition, linoleic acid was found to reduce the severity and duration of MS episodes in patients at all levels of disease severity.84 Selenium and Vitamin E Patients who have MS tend to have abnormally low levels of glutathione peroxidase, a powerful endogenous antioxidant.85,86 Researchers in Denmark conducted a small study in which patients with MS were given an antioxidant mixture containing about 2,000 mcg selenium, 2 grams vitamin C, and 480 mg vitamin E once daily for five weeks. Although glutathione peroxidase levels were initially lower in patients with MS than in normal control subjects, after five weeks of antioxidant therapy, levels of this antioxidant enzyme increased five-fold and reported side effects were minimal.85 ""[O]xidative stress plays an important role in pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. This finding also suggests the importance of antioxidants in diet and therapy of MS patients.""87 N-Acetylcysteine An effective strategy for increasing the body's supply of the powerful antioxidant glutathione is taking the oral supplement N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant that serves as a precursor to glutathione.48,88 NAC's potential benefit in the context of MS has been noted by some researchers.48,89 In a rodent MS model, NAC was able to diminish clinical symptoms and pathological evidence of CNS injury, and attenuate inflammation.90 Lipoic Acid Lipoic acid (LA) is a dietary supplement with antioxidant properties and has been studied specifically in MS. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated primarily by immune cells, are implicated as mediators of demyelination and nerve damage.91,92 Known to cross the blood-brain barrier, LA decreases the activity of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of MS. It is believed that ICAM-1 and other adhesion molecules are responsible for allowing certain pro-inflammatory immune cells, like T-lymphocytes, to enter the CNS, paving the way for induction or exacerbation of inflammation and tissue damage.93-95 In an animal MS model, LA produced a significant reduction of demyelination and infiltration of the CNS by T lymphocytes.96-98 Other researchers have followed up on these studies. In a pilot clinical trial, 37 patients with MS were randomly assigned to receive various doses of LA (up to 2,400 mg/day) or placebo. After two weeks, patients were assessed for levels of ICAM-1 and tolerability of high-dose LA. In addition to being well tolerated by patients, LA treatment was associated with reduced ICAM-1 levels and reduced T-cell migration into the CNS.99 Coenzyme Q10 Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant that is an essential part of healthy mitochondrial function and energy production with potential usefulness in treating MS. Decreased levels of CoQ10 are associated with many disease states, including heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.100,101 CoQ10 was low in patients with MS.102 Several clinical trials of CoQ10 have been performed in neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer disease, Friedreich's ataxia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.103 CoQ10 is a powerful lipid-soluble antioxidant that is also capable of regenerating the antioxidant capacity of vitamin E in the body. Based upon clinical evidence, CoQ10 appears to be well tolerated and safe with potential usefulness in the management of MS. Vitamin B12 Some data suggest patients with MS have abnormally low levels of vitamin B12 in their cerebrospinal fluid, blood serum, or both.104 In fact, clinical vitamin B12 deficiency and MS share remarkably similar characteristics, occasionally rendering correct diagnosis difficult.105 Notably, vitamin B12 plays a key role in the generation of myelin and thus, for decades, integrative physicians have prescribed B12 injections for patients who have MS. Data suggest patients given vitamin B12 supplements have experienced clinical improvements in their symptoms.48 For example, in the United Kingdom, researchers investigated the effects of six months of vitamin B12 (1 mg/week injection) on 138 patients with MS. The researchers concluded that the clinical course of patients with MS improved after beginning vitamin B12 treatment.106 Ginkgo Biloba Ginkgo biloba extracts are primarily composed of flavonoids and terpenoids and have been reported to have properties that can influence neural activity and improve cognitive performance. While controlled trials of the effects of ginkgo biloba on cognitive function have generated inconsistent findings, more recent studies found encouraging results for patients with MS.107-109 In one study, patients received 120 mg of ginkgo biloba extract or placebo twice per day for 12 weeks. Those patients taking ginkgo biloba exhibited improved measures of attention and reported fewer difficulties with memory. Green Tea (Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate) Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of many active ingredients of green tea that have been reported to have beneficial effects on the nervous and immune systems. In an animal study of MS, ECGC was found to prevent severity of clinical signs by decreasing inflammation and protecting nerve cells.110 According to animal research, green tea has the ability to significantly increase regulatory T cells which are critical to providing balance to the immune system and suppressing autoimmunity.111 Curcumin Curcumin is an active component of turmeric, a popular Indian spice. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that curcumin has potent anti-inflammatory effects.112 A research group carrying out animal studies has demonstrated exciting findings that curcumin treatment results in a significant reduction in disease severity and a reduction in duration of acute attacks.113 In a follow-up study, laboratory researchers found curcumin not only suppressed disease severity, but also was associated with reduction of levels of IL-17 a cytokine that has been directly implicated in the progression of MS.114 Biotin Biotin, a water-soluble B-complex vitamin, is sometimes referred to as vitamin B7. Biotin participates in biochemical reactions catalyzed by decarboxylase enzymes, supporting energy production and fatty acid and myelin synthesis.115,116 The Adequate Intake for biotin is 30 micrograms, and low-to-moderate amounts are common in multivitamin supplements.117,118 Biotin's role in neuron functioning is evidenced by its therapeutic effect in a rare genetic disease known as biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease.118 Children affected by this disease experience progressive neurological dysfunction, including speech and motor dysfunction, mental retardation, seizures, and possibly death. Early treatment with biotin and thiamine (vitamin B1) appears to prevent progression in most cases.119,120 More recently, researchers have been exploring biotin's potential benefits in patients with MS. In the first clinical trial to demonstrate the potential of high-dose biotin in MS therapy, 23 patients with progressive MS were treated with 100–300 mg biotin daily for an average of 9.2 months. While improvements were not seen for two to eight months after initiating biotin therapy—suggesting biotin may instigate a slow and progressive repair of MS-related nerve damage—vision improved in all four participants with MS-related optic nerve injury, and motor function and overall disability improved in 16 of 18 participants (89%) with prominent spinal cord involvement.116,118 In a randomized controlled trial, 154 patients with progressive MS received either 100 mg biotin three times daily or placebo for 12 months. Thirteen (12.6%) of the biotin-treated subjects versus none of the placebo subjects exhibited improvements in measures of MS-related disability after nine months that persisted through the end of the trial. In addition, only 4.2% of biotin-treated subjects compared with 13.6% of placebo subjects had progressively worsening disability scores at nine months. At the end of the 12 months, placebo subjects were switched to high-dose biotin, and overall stabilization of disability was seen in all subjects at a 24-month follow-up.121 Biotin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients have been observed to be lower than those of healthy people, leading to speculation that low biotin availability may contribute to the pathology of MS.122 Although the mechanism of biotin's ability to prevent or repair nerve damage is unknown, biotin may prevent progressive demyelination by improving mitochondrial function, increasing brain energy production, supporting myelin production by increasing lipid synthesis, and affecting gene expression.118,123 Biotin is excreted through the urinary system, and high doses appear to be well tolerated in trials to date.118,124 However, high doses of biotin may interfere with certain lab tests, including thyroid function tests, leading to misdiagnosis of thyrotoxicosis.117,125,126 In addition, the possibility of teratogenicity has been suggested by animal research124; therefore, the safety of high-dose biotin in pregnancy is not established. Swank Diet Dr. Roy Swank first proposed a connection between increased consumption of saturated animal fat and the incidence of MS in 1950.127 He conducted a study which enrolled 208 patients with MS in the early 1950s, all of whom had experienced at least two acute relapses, and followed their progress over 34 years.128 In this study, patients maintained the now termed Swank diet, which consists of: less than 15 grams/day of saturated animal fat, 10‒15 grams/day of vegetable oil, 5 grams/day of cod liver oil, and one multivitamin. Long-term follow-up results from this study indicate that the patients adhering to the Swank diet experienced reduced MS disease activity and progression of disability when compared to patients that did not follow the regimen. While these results are encouraging, this trial is criticized for its lack of a proper control group and un-blinded design. Nevertheless, the Swank diet remains one of the most popular complementary approaches to treating MS. Swank Low-Fat Diet: Detailed Guidelines Saturated fat should remain less than 15 grams per day Unsaturated fat should be approximately 20‒50 grams per day No red meat should be consumed during the first year After the first year, a maximum of 3 oz. of red meat per week Dairy products must have 1% butterfat or less Processed foods containing saturated fat should not be eaten A source of omega-3, a multivitamin, and a mineral supplement are recommended daily Wheat, gluten or dairy product quantities are not restricted, unless they are foods which cause allergies or reactions. 9 Hormone Therapy Because women often experience improvement of MS symptoms while pregnant, hormone therapy using estrogen has been studied as a treatment for the disease. In human studies, estriol treatment (8 mg/day) in nonpregnant women with MS was associated with reduced lesion numbers and lesion volumes and when treatment ceased, these values returned to levels observed before treatment.37 Patients given estriol also had enhanced cognitive function. With respect to immune studies, estriol was associated with reduced pro-inflammatory and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine production and these changes correlated well with the reduced formation of lesions.39 Other studies have shown that male MS patients treated with 10 mg of testosterone exhibited improved cognitive performance and reduced brain atrophy, although MRI data showed no change in lesion formation.129 In another similar study, testosterone treatment in males was associated with reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and increased production of neuroprotective factors.130 There is currently debate among researchers about the role of hormones with MS and how that relationship may be exploited as a means of therapy. Some studies argue for hormone replacement as a new therapeutic approach.131 More information can be found in Life Extension's ""Male Hormone Restoration"" and ""Female Hormone Restoration"" protocols.

Your nerve cells have a protective covering called myelin. Without myelin, the brain and spinal cord can't communicate with the nerves in the rest of the body. MS gradually destroys myelin in patches throughout the brain and spinal cord, causing muscle weakness and other symptoms. These patches of damage are called lesions. MS is different for each person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. Generally, MS follows one of four courses: , where symptoms fade and then return off and on for many years. , which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course and then becomes progressive. ""Progressive"" means it steadily gets worse. , where the disease is progressive from the start. , where the symptoms are progressive at first and are relapsing later. The exact cause is unknown, but most experts believe that MS is an autoimmune disease. In this kind of disease, the body's defenses, called the , mistakenly attack normal tissues. In MS, the immune system attacks the central nervous system—the . Experts don't know why MS happens to some people but not others. There may be a link, because the disease seems to run in families. Where you grew up may also play a role. MS is more common in those who grew up in colder regions that are farther away from the equator. Symptoms depend on which parts of the brain and spinal cord are damaged and how bad the damage is. Early symptoms may include: You may feel weak and stiff, and your limbs may feel heavy. You may drag your leg when you walk. Your vision may be blurred or hazy. You may have eyeball pain (especially when you move your eyes), blindness, or double vision. You may feel tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, or numbness. You may feel a band of tightness around your trunk or limbs. You may feel lightheaded or dizzy or feel like you're spinning. Diagnosing MS isn't always easy. The first symptoms may be vague. And many of the symptoms can be caused by problems other than MS. MS is not diagnosed unless a doctor can be sure that you have had at least two attacks affecting at least two different areas of your central nervous system. The doctor will examine you, ask you questions about your symptoms, and do some tests. An is often used to confirm the diagnosis, because the patches of damage (lesions) caused by MS attacks can be seen with this test. During a relapse, to make the attack shorter and less severe. Over a long period of time, to keep down the number of attacks and how severe they are and to slow the progression of the disease. (This is called disease-modifying therapy.) You may find it hard to decide when to start taking the drugs that slow the progression of MS. The drugs may not work for everyone, and they often have side effects. You and your doctor will decide together when you should start any of these drugs. There is no cure for MS. Treatment and self-care can help you maintain your quality of life. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy can help you manage some physical problems caused by MS. You can also help yourself at home by eating balanced meals, getting regular exercise and rest, and learning to use your energy wisely. Dealing with the physical and emotional demands of MS isn't easy. If you feel overwhelmed, talk to your doctor. You may be depressed, which can be treated. And finding a support group where you can talk to other people who have MS can be very helpful. Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve your health. Decision Points focus on key medical care decisions that are important to many health problems. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? The cause of multiple sclerosis (MS) is unknown. Because a person's risk of MS is slightly higher in some families when a relative has MS, there may be a . For more information, see . Some research suggests that where you lived as a child and you have had could be triggers for MS later in life. But these links have not been proved. The symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) vary from person to person depending on which parts of the brain or spinal cord (central nervous system) are damaged. The and scarring caused by MS can affect any part of the central nervous system. Myelin is the insulating coating around a nerve. Symptoms may come and go or become more or less severe from day to day or, in rare cases, from hour to hour. Symptoms may become worse with increased body temperature or after a viral infection. , such as weakness, leg dragging, stiffness, a tendency to drop things, a feeling of heaviness, clumsiness, or a lack of coordination (). , such as blurred, foggy, or hazy vision, eyeball pain (especially when you move your eyes), blindness, or double vision. Optic neuritis—sudden loss of vision that is often painful—is a fairly common first symptom. It occurs in up to 25 out of 100 people who have MS. , such as tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, numbness, a band of tightness around the trunk or legs, or electrical sensations moving down the back and legs. As MS progresses, symptoms may become more severe and may include: Worse muscle problems, and stiff, mechanical movements () or uncontrollable shaking (). These problems may make walking difficult. A wheelchair may be needed some or all of the time. Bladder symptoms, such as an inability to hold urine () or to completely empty the bladder, or a loss of bladder sensation. (impotence) and . . These are common in people who have had MS for some time. Feeling very tired (fatigue). This can be worse if symptoms such as pain, spasticity, bladder problems, anxiety, or depression make it hard to sleep. In general, multiple sclerosis follows one of four courses: , where symptoms may fade and then recur at random for many years. The disease doesn't advance during the remissions. Most people who develop MS have a relapsing-remitting course. In 8 to 9 out of 10 people with this course of MS, the relapsing-remitting phase lasts about 20 years. , which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course. Later on, it becomes steadily progressive. , where the disease is progressive from the start. , where steady deterioration of nerve function begins when symptoms first appear. Symptoms appear and disappear, but nerve damage continues. Few people have this course of MS. MS is different for every person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. The duration of the disease varies. Most people who get MS live with it for decades. MS usually progresses with a series of that occur over many years (relapsing-remitting MS). In many people the first MS attack involves just a single symptom. It may be weeks, months, or years before you have a relapse. As time goes by, symptoms may linger after each relapse so you lose the ability to fully recover from the relapse. New symptoms often develop as the disease damages other areas of the . Events that can mean you may have a more severe type of MS include: Frequent relapses during the first few years of the disease. Early, lasting motor problems that affect movement. Many lesions that show up on an early in the disease. Some people have a few mild attacks from which they recover entirely. This is called benign MS. Although rare, a small number of people die within several years of the onset of MS. This is called malignant or fulminant MS. Because MS may affect your ability to move and walk, it can place limits on your daily living, particularly as you age. If you or someone in your family has MS, talk to your doctor about . Knowing what to expect will help you plan for the future. Reduced ability to move and walk. This makes it necessary to use a wheelchair some or all of the time. Your risk for multiple sclerosis (MS) increases with: Geographic location, or where you lived during childhood (up to age 15). People who spend the first 15 years of their lives in colder climates that are farther away from the equator tend to be more likely to get MS than people who lived closer to the equator during those years. Family history of MS. About 15 out of 100 people who have MS have a relative with MS, most often a brother or sister. Certain genetic characteristics associated with the . These appear more frequently in people who have MS. This may mean that there are one or more that may increase the chance of getting MS. Race. People of Western European ancestry are more likely to get MS. Being female. MS is about 3 times as common in women as in men. Some of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) are similar to those of many other illnesses. See your doctor if over a period of time you have more than one symptom, such as: Blurry, foggy, or hazy vision, eyeball pain, loss of vision, or double vision. A feeling of heaviness or weakness, involuntary leg dragging, stiffness, walking problems, and clumsiness. Tingling or a pins-and-needles sensation; numbness; tightness in a band around the trunk, arms, or legs; or electric shock sensations moving down the back, arms, or legs. Inability to hold urine or to completely empty the bladder. Problems with memory, attention span, finding the right words for what you mean, and daily problem-solving. If you have been diagnosed with MS, see your doctor if: You begin having a symptom that you have not had before or you notice a significant change in symptoms that are already present. Milder MS-type symptoms can be caused by many other conditions or may occur now and then in healthy people. For example, lots of people have minor numbness in their fingers or a mild dizzy spell once in a while. Stiffness and muscle weakness can result from being more active than usual. A wait-and-see approach () is appropriate for these types of everyday aches and pains, so long as they do not continue. If your symptoms occur more often or don't go away, talk to your doctor. Talk to your doctor about what to expect from the disease and from treatment. MS is an unpredictable disease, but you probably can get some idea of what is ""normal"" and what symptoms or problems are reasons for concern. Some people who have MS want active, regular support from their doctors. Others want to manage their condition on their own as much as possible. Wherever you are in this range, find out which signs or symptoms mean that you need to see your doctor. And seek help when you need it. Health professionals who may be involved in evaluating symptoms of MS and treating the condition include: or . Consult your doctor when symptoms first start. He or she will refer you to a neurologist if needed. If you have MS, your family doctor or internist can treat your general health problems even if you see a neurologist for MS treatment. . A neurologist can decide whether your symptoms are caused by MS. He or she can also help you decide what may be the best treatment for your condition. Many university medical centers and large hospitals have MS clinics or centers staffed by neurologists and other health professionals who specialize in diagnosing and treating MS. They may be able to provide the most thorough evaluation. If you have been diagnosed with MS, at some point you may need to seek the help of: A , to assist with exercise to maintain body strength and flexibility and deal with movement problems. An , to identify ways of accomplishing daily activities if MS has caused any physical limitations. A , to improve speech, chewing, and breathing if MS has affected the muscles of the face and throat. A , to help with managing pain, maintaining strength, and adapting to physical disability. A or , to evaluate and treat , or other mood disorders, and problems with memory and concentration if these develop. A , to help with any significant chronic pain that MS may cause. A pain specialist, often as part of a pain clinic, can help find ways of reducing pain when possible and dealing with pain that doesn't go away. A , to do surgery for severe or . Diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS) isn't always easy and in some cases may take time. Your medical history and can identify possible nervous system problems and are often enough to strongly suggest a diagnosis of MS. Tests may help confirm or rule out the diagnosis when your history and exam do not provide clear evidence of the disease. MRI and neurological exam may help doctors predict which people will develop MS after a first attack of symptoms. of the brain and spinal cord. This test is done to . (sometimes called a spinal tap). This test may be done to evaluate . Most people with MS have abnormal results on this test. . This test can often reveal abnormalities in the and in the that other tests may not detect. MS is diagnosed when it is clear from neurological tests and a neurological exam that lesions (damaged areas) are present in more than one area of the (usually the brain, spinal cord, or the nerves to the eyes). Tests will also clearly show that damage has occurred at more than one point in time. Some people have had only one episode of a neurological symptom such as optic neuritis, but MRI tests suggest they may have MS. This is known as a clinically isolated syndrome. Many of these people go on to develop MS over time. Urinary tract tests may be needed to help diagnose a problem with bladder control in a person who has MS. may be needed to identify thinking or emotional problems, which may be present without the person being aware of them. Typically, these tests are in a question-and-answer format. A blood test for JC virus antibodies may be done. This test can help you and your doctor understand your risk for getting a rare but serious brain infection called PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). Treatment can make living with multiple sclerosis (MS) easier. Your type of treatment will depend on how severe your symptoms are and whether your disease is active or in remission. You may get medicines, physical therapy, and other treatment at home. Medicines are used to treat relapses, control the course of the disease (disease-modifying drugs or DMDs), or treat symptoms. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and who have active, relapsing disease start treatment with medicines. This group also recommends treatment with medicine after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS. If you decide not to try medicines at this time, meet with your doctor regularly to check whether the disease is progressing. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? You and your doctor will set up a schedule of periodic appointments to monitor and treat your symptoms and follow the progress of your MS. Monitoring your condition helps your doctor find out if you may need to try a different treatment. , occupational therapy, and nonmedical treatment done at home may also help you manage symptoms and adjust to living and working situations. To learn more, see . In rare cases, MS is life-threatening. If your condition gets considerably worse, you may want to make a living will, which allows your wishes to be carried out if you are not able to make decisions for yourself. For more information, see the topic . In general, there is no way to prevent multiple sclerosis (MS) or its attacks. For people with , , and , treatment with medicine may reduce the frequency of relapses and delay disability. If you have multiple sclerosis (MS), it is important to find ways of coping with the practical and emotional demands of the disease. These are different for everyone, so home treatment varies from person to person. Home treatment may involve making it easier to get around your home, dealing with , handling specific symptoms, and getting support from your family and friends. to keep it safe and easy to get around. For example, to help prevent falls, install grab bars in the bathroom and don't use throw rugs. And try adjusting your daily schedule so that your routine is less stressful or tiring. , either on your own or with the help of a physical therapist. . At some time, most people with MS have bladder problems. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to help you. Avoid getting overheated. Increased body temperature can temporarily make your symptoms worse. Use an air conditioner, keep your home somewhat cool, and avoid hot swimming pools and hot tubs. During warm or hot weather, exercise in an air-conditioned area rather than outdoors. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, cereals, legumes, poultry, fish, lean meats, and low-fat dairy products. A balanced diet for a person who has MS is the same as that recommended for most healthy adults. Change how and what you eat if you are having problems swallowing. Thicker drinks make swallowing easier. Try milk shakes or juices in gelatin form. Avoid foods such as crackers or cakes that crumble easily. These can cause choking. Soft foods need less chewing. Use a blender to prepare food for easiest chewing. Eat frequent, small meals to avoid fatigue from eating heavy meals. Ask your doctor about and occupational therapy to help you manage at work and home. Make all efforts to preserve your health. Proper diet, rest, wise use of energy, and practical and emotional support from your family, friends, and doctor can all be very helpful. For more advice about coping with MS at home, contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at www.nationalmssociety.org. Medicines for multiple sclerosis (MS) may be used: During a , to make the attack shorter and less severe. Over a long period of time, to alter the natural course of the disease (disease-modifying drugs or DMDs). These medicines can shorten a sudden relapse and help you feel better sooner. They have been shown to affect the long-term course of the disease or to prevent disability. Strong evidence suggests that MS is caused by the causing and attacking nerve cells and myelin, which is the protective coating surrounding the nerve fibers. Medicines that change the way the immune system works can reduce the number and severity of attacks that damage the nerves and myelin. For people who have , disease-modifying therapy can reduce the number and severity of relapses. It may also delay disability in some people. Some of these medicines may also delay disease progression and reduce relapses in some people who have or . The most commonly used disease-modifying therapies are: Interferon beta (such as Betaseron), for clinically isolated syndrome (first MS attack), relapsing-remitting MS, and secondary progressive MS. Glatiramer (Copaxone), for clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting MS. Other disease-modifying medicines may also be used for MS. Your doctor will prescribe a medicine depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms, and how your body responds. They include: Some people have only one episode of a neurological symptom such as . Yet or other tests suggest that these people have MS. This is known as a clinically isolated syndrome. Many of these people go on to develop MS over time. In most cases, doctors will prescribe medicine for people who have had a clinically isolated syndrome. These medicines, when taken early or even before you have been diagnosed with MS, may keep the disease from getting worse or extend your time without disease. Treating specific symptoms can be effective, even if it doesn't stop the progression of the disease. Symptoms that can often be controlled or relieved with medicine include: Medicines can also help with sexual problems, emotional problems, and walking problems. Sildenafil (Viagra) can help with sexual problems in both men and women. Clomipramine may also be given to improve . Dextromethorphan and quinidine (Nuedexta) is a medicine that can be used for uncontrollable outbursts of crying or laughing at strange or inappropriate times. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is a medicine that can be used to help with walking problems. Medicine may be used only some of the time or regularly, depending on how severe or constant a certain symptom is. Changes in diet, schedule, exercise, and other habits can also help manage some of these symptoms. See . Cannabinoids are substances found in marijuana. Similar drugs can be created in a lab. Some forms of natural and man-made cannabinoids may help with symptoms such as pain and spasticity. They are not available in all areas. Talk to your doctor if you are considering cannabinoids. A variety of other medicines and biological chemicals have been tried or are being studied as therapy for MS. None of them have been clearly proved as beneficial, and none have been approved for treatment of MS. Several medicines are being tested in clinical trials. People with MS who have not responded to standard therapy sometimes choose to take part in these trials. To learn more about clinical trials, talk to your doctor or contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at www.nationalmssociety.org. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and active, relapsing disease start treatment with interferon beta or glatiramer. Most neurologists support this recommendation and now agree that permanent damage to the nervous system may occur early on, even while symptoms are still quite mild. Early treatment may help prevent or delay some of this damage. In general, treatment is recommended until it no longer provides a clear benefit. The National MS Society also says that treatment with medicine may be considered after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS (before MS is definitely diagnosed). Despite the recommendation, some people find it hard to decide whether to begin disease-modifying therapy, especially when their symptoms have been fairly mild. Some may not want to bear the risks and side effects of medicine when they are not sure they need it. Some may want to see whether their disease gets worse before they start therapy. A small percentage of people diagnosed with MS may never have more than a few mild episodes and may never develop any disability, but the disease is unpredictable. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? The need and desire for medicine vary. If your symptoms are mild, you may choose to manage them without any medicine. If you have specific symptoms that are causing problems, certain medicines may help you keep them under control. Or you may want to use medicine only during a relapse. The possible side effects of using steroids or other medicines to treat symptoms or control a relapse. Some people have only minor side effects. But others may have side effects that concern them more than their MS symptoms. The costs of treating symptoms and controlling relapses. In some cases, using medicine to control symptoms and relapses may reduce the need for hospital stays. Other personal issues that you face at work or at home. Also keep in mind that it can be hard to tell if medicine is helping. Multiple sclerosis is a disease with spontaneous remissions. This means that your condition can improve on its own, without any treatment. Just because your symptoms improve after treatment doesn't mean that a treatment is working. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have severe (shakiness) affecting movement may be helped by surgery. People with severe (muscle stiffness) may be helped by insertion of a spinal pump to deliver medicines when oral medicines fail. for tremor. This treatment is only considered after other options have failed. Severe and disabling tremor that occurs with the slightest movement of the limbs may be helped by an implanted device that stimulates an area of the brain. A does the surgery to implant the device. Implantation of a drug catheter or pump, for spasticity. This treatment is only considered after other options have failed. People who have severe pain or spasticity may benefit from having a catheter or pump placed in the lower spinal area to deliver a constant flow of medicine, such as baclofen. The unpredictability and variety of symptoms caused by multiple sclerosis (MS) make it a disease that people have tried to treat in many different ways. Many have been proposed as treatments for MS. None of these treatments have been shown to modify the course of the disease. Some of those most commonly used are: Diets and vitamin, mineral, herbal, or dietary supplements. (often used by ). Although clinical research has not shown all of these complementary therapies to be effective, a person with MS may benefit from safe nontraditional therapies along with conventional medical treatment. Some complementary therapies may help relieve stress, depression, fatigue, and muscle tension. And some may improve your overall well-being and quality of life. Talk to your doctor if you are interested in trying any of these complementary therapies or to MS treatment. Clinical research also has been unable to show that treatments such as ""liberation"" angioplasty for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), bee venom therapy, Prokarin (a caffeine and histamine combination), removal of mercury fillings (dental amalgams), and have any benefits for people who have MS. Some of these therapies may be harmful as well as expensive and are not recommended by most experts. Experimental treatments for MS involve reducing the activity of the . This may be done with medicines and biological chemicals or through methods such as total lymphoid irradiation, in which the entire lymph node system is exposed to radiation. While these methods have been used with success in the treatment of certain other medical conditions, they have failed to produce significant benefits when tested in controlled clinical trials. They remain experimental treatments for MS. , which uses immature cells from the bone marrow, has been studied. Early results suggest that stem cell transplant may delay disability, especially in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Stem cell transplant may be an option for people who have very aggressive or malignant forms of MS. It remains unproved and isn't recommended for treating relapsing-remitting MS. There is no cure for MS. So far, the only treatments proved to affect the course of the disease are approved disease-modifying therapies. Other types of treatment should replace these medicines if you are a candidate for treatment with them. Some people who have MS report that complementary therapies have worked for them. This may be in part because of the . Some complementary therapies don't treat the disease itself, but they may affect a person's sense of well-being and help the person feel better and healthier. If you are thinking about trying a complementary treatment, get the facts first. Discuss these questions with your doctor: Talk with your doctor about the safety and potential side effects of the treatment. This is especially important if you are on drug therapy for MS. Some complementary treatments in combination with drug therapy can be quite dangerous. A treatment that could be harmful to you and may or may not improve your symptoms isn't worth the risk. Because MS symptoms can come and go, you may find it hard to judge whether a particular treatment is really working. Keep in mind that if you get better after using a certain treatment, the treatment isn't always the reason for the improvement. MS may often improve on its own (spontaneous remission). An expensive, unproven treatment that may or may not help you may not be worth its cost. Beware of therapy providers or products that require a large financial investment at the beginning of a series of treatments. Even if they aren't effective in treating MS, some complementary practices (such as acupuncture, massage, or yoga) may be safe. And they may lead to healthy habits that improve your overall well-being. These might be worth trying. With a hard-to-treat disease like MS, it can be tempting to jump at the promise of an effective treatment. Be cautious about trying unproven treatments.

What is the clinical indication for eculizumab? On June 27, 2019, eculizumab, or Soliris, became the first FDA approved treatment for anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adults. Eculizumab had previously been FDA approved for treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody positive generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). Histologic studies in NMO lesions have shown pronounced complement activation, eosinophilic infiltration, and vascular fibrosis that differ from prototypical multiple sclerosis lesions. The pathophysiology of NMOSD is primarily a humoral immune system mediated attack on AQP4. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits the terminal complement protein C5 to prevent its cleavage into C5a and C5b. The exact mechanism for its efficacy in NMOSD is unknown, but is believed to be related to inhibition of the formation of the membrane attack complex mediated by C5b. Q. What did the clinical trials of eculizumab in neuromyelitis optica show? Eculizumab was first studied in 14 AQP4 antibody positive neuromyelitis optica patients in an open-label trial. This trial showed positive findings in reducing relapses as well as an improvement in median EDSS scores compared with pretreatment. Because of these results, a subsequent randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase III time-to-event trial over 4 years, Prevention of Relapses in Neuromyelitis Optica (PREVENT), was performed. The majority of patients in both the eculizumab (78%) and placebo (72%) groups continued on prior immunotherapy including glucocorticoids, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil. A significantly smaller proportion of patients in the eculizumab group experienced an adjudicated relapse compared with the placebo group (3% vs 43%). Change from baseline in disability measures including EDSS, modified Rankin scale, and Hauser Ambulation Index did not significantly differ between the two groups. Q. How is eculizumab administered in AQP4 antibody positive NMOSD? Eculizumab is supplied in 300 mg vials (30 mL of a 10 mg/mL solution) and is administered via intravenous infusion over 35 minutes. We suggest administration at an infusion center to allow for patient monitoring given the relative newness of the medication for this indication. 900 mg per dose, once weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1200 mg for the fifth dose 1 week later, followed by Supplemental dosing is required in patients undergoing plasma exchange as it can increase the clearance of eculizumab by approximately 250-fold. An additional 600 mg per each plasma exchange session is recommended to be given within 60 minutes after each plasma exchange session. The half-life of eculizumab ranges from 270 to 414 hours. Steady state is achieved 4 weeks after starting eculizumab treatment. Age, race, and renal function do not affect pharmacokinetics of eculizumab. While the PREVENT trial did not pharmacodynamics of eculizumab in APQ4 antibody positive NMOSD patients, pharmacodynamics of eculizumab has been studied in other disease states. An inverse relationship appear to exist between eculizumab concentration and C5 complement blockade. Increased dose of eculizumab has also been shown to correlate with longer period of complement activity suppression. One study in patients with hemolytic anemia found that increasing the dose from 2mg/kg to 4mg/kg to 8mg/kg led to increased drug effect from 2 days, to 7-14 days, to 11-21 days. Q. What are the major adverse effects of eculizumab? Headache, nausea, and dizziness were the most common side effects reported in the open label trial of eculizumab in APQ4 antibody positive neuromyelitis optica patients. In the PREVENT trial, upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and nasopharyngitis were the most common side effects. With the exception of upper respiratory tract infections, percentages of patients experiencing these effects were comparable in the eculizumab group and the placebo group. Other side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, limb pain, and vomiting were also seen in both groups. *78% patients continued on prior immunotherapy: 17% glucocorticoids alone, 39% azathioprine, 18% mycophenolate mofetil, 5% other +72% patients continued on prior immunotherapy: 23% glucocorticoids alone, 28% azathioprine, 17% mycophenolate mofetil, 4% other Although no cases of meningococcal infection were reported in the PREVENT trial, eculizumab’s mechanism of action increases risk of infection, especially from encapsulated bacteria. Eculizumab is thus contraindicated in patients with unresolved serious infection and patients who are not currently vaccinated against . Because of this risk, providers must enroll in a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program to prescribe eculizumab. Q. What pretesting and monitoring labs are recommended for eculizumab? Prior to starting: complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel. Monitoring labs: complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel. Although urinalysis and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are monitored for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria, this is not necessary for AQP4 antibody positive NMOSD. A Mayo Clinic Eculizumab monitoring panel (ECUMP) for C5 function and C5 antigen is available to determine the impact of eculizumab on the complement system but as no specific guidelines are available for its use with AQP4 antibody positive NMO, it is not currently recommended. As leukopenia, lymphopenia, and transaminitis were noted with eculizumab for other indications, we suggest routine monitoring labs as above. A reduction in absolute lymphocyte count less than 0.5k/µL or an elevation of AST or ALT greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal should prompt discontinuation of therapy. Q. What vaccines are recommended prior to starting eculizumab? Required: Meningococcal vaccines (serogroups ACWY and B) All patients are recommended to receive meningococcal vaccination at least 2 weeks prior to starting eculizumab. Both MenACWY and MenB vaccines are required to cover ACWY and B serogroups. There are two MenACWY vaccine products, Menactra® and Menveo®. These products are interchangeable within the MenACWY series, however Menactra must be separated by 4 weeks from the Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar-13). Therefore, we recommend Menveo for the MenACWY “primary series” at 0 and 8 weeks to prevent the Prevnar13/Menactra interaction. There are two MenB vaccine products available: MenB-4 (Bexsero®) and MenB-FHbp (Trumenba®). Bexsero is a 2-dose series administered at least 1 month apart. Trumenba® is a 3-dose series administered at 0, 1-2, and 6 months. Dose 3 not needed if dose 2 is administered at least 6 months after dose 1. Bexsero and Trumenba are not interchangeable (the same product should be used for all doses in series). Trumenba is not available on formulary at the Cleveland Clinic. Vaccination reduces but does not eliminate the risk of meningococcal infections. A review of eculizumab recipients in the United States from 2008 to 2016 identified 16 cases of meningococcal disease with eleven cases caused by nongroupable not impacted by vaccination. Fourteen patients had received at least one dose of vaccine. All cases had meningococcemia. Six patients had meningitis. Recommended: and In previously unvaccinated patients, consider vaccine administration for other encapsulated organisms. This is due to a theoretical increased risk of infection while on eculizumab. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommend pneumococcal (for all patients) and Hib (for children 12-59 months) vaccination for patients with complement deficiencies; the only ACIP recommendation specific to eculizumab is meningococcal. We recommend initiation of vaccination series at least 2 weeks prior to the first eculizumab dose to optimize immune response. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar-13; PCV13) Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax-23; PPSV23) Refer to CDC/ACIP for further guidance. Your institution/facility may have alternative brand names for the vaccinations suggested below on formulary. F i r s t   D o s e MenACWY (Menveo) MenB (Bexsero) - Hib (ActHIB) - PCV13 MenACWY (Menveo) MenB (Bexsero) - PPSV23 MenB (Bexsero) PPSV23 MenACWY (Menactra) These recommendations presume no history of vaccination. Refer to CDC/ACIP guidance for catch-up vaccination for patients with a history of meningococcal, pneumococcal, or Hib vaccination. MenB(Bexsero) minimum age: 10 years old PPSV23 minimum age: 2 years old If unable to administer MenACWY and MenB vaccinations at least 2 weeks prior to first dose of eculizumab, administer vaccines with the first dose. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended to prevent meningococcal disease for a minimum of 2 weeks following vaccination Amoxicillin 10 mg/kg/dose (max 250 mg) PO BID x 2 weeks Ciprofloxacin 10 mg/kg/dose (max 500 mg) PO BID x 2 weeks Azithromycin 5 mg/kg/dose (max 250 mg) PO QD x 2 weeks Cefdinir is a last-line option for meningococcal prophylaxis in patients unable to tolerate oral penicillins, fluoroquinolones, or macrolides Q. Is antimicrobial prophylaxis indicated during treatment? Meningococcal disease in patients receiving eculizumab despite vaccination has been reported, therefore clinicians may consider recommending antimicrobial prophylaxis for the duration of treatment: Adults: penicillin VK 250 mg orally twice daily or azithromycin 250 mg orally daily for penicillin allergic patients Pediatrics: amoxicillin 10 mg/kg (max 250 mg) orally twice a day or azithromycin 5 mg/kg (max 250 mg) orally daily The effectiveness, safety, or risk for development of penicillin-resistant meningococcal infections have not been established. Q. What is the effect on pregnancy and breastfeeding? Safety of eculizumab during pregnancy and lactation has not been studied in NMOSD patients and is thus not routinely used in this population. Limited data for other clinical indications of eculizumab have not identified specific adverse developmental outcomes. One study of pregnant patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, for example, found that all 69 children met developmental milestones for vision, hearing, locomotion, fine-motor skills, behavior, and physical health. Only one child had slightly delayed speech. Eculizumab in concentration below therapeutic range has been detected in cord blood in patients on treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. One study examining 10 breast milk samples found no detectable eculizumab. Q. How does eculizumab compare to other therapies for antibody positive NMOSD? There are no head to head clinical trials comparing different therapies for antibody positive NMOSD. Prior to the FDA approved medications for AQP4 antibody positive NMOSD, treatments included rituximab, azathioprine, and mcyophenolate mofetil. Factors that may influence selecting a therapy can include route of administration, FDA approval, frequency of administration (every 2 weeks for eculizumab versus every 6 months for anti-CD20 therapies), healthcare costs (greater than $500,000/year for eculizumab), and potential comparative efficacy. While eculizumab can be given as a first line treatment, given the above factors, we would suggest use of eculizumab in patients who have experienced failure or intolerance with other treatments. While eculizumab was only studied in adult patients with AQP4 antibody positive NMOSD, it has been used in the pediatric population safely for its other indication. Unlike satralizumab and inebilizumab, the other two FDA-approved medications for AQP4 antibody positive NMOSD, eculizumab has also been used in patients older than 65. Though the numbers are limited (15 in PNH, 4 in aHUS, 26 in gMG, and 6 in NMOSD), no age related differences in medication effects were noted. Unlike inebilizumab, which carries a warning for fetal harm, there have not been similar adverse effects noted with eculizumab based on limited case reports and case series. Q. How should patients be switched from one therapy to eculizumab? We suggest checking absolute lymphocyte count and immunoglobulin levels for patients on other therapies prior to initiating eculizumab to ensure levels are > 0.5k/µL and in a normal range respectively. Transfusions of IV immunoglobulins can be considered in patients who have hypogammaglobulinemia prior to initiation of eculizumab. CDC. Meningococcal ACIP recommendations.

It affects quality of life and correlates with worsened disease outcome. Out approach is to try to systematically identify and treat this problem early and effectively. Q: How common are cognitive disorders present in MS? The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MS is estimated to be between 40 and 65 percent (Bobholz and Rao, 2003; Benedict, Zivadinov, 2011). The cognitive abilities most often affected include episodic memory (recall of previously studied information, like a shopping list or story), working memory (temporary on-line maintenance and manipulation of information), divided attention (multi-tasking ability), and speed processing. Language, executive, and visuospatial functions are relatively spared. However, there is considerable variation in the neuropsychological presentation of MS patients. For example, one study identified six distinct cognitive profiles among patients with relapsing MS entering a trial of interferon-β1a (Fischer, 1999). The largest subgroup, which included 34% of the sample, was cognitively intact. Only 2% showed global cognitive impairment across multiple cognitive domains. The remainder showed circumscribed deficits in two to three cognitive domains. At the Mellen Center, we specifically inquire about the presence of cognitive symptoms at each visit. This is done both in our previsit screening questionnaire and as part of our review of symptoms for each visit. If this is an issue for the patient or their families, we inquire more deeply into this issue. Q: What other factors need to be considered when a patient states they have cognitive problems? (Differential diagnosis) Early in the process of cognitive evaluation for MS patients, other facts should be considered. Standard assessment of laboratory parameters used for general cognitive disorders should be undertaken (For example, thyroid indices and vitamin B12 level). The patient should have an assessment for depression to ensure that the problem is not primarily related to an emotional disorder (see below). Questions about sleep disturbance should be asked as sleep disorders are common in MS and may affect cognitive abilities. The medication the patient is taking should be evaluated for negative impact on cognition. Q: Do physical disability, disease course, and disease duration correlate with cognitive dysfunction in MS? Level of physical disability, as measured with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), has at best a modest correlation with severity of cognition in MS. This is not surprising since the EDSS is heavily influenced by non-cognitive signs and symptoms, such as ambulation. Several studies have shown that cognitive dysfunction is greater in secondary progressive than in relapsing-remitting MS (Gaudino, Chiaravalloti et al.,2001). Cross-sectioning studies have found only a modest relationship between duration of the disease and the extent of cognitive impairment. As noted above, this is likely due to the inter-patient variability in the presentation of cognitive disorders. It is important to note that cognitive changes can occur early in the course of the disease (Deloire, Salort et al.,2005) and, in some patients, may never occur. Longitudinal neuropsychological studies of MS patients studied over an extended period of time suggest that approximately 5-10 percent of patients experience a discernible worsening of cognitive functioning over the course of a year (Amato et al., 2001). Unlike patients with progressive dementias, MS patients with cognitive impairment can be stable for years. In addition, recent cases reports have noted cognitive impairment as a sole manifestation of relapse of MS, with cognitive declines correlating with new lesion formation on MRI imaging. For the above reasons we also do not assume that patients with physical disabilities are cognitively impaired, now do we assume that those without physical impairment are cognitively intact. Q: Do abnormalities detected on brain MRI scans correlate with cognitive dysfunction in MS? Compared to demographic and disease variables, neuroimaging indices correlate relatively well with cognition in MS. Several studies have demonstrated an inverse relation between cognitive performance and the number of volume of lesions on conventional MRI, including T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging (Rovaris and Filippi, 200). Regionally specific relations between lesion volume and cognition have been reported. For example, one study showed specific relations between frontal lobe involvement and executive functions, like conceptual reasoning (Arnett, Rao et al., 1994). Some studies have suggested that brain atrophy is a better predictor of cognitive impairment in MS than lesion volume (Bermel, Bakshi et al., 2002; Benedict, Weinstock-Guttman et al., 2004). Longitudinal studies have shown a relation between progressive brain atrophy and cognitive changes patterns in MS (Hohol, Buttman et al., 1997). There are occasional patients with subacute cognitive changes that correlate with the presence of new lesions, so that a new complaint of cognitive dysfunction may prompt further imaging to assess for disease activity (Pardini, 204). Recent studies indicate that cortical lesions are not only present in early clinical MS, but may be as common as white matter lesions (Lucchinetti 2011). Such lesions and associated tract degeneration may underly some component of the cognitive dysfunction in MS. Note that in addition there are patients with prominent cognitive symptoms with limited lesion burden or atrophy on brain imaging. In such patients, we would assess carefully for other factors such as medication, sleep disturbance, and depression masquerading as cognitive deficits (See below). Q: Do cognitive disorders correlate with other factors related to MS (for example, depression, fatigue, sleep disorders)? Emotional problems, sleep disorders, and fatigue are significantly more common in individuals with MS than in the general population. Although the relationship among these symptoms may be complex, depression has been reported to affect cognitive test performance in the areas of rapid information processing, working memory, and executive function in MS patients (Arnett, Higginson et al., 2001). Although subjective reports of fatigue do not necessarily correlate with observable deficits in cognitive function, decrements in cognitive performance occur during sustained mental effort and after completion of cognitively challenging tasks in MS patients (Krupp and Elkins, 2000; Schwid, Tyler et al., 2003). It is reasonable to assume that patients' performance may be compromised if they are significantly depressed, fatigued, or sleep deprived during cognitive testing. There are many medicines used in MS care that may have a negative impact on cognition. We assess these medicines in our patients with cognitive deficits and consider whether they can be changed to alternative medicines or whether they can be weaned off. Medicines that have such an impact include steroids (particularly IV high dose solumedrol), anticholinergics such as oxybutynin, tricyclic antidepressants, sedatives, beta blockers, muscle relaxants, etc. In addition, the chronic use of marijuana and related substances can have a negative effect on cognition. Sleep disorders may be seen with MS and may affect daytime cognitive performance. We do inquire about sleep at the Mellen Center and consider expert evaluation depending on symptoms presented (for example, snoring, restless leg, periodic leg movements, repeated awakenings, etc). There are documented events where subacute cognitive impairment is the only clinical manifestation of a relapse documented by a decline in neuropsychological function and imaging findings of new lesion formation. A subacute decline in cognition should prompt both a search for factors such as infection, new medications, or emerging illness, or imaging to assess for new lesion activity. Q: How can cognitive disorders be detected in the clinical setting? A: We note that patient self-report of cognitive deficits in unreliable. Patients with MS who are depressed will report cognitive impairment, while patients with cognitive deficits may under report their deficits. An informant (family member, close friend) is critical to assist in giving history to document cognitive impairment. One method for identifying cognitive dysfunction is to administer rating questionnaires to patients and their family members. One such scale is the MS Neuropsychological Screening Questionnaire (MSNQ), a 15-item self-informant-report inventory (Benedict, Cox et al., 2004). Results suggest that informant ratings of cognitive problems are more likely to correlate with objective neuropsychological tests than patient self-reports. Unfortunately, informant ratings are not always available in the clinical setting. An alternative approach is to use a brief cognitive screening examination. One commonly used test, the Mini-Mental State Examination, has been found to be insensitive to the cognitive impairments in MS. Performing extensive cognitive testing can be too time consuming for centers with limited staff, yet performing an annual cognitive screen may be necessary as part of ongoing MS care. Langdon and others (2012) extensively reviewed the literature on neuropsychological measures in MS. They determined that the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), with the possible addition of the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised learning trials, is a reasonable screen. Their expert panel judged these studies to be preferred over others when rated on psychometric qualities (reliability, validity, and sensitivity), an international application, ease administration, feasibility in the specified context, and acceptability to patients. The SDMT consists of single digits paired with abstract symbols. The patient must say the number corresponding with each symbol. The test can be administered and scored within 5 minutes. It is a sensitive test of information processing speed that is preferentially affected in MS patients. It is well validated against multiple MRI measures and has minimal practice effect. One problem with the standard SDMT is that there are not multiple versions, so as a repeated measures test this would be subject to a training effect. The California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition comprises a 16 item word list, with four items belonging to each of 4 categories. This is read aloud 5 times in the same order to the patient at a rate slightly slower than 1 per second. This test can be completed in 5-10 minutes including instructions, testing, and responses. This test has also been validated with brain MRI measures. The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised Learning T1-3 requires the patient to inspect a 2x3 stimulus array of abstract geometric figures. There are three learning trials of 10 seconds, then the stimulus is removed and the patient is required to draw the array from memory. This study also correlates with a variety of MRI measures. Other measures which could be used include the PASAT, MOCA test, and others. At the Mellen Center we screen both with items on a self-reported quality of life scale as well as in our review of symptoms. We have not systematically used screening tools in out entire population though this would be a reasonable approach as well. Q: What is the role of neuropsychology in ascertaining and monitoring cognition? The brief cognitive screening batteries described above could be administered by a non-neuropsychologist to determine if an MS patient is experiencing some form of cognitive dysfunction. Such a result is of limited importance, however, if not tied into specific clinical management. For this to happen, it is common to refer MS patients for a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment performed by a board certified clinical neuropsychologist. Such as assessment typically entails three to four hours of testing and includes a clinical interview. Comprehensive assessments can provide detailed baseline and follow-up data as well as information that pertains to complex matters such as differential diagnosis (e.g. MS dementia versus Alzheimer's disease in an elderly patient), guidance for rehabilitation or therapies, or determination of disability status. Neuropsychology testing can be particularly helpful if work or school related performance has been questioned, potentially leading to recommendation for accommodations (for example, breaks between tasks, more time for examinations, quieter workspace, part time work, etc.) Referral to a clinical neuropsychologist, board-certified by the American Board of Clinical Neuropsychology, is recommended. Q: What non-medication interventions exist for cognitive dysfunction? Non pharmacologic treatment for cognitive impairment in MS, variously described as cognitive retraining, cognitive remediation, or cognitive rehabilitation among other labels, includes three main approaches: (1) restorative therapies that aim to improve specific abilities, (2) compensatory approaches that aim to circumvent cognitive problems through the use of cognitive strategies, and (3) adaptive approaches that aim to circumvent cognitive problems through the use of external aids and modifications (Amato and Zipoli, 2003). Recent studies have begun to assess interventions specifically designed to improve targeted aspects of learning and memory in MS (Chiaravalloti, DeLuca et al., 2005). A recent Cochrane Review found low level evidence for the benefit of neuropsychological rehabilitation in MS patients (Rosti-Otajarvi 2004). Variations in study design and conduct precluded a strong recommendation for such rehabilitative strategies. In addition to the direct treatment of cognition, it is useful to detect and treat comorbidities such as depression and fatigue that can influence cognition and quality of life (Amato and Zipoli, 2003; Bagert, Camplair et al., 2002; Bakshi, 2003). Cognitive-behavioral counseling based in neuropsychological principles has been shown to improve insight and social skills, leading to a reduction in disinhibition and social aggressiveness in cognitively impaired MS patients (Benedict, Shaprio et al., 2001) In addition, a single study indicated reduced brain atrophy in patients actively exercising, which might have an impact on cognition (Lovera, 2010). Compensatory strategies may be helpful. These include a simplified schedule of activities, reminder lists or other strategies, reducing clutter in the household, among others. Where available, vocational rehabilitation may be useful to counsel the patient on alternatives or adaptions which might assist them in the workplace. In general populations, various preventive strategies to spare cognition have been supported by epidemiological or clinical trials data. These may be worth discussing with patients concerned about preventing cognitive decline: Treating hypertension, diabetes, and other vascular risk factors Data on brain training is limited at the present time. Q: What medication approaches are there for cognitive dysfunction? Treatment of cognitive problems in MS has received relatively little clinical or empirical attention in the past. However, recent years have seen the emergence of studies of pharmacologic interventions that have undergone rigorous scientific scrutiny in well-designed clinical trials (Doraiswamy and Rao, 2004). Prevention of cognitive impairment in MS is an important target of therapy. Some disease-modifying medications have been shown to have a beneficial effect on cognition (e.g., Fischer, Priore et al. 2000). Pharmacologic strategies used to treat cognitive impairment in other disorders may have a beneficial effect on MS. A randomized, placebo-controlled study demonstrated a modest but statistically significant benefit of the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil on memory test performance in MS (Krupp, Christodoulou et al., 2004). However, a larger multicenter study of donepezil did not confirm this finding (Krupp et al 2011). It may also be helpful to minimize, when possible, the use of medications with potential adverse cognitive consequences, such as bladder-control medications with anticholinergic effects (Tsao and Heilman, 2005). A randomized multicenter study of memantine 10mg bid in MS patients with cognitive symptoms shows more fatigue and neurological adverse events than patients on placebo and no positive effect on cognition. Higher doses of memantine may have more cognitive side effects in this population as well. Other medications considered for use in this population have not been tested in a randomized trial way. These include activating antidepressants, stimulants, and modafinil. There is limited data to support the use of these medications in this situation. Q: What do families need to think of when there are cognitive disorders? Independent of the severity of physical disability, cognitive dysfunction can have a major impact on employment and activities of daily living in MS (Rao, Leo et al., 1991). Severity of cognitive impairment, as measured by neuropsychological testing, is predictive of ability to drive (Schultheis, Garay et al., 2002), employment status (Benedict, 2005; Rao, Leo et al., 1991), success in rehabilitation (Langdon and Thompson, 1999), and social skills (Knight, Devereux et al., 1997). It is critical that patients and family members receive accurate information and psychosocial counseling to assist them in coping with these sometimes intractable consequences of MS. There are specific recommendations available on the assessment and management of cognitive impairment in MS which may be useful to families and patients with such impairment (Benedict Zacharia, et al., 2006). Specific considerations to discuss with families include safety (to avoid falls, wandering, injury); financial oversight; and driving safety. Bobholz, JA and Rao, SM (2003).

Following cell surface binding, ocrelizumab selectively depletes CD20-expressing B-cells through antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis. The precise mechanisms through which ocrelizumab exerts its therapeutic clinical effects in multiple sclerosis are not known but involve immunomodulation through the reduction in the number and function of CD20-expressing Bcells. Components of MS pathology potentially affected by this mechanism include reductions in: auto-antigen presentation, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, production of autoantibodies, and formation of meningeal lymphoid follicle-like structures. Ocrelizumab affects cell types in the middle of the B-cell lineage, including pre-B cells, mature and memory B cells, but not lymphoid stem cells or plasma cells. The capacity for B cell reconstitution and preexisting humoral immunity are thought to be preserved. The average half-life of ocrelizumab in the body is approximately 28 days. Following administration, B-cells are rapidly depleted and can remain undetectable for a prolonged and variable period of time ranging from 6 months to more than 12 months. Q: How can we apply prior experience with rituximab? Significant anecdotal off-label experience with rituximab has accumulated in large MS centers around the world including the Mellen Center, for treating both MS and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Uncontrolled case series have reported excellent efficacy and safety when rituximab has been used to treat MS. Though ocrelizumab targets the same immunologic mechanism and is administered in a similar fashion to rituximab, ocrelizumab is a different antibody. In vitro characterization of ocrelizumab demonstrated enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and reduced complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) as compared with rituximab. Ocrelizumab binds to a different, but overlapping, epitope of the extracellular domain of CD20 as compared with rituximab. As of March 2017, ocrelizumab is FDA approved to treat relapsing and primary progressive forms of MS. Ocrelizumab is an infrequently administered intravenous medication, given in the outpatient (office or hospital-based infusion room) setting. In Phase III studies of RRMS, ocrelizumab was administered as follows: Followed by ocrelizumab 600mg IV x 1 every 6 months In a Phase III study of ocrelizumab in PPMS, total dose and frequency was similar to the above protocol except follow-up doses every 6 months were divided as 300mg IV each separated by 14 days. The efficacy of ocrelizumab was demonstrated in two double-blind, double-dummy, Phase 3 studies (OPERA I and OPERA II) evaluating the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab vs IFN beta1a SC in adult patients with RRMS. In those studies, treatment with ocrelizumab significantly reduced the relapse rate vs IFN beta-1a by 46% in OPERA I (p<0.0001) and by 47% in OPERA II (p<0.0001). Ocrelizumab treatment also significantly reduced the time to onset of disability progression vs IFN beta-1a, and suppressed new T2 lesions (by 77% in OPERA I and 83% in OPERA II) and gadolinium-enhancing lesions (by 94% in OPERA I and 95% in OPERA II). We do not anticipate restricting use of ocrelizumab to patients who have experienced breakthrough disease on other disease modifying therapies. Ocrelizumab was evaluated for efficacy in PPMS in a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled Phase 3 trial (ORATORIO). A total of 732 patients were randomized to receive ocrelizumab 600 mg IV or placebo every 24 weeks. Treatment with ocrelizumab significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability sustained for ≥12 weeks (as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale) by 24% compared with placebo (p=0.0321). Ocrelizumab also significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability sustained for ≥24 weeks by 25% vs placebo (p=0.0365). Subgroup analyses of patients in ORATORIO with (n=193) vs without gadolinium-enhancing lesions (n=533) at baseline showed that efficacy tended to be stronger in patients with baseline gad enhancement (HR for disability progression 0.65, 95% CI 0.40, 1.06) than without gad enhancement (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62, 1.13). This result is consistent with the results of other disease modifying therapies tested in PPMS, the common theme of which is that younger patients and those with evidence of active inflammation in the form of new T2 or gadoliniumenhancing lesions are the most likely to benefit from therapy. Q: What are the major adverse effects of ocrelizumab: The most common adverse events observed in the Phase III studies of ocrelizumab were mildto-moderate infusion-related reactions. The incidence of adverse events, including serious infections, was similar between ocrelizumab and placebo. Particular events of interest: Mild to moderate infusion reactions were observed in approximately 25% of patients at the time of first infusion. Moderate infusion reaction was defined as requiring minor local or noninvasive management (usually additional medication or change in infusion rate). The incidence of infusion reactions decreased substantially with subsequent infusions in the clinical trials (to 10% or less). Infusion reactions may typically include itching. Severe infusion reactions (requiring urgent medical management) occurred very rarely in the clinical trials. Ocrelizumab must be administered in physician office or inpatient setting by nurses who have experience and qualification to infuse the drug, under supervision by physicians who have experience managing infusion reactions. The rate of common infections was similar between ocrelizumab and placebo or Rebif, with upper respiratory infection, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, occurring each up to 15% of the time in ocrelizumab vs. 10% of the time in the placebo group. No opportunistic infections were identified. Ocrelizumab should not be utilized in patients with active acute or chronic infections. Ocrelizumab might reactivate Hepatitis B infection. For this reason checking for Hepatitis B infection prior to initiating ocrelizumab is important. Neoplasms occurred rarely across all treatment arms in all 3 Phase III clinical trials. The rates of events overall are consistent with what is expected in an MS patient population. Breast cancer occurred in 6 of 781 females treated with ocrelizumab and none of the 668 females treated with interferon beta 1a or placebo. Longer-term data are required to effectively assess the impact of ocrelizumab on rates of malignancy. We recommend patients adhere to usual age-appropriate malignancy screening recommendations. Infusion reactions are expected related to the mechanism of action of ocrelizumab (cytolysis), and those standard infusion reactions may be differentiated from those with features of mast cell or basophil activation (signifying potential progression to anaphylaxis). Features such as itching cannot be used to differentiate between the two. Patients who develop a non-life-threatening mild to moderate SIR can usually be managed by temporary discontinuation of drug infusion alone. Once all symptoms have resolved, most patients will tolerate a slower infusion rate (one-half the rate at which the reaction occurred) with additional antihistamines plus acetaminophen. Patients with even mild symptoms of mast cell/basophil activation (eg, urticaria and dyspnea) should in most cases not resume infusion or be retreated, because reexposure to the causative agent could result in a fulminant and severe anaphylaxis. No definitive guidance is available on the effect of ocrelizumab on pregnancy. Theoretically, the drug could pass to the fetus and have an effect on the fetus. We will counsel woman to use effective contraceptive methods while on ocrelizumab and wait at least 5 months (based on the half-life of the drug) since their last ocrelizumab infusion before attempting to conceive. Q: Should we monitor CD19 counts in a patient on ocrelizumab? We do not expect to routinely monitor B-cell (CD19) counts in patients receiving ocrelizumab or altering the administration schedule based on CD19 counts. The return of B-cells may affect some patients’ abilities to receive other therapies after ocrelizumab, so checking CD19 counts may occasionally be useful to monitor the return of B-cells after treatment. Q: Is any routine monitoring required for patients on ocrelizumab? We routinely check MRI scans of the brain at least every 12 months in patients on therapies for both safety and efficacy monitoring. Q: Is PML a concern in patients treated with ocrelizumab? Although no cases of PML related to ocrelizumab have been reported in MS patients, the experience is limited to patients enrolled in clinical trials. There have been cases of PML reported in association with rituximab therapy in other diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, there may be other rare complications of rituximab in MS patients which has not yet been recognized. Live vaccines should be avoided for patients within 6 months of any ocrelizumab infusion, potentially longer based on B-cell reconstitution. Because rituximab may reduce the generation of new antibodies, the efficacy of vaccines is probably reduced during rituximab therapy. Therefore, clinically indicated vaccines should be given one month or more before starting rituximab. If vaccines are needed during rituximab treatment, they ideally should be given about 1 month prior to the next treatment course. An ongoing study will assess the effectiveness of standard vaccines in patients being treated with ocrelizumab. Kappos L, Li D, Calabresi PA, et al.

Dimethyl fumarate (DMF, Tecfidera) was approved by the US FDA in March 2013 as an oral disease modifying treatment for relapsing forms of MS. Combined data from a Phase II study and two Phase III trials showed that DMF reduces relapses, disability progression, MRI lesion activity. The exact mechanism of action of DMF is not known but may include direct inhibition of proinflammatory pathways and effects on dendritic cell differentiation. DMF may also act through the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) like 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant response pathway. DMF is administered as a single 240mg capsule, twice per day (once in the morning and once in the evening; it does not need to be taken exactly 12 hours apart.) A seven-day starter-pack of 120m mg capsules twice per day is available and recommended to help improve tolerability. Food does not alter DMF's absorption. Therefore, DMF can be taken without regard to meals, although gastrointestinal tolerability may be improved by taking it with food. Missed doses should be skipped and do not need to be made up. However, if a few days are missed, patients may have a recurrence of their side effects. DMF was approved to treat relapsing forms of MS. DMF is also an appropriate treatment option for patients with ongoing disease activity, intolerable side effects, or logistical issues with other MS therapies. DMF is approved as first line therapy (i.e. patients are not required to have tried other medications before DMF), although long-term experience with its use is limited. Note that some insurances will not approve this as first line therapy but may insist that patients use other medications first. We often have patients check with their insurance before beginning the paperwork for DMF. Q: Should patients switch from a previously-available injected medication to DMF? We anticipate many patients currently on an injectable therapy will be attracted to DMF's oral route of administration. However, if a patient is stable clinically and radiographically, and he/she is not experiencing significant adverse effects, in general, we recommend not switching therapy. For JC virus antibody-positive patients on Tysabri who are concerned about the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, DMF is a reasonable consideration. As with anyone on an MS medicine, we do consider switching medicines in the following situations: Intolerance or specific side effects of present medicine. Risk of major side effects such as PML with present medicine Continued relapses above 'acceptable' level of activity (there are no well defined criteria but more than one relapse per year or functionally meaningful relapses often prompt us to change medicine) Continued MRI activity (New T2 lesions or enhancing lesion). Again there is some low level of new disease activity which would be expected on all of the medicines and a judgment call is necessary to decide when a change makes sense. Q: What side effects and safety issues does DMF have? DMF is generally safe and well tolerated. DMF typically lowers the lymphocyte count. The FDA recommends a complete blood count prior to initiating treatment, and then again annually and when clinically indicated. The main side-effects of DMF are skin flushing and gastrointestinal symptoms. Although uncommon, when it is seen, skin flushing typically occurs 30 minutes to several hours after taking DMF. Pruritis and erythema are sometimes reported, too. A placebo-controlled study found that aspirin can significantly reduce flushing. Diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting can be seen between 30 minutes and several hours after taking DMF. Symptoms are most common in the first few weeks after starting DMF and typically reduce significantly by one month of treatment. Symptomatic therapies can be used in patients, where needed, including H2/proton pump inhibitors, metoclopramide, bismuth subsalicylate, loperamide, as needed depending upon the gastrointestinal symptoms. The enteric formulation of DMF makes it mostly like to be absorbed int he intestines. Accordingly, patients who have received gastric bypass are not expected to have altered tolerability. Some patients have reported a benefit for the GI symptoms using an anecdotal list of foods: Q: Can the dosing schedule be changed to reduce the risk of GI side effects? Different dosing strategies have been applied to try to reduce GI side effects. At the Mellen Center we have been using the following modification of the dosing strategy for MG: Third and Fourth week: DMF 240mg with the largest meal, and one 120mg with opposite meal (breakfast and dinner) An alternative regimen tested by NYU medical center (presented ACTRIMS meeting September 2014): Q: Is there a risk of PML with DMF and if so how do I risk stratify and monitor appropriately? Although DMF is a potent immunomodulatory drug and reversibly lowers blood lymphocyte counts, the clinical trials did not observe an increased rate of either routine infections or opportunistic infections. This decline in the lymphocyte count tends to progress over the first year of treatment and counts remain low throughout the course of treatment. However, lymphocyte counts can be quite variable over time, too. Lymphocyte counts may take from 12-16 weeks to return to normal after treatment with tecfidera. There have been case reports of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) with another fumaric acid preparation (Fumaderm), which is available in Germany. Most of these cases were on another immune-suppressing medication prior to or at the time of DMF therapy or had persistently low lymphocyte counts. In October 2014 a single case was reported with DMF of PML which was fatal. This patient was enrolled in ongoing clinical trials of DMF and has not been on immunosuppressive medications prior to this trial. The patient experienced persistently low absolute lymphocyte counts for 3.5 years of treatment (< 500), and was not recognized as having PML until late in the disease course. On the basis of this case, at the Mellen Center, we now recommend a CBC with differential every 6 months while patients are on dimethyl fumarate. If the absolute lymphocyte counts are 500-750. we recheck in 3 months then every 3 months until the count rises about 750. If the absolute lymphocyte count is under 500, we recheck BC monthly and obtain JCV serology. If the absolute lymphocyte count is persistently < 500 and the patient is JCV seropositive, we consider an alternative treatment. Q: How long should a patient wait after stopping another disease modifying therapy before starting DMF? there is no data regarding optimal wash out times. The theoretical increased risk of complications from incomplete wash out from the previous therapy needs to be balanced against the risk of return of MS disease activity during a wash out period. In some patients, the return of disease activity can be very severe. Decisions regarding wash out are influenced by the treatments and the patients underlying disease activity. We have adopted the following wash out periods before starting DMF: Interferon, glatiramer acetate, and teriflunomide: No wash out period Fingolimod: 2-3 week wash out (so that lymphocyte counts normalize) Prior to therapy, a complete blood count (CBC) is recommended. We have also begun to do JCVirus antibodies on patients starting natalizumab, fingolimod, or dimethyl fumarate due to the case reports of PML on the latter two medications and due to the known propensity of natalizumab to cause PML. Q: Are there any restrictions on who can take DMF? There are no contraindications for using DMF. Patients with nausea and diarrhea at baseline should use DMF with caution, as it may aggravate those symptoms. there are no reports of complications related to surgery in patients receiving DMF, so we do not recommend stopping DMF for surgery. Q: Does the risk of infection relate to peripheral blood, white blood cell, or lymphocyte counts? There is no clear relationship between the level of lymphocyte reduction and the incidence (or severity) of infections. See above discussion of risk mitigation for PML. The effectiveness and safety of DMF in primary and secondary progressive MS are not known. Based on animal studies, DMF potentially causes fetal harm and is classified as Pregnancy Category C. Women should use effective contraception while taking DMF and for some time after stopping it. Women should discontinue DMF prior to attempting to become pregnant. There is no known effect of DMF on sperm. Q: Can DMF be used in combination with other MS disease therapies? There are no data concerning the safety or utility of combining DMF with other MS disease therapies. Co-Administration of DMF with immunosuppressant medications would be expected to increase the risk of infection. Q: Can DMF be combined with MS symptom medication? DMF can be combined with MS symptom medications without a problem. There are no specific medications which are contraindicated while patients are on DMF. Q: Can DMF be combined with medications for other conditions? There are no medications known to interact with DMF. Q: Can the dose of DMF be increased beyond 240mg twice daily? The approved dose of DMF is 240mg twice daily (480mg total per day). 240mg thrice daily (720mg total per day) were tested in the DMF Phase II and Phase III trials, but there was no greater efficacy at this dose. Lower dose of DMF (i.e. 240mg once daily) have not been evaluated and so are not currently recommended. Gold R, Kappos L, Arnold DL, et al.

Dalfampridine (Ampyra) was approved by the FDA on January 22nd, 2010 as an oral medication to improve walking in patients with MS. Dalfampridine is a symptomatic therapy, and can be used in combination with disease modifying agents. It is an extended release form of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, also known as fampridine). Dalfampridine is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of voltagesensitive potassium channels. In laboratory studies, dalfampridine has been found to improve impulse conduction in demyelinated nerve fibers and to increase synaptic transmitter release at nerve endings. (Judge, 2006). Its mechanism of action in vivo has not been determined. Dalfampridine is administered as a 10 mg extended release tablet every twelve hours. In two phase III trials in patients with MS randomized to dalfampridine vs. placebo, a significantly greater percentage of patients were ‘responders’ on dalfampridine than on placebo (Goodman et al, 2008; Goodman et al 2009). A responder was defined as a patient who consistently showed faster walking speed on the Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW) while on therapy than while not on therapy. About 1/3 patients responded to dalfampridine in these studies (Goodman et al, 2009). There was also improvement of scores on the MS-Walking Scale 12, a patient-reported measure of walking performance in daily activities, in dalfampridine responders. In a phase, IIIb clinical trial comparing 10 mg twice daily versus 5 mg twice daily dosing or placebo, the 5 mg dose failed to demonstrate efficacy. With the standard dose of 10 mg twice daily, there was again a statistically significant effect on walking speed (T25FW) using the ‘responder analysis’.The study also showed a significant effect on the 6-minute walk test (a measure of walking endurance) with 10 mg twice daily. Q: What is the difference between dalfampridine and compounded 4-aminopyridine? Dalfampridine is an extended-release formulation of 4-AP, while compounded 4-AP is mostly an immediate release (IR) formulation. The IR formulation leads to an initial peak in plasma concentration, which has been associated with a higher risk of side effects. In addition, there have been reports of accidental overdose due to compounding errors. Patients should be instructed to never take dalfampridine and compounded 4-AP concomitantly. Reasonable candidates to try dalfampridine are patients with any type of MS who have walking problems from MS and for whom improvement in walking would be of clinical benefit. In phase III clinical trials, the increased response rate in the dalfampridine group was observed across all four major types of MS (relapsing remitting, secondary progressive, progressive relapsing and primary progressive), and there was no difference in response based on baseline disability status. We note that the magnitude of effect of dalfampridine is usually modest, although significant to the patient. We would not expect patients to change the type of assistive device that they use (that is, if they are using a Rollator, we would not expect them to switch to a cane or no device due to dalfampridine). The average increase in walking speed reported in the clinical trials was around 25% (a 20% change on 25 foot timed walk was found to be the minimal clinically important change for patients). Dalfampridine is not expected to restore ambulation in MS patients who are wheelchair-bound. Other functions might improve (for example upper extremity function, visual acuity, diplopia), but this was not proven in the pivotal trials. Q: Are there any types of gait disturbance for which dalfampridine is not indicated? There is no formal limitation for dalfampridine use regarding the specific type of gait abnormality, but we expect it will be more beneficial in patients with spastic paresis over those with mostly cerebellar or sensory ataxia. It is essential to remember that dalfampridine does not address all gait problems. For example, dalfampridine does not improve gait stability or obviate the need for an assistive device and/or physical therapy, so we recommend these be addressed first, since prescribing a medication that increases walking speed in a patient with unsafe gait may lead to increased risk of falling. There is one dosage, 10 mg tablet twice a day, taken with or without food. Doses should be approximately 12 hours apart. PATIENTS SHOULD NOT DOUBLE UP DOSES IF THEY MISS A DOSE to reduce the risk of side-effects, including seizures. There was no additional benefit above this dose in clinical trials, and serious side effects including seizures were more common at higher doses. Tablets should be taken whole, not crushed or chewed. There is no data on use in pediatric age groups and this medicine is therefore not recommended at present for patients younger than 18 years of age. Data in the elderly is not available. Dalfampridine should not be used by women who are pregnant or nursing. Based on animal data, this medicine may cause fetal harm. Q: When would you expect to see an effect from dalfampridine? We would expect to see a response within 2-4 weeks. This is a medication which should have its maximal effectively rapidly and thus prolonged trials beyond a month are not helpful unless a medical event prevents the patient and the clinician from assessing the true effect of the medication (e.g. UTI, MS exacerbation). Q: What are the risks of dalfampridine and what can be done to reduce those risks? The FDA approved dalfampridine with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program comprising a medication guide and communication plan. The goals of the communication plan are to inform patients about the serious risks, including seizures (which are associated with the use of higher than recommended doses of dalfampridine therapy) and the change of the established name from fampridine to dalfampridine. Detailed information about prescribing dalfampridine is available from the following website: Dalfampridine is contraindicated in patients who have previously had seizures and may cause seizures de novo, particularly at higher than recommended doses. The overall incidence of seizures with dalfampridine 10 mg twice daily is 0.4 per 100 person-years. It is also contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 50 mL/min). It should be used with caution in patients over 50 years of age, who are at higher risk of having mild renal impairment. Over 90% of the drug is excreted in the urine, and the safety of dalfampridine is currently unknown in patients with mild renal impairment. The estimated creatinine clearance should be calculated in all patients prior to starting treatment and should be monitored at least yearly. It is necessary to know the patient’s weight to calculate the estimated creatinine clearance. Other reported side effects seen at ≥ 2% of dalfampridine-treated patients in treatment trials included the following: urinary tract infection, insomnia, dizziness, headache, nausea, asthenia, back pain, balance disorder, paresthesia, nasopharyngitis, constipation, dyspepsia, and pharyngolaryngeal pain. Several anaphylactic reactions temporally related to taking dalfampridine were also reported. Dalfampridine should not be used along with other forms of 4-aminopyridine. For example, patients who are currently on compounded 4-AP must stop the compounded medication before starting dalfampridine. Q: What about doing an EEG prior to beginning dalfampridine? A history of prior seizures is a contraindication for starting dalfampridine. All participants in the licensing clinical trials for dalfampridine received screening EEGs and were excluded if there was evidence for epileptiform activity on that screening EEG. Therefore, there is no published experience of dalfampridine in continued on next page Mellen Center Approaches: Use of dalfampridine (Ampyra), continued 3 patients with epileptiform activity on screening EEG. However, the utility of a screening EEG is unclear. Therefore, obtaining an EEG before prescribing dalfampridine is at the discretion of the clinician. Q: What is the process to prescribe dalfampridine? Information on prescribing dalfampridine can be obtained at the following website: Dalfampridine is presently available only through a specialty pharmacy. Specific forms need to be submitted with insurance information for dalfampridine approval. Q: What else should I consider when prescribing dalfampridine? Walking is a complex neurobiological function and there are many ways that we can improve walking skills beyond the use of dalfampridine. When prescribing dalfampridine, we recommend a comprehensive approach to walking limitations. We think that patients should be assessed by a physical therapist skilled at gait assessment. PT exercises aimed at improving strength, spasticity, gait, and balance, and the provision of walking aids (cane, Canadian crutches, walker, Rollator, etc.) and/ or bracing (for example ankle foot orthosis) may significantly improve gait efficiency and safety.

There are several different types of MS, including relapsing-remitting, progressive and fulminant. The severity of your condition depends on the type of MS you have. Symptoms of MS can include numbness, difficulty walking, fatigue and weakness in one or more body part. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system disorder — that is, it affects the brain and spinal cord and spares the nerves and muscles that leave the spinal cord. MS is an inflammatory disorder in which infection-fighting white blood cells enter the nervous system and cause injury. It is a demyelinating disorder because the myelin sheath that protects nerves is stripped off during inflammation. When this happens, the nerves cannot conduct electricity as well as they should, causing various symptoms. Symptoms may be the type that come and go over time (relapsing-remitting MS) or progress over time (progressive MS). MS can happen to just about anyone and is long-term. Are there different types of multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS varies from patient to patient so that each individual has their own set of symptoms, problems, and their own course. There are people who have MS so mildly that they never even know that they have it. Of course, there are also others that have it severely. It is really a spectrum that ranges from mild to severe. An international panel of experts developed a classification of MS in 1999 that most neurologists use today: : Patients have attacks of symptoms/signs, with or without recovery, but between attacks have no interval worsening. : This is often after a few years of relapsing-remitting MS. The pattern changes from a relapsing pattern to progressive in between attacks, usually with fewer attacks. : This involves a gradual onset from the beginning and no attacks. : This is a rare form, and begins with a progressive course, while later developing attacks. : This is a rare form, and is very severe, rapidly progressive MS. Is there such a thing as benign multiple sclerosis (MS)? The term, ""benign MS,"" is not part of the international classification. It is used when people have had MS for many years without developing significant measurable disability. Recent studies have shown that it cannot be predicted early in the disease and so the term can only really be used retrospectively, after people have done very well with MS for many years. What are the risk factors of multiple sclerosis (MS)? There has been extensive research about MS over the past 50 years. While we still do not know the cause of MS, we know that it is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that occurs in people with a tendency to such a problem. We know that about 350,000 people in the United States have MS, about one in a 1,000 people. We know that it is more common further north and south of the equator, though we are still unsure why this is. Females tend to get MS about three times as often as males, a rate which is similar to other immune diseases. It is more common in Caucasians, but can occur in other populations. It is not contagious nor is it infectious. There may be a link with reduced vitamin D levels and perhaps with decreased sun exposure. We know that there is a genetic component to MS. Having a mother or father with MS increases the risk of having MS to about 3 to 5% lifetime, and having an identical twin with MS increases the risk to about 30%. However, many people with MS have no close family members with the disease. There is nothing that an individual with MS either did to cause the disease to happen, or can avoid to stop the disease from following its natural course. We know that emotional stress may increase the symptoms of MS. We also know that attacks of MS are more likely after infections. There does not seem to be any association with physical trauma or surgical procedures and MS, nor do these seem to make MS worse. There has been widespread research about MS over the past 50 years. We do not know the cause of MS, but do know that it is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that occurs in people with a tendency to such a problem. We know that about 350,000 people in the United States have MS, about 1 in 1,000 people. We know that it is more common further north and south of the equator. Although we are still unsure exactly why this is. Females tend to get MS about three times as often as males, a rate similar to other immune diseases. MS is more common in Caucasians, but can occur in other populations. It is not contagious, nor is it infectious. Did I do anything to bring on the multiple sclerosis (MS) or make it worse? As far as we know there are no activities that specifically cause MS or make it worse. People with MS may not tolerate heat as well as they used to and may need to avoid particularly hot or humid situations. There is evidence that having infections makes having an exacerbation of MS more likely. There does not appear to be a link to trauma. However, emotional stress has been linked to a worsening of MS symptoms. Having MS is not the fault of people who have it; it can happen to anyone. Is there anything new that we know about multiple sclerosis (MS)? Multiple sclerosis is being studied actively in many research institutions around the world, and new knowledge is being added constantly. For example, we now know that even with early MS, the nerve fibers themselves (the axons) are affected more than we knew before. We know from MRI studies that new lesions (abnormal areas in the brain or spinal cord) occur about 5 to10 times as often as people with MS have new symptoms; that is, much of the disease occurs 'under the radar scope'. We know that myelin repair occurs in the central nervous system all the time. Some groups feel there are different types of immune or pathological processes going on that we call MS, and perhaps MS may be many different disorders that we have lumped together. Do any other diseases look like multiple sclerosis (MS)? When neurologists evaluate MS they are also considering other diagnoses. While MS is the most likely cause of typical white matter changes and symptoms in an otherwise healthy young person, there are some other diseases that we consider and occasionally diagnose. These include a vitamin B12 deficiency that can cause an MS-like illness, and rarely, , which may have symptoms that suggest MS. The MRI is very useful in ruling out many other disorders that could be confused with MS, and the blood tests and spinal fluid may also be helpful in diagnosing other diseases. What are some early symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS varies from person to person so there is no 'standard' set of symptoms for MS. However, we know that common symptoms of MS include: Numbness or tingling in various parts of the body. Lhermitte's phenomenon, a symptom in which people feel electrical tingling or shocks down their back, arms or legs when they bend their neck forwards. Urinary symptoms, such as hesitancy when trying to urinate, or a feeling of urgency (when you have to go, you have to go). There is no way to predict which symptoms one person might develop. MS varies from person to person so there is no ‘standard’ set of symptoms for MS. However we know that common symptoms of MS include numbness or tingling in various parts of the body, weakness of one or more parts of the body, walking difficulties, dizziness, fatigue, visual blurring and occasionally double vision. Patients may also have a symptom called Lhermitte’s phenomenon, in which they feel electrical tingling or shocks down their back, arms or legs when they bend their neck forwards. Sometimes people notice hesitancy when they try to urinate or may find that 'when they have to go, they have to go’. There is no way to predict which symptoms one person might develop. The usual course of MS is to have periods of time where things are relatively stable, followed by times when, over a few days or weeks, new symptoms occur or old symptoms worsen. This relatively rapid worsening is known as an exacerbation (also known as an attack, or a relapse). In others with MS, there may be a tendency to progress in that symptoms gradually worsen over time (months to years). MS varies from patient to patient so that each individual has their own set of symptoms, problems, and their own course. There are people who have MS so mildly that they never even know that they have it. Of course, there are also others that have it severely. It is really a spectrum that ranges from mild to severe. An international panel of experts developed a classification of MS in 1999 that most neurologists use today. : Patients have attacks of symptoms/signs, with or without recovery, but between attacks have no interval worsening. : This is often after a few years of relapsing-remitting MS. The pattern changes from a relapsing pattern to progressive in between attacks, usually with fewer attacks. : Gradual onset from the beginning, no attacks. : This is a rare form, and begins with a progressive course, while later developing attacks. : Very severe, rapidly progressive MS. This is a rare form of MS. Why do I have symptoms with multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS damages the myelin sheath surrounding the nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord. Scarring from this damage can block or slow nerve impulses in areas of the brain (neurological damage). As a direct result of MS, you may lack coordination and feel tired, and have weakness, involuntary movements, muscle stiffness (spasticity), or pain. Symptoms such as these are called ""primary symptoms."" Primary symptoms of MS can make you move less. As a result, you may feel tightness, pain and weakness, especially in the muscles and joints. These symptoms, which are not a direct result of MS, are called ""secondary symptoms."" Why do people with multiple sclerosis (MS) have depression? is very common in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In fact, symptoms of depression severe enough to require medical intervention affect up to half of all people with MS at some point during their illness. Depression may be the result of a difficult situation or stress. It is easy to understand how having MS, with its potential for progressing to permanent disability, can bring on depression. Depression might be actually caused by MS. MS may affect the insulating myelin that surrounds nerves which transmit signals affecting mood. Depression is also a side effect of some drugs used to treat MS, such as steroids or interferon. How does heat or humidity impact people with multiple sclerosis (MS)? Heat or high humidity can cause many people with to experience a temporary worsening of their symptoms. Doctors believe that this occurs because heat causes nerves (whose myelin covering has been removed by MS) to conduct electrical signals even less efficiently. For reasons that are not well understood, extremely cold temperatures and changes in temperature can also cause MS symptoms, usually , to flare. Reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional.

Common relapse syndromes include unilateral optic neuritis, focal brainstem or cerebellar syndromes, or partial myelitis. Atypical symptoms that would warrant further evaluation include encephalopathy, complete ophthalmoplegia, headache, or isolated fatigue. A typical MS relapse evolves over 24-48 hours and reaches a nadir in several days. More sudden or gradual symptoms should prompt evaluation of alternative diagnoses. Most patients experience some spontaneous recovery though it is variable and affected by other factors such as comorbidities, functional status prior to the relapse, and age.  Q: What is the differential diagnosis for a MS relapse? A: MS can manifest with a wide array of new or worsening symptoms and they do not all constitute a relapse. A pseudorelapse is a temporary recrudescence of prior neurological deficits usually in the setting of certain stressors such as an infection, heat exposure (including fever or exercise), or adverse psychosocial event.  Common paroxysmal syndromes include trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte sign which is an electrical sensation elicited with neck flexion or Pulfrich phenomenon which is an illusionary, binocular disturbance where object moving across the visual field is perceived as travelling along a curved trajectory. Uhthoff phenomenon specifically refers to transient visual blurring with exercise in patients with a history of optic neuritis though other motor or sensory symptoms can exhibit the same phenomenon. Disability accrual in MS can also occur independent of relapses (ie progression). The most common phenotypic presentation is gradual worsening myelopathy. This can be a challenging diagnosis because this qualifier is made retrospectively over time and patients can have overlying relapses. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) can be very difficult to distinguish from a MS relapse especially early in PML. Clinicians should be vigilant in MS patients treated with certain therapies associated with PML infection, particularly natalizumab. In patients being treated with highly effective therapies, there is usually a low risk of breakthrough disease so PML as the cause of new symptoms should be considered, especially if they include seizures, behavioral changes or cognitive abnormalities; if they evolve subacutely or do not respond to corticosteroids. MRI can assist in differentiating a PML lesion from a MS relapse. A: The evaluation of a relapse should be tailored to the clinical scenario. In the setting of an established diagnosis of MS, new neurologic symptoms compatible with those caused by MS, and no symptoms or history suggesting an intercurrent condition, no further ancillary testing may be needed. When symptoms are atypical of a relapse, a targeted work-up should be pursued to identify the cause. For example, if a patient presents with reemergence of remote neurological deficits concerning for a pseudorelapse they should undergo basic laboratory testing before consider pharmacological treatment for a relapse. This includes a urinalysis with culture since occult urinary tract infections are common in MS, along with a complete cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel. Based on the clinical history, further investigative measures can be ordered if symptoms suggest an intercurrent condition or alternative medical condition. An infection or other derangement does not exclude a concomitant relapse, but identification and correction of the possible trigger should be managed before the relapse is treated. A: In general, neuroimaging is not necessary to diagnose a relapse, which is a clinical diagnosis. MRI can be a useful adjuvant to screen for other mimics such as PML or stroke. MRI can also be helpful if there is diagnostic uncertainty as radiographic activity in the context of new neurological symptoms would support the diagnosis of a MS relapse. The prototypical MRI finding in a relapse is gadolinium enhancement reflecting blood brain barrier breakdown. Gadolinium enhancement is observed in most but not all new lesions and resolves over the course of several weeks. Clinicians should be aware that potential treatment such as corticosteroids can alter these radiographic findings. Enhancing lesions can also occur without obvious clinical signs or symptoms. A: In general, we treat relapses, as they cause significant morbidity and symptoms typically interfere patients’ ability to function. Mild relapses such as non-disabling sensory symptoms or those already exhibiting spontaneous improvement may not require intervention as the risk of therapy may outweighs potential benefit of treatment. Ultimately, treatment decisions are made jointly between the patient and provider using a shared decision-making model. Mild, asymptomatic MRI lesion activity does not require treatment as the rationale for pharmacological treatment is to decrease the duration and intensity of neurological symptoms. We often treat in the setting of multiple asymptomatic active lesion as those patients are at increased risk for clinical worsening. New clinical or radiographic disease activity may warrant a change in disease modifying therapy. Please refer to the Mellen Center Approach (MCA) on switching disease modifying therapies for more information on that topic. A: Corticosteroids are the mainstay treatment option for MS relapses. High dose corticosteroids offer rapid symptom relief and hasten neurologic recovery. While there has been much debate about intravenous vs oral administration, it has been demonstrated that dose rather than the route of administration is the most important factor in terms of efficacy.10 We typically use intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP 1000mg daily) or an equivalent dose of intravenous of high dose oral prednisone (1250mg daily which equates to twenty-five 50mg tablets) for 3-5 days for relapses. Multiple studies have shown that high-dose, oral corticosteroid and high-dose, IV methylprednisolone are bioequivalent with a similar side effect profile and equivalent MRI /clinical outcomes. If the oral regimen is selected, we advise patients that they do not need to take all the pills at one time but they take the pills earlier in the day to prevent potential sleep disturbance.  To lessen side effects, we typically prescribe a proton pump inhibitor or H2 antagonists along with a sleep aid (typically melatonin or diphenhydramine) to proactively manage the impact of the high dose corticosteroids. In addition, steroids are associated with rare yet serious complications including aseptic necrosis of the shoulder or hip and hepatic failure. If patients experience severe psychiatric manifestations including mania, depression or psychosis we have a higher threshold for prescribing corticosteroids as those symptoms are difficult to mitigate and could be life threatening. Corticosteroid-induced psychosis usually self-resolves once the medication is stopped but discontinuation is not always possible. Symptoms can be managed with short courses of atypical antipsychotic or mood stabilizing medications though we would encourage treatment coordination with a mental health professional. Hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids are rare yet serious adverse reaction that providers should also be aware of. Reactions seem to be attributable to the specific formulation (i.e. the salt or preservative agent) rather than the steroid itself. A different corticosteroid preparation can be tried again in a controlled setting where emergency medications and personnel are present. A steroid taper can be considered based on relapse severity and clinical context (i.e. comorbidities) but is not required. There is no clear evidence that a taper contributes to recovery or that a short course of high dose corticosteroids significantly suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis which would necessitate a taper in most patients.   Q: What treatments options are available for relapses with incomplete recovery? A: We will consider a second course of corticosteroids if a patient has an incomplete response to the initial treatment though we have a low threshold to escalate therapy as incomplete symptom resolution is a major cause of early disability in MS. We typically use plasmapheresis for treatment of severe or refractory relapses with an incomplete response to the corticosteroids. The length of treatment can vary between 3-7 sessions depending on the treatment response and tolerance. The most common treatment period is 5 sessions over 7-10 days. Plasmapheresis is usually well tolerated but there are a number of potential side effects clinicians should be aware of including infection (specifically related to the venous catheter), deep venous thrombosis, , hypotension, and hypoalbuminemia. Most of these side effects are easily managed and do not require plasmapheresis discontinuation, though close coordination with the plasmapheresis administration team is essential. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) treatment has been approved for use in MS relapses since the 1960s though it was supplanted in clinical practice by corticosteroids in the 1980s. There has been some recent, renewed interest in ACTH given its effects on melanocortin receptors on circulating lymphocytes. There is no conclusive evidence that ACTH has any additional benefits when compared to corticosteroids or improves the recovery of patients with incomplete response to corticosteroids. Clinical trials are currently underway to further investigate. Current evidence does not support intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as a treatment for acute MS relapse. IVIG could be considered if a patient was intolerant to both IVMP and PLEX but we do not typical prescribe it at the Mellen Center. Please refer to the MCA on IVIG for more information regarding that specific therapy. A: Relapses are typically managed in the outpatient setting unless circumstances necessitate inpatient treatment such as an inability for the patient to perform self-care, loss of ability to ambulate, or comorbidities that increase the risk of corticosteroid-related complications. Given the challenges of arranging out-patient plasmapheresis, we usually admit these patients to the hospital for expedited central venous line placement and treatment, though sometimes outpatient therapy can be arranged. Acute treatment in the inpatient setting also is considered if subsequent inpatient rehabilitation is anticipated. Q: What adjunctive methods can be used to manage a relapse? A: We believe rehabilitation is an integral part of relapse management. Our patients engage with a multidisciplinary team to focus on their physical and emotional wellbeing when being treated for a relapse or pseudorelapse. This team encompasses physiatrists, psychologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists. Rehabilitation can focus on motor impairment, gait instability or cognitive dysfunction. These services can also focus on a broader range of functions including an ability to perform activities of daily living, improve mobility, or a return to work. Management of the relapse symptoms can also lead to improved quality of life for patients. For example, treating painful sensory disturbances with a neuropathic pain medications or addressing disabling fatigue with pharmacological and non- pharmacological methods. Q: How are relapses managed during pregnancy or breastfeeding? A: Typically, disease modifying therapy is discontinued during pregnancy and while breast feeding, which increases the risk of disease activity. Fortunately, MS disease activity decreases during this time though women with highly active disease before pregnancy are at higher risk for a relapse, especially for three to four months postpartum. Women undergoing an assisted reproductive technique may also have a higher relapse risk due to the hormone changes induced by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. We typically use the standard treatment strategy for relapses during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. We do have a higher threshold for treatment in the first trimester as there is some evidence for adverse fetal outcomes with corticosteroids, including cleft palate and low birth weight. Generally, relapses during the second and third trimesters can be treated safely with corticosteroids. Ultimately, a joint decision is made between the patient, provider and obstetrician (OBGYN). Corticosteroids can cross into the breast milk so we recommend patients to avoid breast feeding for several hours after their treatment.  For disabling, corticosteroids-refractory relapses, plasmapheresis can be considered. For more information regarding MRIs during pregnancy and breast feeding please refer to the MCA on MRI Activity.  References: Thompson AJ, Banwell BL, Barkhof F, et al.

After IV administration, there is rapid and profound lymphopenia that gradually recovers (return of absolute lymphocyte count to the lower limit of normal in 40% of patients at 6 months and in 80% by 12 months). Efficacy is thought to be due to depletion of circulating pro-inflammatory leukocytes and gradual immune reconstitution during which there is alteration in the lymphocyte profile and functional immunomodulation. Q: What are the indications for Lemtrada (alemtuzumab)? A Phase 2 and two Phase 3 trials demonstrated potent efficacy on relapses and MRI lesion activity compared to SC interferon beta-1a in relapsing MS. Benefit on worsening of disability was shown in the Phase 2 trial 2 and in the CARE-MS II Phase 3 study of patients with continued disease activity on other disease-modifying therapies,4 but not in the CARE-MS I trial of treatment-naïve patients. In early studies, there was no benefit on disability worsening in progressive MS. Lemtrada generally has good tolerability. However, its use is associated with several safety concerns. Safety and efficacy in pediatric and geriatric patients have not been established. Because of these considerations, the approved indication of Lemtrada generally is restricted to patients with active relapsing MS with an inadequate response to 2 or more disease-modifying medications. The approved dose in MS is 12 mg IV daily for 5 consecutive days at Month 0 and daily for 3 consecutive days at Month 12. At the Mellen Center we agree with these restrictions. We use alemtuzumab for patients with active MS not responding to 2 or more disease modifying therapies, or who have not tolerated other medications. Although not discussed in the Prescribing Information, there is anecdotal experience and data from the trials supporting the utility and safety of retreatment (3 days) after Month 12 (annually or less often PRN) in patients with return of MS disease activity. Note that because of the importance of close follow up for this medication, particularly continued lab testing, we are careful at the Mellen Center to select candidates who are willing to follow up closely for their health and who are reliable agents in their ongoing care. Q: What is the pharmacology and immunogenicity of Lemtrada? After IV administration, the elimination half-life of Lemtrada is approximately 2 weeks. Anti-Lemtrada binding antibodies develop in most patients (83%, 3 months after the 2nd cycle). Neutralizing antibodies also are common, detectable in 88-94% of binding antibody-positive patients 1-3 months after the 2nd cycle. Binding antibodies are less common 12 months after the first cycle prior to the 2nd cycle (detectable in 29% of patients), and neutralizing antibodies are uncommon (5% of binding antibody-positive patients). In the clinical trials, the presence of neutralizing antibodies had no apparent effect on efficacy, lymphocyte counts, or adverse effects. Q: What are the potential adverse effects of Lemtrada? The main adverse effects of Lemtrada include: Infusion-related symptoms are due to rapid cytolysis of circulating leukocytes and resultant cytokine release syndrome. Infusion-related symptoms develop in >90% of patients (without premedication) and can range from minimal to severe (in 3% of patients). Symptoms can develop during or after infusion. Typically, they are most prominent on Day 1 of the 1st cycle and are less severe on subsequent days and during the 2nd cycle. Lemtrada should be infused in a setting with equipment, medications, and personnel to manage anaphylaxis and severe infusion reactions if needed. In most cases, infusion-related symptoms can be effectively minimized by pretreatment with corticosteroids, antipyretics, and antihistamines. The Prescribing Information recommends IVMP 1000 mg daily for 3 days. However, in our experience, a significant proportion of patients then develop symptoms on Days 4 and 5. Therefore, unless contraindicated, we administer corticosteroid pretreatment for 5 days during the 1st cycle and for 3 days during the 2nd cycle (and subsequent cycles). This phenomenon presumably is due to reconstitution of B lymphocyte populations faster than regulatory T lymphocyte populations. The risk of autoimmune disorders persists for 4-5 years after the last dose of Lemtrada. Thyroid disease (34% of patients). Autoimmune thyroid disorders, associated either with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, are common. Most cases respond to standard management. Thyroid ophthalmopathy is rare. The Prescribing Information recommends TSH prior to treatment and every 3 months until 48 months after the last administration. Immune thrombocytopenia (2% of patients). This adverse effect can range from mild and self-limited to severe, including leading to hemorrhage and death. The Prescribing Information recommends CBC with differential prior to treatment and monthly until 48 months after the last administration. Note: severe thrombocytopenia can develop precipitously, within weeks of a normal CBC. Patients should be educated about the signs and symptoms of thrombocytopenia and should be evaluated emergently if they report them. Most cases respond to standard management. We encourage patient teaching to watch particularly for signs of a bleeding disorder (petechiae, hematomas) and to act immediately on any concerning signs. Glomerular nephropathies (0.3% of patients). Glomerular nephropathies (membranous glomerulonephritis and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease) are rare but if left untreated can lead to renal failure. The Prescribing Information recommends urinalysis with cell count and Cr prior to treatment and monthly until 48 months after the last administration. Marked change in urine protein or cell counts, particularly if accompanied by a relative increase in Cr, is of concern and indicates the need to refer urgently to Nephrology. Mild abnormalities in UA are common in MS patients, including due to UTI and menses, so the significance of isolated abnormalities on urinalysis can be difficult to determine and requires clinical context. Miscellaneous autoimmune conditions have been reported rarely (approximately 0.1-0.2% of patients each): hemolytic , pancytopenia, acquired hemophilia, undifferentiated connective tissue disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, vitiligo, and retinal pigment epitheliopathy. Increased risk of infection presumably is due to immunosuppressive effects of Lemtrada. In clinical trials, infections were common; serious infections were uncommon (3%). Lemtrada administration should be delayed in patients with an ongoing significant infection. Herpes Virus In the clinical trials, Herpes virus infections occurred in 6% of Lemtrada-treated patients, and were serious in 0.1-0.2% of patients. Increased risk is greatest for 1-2 months after infusion but persists until CD4+ lymphocyte counts are >200/uL. Based on Lycke et al,7 only approximately 50% of patients have a return of CD4+ count >200/uL 9 months after Month 0 and Month 12 cycles. Just over 80% have returned to >200/uL 12 months after the Month 0 and Month 12 infusions. Therefore, we advise anti-herpes prophylaxis for 2 years beginning with the first cycle (assuming cycles are administered at Month 0 and Month 12). If there is a reason to discontinue prophylaxis sooner, it should be continued for at least 60 days after the last Lemtrada administration and until the CD4+ lymphocyte count is >200/uL. Patients should be screened for VZV immunity prior to initiation of Lemtrada. Patients who are VZV seronegative should receive the two-part Varivax vaccine, and Lemtrada dosing should be delayed until at least 6 weeks after vaccine administration. Human Papilloma Virus. HPV infections, including associated cervical dysplasia occur in 2% of Lemtrada-treated patients. Annual HPV screening is recommended. Tuberculosis. Active TB occurred extremely rarely in the clinical trials, but is a consideration in patients from endemic areas. Fungal infections. In the clinical trials, fungal infections, most often oral and vaginal candidiasis, were relatively common (12% of Lemtrada-treated patients). Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria meningitis has occurred in Lemtrada-treated patients. Patients should be advised to avoid foods that are potential sources (primarily unpasteurized dairy products). There is potential increased risk of malignancy, presumably due to immunosuppression with Lemtrada. Lemtrada should be administered with caution in patients with pre-existing or ongoing malignancy. Thyroid cancer (0.3% of patients). Routine exam should include thyroid palpation. Melanoma (0.3% of patients). Baseline and annual skin exams are recommended. Lymphoproliferative disorders. Monthly CBC provides some screening, and routine exam should include LN palpation. In the clinical trials, pneumonitis of varying severity and including hypersensitivity pneumonitis and pneumonitis with fibrosis occurred in 0.5% of Lemtrada treated patients. Patients reporting new pulmonary symptoms should be evaluated as indicated. Q: What is the effect on pregnancy and breastfeeding? Lemtrada is Pregnancy Category C. It may be directly toxic to the developing fetus. A pregnancy test should be obtained prior to Lemtrada administration, and women should be counseled to practice effective contraception during and for at least 4 months after administration. Autoantibodies that develop in women treated with Lemtrada can be transferred transplacentally to the fetus during pregnancy. It is not known whether Lemtrada is excreted in human milk. Therefore, we advise women not to breastfeed within 4 months of Lemtrada administration. Q: What precautions are needed for immunizations when patients are using Lemtrada? Complete necessary immunizations at least 6 weeks prior to initiation of Lemtrada treatment. NOTE: Do not administer live vaccines to patients treated with Lemtrada. Q: How much time should be allowed between therapies when switching to Lemtrada? There is no specific evidence for a washout period before instituting Lemtrada. At the Mellen Center, since the patients we will treat have highly active MS, we will minimize any washout period to avoid recurrence of disease activity during this period. A one month washout period for FDA approved therapies including natalizumab appears reasonable. Q: What is the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program for Lemtrada? Because of the safety concerns outlined above, the FDA mandated a REMS Program for Lemtrada, the components of which include: To prescribe Lemtrada, clinicians must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training (including passing a knowledge assessment). Patients must enroll in the program and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. Pharmacies must be certified with the program and must only dispense Lemtrada to certified healthcare facilities. Healthcare facilities must enroll in the program and verify that patients are authorized before infusing Lemtrada. Healthcare facilities must have on-site access to equipment and personnel trained to manage infusion reactions. Testing Gynecologic exam including screening for HPV and cervical dysplasia PPD or Quantiferon in patients from regions endemic for TB or with suspected exposure Prescriptions (patient to begin in am morning of infusion day 1) Cetirizine (Zyrtec) 10 mg PO daily for 14 days, beginning the morning of infusion Day 1 Ranitidine (Zantac) 150mg PO daily for 14 days, beginning the morning of infusion Day 1 Acyclovir (Valtrex) 200mg PO twice daily for 2 years (assuming cycles at Month 0 and Month 12), beginning the morning of infusion Day 1 Administer Lemtrada 12 mg IV daily on 5 consecutive days at Month 0 then 3 consecutive days at Month 12. Confirm patient took certirizine, ranitidine, and acyclovir Methylprednisolone (Solumedrol) 1000mg IV in 100ml 0.9% saline, infuse over 60 minutes Acetaminophen (Tylenol) 1000 mg PO every 4 hours as needed for fever, headache, itching Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 25-50 mg PO every 4 hours as needed for mild fever, itching 25-50 mg IV as needed for more severe rash, itching, or shortness of breath. Repeat 25-50 mg IV as needed for rash, itching or shortness of breath every 30 minutes up to 4 doses Lemtrada Using sterile technique, withdraw Lemtrada (12 mg, 1.2 mL) and inject into a 100-mI bag of 0.9% saline or D5W If not well tolerated, the infusion period may be extended, but the total infusion period on any day should not exceed 8 hours. If so, Lemtrada should be reconsidered Vital signs and monitoring for side effects Every 15 minutes for the first 2 hours of infusion then every 30 min. Every 30 min. for 2 hours after completion of infusion Discharge Discharge if stable after the 2-hour monitoring period. Extend the monitoring duration if indicated Advise patients that side effects can develop after the 2-hour monitoring period CBC with differential monthly until 48 months after the last dose Urinalysis with cell count monthly until 48 months after the last dose TSH every 3 months until 48 months after the last dose Annual gynecological exam including screening for HPV and cervical dysplasia It is appropriate to see patients in the office initially at least every 3 months, to evaluate for complications of therapy, verify clinical stabilization of MS disease activity, and to manage MS symptoms. Urgent office visits or emergent medical attention may be rarely indicated to evaluate for possible complications of therapy Brain MRI is generally performed at least every 6 months after treatment to monitor for disease activity, and as often as every 3 months in selected patients with very active disease prior to treatment Hersh CM, Cohen JA.

Several important practice guidelines updates for MRI in MS have been published recently, including the 2017 revised McDonald’s Criteria[1], Magnetic Resonance Imaging in MS network guidelines[2], and revised recommendations of the Consortium of MS Centers Task Force[3]. This document reflects updated recommendations per Mellen Center consensus based on review of the guidelines. A: When making the diagnosis of MS, brain and cervical spinal cord MRIs should be obtained in all cases unless specific contraindications. MRI is essential: to serve as a baseline evaluation and staging the disease process Q: Is an MRI required for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, or can other additional testing and clinical features suffice? A: Yes, MRI should be obtained in all patients unless there is a specific contraindication for obtaining the MRI (for example, presence of MRI-incompatible pacemaker or other electronic devices). In cases where MRIs cannot be obtained, we generally obtain as much supportive testing as possible. We are more cautious regarding the certainty of the diagnosis in such patients, and rely more heavily on lumbar puncture results and other supportive diagnostic testing results such as evoked potentials and optical coherence tomography. If the contraindication for MRI is removed at a later time, we would recommend obtaining an MRI at that point. Q: Do you ever diagnose MS in a patient with a normal MRI? A: Per 2017 McDonald criteria, in order to diagnose MS, there needs to be reasonable clinical suspicion, along with supportive MRI and paraclinical evidence. We would be hesitant to diagnosis MS in a patient with a good quality MRI (at least 1.5 Tesla magnet strength or above) showing a normal brain and spinal cord (cervical cord and thoracic cord). However, due to the potential limitations of conventional MRI, particularly with regard to grey matter pathology, there will be rare exceptions to this rule. In most cases, repeatedly normal imaging raises strong doubts about an MS diagnosis, particularly in a patient with long standing neurological disability. Q: When should an MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine be obtained? A: We recommend an initial cervical and thoracic spine MRI with and without contrast along with brain MRI in patients suspected of having MS, for diagnosis, to establish disease burden, and to monitor for asymptomatic spinal cord lesions[4,5]. Also, if symptoms or signs could be explained by spinal cord disease, then spinal cord MRI is required to evaluate for non-MS cord pathology. Spinal MRI provides increased specificity in patients with an abnormal brain MRI and increased sensitivity in patients with a negative brain MRI. This is particularly true in cases where there are non-specific white matter changes due to cerebrovascular risk factors and/or spinal cord compression from degenerative disc disease. Presence of spinal cord lesions have been shown to predict long term disability in patients with CIS and early RRMS[6,7] and therefore this is an important factor in treatment planning. Due to potential issues of artifact and patient motion, the quality of scans is particularly important with spinal MRI. Typically, higher field strengths (1.5 Tesla or higher) are preferred for spinal cord MRI. Routine follow up scans of spinal cord for disease monitoring purposes is recommended but can be challenging due to small anatomical area involved and physiological artifacts that commonly affect quality of the scans. Q: In which circumstances should a follow-up MRI scan be obtained? A: It can be useful to monitor sub-clinical disease as well as response to therapy by obtaining MRIs periodically during the course of routine follow up care of MS patients. We obtain repeat MRI in the following circumstances: Patients with an MRI typical for MS, in whom we are initiating disease modifying therapy. This serves as a baseline for monitoring therapy. Patients on disease modifying therapy. MRI for re-establishing baseline can be obtained at 6 months after disease modifying therapy initiation, and thereafter every 6-12 months individualized according to disease severity, activity when disease modifying therapies are started, as well as type of disease modifying medication (please see the individual Mellen Approaches for the timing of onset of therapeutic effect with each therapy). Patients with clinically isolated syndrome, radiologically isolated syndrome who need MRI follow up for diagnosis. MS patients who decline therapy, but need monitoring to determine disease activity for future treatment recommendations. Patients with a very active initial MRI in which close follow up is needed to assess for radiological stabilization after starting treatment. Q: Do you recommend an MRI during a relapse of MS? A: MRIs are not required to diagnose relapses. We do not generally obtain an MRI of the brain or spinal cord during an MS relapse if the symptoms and signs are consistent with MS and there are no atypical features. The exceptions to this rule would be if the patient is on immunomodulating therapies that increase the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). In addition, if the patient has an altered level of consciousness or other problems such as a severe headache, sudden stroke-like onset, etc., then we would obtain an MRI as soon as possible. Patients whom we are considering switching disease modifying therapy should also obtain MRIs. Q: What is the Mellen approach to a radiologically-isolated syndrome (RIS), or the incidental finding of classic MS by MRI including enhancing lesions with no clinical symptoms or mild or atypical symptoms? A: We recommend clinical and imaging follow-up in these situations, depending on the extent and inflammatory nature of the findings. A portion of these individuals will go on to develop clinical signs and symptoms of MS given a long enough time period. A longitudinal follow up study showed that RIS patients have approximately a one in three chance of converting to MS by year 5[8]. The presence of other factors, such as high brain lesion burden, brainstem or cerebellum lesions, spinal cord lesions, contrast-enhancing lesions, CSF oligoclonal bands, or abnormal visual evoked potentials, increase the likelihood of developing clinically definite MS[5], for which treatment with disease modifying therapy may be considered, with benefits and risks to be carefully weighed. Q: What are the technical requirements for obtaining an MRI of the brain and spine? A: In compliance with published Consortium of MS Centers MRI standardize guidelines, all MRIs should be obtained on machines of at least 1.5 Tesla strength. At Mellen Center, we prefer all MRIs to be performed on 3 Tesla strength machines, especially for spinal cord MRI as higher field strength MRI improves resolution and may increase yield in terms of lesion counts. If 3D acquisition possible: 3D sagittal T2 FLAIR, 3D T2 weighted sequence, 2D axial diffusion weighted sequence, 3D T1 MPRAGE, axial T1 spin echo post-contrast sequence (if needed). If unable to perform 3D: 2D axial and sagittal FLAIR, axial fast spin echo T2-weighted sequence, 2D axial diffusion weighted sequence, sagittal T1 spin echo sequence, axial T1 weighted post-contrast sequence (if needed). Sagittal T2 weighted sequence, sagittal STIR sequence, sagittal T1 weighted sequence, axial T1 weighted sequence, axial T2 weighted sequence, axial and sagittal T1 weighted post-contrast sequences (if needed) Detailed parameters are available on Consortium of MS Centers website [3]. We further recommend that follow-up MRIs be obtained on the same magnet and with similar software, to allow for ‘apples to apples’ comparisons rather than attempting comparing slices obtained with gaps to those obtained with no gaps, etc. If contrast is administered for brain MRI, the same dose can be used for post-contrast imaging in the spinal cord as well. For quantitative analysis such as tissue volume and lesion size, generally 3D sequences are optimal. Volumetric analysis is typically best accomplished using a 3D T2 FLAIR and T1 MPRAGE or equivalent sequence. Lower field open-MRI scanners are not recommended except in special circumstances (i.e. claustrophobia, implanted devices). Q: What are the technical requirements for obtaining an MRI of the orbit? Orbit MRI is not required in asymptomatic patients. However, this may be necessary to confirm optic neuritis or evaluate for other etiologies involving the visual system (e.g., sarcoidosis, compressive lesions, neuromyelitis optica). Coronal STIR or fat-suppressed T2, and post-contrast fat-suppressed T1 with coverage through optic chiasm are the minimal sequences recommended in the Consortium of MS Centers guidelines [3]. Q: What is the role of contrast agents and their safety? A: In general contrast agents are safe and we prefer to obtain MRI of the brain and spinal cord with a gadolinium-based contrast agent as an initial diagnostic strategy. Contrast-enhancing lesions assist in satisfying diagnostic criteria of dissemination in time in patients suspected of having MS. They are validated imaging biomarkers of new inflammatory activity, and assist in ensuring that alternative diagnoses are thoroughly evaluated. The use of IV contrast agents increases the yield of MRI in detecting active lesions and new T2 lesions. Recent studies have demonstrated that the presence of new or enlarging T2 lesions on follow up scans is sufficient as a surrogate for subclinical disease activity and progression [9], and did not perform worse than post-contrast T1 scans at detecting interval change [10]. Also, standardized MRI protocols and high-quality comparable scans between follow-ups increase sensitivity for the evaluation of disease progression.  Contrast can cause allergic reactions that should be treated per standard protocols. Contrast should be generally avoided in pregnancy, although there are no reported adverse effects of contrast on the fetus. It is recommended that a serum creatinine be obtained in individuals as indicated by institutional and American College of Radiology guidelines. We follow our institution’s policy for hydration and use of contrast in these patients, which are based on age, GFR, and the presence of risk factors such as diabetes, known renal disease, etc. Contrast can rarely cause nephrogenic sclerosing fibrosis, but this is seen only in patients with severe renal disease and only in a small fraction of patients treated with contrast. Although gadolinium deposition has been reported in brain and other tissues of patients with normal renal function following administration of contrast, there are no known diseases or disorders associated with this finding [11]. We only use macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agents (as opposed to linear agents) due to its lower risk of associated gadolinium deposition in body tissues. Of note, there are no current FDA restrictions on gadolinium-based contrast agent use. The FDA is currently investigating the risk associated with brain deposits following repeated doses of gadolinium-based contrast agents for MRI, and we await further guidance from the FDA on this issue. Our current approach is to carefully assess the risks and benefit for MRI imaging with contrast and where possible to defer contrast use. For example, in established MS patients with routine MRI scans every 6-12 months, new T2 lesions and/or enlarged T2 lesions can serve as indicators of disease activity. Q: Can you obtain an MRI in pregnancy or in a woman who is breast feeding? A: According to the most recent American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology guidelines [12], there are no precautions or contraindications for non-contrast MRI in pregnant women. There are very rare situations that require obtaining an MRI in a pregnant woman with MS. As mentioned above, the use of contrast is generally avoided during pregnancy, although there is not an absolute contraindication to its use. As very small amounts of gadolinium (<0.04% of the administered dose) is excreted into breast milk, patients who are breast feeding do not need to express their milk after receiving contrast and can continue breast feeding as usual. Q: Can you perform MRI in MS patients with intrathecal pumps and other implanted devices? A: We have a protocol for scanning patients who have implanted baclofen pumps. In general, the pump is deactivated by the MRI, and then restarts automatically, but this should always be checked by qualified personnel after the MRI scan. There are conditional protocols that can allow patients with certain deep brain, spine, vagal nerve and bladder stimulators to have MRI scans using specifically approved protocols. We recommend significant caution in scanning these individuals. MRI staff need to review the information for each specific device with regards to MRI compatibility, as protocols and restrictions are evolving with time. Q: When do you scan patients on natalizumab or other immunomodulating therapies that may increase the risk of PML? What is the protocol you recommend? A: At each natalizumab infusion visit the TOUCH program requires questioning about new symptoms which might indicate the presence of PML. Early detection of PML improves survival and neurological functional outcomes. We perform MRI of the brain with and without contrast as soon as possible if there are clinical changes of concern in such patients. For routine surveillance, we also obtain routine brain MRIs to assess for clinical efficacy and monitor for PML (for low risk patients, every 6-12 months, for high risk patients, every 3-4 months). As other immunomodulating therapies that may increase PML risk are used, a similar approach should be used. We recommend at least a 3D sagittal FLAIR sequence (or 2D axial and sagittal FLAIR sequence), and a 2D axial diffusion weighted sequence; post-contrast T1 images may be obtained depending on clinical and radiographic suspicion for PML, and/or PML-related immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes. No, but children younger than 9 years old may require general anesthesia for sedation.

There are several different types of MS, including relapsing-remitting, progressive and fulminant. The severity of your condition depends on the type of MS you have. Symptoms of MS can include numbness, difficulty walking, fatigue and weakness in one or more body part. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system disorder — that is, it affects the brain and spinal cord and spares the nerves and muscles that leave the spinal cord. MS is an inflammatory disorder in which infection-fighting white blood cells enter the nervous system and cause injury. It is a demyelinating disorder because the myelin sheath that protects nerves is stripped off during inflammation. When this happens, the nerves cannot conduct electricity as well as they should, causing various symptoms. Symptoms may be the type that come and go over time (relapsing-remitting MS) or progress over time (progressive MS). MS can happen to just about anyone and is long-term. Are there different types of multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS varies from patient to patient so that each individual has their own set of symptoms, problems, and their own course. There are people who have MS so mildly that they never even know that they have it. Of course, there are also others that have it severely. It is really a spectrum that ranges from mild to severe. An international panel of experts developed a classification of MS in 1999 that most neurologists use today: : Patients have attacks of symptoms/signs, with or without recovery, but between attacks have no interval worsening. : This is often after a few years of relapsing-remitting MS. The pattern changes from a relapsing pattern to progressive in between attacks, usually with fewer attacks. : This involves a gradual onset from the beginning and no attacks. : This is a rare form, and begins with a progressive course, while later developing attacks. : This is a rare form, and is very severe, rapidly progressive MS. Is there such a thing as benign multiple sclerosis (MS)? The term, ""benign MS,"" is not part of the international classification. It is used when people have had MS for many years without developing significant measurable disability. Recent studies have shown that it cannot be predicted early in the disease and so the term can only really be used retrospectively, after people have done very well with MS for many years. What are the risk factors of multiple sclerosis (MS)? There has been extensive research about MS over the past 50 years. While we still do not know the cause of MS, we know that it is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that occurs in people with a tendency to such a problem. We know that about 350,000 people in the United States have MS, about one in a 1,000 people. We know that it is more common further north and south of the equator, though we are still unsure why this is. Females tend to get MS about three times as often as males, a rate which is similar to other immune diseases. It is more common in Caucasians, but can occur in other populations. It is not contagious nor is it infectious. There may be a link with reduced vitamin D levels and perhaps with decreased sun exposure. We know that there is a genetic component to MS. Having a mother or father with MS increases the risk of having MS to about 3 to 5% lifetime, and having an identical twin with MS increases the risk to about 30%. However, many people with MS have no close family members with the disease. There is nothing that an individual with MS either did to cause the disease to happen, or can avoid to stop the disease from following its natural course. We know that emotional stress may increase the symptoms of MS. We also know that attacks of MS are more likely after infections. There does not seem to be any association with physical trauma or surgical procedures and MS, nor do these seem to make MS worse. There has been widespread research about MS over the past 50 years. We do not know the cause of MS, but do know that it is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that occurs in people with a tendency to such a problem. We know that about 350,000 people in the United States have MS, about 1 in 1,000 people. We know that it is more common further north and south of the equator. Although we are still unsure exactly why this is. Females tend to get MS about three times as often as males, a rate similar to other immune diseases. MS is more common in Caucasians, but can occur in other populations. It is not contagious, nor is it infectious. Did I do anything to bring on the multiple sclerosis (MS) or make it worse? As far as we know there are no activities that specifically cause MS or make it worse. People with MS may not tolerate heat as well as they used to and may need to avoid particularly hot or humid situations. There is evidence that having infections makes having an exacerbation of MS more likely. There does not appear to be a link to trauma. However, emotional stress has been linked to a worsening of MS symptoms. Having MS is not the fault of people who have it; it can happen to anyone. Is there anything new that we know about multiple sclerosis (MS)? Multiple sclerosis is being studied actively in many research institutions around the world, and new knowledge is being added constantly. For example, we now know that even with early MS, the nerve fibers themselves (the axons) are affected more than we knew before. We know from MRI studies that new lesions (abnormal areas in the brain or spinal cord) occur about 5 to10 times as often as people with MS have new symptoms; that is, much of the disease occurs 'under the radar scope'. We know that myelin repair occurs in the central nervous system all the time. Some groups feel there are different types of immune or pathological processes going on that we call MS, and perhaps MS may be many different disorders that we have lumped together. Do any other diseases look like multiple sclerosis (MS)? When neurologists evaluate MS they are also considering other diagnoses. While MS is the most likely cause of typical white matter changes and symptoms in an otherwise healthy young person, there are some other diseases that we consider and occasionally diagnose. These include a vitamin B12 deficiency that can cause an MS-like illness, and rarely, , which may have symptoms that suggest MS. The MRI is very useful in ruling out many other disorders that could be confused with MS, and the blood tests and spinal fluid may also be helpful in diagnosing other diseases. What are some early symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS varies from person to person so there is no 'standard' set of symptoms for MS. However, we know that common symptoms of MS include: Numbness or tingling in various parts of the body. Lhermitte's phenomenon, a symptom in which people feel electrical tingling or shocks down their back, arms or legs when they bend their neck forwards. Urinary symptoms, such as hesitancy when trying to urinate, or a feeling of urgency (when you have to go, you have to go). There is no way to predict which symptoms one person might develop. MS varies from person to person so there is no ‘standard’ set of symptoms for MS. However we know that common symptoms of MS include numbness or tingling in various parts of the body, weakness of one or more parts of the body, walking difficulties, dizziness, fatigue, visual blurring and occasionally double vision. Patients may also have a symptom called Lhermitte’s phenomenon, in which they feel electrical tingling or shocks down their back, arms or legs when they bend their neck forwards. Sometimes people notice hesitancy when they try to urinate or may find that 'when they have to go, they have to go’. There is no way to predict which symptoms one person might develop. The usual course of MS is to have periods of time where things are relatively stable, followed by times when, over a few days or weeks, new symptoms occur or old symptoms worsen. This relatively rapid worsening is known as an exacerbation (also known as an attack, or a relapse). In others with MS, there may be a tendency to progress in that symptoms gradually worsen over time (months to years). MS varies from patient to patient so that each individual has their own set of symptoms, problems, and their own course. There are people who have MS so mildly that they never even know that they have it. Of course, there are also others that have it severely. It is really a spectrum that ranges from mild to severe. An international panel of experts developed a classification of MS in 1999 that most neurologists use today. : Patients have attacks of symptoms/signs, with or without recovery, but between attacks have no interval worsening. : This is often after a few years of relapsing-remitting MS. The pattern changes from a relapsing pattern to progressive in between attacks, usually with fewer attacks. : Gradual onset from the beginning, no attacks. : This is a rare form, and begins with a progressive course, while later developing attacks. : Very severe, rapidly progressive MS. This is a rare form of MS. Why do I have symptoms with multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS damages the myelin sheath surrounding the nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord. Scarring from this damage can block or slow nerve impulses in areas of the brain (neurological damage). As a direct result of MS, you may lack coordination and feel tired, and have weakness, involuntary movements, muscle stiffness (spasticity), or pain. Symptoms such as these are called ""primary symptoms."" Primary symptoms of MS can make you move less. As a result, you may feel tightness, pain and weakness, especially in the muscles and joints. These symptoms, which are not a direct result of MS, are called ""secondary symptoms."" Why do people with multiple sclerosis (MS) have depression? is very common in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In fact, symptoms of depression severe enough to require medical intervention affect up to half of all people with MS at some point during their illness. Depression may be the result of a difficult situation or stress. It is easy to understand how having MS, with its potential for progressing to permanent disability, can bring on depression. Depression might be actually caused by MS. MS may affect the insulating myelin that surrounds nerves which transmit signals affecting mood. Depression is also a side effect of some drugs used to treat MS, such as steroids or interferon. How does heat or humidity impact people with multiple sclerosis (MS)? Heat or high humidity can cause many people with to experience a temporary worsening of their symptoms. Doctors believe that this occurs because heat causes nerves (whose myelin covering has been removed by MS) to conduct electrical signals even less efficiently. For reasons that are not well understood, extremely cold temperatures and changes in temperature can also cause MS symptoms, usually , to flare. Reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional.

SPMS with active disease refers to those patients who are in a progressive phase of the disease and continue to have clinical relapses. In the clinical trials, siponimod appeared to have the most benefit for patients who were younger, had gadolinium-enhancing lesions, lower disability, and shorter disease duration. The benefit of siponimod in patients with SPMS without relapses is less clear. Siponimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P) modulator that selectively binds the S1P subtypes 1 and 5. It acts as a functional antagonist, as binding to S1P1 induces receptor internalization and degradation in T and B cells. The ultimate result is prevention of lymphocyte egress from the lymphoid tissue into the central nervous system (CNS). Additionally, preclinical studies have shown that siponimod inhibits demyelination, and attenuates the production of TNFα, IL-6, and IL-17 by astrocytes and microglia. This suggests that siponimod may act directly on the CNS in addition to its role in decreasing circulating lymphocytes. Siponimod has a rapid onset of action, and reduces circulating T and B cells within 4-6 hours. Its half-life is approximately 30 hours. Circulating lymphocytes counts recover within a week after treatment discontinuation. Complete elimination of siponimod from the body takes approximately 10 days. Siponimod is metabolized in the liver through the Cytochrome P450 system (primarily through CYP2C9, subsequently by CYP3A4). Genetic variants to the CYP2C9 enzyme can slow siponimod metabolism. This is important in determining the correct dose and titration schedule for a given patient, as patients with the *3 variant of CYP2C9 demonstrated slower rates of drug metabolism. Specifically, heterozygotes with CYP2C9 *3 have moderately slowed metabolism, and homozygotes with CYP2C9 *3/*3 have severely impaired metabolism. As a result, CYP2C9 *3 heterozygotes should follow a lower dose titration and lower final dose; CYP2C9 *3/*3 genotype is a contraindication to siponimod. Does siponimod have any significant drug interactions? While siponimod does not induce nor inhibit the CYP450 system, its metabolism can be affected by medications that are CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers. For example, a patient who takes warfarin, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, may have increased levels of siponimod. We recommend a careful review of a patient’s medication list, and would use siponimod cautiously in patients who take CYP450 modulators. What did the clinical trials of siponimod for MS show? Siponimod was approved for treatment of MS based on the results of two clinical trials. The first was , which was a phase II randomized, double-blind, dose-finding, placebo comparison trial for patients with RRMS. This showed that siponimod at a dose of 2mg approached peak efficacy as measured by a reduction in the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions or new enhancing lesions. It also showed that the medication had favorable tolerability and safety. While there were two significant cardiovascular adverse events, both of these patients had preexisting cardiac risk factors, and both of these events occurred after drug discontinuation and washout. The safety 24-month extension study did not identify any new serious safety signals compared to the original study. The second study was EXPAND, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial of patients with SPMS. EXPAND demonstrated that siponimod reduced the risk of confirmed disability worsening in patients with SPMS by 21%, reduced the risk of relapses compared to placebo by 55%, and slowed the rate of radiographic disease activity and brain atrophy. The side effects of siponimod that occurred in greater than 10% of patients in clinical trials are as follows: Siponimod, similar to other S1P modulators, can lead to temporarily bradycardia immediately following the first dose, although a five-day titration appears to mitigate first-dose bradycardia. There were no symptomatic bradycardic events or adverse reactions, nor clinically significant changes in baseline blood pressure observed in the trials. Siponimod also induced cardiac conduction abnormalities in 3% of patients in clinical trials, including first- and second-degree AV block. Approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials experienced increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). 2% of siponimod patients developed macular edema, compared to less than 1% of placebo patients. In the clinical trial EXPAND, macular edema was seen in 2% of siponimod patients compared to <1% of placebo patients. Patients with a prior history of uveitis and patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of macular edema when taking siponimod. While this is not an absolute contraindication, we recommend obtaining a baseline ophthalmologic evaluation. We typically complete this using optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT monitoring for macular edema is only done if symptoms suggestive possible macular edema. OCT monitoring for macular edema is only done if symptoms suggestive possible macular edema. Is siponimod associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)? There have been no cases of PML reported in patients treated with siponimod, although PML has been associated with another S1P modulator fingolimod. Infingolimod the rate of PML is very low. . Accordingly, a risk of PML during siponimod treatment cannot be excluded. We believe that if PML is to develop in patients taking siponimod, it will occur at the same low rate as was seen in fingolimod. Currently, we do not feel that positive JC virus serology should preclude treatment with siponimod. Clinical trials showed that the overall rate of infections was comparable between siponimod and placebo group (49.0% vs 49.1%, respectively), and the rate of serious infection was slightly increased for the siponimod group compared to placebo (2.9% vs 2.5%). The siponimod group had a higher rate of herpetic infections (including VZV), , upper respiratory infection, and fungal skin infection. While not reported for siponimod, rare cases of cryptococcal meningitis have been reported in patients taking fingolimod, another S1P modulator. Siponimod reduces the circulating absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), which is its intended pharmacodynamics effect. The magnitude of reduction is dose-dependent, and is approximately 20-30%. Lymphopenia (defined as ALC < 200/µL) occurred in 1% of patients, however there is no correlation between lymphopenia and an increased risk of infections, including PML. Contraindications to siponimod include patients homozygous for the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype; significant heart rhythm or conduction abnormalities (unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker); or in the past six months has had myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, TIA, decompensated heart failure, or Class III or IV heart failure.   Siponimod is a once-daily oral medication that follows an initial titration. Prior to starting the medication, CYP2C9 genotype must be tested in order to determine how the drug will be metabolized for a specific patient. This determines the titration strategy and target dosage. If a titration dose is missed for more than 24 hours, treatment should be restarted with Day 1 of the titration schedule. If treatment is interrupted for more than 4 days, patients should repeat the titration. For patients with CYP2C9 Genotypes *1/*1, *1/*2, or *2/*2: initiate siponimod therapy with the standard 5-day titration, followed by the maintenance dose of 2 mg taken once daily beginning on day 6. This standard titration should be prescribed using the starter pack (which includes 12 pills of 0.25mg), followed by a separate prescription for the 2mg maintenance pills. Titration for wild-type CYP2C9 Genotypes (*1/*1, *1/*2, or *2/*2) For patients with CYP2C9 Genotypes *1/*3, or *2/*3: initiate siponimod therapy with an altered 4-day titration, followed by the maintenance dose of 1 mg taken once daily beginning on day 5. The titration should be given as a prescription for siponimod 0.25 mg x 7 pills, followed by a separate prescription for the 1mg maintenance dose. Titration for heterozygote CYP2C9 Genotypes (*1/*3, or *2/*3) Siponimod is contraindicated for patients with the *3/*3 CYP2C9 genotype due to dangerously prolonged siponimod metabolism. Prior to starting treatment with siponimod, we recommend the following tests: this can be done in a patient’s home at no cost to the patient through the pharmaceutical company Virus IgG antibodies (VZV), and we recommend vaccinating VZV antibody-negative patients prior to starting treatment OCT to screen for macular edema, can also consider ophthalmologic examination to screen for asymptomatic uveitis It is also recommended that patients not have active infections when starting siponimod Is monitoring required during the first dose like with fingolimod? For the majority of patients, first dose observation is not necessary. First-dose 6 hour monitoring is recommended for patients who have a history of myocardial infarction, heart failure, sinus bradycardia (HR < 55 bpm), or first- or second-degree AV block as detected on baseline EKG. This monitoring should include hourly measurements of pulse and blood pressure, as well as an EKG at the end of the observation period. What monitoring is done during siponimod treatment? Although routine monitoring is not stipulated in the prescribing information, we at the Mellen Center recommend measuring blood pressure during office visits, and checking CBC with differential and LFTs 3-6 months after starting treatment, then every 6-12 months while on the medication. On these labs, we expect to see a 20-30% reduction in ALC, but we monitor for lymphopenia (ALC < 200/µL) and elevated ALT. For any significant abnormalities, more frequent monitoring is reasonable. Currently, there are no data to suggest that the lymphopenia produced by siponimod leads to a higher risk of infection. We recommend routine clinical monitoring for infections for all siponimod patients, especially for those who develop ALC < 200/µL with concomitant leukopenia, or for patients with a history of frequent infections. For other S1P modulators such as fingolimod, rebound disease activity may occur after drug discontinuation. While this phenomenon was not seen in the siponimod clinical trials, we consider it a potential risk, and therefore patients should be monitored closely for relapses, MRI lesion activity, or disability worsening after stopping the drug. Additionally, rare cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) have occurred in patients receiving other S1P modulators, though this has not yet been reported in siponimod patients. It is therefore considered a potential risk, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any patient who develops a new neurologic symptom or deficit. Although there are no data on the safety of siponimod in pregnant woman, siponimod has been shown to cause teratogenicity in various animal models. Therefore, female patients of childbearing potential should use effective contraceptive methods while on siponimod, and wait at least 2 months (based on the half-life of the drug) after the last siponimod dose before attempting to conceive. There are currently no data on the safety of siponimod on the breastfed infant, however animal studies have shown that the medication is secreted into breast milk. A discussion of the risks and benefits of breastfeeding while on siponimod should occur with each patient individually. Which vaccines should a patient receive while on siponimod? Prior to starting siponimod therapy, VZV antibodies should be checked, and patients who are antibody-negative should receive VZV vaccination. After starting siponimod, patients should receive all age-appropriate vaccines, including the annual flu vaccine, though we recommend avoiding any live vaccines. Killed or inactivated vaccines are considered to be relatively safe.

Currency in USD MediciNova Receives Notice of Allowance for New Patent Covering the Combination of MN-166 (ibudilast) and Riluzole for the Treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) in Japan LA JOLLA, Calif., Jan. 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MediciNova, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company traded on the NASDAQ Global Market (NASDAQ:MNOV) and the JASDAQ Market of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Code Number: 4875), today announced that it has received a Notice of Allowance from the Japan Patent Office for a pending patent application which covers the combination of MN-166 (ibudilast) and riluzole for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Once issued, the patent maturing from this allowed patent application is expected to expire no earlier than November 2035. The allowed claims cover the combination of MN-166 (ibudilast) and riluzole for alleviating the negative effects of ALS, treating a patient diagnosed with ALS, and slowing progression of disease in a patient diagnosed with ALS. The allowed claims cover a wide range of doses and dosing regimens for both MN-166 (ibudilast) and riluzole. Yuichi Iwaki, MD, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of MediciNova, Inc., commented, ""We are very pleased to receive notice that this new patent will be granted. We believe it could substantially increase the potential value of MN-166 as patients are using the combination of MN-166 and riluzole in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial in ALS. Previously, a similar patent was granted in the U.S., the U.S. FDA granted both orphan-drug designation and fast-track designation to MN-166 for the treatment of ALS, and the European Commission granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation to MN-166 for the treatment of ALS."" About ALS Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. The nerves lose the ability to trigger specific muscles, which causes the muscles to become weak. As a result, ALS affects voluntary movement and patients in the later stages of the disease may become completely paralyzed. Life expectancy of an ALS patient is usually 2-5 years. According to the ALS Association, there are approximately 20,000 ALS patients in the U.S. and approximately 5,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with ALS each year. About MN-166 (ibudilast) MN-166 (ibudilast) is a first-in-class, orally bioavailable, small molecule macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) inhibitor and phosphodiesterase (PDE) -4 and -10 inhibitor that suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines and promotes neurotrophic factors. Our earlier human studies demonstrated significant reductions of serum MIF level after treatment with MN-166 (ibudilast). It also attenuates activated glial cells, which play a major role in certain neurological conditions. MN-166 (ibudilast)'s anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective actions have been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies, which provide the rationale for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurological diseases such as glioblastoma (GBM), and substance abuse/addiction. MediciNova is developing MN-166 for ALS, progressive MS and other neurological conditions such as degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), glioblastoma, substance abuse/addiction, and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, as well as prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19. MediciNova has a portfolio of patents which covers the use of MN-166 (ibudilast) to treat various diseases including ALS, progressive MS, and drug addiction.

Once issued, the patent maturing from this allowed patent application is expected to expire no earlier than October 2039.  The allowed claims cover a method of (i) alleviating the negative effects of progressive multiple sclerosis, (ii) treating progressive multiple sclerosis, or (iii) slowing the progression of progressive multiple sclerosis by administering MN-166 (ibudilast) and interferon-beta in separate dosage forms.   The allowed claims specifically cover the treatment of both primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). The allowed claims cover a wide range of doses of both MN-166 (ibudilast) and interferon-beta and a range of different dosing frequencies for each medication.Yuichi Iwaki, MD, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of MediciNova, Inc., commented, ""We are very pleased to receive notice that this new patent will be granted. Our analysis of the data from our completed Phase 2b trial in progressive MS indicated that there may be a synergistic effect of the combination of MN-166 and interferon-beta which could result in an even lower risk of disability progression compared to the risk reduction for MN-166 alone. We believe this patent could substantially increase the potential value of MN-166 as it provides more options for further development and commercialization.""About Progressive Multiple SclerosisAccording to the National MS Society, MS affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide. Approximately 85% of MS patients are initially diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS). Many RRMS patients will eventually transition into secondary progressive MS (SPMS) in which there are fewer or no relapses but gradual worsening of neurologic function. Approximately 15% of MS patients are diagnosed with primary progressive MS (PPMS) at onset and exhibit gradually increasing disability in walking, vision, mental acuity, and other bodily functions without experiencing relapses or remissions. Current therapies for MS affect the inflammatory response, but provide limited benefit for the neurodegeneration seen in progressive MS. There is a significant unmet medical need for agents that may provide neuroprotection in progressive MS.About MN-166 (ibudilast) MN-166 (ibudilast) is a first-in-class, orally bioavailable, small molecule macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) inhibitor and phosphodiesterase (PDE) -4 and -10 inhibitor that suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines and promotes neurotrophic factors.

Approximately 250,000 to 350,000 people have been diagnosed with M.S. in the United States (Schoenstadt, 2006). Every week, 200 new people are diagnosed with M.S. in our country (National MS Society, n.d.). M.S. can affect each person differently. Damage to the myelin in the Central Nervous System and nerve fibers disturb the signals sent between the brain and spinal cord to other parts of the body causing the primary symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (National MS Society, n.d.)Symptoms can come and go without any warning. An idea on how to help people suffering from M.S. is to have a dietitian either come to an M.S. housing building or support group, and introduce a healthy, nutritious diet that will help decrease the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis. There are many diets out there that can help reduce symptoms and weight. Using a dietitian to introduce a healthy diet to those with M.S. can be very beneficial because it can decrease their pain and exacerbations, and improve the quality of their lives. There are four different types of M.S. that people can have. They are relapsing- remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS) and progressive-relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (PRMS) (National MS Society, n.d.). RRMS is when patients have relapses followed by periods of recovery (Mayo Clinic, 2012). SPMS occurs when there are relapses and partial recoveries, but the disability progressively gets worse until a steady progression of disability replaces cycles of exacerbations (Mayo Clinic, 2012). PPMS is when the disease progresses slowly and steadily from start with no periods of remissions (Mayo Clinic, 2012). Finally, PRMS is a rare type of M.S. where people experience both steadily worsening symptoms and attacks during times of remission (Mayo Clinic, 2012). To people who have Multiple Sclerosis, being diagnosed with any one of these types can be depressing. People with Multiple Sclerosis often suffer with extreme pain. My Mom has been living with M.S. for over 15 years now and she struggles with severe back pain every day. She is currently seeing a pain management doctor to help relieve some of her pain. M.S. patients can have pain in two different areas, which are neuropathic and musculoskeletal. Neuropathic pain is caused by the disruption in how the nerves carry messages within the brain and spinal cord (Multiple Sclerosis Trust, 2012).Musculoskeletal pain is from damage to muscles, tendons, ligaments, and soft tissue (Multiple Sclerosis Trust, 2012).Even with the use of pain medication, the pain associated with M.S. can be very hard to deal with. There are certain foods that can reduce inflammation and pain in people who have M.S. Anything that can lessen or stop the use of pain medication would be valuable to patients. Multiple Sclerosis affects a person’s brain and spinal cord causing a variety of troubling symptoms. The most common symptoms of M.S. are pain, fatigue, numbness, poor motor skills and vision problems. There are also many other symptoms that can trouble those who suffer from M.S. Other common symptoms are trouble walking, bladder, bowel dysfunction, dizziness, depression, and spasticity. Through diet and exercise, people with M.S. can improve some of those problems and lead a healthier, more productive life. A dietitian can help them focus on the foods and exercises that will eliminate or reduce the symptoms that bother them the most. M.S. patients struggle their whole lives dealing with exacerbations. They never know when one will come and how long it will last for. During an exacerbation, a lot of different problems can occur.

This disease starts as an auto-immune disease in which CD4 T cells cross the blood brain barrier and attack myelin sheaths of olygodendrocytes resulting in demyelination (Gandhi et al., 2010; Lund et al., 2013). Initially this is a transient process and re-myelination occurs, so initial stage of the disease is characterized by neurological dysfunctions that eventually recover. However this re-myelination is not permanent (Compston and Coles, 2008; Wakerley et al., 2012). The continuous immune attacks cause serious pathological changes of myelin sheaths hence disease progression and development of serious disabilities . (Makris et al., 2013; Wakerley et al., 2012; Hafler, 2004; Nylander and Hafler, 2012; Eshaghi et al., 2013). Peak age of the initial diagnosis of MS is 30 and the disease progress overtime causing a in decline in health and even mortality (Makris et al., 2013). Though it is subjective the average decrease in life expectancy of a patient with MS is 5 to 10 years after the disease is being diagnosed (Keegan and Noseworthy, 2002). Disabilities caused by the disease vary between patients and depend on the abnormalities of the neuronal track that is affected (Leray et al., 2010). Some disabilities include numbness, muscle...

MS affects approximately 400,000 people in the United States alone. The onset of MS is usually between 20 and 40 years of age and is more common in women; men may have a more severe progressive course (Luzzio, 2013). Life expectancy is shortened in persons with MS, and the survival rate is linked to disability. Death usually results from secondary complications but can also be due to primary complications unrelated to MS. The occurrence rate of MS is affected by gene-environment interactions in susceptible individuals (Huether & McCance, 2012). Definition of Disorder is a progressive, inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which can affect the peripheral nervous system (PNS) as well. This disorder affects movements, sensation, and bodily functions (National Society [NMSS], 2012). There are several types of MS, these include: mixed (general), spinal, and cerebellar. General MS affects both the CNS and PNS, while spinal and cerebellar affect the CNS.

This damage to the nerve cells causes many problems for the patient including weakness, muscle stiffness, poor coordination and balance, tingling, numbness, tremors, blurred vision, slurred speech, and memory and concentration problems (Bren) There are three different versions of (“What is MS?”). The least severe being relapsing-remitting; this occurs when a person has an attack and then there are no further symptoms until there is a relapse or another flare up of the disease (Bren). The next kind is called primary progressive; this is where the disease and the symptoms just worsen with time, each attack building on the previous (Bren). The final type is secondary progressive and this is a combination of relapsing-remitting first which eventually will become progressive (Bren).

dc235da3-fec1-4305-8ae1-7dc2d3c9ed75,"The Importance of Long-Term Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis The Importance of Long-Term Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment with a long-term, is crucial for most patients with MS, since disease activity and damage continues within the CNS even when no new symptoms are present. When a patient begins a treatment regimen early in his or her disease course, disease activity is slowed. This not only reduces the number and severity of symptom flare-ups, as well as delays the progression of the disease (and possibly delays any related disability), but also reduces the number of active lesions that appear on an MRI. A 21-year prospective study of individuals (with relapsing-remitting MS) who began therapy early in the disease found that they experienced a longer lifespan than those who did not begin treatment as early. Of those who didn’t start treatment early, MS-related pulmonary infection was the most common cause of mortality over the 21-year period. Previously, all but one* of the approved treatments were only available for individuals with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) – largely for those with RRMS – and some are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome, prior to the diagnosis of MS. In 2017, Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab) was approved for two types of MS: relapsing forms of MS (RMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS). This is the first time that a medication for MS had been approved for these two types of the disease, and the first time that any medication had been approved to treat PPMS. Ocrevus is given via intravenous (IV) infusion every six months. Additionally, in 2019, Mayzent® (siponimod) oral tablets, Mavenclad® (cladribine) oral tablets, and Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate) oral capsules were approved to treat RMS as well as active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), which is a more steady form of MS that follows RRMS, but still has relapses. While these are the only DMTs to be approved in recent years for active SPMS, the FDA is allowing some of the previously approved DMTs to add active SPMS to their indications. Mayzent and Vumerity are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). *In 2000, Novantrone® (mitoxantrone), given via IV infusion, was approved for RRMS, SPMS, and worsening RRMS. However, side effects may include cardiac disease and leukemia, and for this reason, is seldom prescribed for individuals with MS. Additionally, Gilenya® (fingolimod), is the only DMT that is also approved for the treatment of children and adolescents, ages 10 through 17, with relapsing forms of MS. Young people under the age of 18 who are diagnosed with MS are referred to having “pediatric MS”; the vast majority (98 percent) of individuals with pediatric MS are diagnosed with the relapsing form of the disease. Research (including many clinical trials) is ongoing at a rigorous pace to find additional treatments for all forms of MS. Mylan’s generic version of Copaxone® (glatiramer acetate injection) Three generic versions of Gilenya® (fingolimod) capsules; while approved, these are not yet available Tecfidera® (dimethyl fumarate or DMF, formerly known as BG-12) Getting early treatment and staying on one of the long-term DMTs for MS may also delay the rate of conversion from RRMS to . As noted earlier, this form of MS that follows RRMS exhibits a steady worsening, with or without relapses (or flare-ups). If flare-ups do occur, they usually do not remit fully. As mentioned in the previous section, without treatment, approximately half of individuals with RRMS convert to SPMS within 10 years. However, with the introduction of more than 20 brand-name and generic DMTs since the first treatment became available in 1993, those taking a DMT experience a reduced or delayed conversion rate. For more information on long-term treatments for MS and how to select the treatment that is right for you, please see MSAA’s . Individuals who experience a more steady progression of the disease from the onset, without periodic relapses and remissions, may be diagnosed with .

d359081e-c45f-455e-ac2a-bfceab3db4b5,"Reviewed by MSAA Chief Medical Officer While we all know “MS” stands for “multiple sclerosis,” with so much exciting research reported in this edition of “What’s New in MS Research,” we can almost imagine that “MS” could also refer to the quest for “multiple solutions” in MS. Although a great deal of the research looks to further understand the biology, easing the symptoms, and slowing or stopping the physical damage of MS, the studies and other information presented here are very encouraging – and they are only a small sample of the vast array of research under way around the world. Most of the clinical trials and other studies featured in this issue of “What’s New in MS Research” are drawn from virtual presentations given at the September 2020 joint meeting of the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS). That meeting, held virtually this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was a forum for laboratory scientists and clinical investigators to share their findings from literally thousands of research efforts. As reflected in the reports that follow, those inquiries touch upon everything from enhancing the diagnosis of MS and better understanding its course, to evaluating the effectiveness and safety of approved disease-modifying therapies, investigational agents, and other types of interventions. Impact of Vumerity on brain-volume change: Encouraging interim findings People with relapsing MS who took the oral disease-modifying therapy Vumerity (diroximel fumarate) for up to two years had changes (reductions) in brain volume that approach those seen in people who do not have MS. That’s the encouraging finding from interim results of a study examining the long-term impact of the medication, which the FDA approved in October 2019. The study, EVOLVE-MS-1, is an ongoing, open-label Phase 3 investigation. Analysis of data on 365 patients who had taken Vumerity for a median of 96 weeks showed that their average percent of brain volume change (PBVC) was -0.36 from baseline to Week 48 and -0.35 from Week 48 to Week 96. Meanwhile, the estimated proportion of patients who were free of confirmed disability progression was 94.3% at Week 48 and 90.7% at Week 96. The proportions of patients with no evidence of disease activity at Week 48 and Week 96 were 44.7% and 25.2%, respectively. The study’s authors noted, “Interim findings from the ongoing EVOLVE-MS-1 study demonstrate that yearly PBVC in [Vumerity]-treated patients approached the rate observed in healthy adults.” Newly approved DMT shows efficacy in newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve patients In August, Kesimpta (ofatumumab) became the first self-administered targeted B-cell therapy approved by the FDA to treat relapsing forms of MS. A recent analysis of data from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS I/II trials that led to that approval provide insights into the efficacy and risk profile of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody in newly diagnosed patients who had not received any prior disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for their MS. The analysis involved 615 patients with a median age of 36 years who typically had been diagnosed within a year of starting either Kesimpta, or the comparison agent Aubagio (teriflunomide), in the Phase III trials. Compared to Aubagio, the study found that Kesimpta reduced the annual relapse rate (ARR) by 50.3%. It also reduced six-month confirmed disability worsening by 46%, and the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a year by 82.0%. The study’s authors noted that these findings in newly diagnosed patients who had not received prior DMTs were consistent with results for the overall study population. Assessing the long-term impact of Mayzent in secondary-progressive MS Mayzent (siponimod) is an oral DMT approved by the FDA in March 2019 as a treatment for both relapsing and active secondary-progressive MS (aSPMS). In the EXPAND trial that led to its approval, the medication reduced worsening of both clinical disability and cognition at the six-month mark in people with aSPMS. New data show that those benefits may continue for up to five years. An analysis assessed long-term outcomes in 582 people with aSPMS, comparing those who had received Mayzent throughout the EXPAND trial and its open-label extension (Continuous Group), with those who had been on placebo during the main trial and then switched to Mayzent during the extension (Switch Group). Median time to confirmed disability progression over any six-month period was 48 months for the Switch Group, but was not reached for the Continuous Group. Similarly, the risk of confirmed cognitive worsening over any six-month period was reduced by 33% in the Continuous Group vs. the Switch Group, a statistically significant difference. The annual relapse rate (ARR) was also significantly reduced in the Continuous Group relative to the Switch Group. The study’s authors concluded, “Long-term data analyses in the Continuous versus Switch groups showed that siponimod treatment effects on disability, cognitive processing speed, and relapse outcomes in patients with active SPMS are sustained for up to 5 years, and highlight the value of early treatment initiation.” Arnold D, et al.

Evaluating the impact of ponesimod on brain volume and other measures Ponesimod is an oral medication in late stages of investigation for treatment of relapsing forms of MS. It belongs to a class of medications called sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 modulators. The class also includes FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) such as Gilenya (fingolimod) and Mayzent (siponimod). The Phase III OPTIMUM study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ponesimod relative to the approved DMT Aubagio (teriflunomide) over two years of treatment. The study included 985 patients. Analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and other data from the trial showed that patients in the ponesimod group had less change in brain volume than those taking Aubagio and fewer new or enlarging T2 lesions seen on MRI per year. Further, at week 108 of treatment, 28.2% of patients receiving ponesimod had no evidence of disease activity as assessed by three measures (NEDA-3), compared to 18.3% of people taking Aubagio. Evobrutinib shows two-year reduction in relapse rate Evobrutinib is an investigational medication that belongs to a class of medications known as Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or BTKIs. Its developers note that it has a dual mode of action, targeting B cells and myeloid cells, both of which play a role in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). In a recent Phase II trial involving people with relapsing MS, evobrutinib significantly reduced T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI compared to placebo at Week 24, and showed continued efficacy through Week 48. Patients who participated in that trial were eligible to join an open-label extension study that tracked clinical relapse rates and other measures. The extension included both people who had received various doses of evobrutinib in the Phase II trial and those who had received placebo. All participants in the extension study received evobrutinib. Among 148 patients who completed 108 weeks of treatment, those who had been on the highest dose of evobrutinib in the main trial had an annualized relapse rate of 0.12, which was roughly one-third that of the 0.31 rate for patients who received placebo in the main trial before switching to evobrutinib in the open-label period. Similarly, the estimated time to relapse in the higher-dose evobrutinib patients was almost three times longer than that of patients who started on placebo. For all of the remarkable progress that has been made in expanding treatment options for MS, there also are periodic reminders that drug development is a difficult and complex process that offers no guarantees of success. One such reminder came a few weeks ago, when Biogen noted in its third-quarter report that it will discontinue development of its investigational agent opicinumab. The medication, which is also known as anti-LINGO-1 and BIIB033, is an antibody that was thought to promote repair of the myelin sheath that protects nerves. Damage to that sheath is the hallmark of MS. The agent has been studied in a number of Phase II studies, including RENEW, SYNERGY, and the AFFINITY trial, which was scheduled to run until 2022. Unfortunately, the latter trial did not meet primary or secondary endpoints, so development of opicinumab was discontinued. Kappos L, et al.

Two of those studies are summarized below. Neurofilament light, or NfL, is a protein found in axons, the component of neurons that facilitates transmission of electrical impulses. When neurons are damaged, as occurs in MS and other diseases, the protein is released, eventually reaching the blood, or serum. Researchers seeking biomarkers that can help correctly identify MS and provide clues to its future course have focused in recent years on the sNfL chain, with generally encouraging results. In a multi-center, prospective study, investigators looked for an association between sNfL levels and the diagnosis of MS, MRI parameters, and treatment decisions. The study, which involved 814 patients, found that: Patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) had lower sNfL levels than those with MS, a finding that may help clinicians distinguish between the two conditions. sNfL levels correlated with the number of clinical relapses a person experienced and the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions seen on MRI. Patients who received disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in the first two years after diagnosis had higher baseline sNfL levels than patients who did not receive a DMT, suggesting that they may have presented with more pronounced symptoms. Further, sNfL levels measured over four years reflected treatment decisions, supporting the idea that those levels are a marker of disease status. The study’s authors concluded that evaluating sNfL levels may both enhance diagnosis and help guide decisions about initial treatment. A second study found that sNfL levels obtained in the early stages of MS can predict how patients are likely to fare as much as 15 years later. Drawing on long-term data from the BENEFIT study examining use of interferon beta-1b in people with MS, researchers found that patients with baseline sNfL values above the 90th percentile were almost 2.5 times more likely than people with lower sNfL concentrations to have an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 4 or greater 15 years later. An EDSS score of 4 indicates that although fully ambulatory and self-sufficient, an individual is experiencing significant disability. One less headache for people with MS who also suffer from migraines It could be intuitive to think – or at least to worry – that a history of migraines would not bode well for the course of MS, but researchers have found that this isn’t necessarily the case. Those investigators analyzed data on 2,017 people with MS, including 336 people who had reported experiencing migraines. The people who reported migraines tended to be younger than the other patients, and were more likely to also have a history of anxiety, depression, and obstructive sleep apnea. However, they were less likely than the other study subjects to have severe disability (5.4% of those with migraine vs. 12.0% of those without, a statistically significant difference), and did not show differences in walking speed, manual dexterity, cognitive processing speed, relapse rates, or rate of new brain-lesion development. While the investigators cautioned that the evidence gathered to date on migraine and MS is conflicting, and that further studies are needed, their findings nonetheless offer reassurance to people who may have feared that migraine headaches would somehow contribute to or be associated with a more-difficult MS course. Different types of MS impact quality of life similarly Depression, pain, and walking difficulty are the symptoms that have the greatest impact on quality of life for people with MS, regardless of which form of the condition they have. This is the main finding to emerge from a study examining how 13 different MS symptoms affected health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in 1,985 people with MS. Although the study subjects were stratified by MS phenotype, such as relapsing-remitting MS, secondary-progressive MS, and primary-progressive MS, the investigators found that depression, pain, and problems with walking were the main contributors to a reduced quality of life across and among the different subgroups. “Reducing these symptoms may have the largest impact on improving HRQoL in all MS phenotypes of people with MS,” they said.

An MS trial focused exclusively on minority patients In keeping with efforts to address long-standing inequities in society as a whole and within the healthcare system, a new trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the disease-modifying therapy Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) in people with relapsing forms of MS who are of African ancestry or Hispanic and Latino ethnicity. In previewing the trial, researchers noted that minority patients with MS tend to have greater disease severity and faster progression than Caucasians, but are significantly under-represented in clinical trials, “owing to poor access and cultural, economic and other participation barriers.” They added that while large-scale clinical trials of Ocrevus showed that the B cell-targeting anti-CD20 therapy reduced rates of disease activity and progression in both relapsing MS and primary-progressive MS, minority participation in those studies was less than 10%. By contrast, the researchers said, the single-arm Phase IV study, called CHIMES, is an industry-sponsored collaborative approach designed to meet the needs of patients of African or Hispanic ancestry. The study’s primary endpoint will be disease activity, defined by the proportion of patients free of protocol-defined events such as relapses, at one year. Study subjects will be eligible to participate in a second-year extension that will assess disease progression and biomarker endpoints. One-third of the patients will take part in a sub-study evaluating cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. The researchers noted, “Findings from CHIMES are expected to improve current understanding of MS disease biology, treatment response and clinical trial participation among [African ancestry and Hispanic ancestry] patients with MS, with the ultimate goals of increasing high-quality standard of care to traditionally underserved populations and enhancing equality through clinical research.” Examining MS relapse rates during – and after – pregnancy A new study has bolstered prior findings that MS relapses tend to decrease during pregnancy and then increase again in the early postpartum period. The analysis assessed information on 119 women who became pregnant while they were patients at the University of California San Francisco Multiple Sclerosis Center during the period 2005 to 2018. For the 146 live-birth pregnancies that the study subjects had, the pre-pregnancy annual relapse rate (ARR) was 0.33. That rate decreased during pregnancy to 0.10 but then increased to 0.61 by three months after delivery. (Both changes were statistically significant.) Another key finding: Women who exclusively breastfed their babies for at least three months after delivery had a significantly reduced likelihood of having a relapse. Identifying indicators of long-term disability in children with MS Children and adolescents who have optic nerve, brainstem, or spinal cord lesions when they are diagnosed with MS are at greater risk for long-term disability than other pediatric MS patients. That was one of the major findings to emerge from a study of 123 young people followed for an average of nine years after diagnosis. Researchers found that optic nerve involvement at baseline predicted a shorter time to first relapse and 10-year disability worsening. Brainstem lesions at baseline also were predictive of 10-year disability worsening, as well as of a higher 10-year Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. The number of cervical spinal cord lesions at diagnosis also helped identify patients likely to have higher EDSS scores 10 years after diagnosis. Several other clinical and imaging features seen in the first three years after diagnosis, including number of relapses in the first year and detection of at least two lesions seen on MRI within two years, also provided reliable information on long-term disease course. The study’s investigators noted, “Accurate clinical and MRI monitoring during the first two years of disease has proven to represent a powerful tool for counseling [pediatric] patients about long-term prognosis and personalizing treatment strategies.” Williams M, et al.

Comparing stem cell transplantation with disease-modifying therapies Encouraging results from small- and medium-sized studies have generated considerable interest in treating multiple sclerosis with stem cell therapy, but important questions remain about the long-term outcomes of the treatment strategy, as well as about how it compares with current disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The StarMS study will examine that last issue: the safety and efficacy of stem cell transplantation relative to DMTs. Funded by the British government, the study will involve 198 people with relapsing-remitting MS. One half of the study participants will receive stem cells that have been taken from their body, treated, and then re-infused after the patient undergoes immunosuppression. This approach is designed to “reboot” the immune system. The other half of the participants will receive one of two DMTs, Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) or Lemtrada (alemtuzumab). The primary endpoint of the study will be the rate of patients achieving no evidence of disease activity (NEDA), based on clinical and imaging assessments, over a two-year follow-up period. Allowing time for full patient enrollment, results are expected in about four years. Study investigators note, “The StarMS trial has the potential to provide definitive data on the comparative efficacy of aHSCT [autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation] versus highly efficacious DMTs, help improve patient outcomes, and impact national and international guidelines.” Might administering microscopic crystals to people with MS prove to be the gold standard – literally – for repairing the nerve-sheath damage that drives MS? Clene Nanomedicine, a biopharmaceutical company based in Salt Lake City, Utah, is pursuing the answer to that question as it develops CNM-Au8, a concentrated, aqueous suspension of clean-surfaced faceted gold nanocrystals that act catalytically to support intracellular biological reactions. The agent is being investigated as a potential treatment not only for MS, but also for Parkinson’s disease (PD) and potentially other neurological conditions. Studies in animals indicate that CNM-Au8 has both remyelination and neuroprotective effects, the Company notes. Clene Nanotechnologies adds that Phase I studies in healthy human volunteers have demonstrated the safety of CNM-Au8. As a next step in the research process, the Company organized the REPAIR-MS and REPAIR-PD studies. The Phase II, single-center, open-label, imaging studies are examining the brain metabolic effects, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CNM-Au8 in patients who have been diagnosed with MS in the past 15 years (REPAIR-MS) or who have been diagnosed with PD in the past three years (REPAIR-PD). Study participants take either a 15 or 30 mg orally delivered dose of the nanocrystal suspension each morning. Study participants undergo sophisticated brain imaging scanning to assess key bioenergetic brain metabolites at baseline, prior to administration of CNM-Au8, and at the end of the study. The objective is to show that CNM-Au8 engages with targeted central nervous system biomarkers related to bioenergetics and neuronal metabolism in people with MS and PD. The study is taking place at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Survey finds that one in five people with MS are using cannabis for symptom relief Roughly one-third of people with MS have looked to cannabis at least once for relief of spasticity or pain, or to help with sleep, and 20% currently are taking cannabis to ease MS symptoms. Those were the main findings of a recent online survey conducted by the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis, or NARCOMS, a voluntary self-report registry for people with MS. NARCOMS researchers invited 6,934 registry participants to complete the survey. Forty-seven percent – or 3,249 people – responded. The participants had an average age of 61.2 years and a mean age at MS symptom onset of 31.2 years. Current users were more likely than past users to be male, and also were likely to be somewhat younger. More than 60% of the respondents reported moderate to severe spasticity, pain, and sleep problems. Phase III study examines cannabinoid agent for MS spasticity Americans who look to cannabis-based agents for relief of MS symptoms may have a new treatment option – one already offered in more than two dozen other countries – available to them in the years just ahead. GW Pharmaceuticals and its United States subsidiary, Greenwich Biosciences, on November 3, 2019 announced the initiation of the first United States Phase III clinical trial studying nabiximols for MS-associated spasticity. Nabiximols, which are known as Sativex outside of the United States, are approved for treatment of MS spasticity in more than 25 countries. GW Pharmaceuticals, which focuses on the development and commercialization of cannabinoid prescription medicines, said that nabiximols is a complex botanical medicine formulated from extracts of the cannabis plant. It is administered as an oral spray. The company noted that three European Phase III clinical studies showed that nabiximols was well-tolerated and provided continued reductions in patient-reported spasticity in people with MS. The new Phase III trial is one of five pivotal studies planned for nabiximols in MS spasticity, with the remaining studies on track to begin later this year or in 2021. The company said that it expects that a positive result in any one of the five studies will enable submission of an application for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the agent, potentially as early as mid-2021. The Phase III, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of nabiximols for spasm frequency over a 12-week period. It is expected to enroll 446 participants. Evaluating the long-term impact of therapeutic plasma exchange Therapeutic plasma exchange – the removal and replacement of the plasma component of a person’s blood through the use of a special machine – is an option sometimes employed when high-dose steroid therapy isn’t effective in treating an MS relapse. A recent study examined the impact of the treatment strategy over 12, 18, and 24 months, and sought to identify whether certain patient characteristics or disease features were associated with a better response to therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). Researchers analyzed data on 24 people with relapsing-remitting MS who received steroids followed by TPE and 43 patients who received steroids only. Patients in the two groups were matched for age, sex, disease duration, and disability level at the time of the relapse. Good response to treatment was defined as a reduction of at least 50% in one’s Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. Initial EDSS scores in the two groups were similar. While two-thirds of the people receiving TPE initially had a good response to the treatment, the researchers found no significant differences between their EDSS scores and those of the steroid-only patients at 12, 18, or 24 months of follow-up. Further, preliminary analysis did not identify any patient characteristics or disease features associated with a favorable response to TPE. Although the study did not identify an added long-term benefit from following high-dose steroids with TPE, the fact that most TPE recipients had a good initial response to the therapy is encouraging news, especially considering that up to one-quarter of people experiencing a relapse do not obtain sufficient improvement from steroids alone. Can taking aspirin as a warm-up help avoid overheating during exercise? In addition to the time pressures and other deterrents to regular exercise that all people face, many people with MS also have to cope with the exertion-induced overheating that is a frequent feature of multiple sclerosis. A new study is examining whether taking aspirin before working out can help remove that MS-specific obstacle to maintaining an exercise routine. ASPIRE is a large-scale, double-blind randomized controlled trial that will compare the effects of aspirin with those of acetaminophen (generic version of the brand name Tylenol) and placebo in 60 people with MS. Each study participant will engage in three maximal exercise tests, with the evaluations scheduled at one-week intervals. A study subject will take 650 mg of aspirin before one test, a standard dose of acetaminophen before another session, and placebo prior to the third session. The study’s two main endpoints are time to exhaustion and change in body temperature from the pre-exercise period to the immediate post-exercise period. Study organizers note that a pilot trial showed that aspirin pre-treatment increased exercise time and reduced the post-exercise increase in body temperature by 56% in people with MS who experience overheating on exertion.

Exploring the link between pediatric MS and a family history of autoimmune disorders The “economic complications” of MS: unemployment and underemployment Assessing the extent and impact of “stem cell tourism” The opening months of 2019 saw significant research advances on many fronts in multiple sclerosis (MS). A sophisticated analysis of data using healthcare claims found that the number of people in the United States living with MS is more than twice as high as previously estimated. Dietary studies sounded a cautionary note for people with MS drinking soda and many other sweetened beverages, and a hopeful note on the potential for flavonoid-rich cocoa to reduce MS-associated fatigue. A promising stem-cell therapy is moving forward in the clinical-trials process, while the FDA is considering whether to approve a new disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Additionally, genetic analysis, population-based studies, and other investigations are steadily expanding scientists’ understanding of MS risk factors and physiologic processes, laying the groundwork for new treatments and other interventions. This edition of “What’s New in MS Research” covers all of those developments and more. Beyond perusing the items that follow, please check the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America’s periodically for updates on other research advances and comprehensive information on all aspects of living with MS. Analysis shows the number of people with MS to be much higher than previously estimated As many as 913,925 people living in the United States had multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2017, according to estimates derived from an extensive analysis of healthcare claims. That number is more than double the previous estimate of 400,000 affected people in the United States. [Wallin 2019] Researchers arrived at the higher figure by using a sophisticated algorithm (a step-by-step problem-solving process) to analyze the data found in claims from private, public, and military healthcare systems covering more than 125 million people. Drawing on the claims data, the investigators first calculated that 727,344 people in the United States were affected by MS in 2010. They then extrapolated their findings to come up with a low and a high estimate of the number of people living with MS in 2017. Those 2017 estimates ranged from 851,749 people to 913,925 people, or from 337.9 cases per 100,000 population to 362.6 cases per 100,000. The figures represent the MS prevalence, which is the cumulative number of cases diagnosed over several years among people who are still living. [Wallin 2019] The analysis also confirmed the long-standing finding that MS is more common in women than men. For 2010, investigators found that MS prevalence was 450.1 cases per 100,000 women versus 159.7 cases per 100,000 men, for a female:male ratio of 2.8-1. Further, the 2010 data showed that MS prevalence was highest in people aged 55 to 64 years, and that MS is more common in the north than in the south, differing from a high of 377.4 cases per 100,000 in the northeast to 272.6 cases per 100,000 in the south. [Wallin 2019] Our findings suggest that there has been a steady rise in the prevalence of MS over the past five decades, the researchers noted. [Wallin 2019] Correcting lower, inaccurate estimates of how many people are affected by MS is critical as the government, payers, and healthcare systems determine how to allocate resources – including research funds and patient-care staff – to address various conditions and diseases. Drinking roughly two cans per day of non-diet soda or other beverages sweetened with sugar may be tied to more severe multiple sclerosis (MS) symptoms and greater disability relative to not drinking or seldom consuming such beverages. This conclusion is according to a study involving 135 people with MS. [AAN Feb. 26] The study focused on how participants’ diets compared to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. The DASH diet recommends whole grains, fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, lean meats, poultry and fish, and nuts and legumes. It also limits foods that are high in saturated fat and sugar. [AAN Feb. 26] Researchers divided the participants into five groups based on those study subject’s self-reported consumption of soda and sugar-sweetened beverages. The people in the top group drank an average of 290 calories of sugar-sweetened beverages – the rough equivalent of two cans of non-diet soda – per day. The lowest group seldom drank sugar-sweetened beverages. The study found that people with MS who drank the largest amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages were five-times more likely to have severe disability than those in the lowest-consumption group. The top group had an average score of 4.1 points on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), while the bottom group had an average score of 3.4 points. [AAN Feb. 26] MS patients often want to know how diet and specific foods can affect the progression of their disease, noted study author Elisa Meier-Gerdingh, MD, of St. Josef Hospital in Bochum, Germany. While we did not find a link with overall diet, interestingly, we did find a link with those who drank sodas, flavored juices and sweetened teas and coffees. Dr. Meier-Gerdingh added that while the results of the research need to be confirmed by larger, longer studies, We do know that sodas have no nutritional value, and people with MS may want to consider reducing or eliminating them from their diet. [AAN Feb. 26] The researcher also noted that the study assessed participants diets and sugar-sweetened beverages at the same time as disability, precluding investigators from determining whether sugar-sweetened beverages contribute to higher disability or whether more severe disease affects a person’s ability to follow a healthy diet. [AAN Feb. 26] Further information on the study will be presented at the 71st annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, which will take place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in early May 2019. Meanwhile, a sweet remedy for MS-related fatigue shows early promise A cup of flavonoid-rich cocoa may someday be just what the doctor orders to help with the fatigue frequently experienced by people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Flavonoids are a group of more than 5,000 plant chemicals found in fruits and vegetables, and are especially abundant in cocoa and dark chocolate. Flavonoids, which are associated with anti-inflammatory properties, have been previously studied in people with chronic fatigue syndrome. [BMJ March 4] Researchers in the United Kingdom recently assessed the impact of flavonoids on MS-related fatigue in a randomized, double-blind study that involved 30 women and 10 men with RRMS. Those study participants were randomized to drink either high-flavonoid or low-flavonoid cocoa each day for six weeks. [Coe 2019] At the end of the study period, the people drinking the high-flavonoid cocoa showed a 45% improvement in subjectively assessed fatigue and an 80% improvement in walking speed. Overall, 11 of the 19 people in the high-flavonoid group and eight of the 21 people in the low-flavonoid group reported improvement in their fatigue. [Coe 2019] The researchers noted that the mental and physical fatigue experienced by people with MS arise from complex causes, likely involving neural, inflammatory, metabolic, and psychological factors. Flavonoids potentially could be used in conjunction with exercise, medication, and physical therapy to provide a comprehensive approach to managing fatigue in MS, they added. The use of dietary approaches to reduce fatigue and associated factors in people with MS may be an easy, safe, and cost-effective way to have an impact on quality of life and independence, allowing people to feel more in control of their condition, the investigators said in calling for more-extensive research into the potential for flavonoids to reduce MS-related fatigue. [BMJ March 4] Clinical trial to evaluate stem-cell therapy for progressive MS A therapy that would use a patient s own stem cells to treat progressive MS is moving toward the clinical trial stage. In December 2018, the FDA approved an application from BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics to begin a Phase II clinical trial of NurOwn mesenchymal stem cell-neurotrophic factors (MSC-NTF) cells. [BrainStorm] The trial is scheduled to get under way early this year, with an estimated primary completion date of February 2020 and full completion date of September 2020. [clinicaltrials.gov NCT03799718] The Phase II trial will involve 20 people with progressive MS, and will be conducted at multiple locations. [clinicaltrials.gov NCT03799718] Participants mesenchymal stem cells will first be removed from their bone marrow via insertion of a hollow needle. Those cells then will be converted into MSC-NTF cells by growing them under patented conditions that cause the cells to secrete high levels of neurotrophic factors, which are molecules that support the development and differentiation of neurons. [BrainStorm] The MSC-NTF cells will be re-introduced into the patients bodies through three intrathecal cell transplantations over the course of 16 weeks. [clinicaltrials.gov NCT03799718] Autologous (meaning from the patient’s own body) MSC-NTF cells can deliver neurotrophic factors and other immune-modulating molecules directly to the site of damage to elicit a desired biological effect and ultimately slow or stabilize disease, BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics explained in outlining the rationale for the treatment. [BrainStorm] Participants will be followed for 28 weeks after the start of treatment, with researchers monitoring for adverse events. The study will also measure the change from baseline to 28 weeks post-treatment in the participants 25-foot walking speed. Sixteen weeks after treatment, researchers will analyze the participants cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to determine how many individuals had changes in neurotrophic factors in their CSF. [clinicaltrials.gov NCT03799718] In announcing the FDA’s acceptance of its application to conduct a Phase II study, BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics noted, There are currently no FDA-approved autologous cellular therapies addressing MS or other neurological diseases. The company is also conducting a Phase III clinical trial of autologous MSC-NTF cells for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. [BrainStorm] Late 2019 target date for FDA action on potential new treatment for relapsing-remitting MS The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set a fourth quarter 2019 target date to act on an application to approve the oral agent diroximel fumarate to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). [Alkermes Feb. 25] In late February, the pharmaceutical companies Alkermes plc and Biogen Inc. announced that the FDA had accepted a new drug application (NDA) for diroximel fumarate. [Alkermes Feb. 25] Biogen currently markets the oral disease-modifying therapy (DMT) dimethyl fumarate in the United States as Tecfidera. Biogen and Alkermes note that diroximel fumarate may have the potential to offer differentiated GI [gastrointestinal] tolerability due to its chemical structure as compared to dimethyl fumarate. [Alkermes Feb. 25] The prescribing information for Tecfidera notes that in clinical trials of the agent, 18% of patients reported abdominal pain, 14% reported diarrhea, 12% said they experienced nausea, and 9% reported vomiting. [Tecfidera PI] The application for FDA approval of diroximel fumarate is based on the results of the Phase III, open-label, two-year safety study EVOLVE-MS-1, along with studies comparing the pharmacologic profiles of diroximel fumarate and dimethyl fumarate. Alkermes is also conducting the EVOLVE-MS-2 study in people with RRMS. That five-week study will compare the GI tolerability of diroximel fumarate with that of dimethyl fumarate. [Alkermes Feb. 25] If the FDA approves diroximel fumarate, Biogen intends to market the oral DMT under the brand name VUMERITY, subject to approval by the FDA, which has conditionally accepted the name. [Alkermes Feb. 25] Biogen studying an extended dosing interval for Tysabri Can stretching out the time between doses of Tysabri (natalizumab) enable people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to continue to derive health benefits from the disease-modifying therapy (DMT), while reducing the risk for a rare but serious brain infection, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)? It is a question that MS researchers have been asking since evidence emerged a few years ago that Tysabri was associated with an elevated risk for the viral infection. Since then, individual MS centers and neurologists have adapted extended-dosing intervals and reported their results to Biogen, the company that markets Tysabri. They in turn have used this information to conduct a retrospective analysis of patients receiving extended-interval dosing (EID) vs. those on the FDA-approved standard-interval dose (SID) of 300 mg every four weeks. [Biogen January 3] Now, however, Biogen will be comparing the safety and efficacy of six-week dosing to that of the standard four-week dose in a prospective, randomized study that will enroll approximately 480 people with RRMS. In early January, the company announced that it had enrolled the first patient in the two-year, Phase IIIB study, known as NOVA. The global study will evaluate people who switch to the six-week EID after one year on the four-week SID regimen to those who remain on SID. The primary endpoint will be the number of new or newly enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions seen on MRI at 48 weeks of treatment. [Biogen January 3] Biogen initiated the NOVA study after its retrospective analyses showed that EID was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of PML, the company noted. More than 190,000 people worldwide have been treated with Tysabri. [Biogen January 3] An analysis of pooled data from more than 37,000 patients participating in four large clinical trials found that fewer than 1% overall had developed PML. [Ho] However, among those who had an antibody known as the anti-John Cunningham virus (anti-JCV) antibody, the estimated cumulative probability of having PML over the course of six years of Tysabri treatment was 2.7% in those who had used an immunosuppressant agent before Tysabri and 1.7% in those who had not received an immunosuppressant previously. [Ho] The NOVA study may generate valuable data that we hope will answer questions for the scientific community about the efficacy of nataliuzumab when its dosing schedule is extended to every six weeks, and in conjunction with prior safety analyses, may inform on the drug’s benefit-risk profile, noted Alfred Sandrock, MD, PhD, Biogen’s executive vice president and chief medical officer. [Biogen January 3] Use of a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) early in pregnancy does not appear to be associated with a significant risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, poor fetal growth, or other adverse pregnancy outcomes. That’s the conclusion of a database analysis that evaluated 984,058 pregnancies occurring between 2011 and 2015, including 1,649 pregnancies to women with MS. Thirty-five percent of the women with MS filled a DMT prescription within 90 days before pregnancy. Researchers concluded, Pregnancies with and without early DMT exposure had similar risks of outcomes to one another and to pregnancies in women without MS. [MacDonald 2019] Please note that while these findings are encouraging, women who are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant while taking a DMT are advised to consult with their physician. Rituxan and no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) in pediatric-onset MS Rituxan (rituximab) is a monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis, forms of lymphoma and leukemia, and other conditions. Although it is not approved for use in multiple sclerosis (MS), some neurologists use it off-label to treat their adult MS patients. Now, a chart review of pediatric-onset MS (POMS) patients treated with Rituxan at Texas Children’s Hospital suggests that the agent is effective in younger people. The analysis examined data on 17 patients who ranged in age from 13 years to 22 years at the time of the chart review. All had undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) six months or longer after starting Rituxan. Their mean age was 18 years, and their mean disease duration was 41 months (close to three and a half years). Four of the study subjects received Rituxan as their first disease-modifying therapy. Nine switched to Rituxan from another DMT because of disease progression, while another four switched to Rituxan after experiencing side effects on an earlier DMT. [Shukla ACTRIMS 2019] The review found that 82% (14 of 17) of those young patients had no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) as measured by absence of new T2 or contrast-enhancing lesions on MRI, absence of relapses, and absence of increased post-treatment disability. [Shukla ACTRIMS 2019] While acknowledging that the retrospective nature of the analysis and the small number of patients involved were study limitations, the authors nonetheless noted that our data supports the use of rituximab in POMS and suggests high rates of NEDA in this population. [Shukla ACTRIMS 2019] Can reducing children’s weight reduce their risk for MS later in life? Clinicians long have noted that many people with multiple sclerosis (MS) were overweight as children, but the complex nature of MS makes establishing a cause-and-effect relationship difficult. Now, however, a team of Canadian and British researchers has found genetic support for childhood obesity playing a role in the development of MS. Those researchers conducted a genome-wide association study involving 14,802 people with MS and 26,703 controls. They identified 22 genetic variants strongly associated with childhood body mass index (BMI) and examined the effect that each variant had on MS. [Harroud 2019] One key finding: a one-standard deviation (SD) increase in childhood BMI increased the risk of developing MS by 29%. [Harroud 2019] The researchers noted, These findings suggest that targeting childhood obesity may be an effective strategy to reduce MS incidence. [Harroud 2019] Exploring the link between pediatric MS and a family history of autoimmune disorders Children and adolescents with multiple sclerosis (MS) are more than twice as likely as other young people to have a close relative with an autoimmune disorder. [Greenberg ACTRIMS] That finding emerged from an ongoing, multi-center study of risk factors for pediatric MS. The study, which began in 2011, compares the medical data, biologic specimens, and family history of children and adolescents with MS with that of their peers unaffected by the condition. After adjusting for variables such as sex, race, age, and ethnicity, the analysis identified family history of autoimmune disease as a factor associated with an increased risk for developing MS before adulthood. [Greenberg ACTRIMS] The odds of a pediatric MS patient having either a first- or second-degree relative with an autoimmune condition were 2.27 times that of a young person without MS, according to researchers. They noted that the differences between young people with MS and healthy controls were most marked when there was a family history of diabetes, thyroid disorders, or rheumatoid arthritis. Conversely, no difference in risk was observed when a family member had eczema or psoriasis. [Greenberg ACTRIMS] Researchers also found that the odds of autoimmune disease among family members was significantly higher on the father’s side of a young person’s family compared to the mother’s side. The investigators noted that this increased prevalence of certain autoimmune disorders in close relatives of pediatric MS patients aligns with prior findings among adult populations. [Greenberg ACTRIMS] As investigators continue to explore how genetics and immunologic function contribute to the development of MS in children and teenagers, this study adds another piece to a complex puzzle. The “economic complications” of MS: unemployment and underemployment Unemployment and underemployment are common among people with multiple sclerosis (MS), with fatigue being a major obstacle to workplace participation and productivity. That’s one of the early insights from ongoing research being conducted by the North American Registry for Care and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (NARCRMS). [Rammohan ACTRIMS 2019] The Registry collects a wide range of information on people with MS, and uses that information to examine issues such as the economic impact of MS. An early analysis of data from 212 NARCRMS patients found that 31% either were unemployed or underemployed. Among those who were employed, almost one-third said that MS affected their work, with fatigue being the leading issue cited. The economic impact of identifying an effective treatment for this disabling symptom of MS cannot be overstated, the study’s authors noted. [Rammohan ACTRIMS 2019] Assessing the extent and impact of “stem cell tourism” “Stem cell tourism” is the latest manifestation of a trend as old as the disease itself offering unproven therapies to desperate patients. The phenomenon is increasingly prevalent in multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurologic diseases, according to a team of researchers from Ohio State University. Those investigators recently surveyed academic neurologists across America, and found that 65% had at least one patient who had received unproven cellular preparations. [Rai ACTRIMS 2019] It should be noted that patients receiving such preparation without their physician’s knowledge or against their physician’s advice is entirely different from participating in a stem cell clinical trial that has been carefully designed, approved by hospital officials, registered on clinicaltrials.gov, and meets rigorous ethical, safety, and monitoring standards. [Rai ACTRIMS 2019] The academic neurologists reported that 33% of their patients had received unproven “stem cell therapies” in the United States, 22% had received their treatment abroad, and 37% had received preparations in both the United States and abroad. Overseas destinations included China, Germany, Mexico, the Bahamas, Russia, and Costa Rica. [Rai ACTRIMS 2019] Three-quarters of the survey respondents said their patients did not report complications from receiving these unproven preparations. However, among the 25% whose patients did report adverse effects, complications included stroke, meningoencephalitis, quadriparesis, sepsis, hepatitis C, seizures, and infections. At least three respondents had patients who died following these procedures. [Rai ACTRIMS 2019] The authors said that the complications of these unproven approaches and the overall negative impact on people with MS underscore the need for a comprehensive education campaign to prevent the exploitation of individuals with MS.

2ab8e4cc-cf30-4db1-953d-c8ac582f829e,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS consists of the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord. With MS, areas of the CNS become inflamed, damaging the protective covering (myelin) that surrounds and insulates the nerves (axons). In addition to the myelin, over time, the axons and nerve cells (neurons) within the CNS may also become damaged. This damage is referred to as neurodegeneration. The damage to the protective covering and also to the nerves disrupts the smooth flow of nerve impulses. As a result, messages from the brain and spinal cord going to other parts of the body may be delayed and have trouble reaching their destination – causing the symptoms of MS. Described later in this booklet, these symptoms can include a wide variety of physical, emotional, and cognitive changes. Areas of inflammation and damage are known as lesions, which are viewed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The changes in size, number, and location of these lesions may determine the type and severity of symptoms. While individuals with relapsing forms of MS are believed to experience more inflammation than those with progressive forms of MS, lesions still occur for individuals with all forms of MS. However, the lesions in progressive forms of MS may be less active and expand more slowly. Shown above is an illustration of two nerve cells. The normal one on the left has a healthy nerve fiber, or axon, protected by myelin (insulation covering the nerve), and is able to transmit signals at a very fast speed – similar to electricity traveling along an electrical cord. The MS nerve cell on the right shows damage to the myelin, and as a result, signals do not travel well along the nerve. MS affects each person differently. For many years, the most common types of MS had been classified as: However, these classifications are changing, and some experts are now grouping relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) together, as a continuum of the same disease. These are now frequently referred to as “” Additionally, progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS) have also been grouped together. These are now frequently referred to as “” Initially, most people with MS experience symptom flare-ups, which are also known as relapses, exacerbations, or attacks. When someone experiences a relapse, he or she may be having new symptoms or an increase in existing symptoms. These usually persist for a short period of time, from a few days to a few months. Afterward, the symptoms greatly improve or remit completely, and these individuals may remain symptom-free for periods of months or years. This type of MS is known as relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Approximately 80 to 85 percent of MS patients are initially diagnosed with this form of the disease. Over time, RRMS may advance to secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). This form of MS does not have the dramatic variations in symptoms that RRMS does, but rather has a slow, steady progression – with or without relapses. If relapses do occur, they usually do not fully remit. Without treatment, approximately half of individuals with RRMS convert to SPMS within 10 years. However, with the introduction of long-term disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), fewer individuals advance to this latter form of the disease. Since 1993, and as of mid-2017, a total of 15 DMTs have been approved by the FDA and are available through prescription. All of these approved medications are aimed at slowing disease activity and delaying progression in MS. Individuals who are not initially diagnosed with RRMS may be experiencing a more steady progression of the disease from the onset. Approximately 10 percent of the MS population is diagnosed with primary-progressive MS (PPMS), where individuals experience a steady worsening of symptoms from the start, and do not have periodic relapses and remissions. Approximately 5 percent of patients are initially diagnosed with progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS). This type of MS steadily worsens from the onset, but symptom flare-ups – with or without remissions – are also present. All forms of MS share an underlying pathogenesis, which refers to the origin of a disease and its development. The pathogenesis of MS includes: – this is an autoimmune attack where an individual’s own white blood cells cause damage to his or her own neurons within the brain and spinal cord – this is damage to the myelin covering around nerves, caused by inflammation – this is the shrinking, atrophy, and death of neurons – this is the body’s own attempt to repair damaged myelin, although this repair is often incomplete – this results in multiple scars within the brain and spinal cord at sites of damage from MS Research has shown that individuals with progressive forms of MS have predominantly neurodegeneration and less inflammation. This is in comparison to relapsing-remitting MS, where inflammation is the predominant driver of the disease with less neurodegeneration occurring early in the disease process. Particularly with relapsing forms of MS, inflammation is greatly involved with the initial disease process. This causes damage to the myelin – the protective covering of the nerves in the central nervous system – and eventually damage to the nerves as well. As time progresses and fewer relapses are experienced, the disease involves increasingly less inflammation and more neurodegeneration, which is the breakdown or cell death of nerve cells. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized the ability to efficiently diagnose MS, track new inflammatory-disease activity – through the discovery of new T2 bright spots and/or new gadolinium-enhancing lesions (these are areas of disease activity with inflammation) – as well as monitor an individual’s response to MS disease-modifying therapies. Currently, an MRI scan provides the best biomarker for evidence of MS progression. MRI measures that most closely correlate to progression include: accelerated brain atrophy, which refers to faster brain shrinkage development of T1 hypointensities, also referred to as “black holes,” which indicate more neurodegeneration versus inflammation Readers should note that many of the current MS therapies have been shown to decrease the accumulation of bright spots and black holes as viewed on an MRI, along with slowing atrophy rates. MS specialists encourage people with MS to review their MRI scans with their providers and to ask about these two types of disease measures. MSAA may be able to help cover MRI costs through its MRI Access Fund program (certain income limits apply). To learn more, please visit or call . Kurtzke’s Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is the oldest and most widely accepted measure of MS disability. The EDSS ranges from 0 to 10 in half-point increments, where 0 is a normal examination, 3.0 is moderate disability, 6.0 is where the person needs assistance to walk, and higher numbers refer to greater disability, largely in terms of mobility. Shown above are features from Kurtzke’s Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Frequently used for clinical evaluation and research study assessments, it mainly focuses on mobility when determining a score. A trained MS clinician assigns a functional score to a patient in eight neurologic systems: pyramidal (referring to the motor system, with weakness and spasticity), cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bladder and bowel, vision, cerebral, and “other.” These are all based on a standard neurologic examination. The EDSS is frequently criticized for being insensitive to small changes, being heavily dependent on mobility, not capturing cognitive impairment, being subjective in some assessments (rating scores can vary), and for not capturing the full range of disabilities. The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) is another clinical tool that assesses MS disability. Unlike the EDSS that is based on a standard neurological examination, the MSFC assesses disability using three “functional” tests. It summarizes the scores of the following: the paced auditory serial addition test evaluating cognition The goal of this system is to capture information on key functional measures affected by MS, specifically leg, arm, and cognitive function. The MSFC is often used in connection with the EDSS in MS clinical trials. Many aspects of the MSFC, such as the timed 25-foot walk, are routinely monitored in MS clinics as well. Approximately one in every 750 individuals in the United States has MS. The natural progression of MS has changed over time. Early studies showed that the median time from onset of PPMS to needing a device (such as a cane) to assist with walking was 10 years, while more contemporary studies show that this has increased to 15 years. Another study showed that 25 percent of people with PPMS still did not require a cane after more than 25 years. Although difficult, individuals with MS should not compare their disease course with those of others, as every individual is different. Risk factors for disease progression have been identified, but their interplay is complex. Early onset of disease and female gender are favorable factors associated with a better prognosis in terms of one’s long-term course of MS. For instance, individuals who were young at the onset of their MS have been shown to take a longer amount of time before their MS progresses to the point of needing a device to assist with walking, which is a score of 6.0 on the EDSS. Relapses can still occur in people with progressive MS. Individuals with secondaryprogressive MS can have an occasional relapse, which is a new neurologic symptom that lasts more than 24 hours, in the absence of fever or infection. This occasional relapse is superimposed on progressive disease, characterized by a gradual decline. For example, an individual with SPMS may notice worsening balance and walking issues over several years, and then notice over the course of hours to days, they have developed blurry vision in one eye and pain with eye movements. He or she may then be diagnosed with an MS relapse of optic neuritis, in addition to having a gradual decline in neurologic function over the course of years. This is different from RRMS, as individuals with RRMS only experience neurologic worsening in the setting of a relapse. The word “progressive” has historically carried a negative connotation among members of the MS community. However, when this term was first coined, the understanding of the pathophysiology of MS – which is how the disease progresses and its effects – was very limited. Neuro-diagnostics, which use advanced technology to diagnose, evaluate, and sometimes treat certain neurological conditions, were in their infancy, and the therapies that could slow progression were lacking. Fortunately, the MS world is changing. Currently, no criteria have been defined to determine definitively when a person with MS has progressed from RRMS to SPMS. However, criteria are in place for a diagnosis of SPMS, which requires the onset of the disease with at least one clinical relapse (differentiating it from PPMS), followed by a gradual decline in neurologic function over the course of at least six to 12 months. This decline must be separate from the worsening that occurs during relapses. The diagnosis of PPMS has distinct criteria based on 2010 McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of MS. To receive a diagnosis of PPMS, a person with MS must have one year or more of gradual decline in neurologic function, in addition to two or more of the following: two or more lesions consistent with MS in the spinal cord cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis consistent with the diagnosis Individuals with RRMS are usually diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 40. The average age of onset of SPMS and PPMS is in the fifth and sixth decades of life, when people are in their 40s or 50s. While RRMS often affects women two-to-three times more often than men, the gender ratio in PPMS is equal between males and females. In both SPMS and PPMS, the rate of decline in neurologic function occurs at a similar rate. Individuals with PPMS generally have more spinal-cord lesions than those with SPMS. It is important to note that the diagnosis of the type of MS is based on clinical history, which is determined through doctor visits and evaluations. Progressive forms of MS cannot be diagnosed with an MRI or spinal-fluid analysis alone. As part of the 2013 International MS Phenotype Group revised MS classification criteria, three important modifiers were added to the description of MS: activity, worsening, and progression. These modifiers help to more accurately reflect the current disease process in a specific individual with MS. refers to a new clinical MS attack (relapse) or a new bright spot (showing inflammation) on the MRI. simply reflects that a specific person’s neurological examination has gotten worse compared to prior examinations, possibly related to an MS attack (relapse). indicates worsening on an exam, independent from an attack (relapse). In summary, people with progressive MS can and do have attacks (relapses), albeit infrequently, and develop new spots (or lesions) on MRI. Both relapses and new lesions are types of disease activity. Additionally, MS may be “clinically silent,” showing no increase in symptoms, yet continuing to show signs of disease activity within the CNS, as seen on MRI. Conversely, these same people can experience long periods of time without progression and without worsening. These variations in disease activity show how dynamic MS is, while affecting each individual differently. Clinical worsening in MS, or the gradual decline in function, should not immediately be attributed to MS as the only cause. Individuals with MS can also acquire other medical problems that can mimic MS progression. These include: cervical stenosis – a narrowing of the spinal canal in the neck, which can put pressure on the spinal cord and cause a worsening of gait, sensation, strength, as well as a worsening of bowel and bladder control As a result, a thorough evaluation by a neurologist as well as a regular follow up with a primary-care physician are important. If alternative causes are ruled out, then a neurologist may confirm that progression is directly related to one’s MS. | | Improving Lives Today! – A Guide to MSAA’s Programs and Services How to S.E.A.R.C.H.™ for the Right MS Therapy for You!

2098dd21-a88a-4c70-a492-b8d41dc0ac32,"What’s New in MS Research: Highlights from the 2018 ECTRIMS Annual Meeting What’s New in MS Research: Highlights from the 2018 ECTRIMS Annual Meeting For more than three decades, multiple sclerosis (MS) experts from around the world have gathered in a European city each fall to share the results of their research at the annual meeting of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS). This year’s gathering was held in Berlin, Germany, October 10-12, where the findings were presented from hundreds of studies on topics ranging from the safety and effectiveness of investigational medications to the role of diet in controlling symptoms of MS. Along with the annual meetings of organizations such as the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS), and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), the ECTRIMS meeting is an important forum for researchers and clinicians to compare notes, generate hypotheses, make plans for future research, and discuss how best to translate study findings into improved patient care. This ECTRIMS 2018 research update article highlights more than 30 studies with important implications for people with MS. While these studies represent only a small sampling of the research presented at ECTRIMS, they were selected for their relevance to the current and potential near-term management of MS, and with a view toward addressing a variety of topics. Accordingly, the study findings reported below are organized into eight categories: We hope this information will be of interest and value.

And as always, please note that your healthcare provider remains your best source of information on the medical and overall management of your MS, and should be consulted with any questions you may have or before making any changes to a treatment regimen or other aspects of your approach to living with MS. For readers who are not familiar with study protocol, to follow is a helpful listing that provides a brief explanation of the different clinical trial phases. Phase I studies are primarily concerned with assessing the drug’s safety. This initial phase of testing in humans is done in a small number of healthy volunteers, and is designed to determine what happens to the drug in the human body – how it is absorbed, metabolized, and excreted. Once a drug has been shown to be safe, it must be tested for efficacy. This second phase of testing may last from several months to two years, and involve up to several hundred patients. Phase II studies are often “double-blinded,” meaning that the participants, medical staff, and investigators are not told who is receiving the drug and who is receiving the placebo. In a Phase III study, a drug is usually tested in several hundred to several thousand patients, usually in multiple medical facilities around the world. Phase III studies typically last two or more years. Only after a Phase III study is successfully completed can a pharmaceutical company request FDA approval for marketing the drug. Phase IV clinical trials are conducted after a drug has been approved. Participants are enrolled to further monitor safety and side effects, while evaluating long-term efficacy. Ongoing decline in relapse rate seen in long-term study of Gilenya People with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) who took Gilenya (fingolimod) for five years or more had low rates of disease activity during that period, with gradually decreasing relapse rates, researchers reported. The investigators drew on data from LONGTERMS, an open-label, single-arm, extension study assessing the ongoing safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 0.5 mg of Gilenya in RRMS patients who had participated in earlier clinical trials of the disease-modifying therapy (DMT). The LONGTERMS study evaluated 754 patients. Sixty-seven percent of study subjects were women, and the mean time since MS diagnosis was 4.8 years. The annualized relapse rate in the population declined from 0.26 at one year to 0.16 at five years and to 0.14 for those patients for whom data were available at the 10-year mark. Of the 697 patients for whom five-year data was available, 78 percent were free from confirmed disability progression in the six months prior to assessment. The most common adverse events reported were viral upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and hypertension. The most common serious adverse events were MS relapse, basal cell carcinoma, and pneumonia.  Charting rise in treatment-satisfaction scores with switch to Aubagio Patients switching to Aubagio (teriflunomide) from other disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) showed improvements in treatment satisfaction up to 96 weeks after switching, researchers reported. Investigators drew on data from the Phase III TENERE study extension and the non-interventional TAURUS-MS I study. Both studies employed the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), which was administered at baseline and every 24 weeks thereafter in the TENERE extension study, and at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 in TAURUS-MS I. More than 650 patients from the two studies switched to 14 mg/day of Aubagio after having been on other DMTs. From baseline (initiation of Aubagio) to week 96, Global Satisfaction scores increased for patients from both studies. The average change from baseline was 9.1 in TENERE and 15.3 in TAURUS-MS I, with both changes being statistically significant. Tecfidera altered composition of gut microbiome in 12-week study  Tecfidera (delayed-release dimethyl fumarate) altered the gut microbiome in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients who took the oral disease-modifying therapy (DMT) over 12 weeks. The gut microbiome – the milieu of bacteria and other microbes found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract – is a major component of the body’s immune system. Recent research suggests that the composition of the microbiome, as defined by the presence and number of various microbes, may affect the course of MS. In a study involving 36 patients with RRMS, 17 types of microbes were significantly altered in MS patients compared with 165 healthy controls. In particular, people with MS had lower levels of compared to the healthy controls. Twenty-seven of the study participants received Tecfidera, while nine received an injectable DMT. At two weeks, subjects receiving Tecfidera reported a worsening of GI symptoms compared to baseline, but this impact on symptoms was not seen at 12 weeks. Meanwhile, at 12 weeks, the Tecfidera patients had an increased abundance of . Similar alterations were not seen in the participants receiving an injectable DMT. Researchers continue to investigate not only the role of the gut microbiome in MS, but also the impact that individual microbes may have on disease course. As those investigations continue, this study adds to the understanding of the interplay between MS medications and the composition of the microbiome. As the investigators note, “It could therefore be speculated that direct effects on the gut microbiome are part of the therapeutic actions” of Tecfidera. Exploring treatment outcomes in African Americans relative to Caucasian Americans Do treatment outcomes on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) differ between African Americans (AA) and Caucasian Americans (CA)? A team of researchers posed that question in the context of the widely held view that African Americans often have a more aggressive form of MS than Caucasian Americans, and therefore may require more efficacious therapies.   To find answers, those investigators conducted a retrospective analysis of the CombiRx study, a randomized controlled trial that evaluated combined use of interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate in relapsing-remitting MS. The CombiRx study followed patients for three years. Eighty-eight percent of the study’s 1,008 patients identified as Caucasian Americans, and 7 percent identified as African Americans. At the start of the study, the AA participants had worse disability and a higher total burden of brain/spine lesions than CA participants. Once on treatment, however, there was no difference in outcomes between the two groups. While that finding is welcome news, the researchers noted that there is a need to study larger numbers of African-American patients to further explore the relative efficacy of DMTs in the AA and CA populations. They added that research into the causes of disparity in disease burden prior to treatment also is warranted. Support for early initiation of Betaseron in clinically isolated syndrome Starting Betaseron (interferon beta-1b) sooner rather than later in clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) yields benefits up to 15 years after initiation of the disease-modifying therapy (DMT), researchers report. Investigators in the BENEFIT 15 study monitored long-term outcomes in people who had CIS and at least two lesions on MRI that were suggestive of MS. In an earlier, related study, those individuals were randomly assigned to receive Betaseron (early-treatment group) or placebo. After either two years or conversion to clinically definite MS (CDMS), patients in the placebo group were offered Betaseron (delayed-treatment group). Of the 468 participants who had been randomized in the initial study, 261 enrolled in a follow-up study 15 years later. One hundred and sixty one were in the early-treatment group and 100 were in the delayed-treatment group. In the delayed-treatment group, Betaseron had been initiated an average 1.5 years after randomization. The annualized relapse rate in the full analysis set was 0.18 over 15 years. Notably, however, the risk of relapse in the early-treatment group was 19-percent lower than in the delayed-treatment group, and the risk for conversion to clinically definite MS by Year 15 was 31-percent lower. The researchers concluded that their results “support a sustained benefit of early intervention in reducing the risk of relapse and conversion to CDMS.” Tracking the efficacy of interferon beta-1a for up to 10 years With many people with MS now on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for several years, there is an increasing focus on the long-term safety and effectiveness of those medications. Researchers recently evaluated the ongoing efficacy of one of the first DMTs, subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, in 1,240 individuals receiving care at four MS centers throughout Italy. (In the United States, subcutaneous interferon beta-1a is available as Rebif.) The primary endpoint of their study was the proportion of patients with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3) as measured by clinical relapse, confirmed disability progression, and MRI for brain/spine lesions. Seventy-one percent of the study participants were women, and the participants’ mean age at the start of treatment was 34.6 years. The patients were followed for an average of approximately 7.5 years. Seventy-four percent of patients remained on treatment at two-year follow-up, just under half were still on therapy at the 5-year mark, and 28 percent were on the medication after 10 years of follow-up. At two years, 44 percent of patients did not have evidence of disease activity, while 25 percent were free of disease activity at five years and 19 percent were at 10 years. The researchers concluded that those percentages constitute “further evidence of sustained interferon beta-1a efficacy in modifying the natural course of MS.” Plegridy use in real-world setting consistent with clinical trial findings A post-approval, real-world analysis of Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) in 963 patients with relapsing-remitting MS yielded safety and efficacy findings consistent with those from the pre-approval clinical trials of the DMT. The interim analysis from the Plegridy Observational Program included data on 242 newly diagnosed individuals and 721 people who had been diagnosed one year or longer before study entry. The newly diagnosed (ND) patients generally were younger than their non-newly diagnosed (NND) counterparts (mean age 37.7 years versus 46.0 years) and had less disability, but had experienced more relapses in the prior year. Treatment discontinuation rates were similar for the two groups (31 percent for ND patients versus 32 percent for NND patients). The most commonly cited reasons for treatment discontinuation in both groups were adverse effects and lack of efficacy. The most frequently reported adverse effects were redness at the injection site and influenza-like illness. Eighty-two percent of newly diagnosed individuals and 85 percent of those who were non-newly diagnosed were relapse-free up to two years after starting Plegridy.   Glatiramer acetate slows disability progression for up to 10 years Glatiramer acetate, which is marketed as Copaxone and in generic formulations, including Glatopa, showed enduring benefit over the course of 10 years of therapy, making it a cost-effective option for long-term treatment of relapsing-remitting MS, according to British investigators. The researchers drew on clinical data and cost-effectiveness models to assess the impact of glatiramer acetate (GA) on patient health and health-system economics. The analysis included 752 people treated with GA and another 898 people with MS who were not treated. The investigators found that, relative to no treatment, GA use led to a 17-percent reduction in disability progression as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Further, among people treated with GA, there was only a 1.2-percent difference in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores in six-year and 10-year data. The study’s authors concluded that the 10-year analysis “continues to support the long-term efficacy of GA in terms of disability, based on EDSS, and utility with no apparent evidence of a waning in treatment effect” making it highly cost-effective based on prevailing prices in the United Kingdom.   Reductions in relapse rate, MRI disease activity after three-to-five years of Ocrevus Two studies of people with relapsing-remitting MS show that use of the disease modifying therapy (DMT) Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) for three-to-five years is associated with reductions in annualized relapse rate (ARR) and several MRI measures of disease activity, according to researchers. The studies followed patients who had participated in the Phase III OPERA I and OPERA II trials that led to FDA approval of Ocrevus. In those 96-week studies, patients were randomized to receive either Ocrevus or interferon beta-1a. Upon completion of the Phase III trials, patients were able to enter an open-label extension study in which they would either continue on Ocrevus, if they had been assigned to receive that medication initially, or switch from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus if they had been in the comparator group. Among those who received Ocrevus during the initial two-year trial and for three years afterwards in the open-label extension, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) declined from 0.13 in the year before the open-label extension to 0.07 at Year 3 of the extension (or five years, in total, from starting Ocrevus). For individuals who switched from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus, the ARR decreased from 0.20 in the year before switching to 0.07 at three years post-switch. At five-year follow-up, the proportion of people with clinically defined disability progression was lower in those who had been on Ocrevus for five years than for those who had taken the medication for three years. Meanwhile, in people who switched from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus, the adjusted number of T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI was 0.48 lesions/scan prior to switching medications, and decreased to rates of 0.007, 0.004, and 0.004 after one, two, and three years, respectively, on Ocrevus. Individuals on Ocrevus for the full five-year period maintained low numbers of lesions on MRI. Compared to patients who started Ocrevus after two years on interferon beta-1a, those treated with Ocrevus from the outset had less brain atrophy as measured by whole brain volume, grey matter volume, and white matter volume on MRI. No MRI disease activity in most study subjects after six years on Lemtrada Most people with relapsing-remitting MS who began therapy with Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) after having received subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in a clinical trial were free of MRI indications of disease activity six years after switching medications, researchers reported. The TOPAZ trial followed 143 patients who initially had received subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in the Phase III CARE-MS study. These individuals entered an initial extension study in which they switched to Lemtrada, which was given in doses of 12 mg/day for five days at baseline, and then 12 mg/day for three days 12 months or more later. The participants were then eligible to enter TOPAZ, an additional five-year extension study. In TOPAZ, investigators had the option of giving these patients additional courses of alemtuzumab or another disease-modifying therapy as they thought necessary. Eighty-two percent of the participating patients completed Year 2 of TOPAZ (Year 6 after starting Lemtrada). Fifty-seven percent did not receive an additional dose of Lemtrada or another DMT during those six years. The annualized relapse rate at Year 6 after Lemtrada initiation was 0.19 percent. Further, 69 percent of patients were free of MRI disease activity, and 89 percent did not have new gadolinium-enhancing lesions. Meanwhile, safety results were consistent with those seen in Lemtrada-treated patients in the initial CARE-2 study and its two-year extension. Overall, researchers noted, Lemtrada improved clinical and imaging outcomes in patients who switched to the medication after receiving subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, and those improvements were sustained over six years in the absence of further treatment. Assessing the long-term safety and effectiveness of Tysabri An analysis of more than 6,100 people with relapsing-remitting MS who have taken Tysabri (natalizumab) for several years shows the long-term effectiveness of the medication and indicates that its safety profile remains consistent with ongoing use, researchers reported. Investigators drew on data from the Tysabri Observational Program (TOP) to characterize the Tysabri patient population and assess the medication’s impact on relapses and other measures of MS activity. At the time of the analysis, the program included 6,149 participants. Their median exposure to Tysabri was 38 doses, and median follow-up time was slightly over five years. Fifty-two percent of patients had discontinued the medication. The patients’ annualized relapse rate declined by 89 percent while on Tysabri, from 1.99 prior to starting the medication to 0.21. The greatest reduction was seen in the approximately 10 percent of patients who had not taken another disease-modifying therapy (DMT), but those who had taken one or two prior DMTs saw ARR reductions of 93 percent and 87 percent, respectively. Fourteen percent of these individuals experienced at least one serious adverse effect, with infections/infestations being the most commonly reported issues.   Evobrutinib shows favorable impact on lesion count, relapse rates Evobrutinib, or M2951, is an orally administered compound being investigated as a potential treatment for immune-mediated diseases including MS, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Evobrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the development and function of immune cells, including B lymphocytes and macrophages. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers announced 24-week results of a double-blind, randomized, 48-week, Phase II study of evobrutinib in patients aged 18 to 65 years with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) or secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) with relapses. In the study, 267 participants were randomized to receive evobrutinib 25 mg daily, 75 mg daily, 75 mg twice daily, placebo, or open-label Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate 240 mg twice-daily. (The Tecfidera group served as a reference arm in the study, and no formal comparisons were made between people in that group and those receiving evobrutinib or placebo.) The study’s primary endpoint was the sum of T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24. The annualized relapse rate (ARR) at 24 weeks was a key secondary endpoint, as were safety assessments. The primary analysis comparing the evobrutinib groups to the placebo group was planned to occur when all randomized patients either reached 24 weeks of treatment or had discontinued the study before that point. Ninety-one percent of patients completed 24 weeks of therapy. The study met its primary endpoint, with patients in the evobrutinib 75-mg once-daily and 75-mg twice-daily groups having significantly fewer gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions than placebo patients at each time point studied. For weeks 12-24, the mean total of such lesions was 3.85 in the placebo group, 4.06 in the evobrutinib 25 mg once-daily group, 1.69 in the evobrutinib 75 mg once-daily group, and 1.15 in the evobrutinib 75 mg twice-daily group. The evobrutinib 75 mg once-daily and 75 mg twice-daily groups also had greater reductions in the ARR than placebo. No treatment-associated infections or significant reductions in lymphocyte counts were observed in those receiving evobrutinib. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, occurring in more than 5 percent of patients, included increased liver-enzyme levels in patients receiving 75 mg of evobrutinib twice daily, but these changes were reversible and did not cause symptoms. French study details impact of biotin on disability measure, walking speed   Biotin is a vitamin involved in energy metabolism and fatty acid synthesis, including the activation of an enzyme in myelin synthesis. In the MS-SPI study, a high-dose, pharmaceutical-grade biotin known as MD1003 reversed MS-related disease disability in 13 percent of patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS). To assess the efficacy and safety of MD1003 in a real-world setting, as opposed to in a clinical trial such as MS-SPI, researchers monitored outcomes in primary-progressive MS (PPMS) and secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) patients at a clinic in France. From January 2016 through May 2018, 220 individuals with progressive MS who were receiving care at the clinic in Toulouse, France, received 300 mg/day of the oral medication. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers presented data on the first 91 patients to complete one year of follow-up. Those patients’ mean age at baseline was 59.5 years. Sixty-two percent were females, and 70 percent had SPMS. The mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at baseline was 5.9, and their mean timed 25-foot walk time was 50.7 seconds. At the end of one year of treatment with MD1003, 23 percent of the participants had an improvement in their EDSS score and 23 percent had a 20 percent or greater improvement in the time it took them to walk 25 feet. During the one-year period, 11 percent of patients had active disease, such as a clinically defined relapse, a gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesion on MRI, or both. Researchers said, “This real-world study supports the growing body of evidence that MD1003 is an effective and safe treatment for PMS.”  Gauging the impact of ozanimod on early and advanced relapsing-remitting MS Ozanimod is a once-daily, oral immunomodulator that targets two cell-surface receptors, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 1 and 5, suspected of playing a role in multiple sclerosis. The agent was evaluated in two Phase III studies, SUNBEAM and RADIANCE. In SUNBEAM, individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) received ozanimod on a daily basis (either ozanimod HCl 1 mg or 0.5 mg) or a weekly injection of interferon beta-1a for 12 months or longer. In RADIANCE, the participants were randomized to the same treatments, but for 24 months. More than 2,600 people participated in the trials. A post hoc analysis presented at the 2018 ECTRIMS meeting examined how outcomes in SUNBEAM and RADIANCE differed between patients with early RRMS and advanced RRMS. The designation of early MS was based on a composite baseline profile that included three years or less from diagnosis, an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ≤3.5, and use of one or no disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The early MS group consisted of 1,392 patients, while there were 1,267 people in the advanced MS group. Thirteen hundred and ninety-two patients were included in the early MS group. Key differences between the two groups at baseline included median years since diagnosis (0.5 years for the early group and 5.7 for the advanced group), median EDSS (2.0 versus 3.5), mean relapses within the last year (1.4 versus 1.2), and mean count of gadolinium-enhancing lesions (1.77 versus 1.67). In both the early and advanced RRMS groups, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) was lower in those who received ozanimod than in patients who received interferon. In the early group, the ARR was 0.149 for those on 1 mg of ozanimod HCI, 0.200 for the ozanimod HCI 0.5 mg patients, and 0.285 for the interferon group. The annualized relapse rates in the advanced RRMS group were 0.217 for ozanimod HCI 1 mg, 0.277 for ozanimod HCI 0.5 mg, and 0.363 for interferon. MRI measures of disease activity also favored ozanimod over interferon. In both the early and advanced RRMS groups, individuals receiving either dose of ozanimod had lower mean numbers of gadolinium-enhancing lesions and new/enlarging T2 lesions at 12 months than patients receiving interferon. Surveying real-world experience with treating MS with rituximab Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis and several forms of cancer. Because it depletes B cells, which are key components of the immune system, some neurologists prescribe rituximab to treat MS, although it currently does not have FDA approval specifically for use in MS. Investigators at the University of Colorado’s Rocky Mountain MS Center examined the safety and effectiveness of rituximab in 125 people with MS. The participants had an average age of 44 years and had an MS disease duration of slightly more than 10 years. Seventy-two percent were female; 62 percent had relapsing-remitting MS. With an average follow-up of 40.6 months, most individuals had six or seven rituximab infusions. While on rituximab, 16 percent of participants had infections requiring an emergency department visit, and 11 percent had infections necessitating hospitalization. Thirty-seven percent of patients had an infusion reaction on their first infusion that required interrupting the infusion, but that percentage fell to 14 percent on the second infusion. None experienced an infusion reaction that required hospitalization. Two individuals (1.6 percent of the total) were diagnosed with cancer after starting rituximab. While on rituximab treatment, 5 percent of patients had a clinical relapse, 2 percent had an enhancing lesion on MRI, and – based on detailed analysis – 8 percent of those with available MRI data had a new lesion on T2 imaging. Those findings prompted the researcher to conclude that rituximab appears to be a safe and effective option for long-term MS treatment. Two trials to examine the monoclonal antibody ofatumumab in relapsing-remitting MS Two Phase III trials will assess the safety and efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody ofatumumab relative to Aubagio (teriflunamide) in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Like Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), ofatumumab targets the CD20 marker on the surface of B cells. The identically designed ASCLEPIOS I and ASCLEPIOS II trials have enrolled a combined total of 1,884 patients in 37 countries. Study participants will be randomized to receive either 20 mg subcutaneous injections of ofatumumab every four weeks (following an initial regimen of three 20-mg subcutaneous doses per week in the first 14 days) or 14 mg of Aubagio taken orally once daily. Annualized rate of confirmed relapses is the primary endpoint for both trials. Secondary outcomes include confirmed disability worsening and MRI-related measures. Enrollment for both studies has been completed. Both employ an adaptive design in which study duration is not fixed over a specified period of time but rather is dependent on reaching a pre-specified number of events. Phase II study to explore impact of opicinumab in targeted population Early-phase research into investigational agents often identifies patient groups that have a better response to treatment than other patient types. That was the case in the Phase II SYNERGY study of opicinumab. Opicinumab is a human monoclonal antibody active against LINGO-1, a protein that exercises an effect on the differentiation and regeneration of central nervous system cells. SYNERGY investigated the infused medication’s safety and efficacy as an add-on therapy to disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in MS. The study found that a patient subpopulation (defined by disease duration and baseline MRI findings) was associated with an enhanced response to treatment. The Phase II AFFINITY trial is following up on those findings by taking a closer look at the impact of opicinumab in that patient population. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers provided an overview of the AFFINITY study’s design and demographics. AFFINITY is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 750 mg of opicinumab administered intravenously every four weeks compared to placebo as an add-on to DMTs. The trial will last for 72 weeks. The population being studied encompasses people aged 18-58 years with relapsing-remitting or secondary-progressive MS who have had MS for 20 years or less and who have Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 2.0 and 6.0. Further, the study’s inclusion criteria specify a clinical relapse in the last four to 24 months or brain MRI evidence of disease activity in the past two years. Because opicinumab is being studied as an add-on therapy, patients must be stable on interferon beta, dimethyl fumarate, or natalizumab for at least six months. Further, the patients must have brain imaging findings indicative of lower myelin content and more preserved tissue integrity in brain T2 lesions. The study’s main endpoint is Overall Response Score, an integrated assessment of disability improvement and worsening based on the EDSS and other measures. The study began in September 2017, and remains open to enrollment. Study investigators noted that AFFINITY is expected to enroll approximately 240 participants at roughly 150 sites in about 25 countries. Cladribine is an oral medication approved for use in several countries for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). It is not approved for that use in the United States. The medication has an unusual dosing pattern in that it is taken for up to 20 days over the course of two years. It also has an unusual mechanism of action: it targets the immune system’s B cells and T cells, leading to a reduction in the total count of those cells followed by a distinct pattern of “reconstitution” as new B cells and T cells are produced. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers presented an update on the safety profile of Cladribine Tablets in people with RRMS who took the medication as a monotherapy (without use of other MS agents at the same time). The study assessed data from three clinical trials and a patient registry, and reported information collected through May 2017. The analysis included data on 923 patients who received cladribine at a dose of 3.5 mg/kg and 641 patients who received placebo. It focused on the incidence of adverse events per 100 patient-years. The cladribine group had an average age of 36.5 years at study enrollment; two-thirds of the cladribine patients were women. The rate of serious treatment-emergent adverse events per 100 patient years through May 2017 was 3.88 for the cladribine group and 2.24 for the placebo group. Adverse events occurring at a higher rate in the cladribine group than in the placebo group included abnormally low levels of lymphocytes (a white blood cell) and serious infections, including serious herpes zoster. Study authors concluded that the updated safety profile “was generally consistent with that from two years prior,” adding, “No new major safety findings were identified in the updated dataset, where patients were followed for up to 10 years.”  Elezanumab: Phase I trial supports the need for larger studies A small, early-stage study of a monoclonal antibody directed at a new target in MS showed the medication to be well-tolerated, but did not demonstrate a clear-cut impact on symptoms, highlighting the need for further testing in a larger population, the study’s authors said. Elezanumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa), which has been shown to inhibit key processes in neurologic regeneration and functional recovery following inflammation or trauma. A Phase I placebo-controlled, 29-week study randomized 20 people with MS to one of three treatment groups or to a placebo group. Elezanumab was administered intravenously every four weeks for a total of four doses. Patients in the three active treatment groups received an initial “loading” dose followed by maintenance doses of either 150 mg, 600 mg, or 1800 mg of elezanumab. Twenty-five percent of all participants reported headaches. Most individuals receiving elazanumab did not report a clinically significant improvement in, or worsening of, MS symptoms. However, testing showed that as levels of elezanumab in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) increased, levels of free soluble RGMA decreased, while total RGMA (both free and antibody-bound) increased in step with CSF elezanumab exposure. Investigators concluded that, “Additional long-term studies are required to elucidate elezanumab efficacy in a more robust patient population.” Survey results reveal people with multiple sclerosis want more information on preventing brain atrophy Cognitive changes are a common symptom of multiple sclerosis, affecting more than half of those living with the condition. A new survey examines the topic of brain volume loss, known as brain atrophy, in people with multiple sclerosis. The survey, conducted by the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA) and sponsored by Celgene, included more than 1,300 people with multiple sclerosis or someone responding on their behalf. Based on the survey findings that were presented at ECTRIMS 2018, maintaining cognitive function is the second most common concern for respondents. Only the prevention of physical disability progression was reported more often (45 percent). The survey findings also suggest that there is a high level of interest in better understanding how brain atrophy may impact disease progression. Sixty-three percent of respondents reported that they have not talked to any member of their medical team about brain atrophy, and only 20 percent reported being moderately or very satisfied with the amount of information available on potential ways to prevent brain atrophy. These study results indicate that additional education on the topic of brain atrophy is an area of interest to the MS community. Global initiative seeks to improve shared decision-making and communication between healthcare professionals, patients, and care partners Navigating Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a global initiative that aims to improve outcomes for people with MS through the global adoption of strategies that optimize therapeutic decision-making. This initiative also aims to improve the way that healthcare professionals, patients, and care partners communicate around benefit and risk in the management and treatment of their disease. In order to better understand the potential barriers to effective communications and shared-decision making, the Navigating MS Steering Committee developed and distributed a survey to MS healthcare professionals and people with MS to identify potential and perceived barriers to successful shared-decision making in MS practice. A total of 73 neurologists, 104 nurses, and 1,184 individuals with MS have responded to the survey. Differences in the perception of neurologists, nurses, and people with MS regarding the adequacy of resources required for successful shared-decision making was demonstrated in the data received. Four main areas of contention were identified: lack of education, resources, time, and variable involvement of the interdisciplinary (healthcare) team. Nurse respondents indicated a perceived proficiency with shared-decision making and adequacy of education and training to fulfil this role. However, 73 percent of people with MS who responded indicated a strong preference for engagement with the neurologist in discussing the benefits and risks of treatment options. There was no clear consensus regarding the degree to which decision-making is accurately a collaborative process within the interdisciplinary team. Half of the nurses stated that the decisions were shared, although people with MS reported a lot of ambiguity and variation in how actively involved they were in the decision-making process. Despite neurologists stating the main barrier to shared-decision making was lack of time, 49 percent of people with MS strongly disagreed that time was a barrier to shared-decision making, with 60 percent of nurses reporting clinic timeframes as adequate. The disagreement in perceptions among clinicians and people with MS demonstrates an ongoing need to educate both healthcare professionals and patients on best practices in adopting a shared-decision making approach to discussions around treatment decisions. The Navigation MS initiative has received funding from Biogen, Celgene, EMD Serono, Genentech, Novartis, and Sanofi Genzyme.  It might seem paradoxical that people who experience fatigue should exert themselves in order to have more energy, but that is exactly what researchers found when conducting a study of 60 individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and fatigue. The 47 females and 13 males participating in the study had an average age of 30 years and a baseline mean Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score of 56.7. They were divided into two groups, balanced by age, gender and FSS score. People in the first group walked on a treadmill three times a week for six weeks, with the pace increasing from easy to brisk during each session and the duration of exercise increasing from 10-15 minutes initially to 25-32 minutes by the end of the study. People in the second group did not exercise but instead received amantadine, a medication used to treat movement disorders. While the people who did not exercise had no meaningful change in their FSS scores over the 12-week course of the study, those assigned to the exercise group saw their mean FSS score improve to 35.67 (versus 56.7 for all at the start of the study) at six weeks and to further improve to 29.11 at 12 weeks. The researchers concluded, “A specially designed walking exercise program with gradual increments in time and speed for 12 weeks can improve fatigue in RRMS patients. A long-term follow-up is recommended to verify the maintained effect on such improvement.”  Securing the long-term benefits of activity in MS: “Keep going!” Is the improvement in quality of life typically seen in exercise and activity programs for people with MS sustained after those programs end? That is the question a team of investigators posed in a study of 56 women with MS. Their answer: Yes, over the short term; and no, over the long term. The women, who had an average age of 34.5 years, were divided into groups, with some assigned to exercise and others to engaging in leisure-time activities such as making crafts. The women completed surveys to measure their sleep quality, fatigue, and depression, if any, at the start of the study and at several points afterward. Women in both groups showed improvement in sleep, fatigue, and depression at the end of the study and four weeks after its conclusion. By the 20-week mark after the study, however, MS symptoms had begun to increase, leading the researchers to comment that “continuous exercising appears to be of utmost importance for keeping symptoms of depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances stably low.” There is growing evidence that diet plays a role in the MS disease course, but researchers continue to debate how best to study the issue in a scientifically rigorous manner. One practical concern is whether sufficient numbers of people with MS will be able to adhere to restrictive diets long enough for studies to yield valid results. A six-month pilot study involving 36 women with MS provides encouraging news in this regard. The study assigned 18 of the women to the intervention group – and to following a restrictive, modified Mediterranean diet for six months. The women in this group participated in training sessions with a nutritionist and attended monthly meetings to assess and encourage their adherence to the diet. The other 18 participants acted as a control group; they participated in educational seminars. All 18 women in the intervention group completed the study, with a 90.3-percent mean self-reported rate of adhering to the study diet. At the time of the ECTRIMS meeting in early October, 14 of the 18 women in the control group had completed the six-month study, three more were on track to finish in the weeks just ahead, and there was only one anticipated drop out. Sixteen of the 18 women in the intervention group reported that their overall health had benefited from following the study diet, with 14 women reporting benefit in terms of specific MS symptoms. The intervention group subjects also showed greater improvement than the women in the control group on measures of fatigue and MS impact. The researchers concluded, “It is feasible to enroll MS patients into a rigorous dietary intervention study requiring significant commitment and randomization and reasonable to expect high adherence to this type of dietary program utilizing educational methods to promote adherence.” They added, “Larger-scale clinical trials to assess the role of diet for symptom management and even as a disease modifier in MS are feasible and warranted.” Exploring the impact of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet on MS The benefits of a ketogenic diet – a high-fat, low-carbohydrate eating plan – have long been promoted by some people with MS and their physicians, while others have said that there has not been adequate research to support the approach. A recent pilot study sought to add to the knowledge base on the subject by assessing how following a ketogenic diet for six months affected 20 people with relapsing-remitting MS. Researchers reported that no subjects experienced worsening diseases – as assessed by clinical symptoms and brain MRI – while on the diet. Further, fatigue and depression scores improved from baseline, and body-mass index and insulin levels declined. While additional data is being collected, those findings prompted the investigators to conclude that ketogenic diets appear to be “safe, feasible, and well-tolerated” in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Despite the old saying, misery doesn’t actually appear to love company  The more social support a person with MS enjoys, the less pain is likely to interfere with his or her life – even as the intensity of pain increases. That is the bottom-line finding of a study involving 196 people with MS who reported experiencing pain. Study participants had an average age of almost 54 years; 82 percent were women and 18 percent were men. Researchers assessed the participants’ degree of social support, pain intensity, and pain interference at the start of the study and again after an average of roughly 3.5 years. As would be expected, as the intensity of pain changed, so did the extent to which pain caused interference in a person’s life. However, the study also found that “higher levels of perceived social support [are] associated with subsequent improvements over time in pain interference in individuals with MS and pain, even when controlling for changes in pain intensity.” In simpler language, the more friends, family members, and other meaningful relationships a person has in his or her life, the less he or she will experience interference from pain, even when the pain is intensified. Conversely, the investigators found that “lower levels of social support prospectively predict increases in pain interference.” Commenting that their findings “are consistent with other research indicating multiple health benefits from the presence of social support,” the study’s authors noted the importance of investigating means to enhance such support for people with MS who are experiencing pain. Pain and sleep issues are top reasons for cannabis-based product use in people with MS Roughly one in five people with MS surveyed by researchers at a Canadian hospital reported using cannabis-based products (CBP) on a regular basis, with pain and sleep problems as the most commonly cited reasons for use. Investigators at the University of British Columbia MS clinic distributed surveys on CBP use to 600 patients attending the clinic from January to March 2018. Two hundred and fifty-nine participants completed and returned the survey. Seventy-five percent of the respondents were female, and the most common age range of respondents was 45 to 55 years. Sixty-one percent of respondents reported never using CBP, and another 16 percent said they rarely did so. Of the remainder, 15 percent reported daily use, 4 percent said they used CBP weekly, and 3 percent said they used CBP on a monthly basis. Researchers noted that responder bias might cause overestimation of CBP use. Seventy-one percent of regular CBP users said they sought relief from pain with a cannabis-based product. Help with sleep also was cited by 71 percent of respondents. Other reported reasons for use included mood (44 percent), spasticity (40 percent), tremor (11 percent), and bladder dysfunction (9 percent). Ninety-five percent of regular users said they had obtained relief of symptoms from CBP. More than half (52 percent) had discussed their CBP use with a neurologist; 35 percent had not tried other symptomatic medications. With the increasing liberalization of state laws regarding use of cannabis-based products for both medical and recreational purposes, CBP is likely to be an increasingly accessible option for more and more people with MS. Reassurance on use of DMTs in women pursuing pregnancy “How will this medication affect my ability to conceive, and to deliver a healthy baby?” It’s a question MS clinicians hear frequently when talking with women of child-bearing age about starting a disease-modifying therapy (DMT). A recent retrospective analysis by Israeli researchers provides reassuring news with regard to this important concern. The investigators examined data on 125 women with relapsing-remitting MS who had a total of 219 live births between 2002 and 2017. They divided the women into three groups: those who were not treated with a DMT in the three months prior to becoming pregnant; those who were treated in the three months prior to pregnancy; and those who were treated during pregnancy. After adjusting for factors including age, disease severity, and known fertility problems, the researchers found that use of DMTs shortly before and during pregnancy did not affect fertility or pregnancy outcomes. They found no significant differences between women in the three groups in terms of the need for fertility treatment and time to pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, complications during pregnancy, or incidence of relapses during pregnancy or in the first year following delivery. The investigators concluded, “The decision regarding DMTs treatment in RRMS patients during child-bearing years should not be influenced by the question of pregnancy in the near future.” However, treatment discussions along with pregnancy planning should always be discussed with one’s healthcare team in advance. Additionally, none of the DMTs have been approved by the FDA for use during pregnancy and certain DMTs may present more of a risk than others. Sexual dysfunction common in women with clinically isolated syndrome   More than one-half of women with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), a common precursor to MS, experience sexual dysfunction. That is the main finding of a small study in which Egyptian researchers gathered data from August 2011 to June 2017. Noting that sexual dysfunction has been reported in between 40 percent and 80 percent of women with multiple sclerosis, the investigators sought to determine the frequency of the condition in CIS. They had 43 women with CIS complete the Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire (MSIQ-19), as well as instruments assessing fatigue, cognitive function, anxiety, and depression. Fifty-six percent of the women reported at least one manifestation of sexual dysfunction. Eight cited a lack of sexual interest or desire, five reported less intense orgasms, and four said they experienced inadequate vaginal lubrication. Beyond those primary aspects of sexual dysfunction, women also reported that symptoms of CIS – such as urinary and bowel problems and difficulty with concentration – interfered with their sexual function. Lack of confidence about sexuality and fear of rejection also was reported to contribute to sexual difficulties. Fatigue and depression were significant predictors of sexual dysfunction. Further, women who reported sexual dysfunction were older than those who did not report such difficulties (27.5 years versus 23.1 years), but the two groups did not differ in terms of occupation, educational level, or location of brain/spine lesions on MRI. The investigators noted that four patients reported experiencing sexual dysfunction before the emergence of neurological symptoms of MS. As researchers continue to “fill in the gaps” on the many facets of CIS, this study points to the importance of patients talking frankly with clinicians about the full range of issues they may be experiencing. Is menopause a turning point for MS disease course? Relapse rates declined but disability increased in the years following menopause among 148 women with relapsing forms of MS, suggesting that “natural menopause could be a turning point to a less inflammatory, progressive phase of disease,” according to researchers. Those findings and conclusions are from an observational study conducted at 16 MS centers across Italy. Women were followed for a period of roughly 3.5 years before and after natural menopause, meaning menopause not brought about by surgical removal of the ovaries. Ninety-three percent of the women received disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) during that period. The annualized relapse rate (ARR) for the women declined from 0.22 before menopause to 0.13 following menopause. However, their scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) increased from a median of 2.0 at menopause to 2.27 two years later and to 2.46 four years after menopause. On the EDSS, an increasing score reflects increased disability. The investigators noted that the findings are in keeping with the results of earlier research they have conducted with a smaller group of women. The impact of endocrine (or hormonal) factors on MS is a focus of considerable research, and studies such as this one suggest avenues for further investigation, while also helping clinicians and patients better anticipate changes that may await across one’s lifespan.  Promising results for stem cell therapy in “aggressive MS”  Clinicians long have faced a challenge in treating “aggressive MS” – a term used when one’s MS is marked by frequent relapses and rapid progression of disability. An international study presented at the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting offers hope that removing, treating, and re-infusing a patient’s own hematopoietic (blood-tissue forming) stem cells may be a safe and effective first-line therapy for this uncommon but extremely debilitating type of MS. The study involved 20 patients treated in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada, Italy, and the United States. None had received more than three months of standard DMT treatment before undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or AHSCT (with autologous signifying that the cells came from the patient, rather than from a donor). The patients, who ranged in age from 19 to 52 years, had a median EDSS score of 6.5 prior to treatment. They were followed for a median time of 30 months after transplantation. The median improvement in their EDSS score from pre-treatment to last follow-up was 2.5, which was a statistically significant difference. None had a clinical relapse following transplant. Three patients had new lesions on MRI at their first follow-up visit, but no other new or gadolinium-enhancing lesions were seen on later scans. The investigators reported that, “There were routine toxicities, but no treatment-related mortality.” The researchers added that the study results demonstrate the potential role of AHSCT as a first-line treatment for aggressive MS. Additional studies will continue to provide answers on the potential benefits and risks of this intriguing experimental treatment. Low immunization rates against respiratory disease in people with MS Pneumonia and influenza pose serious threats in the setting of MS, but more than 70 percent of people with MS in an Argentine study had not been vaccinated against either illness, researchers reported. The investigators noted that age, smoking, severe disability, and use of immunosuppressive medications all increase the risk of respiratory infections, adding that people with MS have a risk three-times higher than that of the general population for contracting community-acquired pneumonia. Against that backdrop, the researchers conducted an online survey of 220 people with MS and 62 healthy controls. The proportion of people not receiving either the pneumococcal pneumonia or influenza vaccine was high in both groups – 71.4 percent of people with MS and 79 percent of the healthy controls. Among the unvaccinated patients with MS, 80 percent were on a DMT medication, 31 percent smoked or had only recently stopped smoking, 22 percent were aged 50 years or older, and 11 percent had severe disability. The investigators concluded that the low vaccination rates combined with the high prevalence of risk factors among MS patients underscores the need to develop consensus policies on immunization in people who have MS. Impact of magnetic stimulation on balance in people with MS Using a coil held over a person’s head to direct magnetic stimulation to the brain improved balance and walking ability in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and a related movement disorder, according to a group of Egyptian researchers. The investigators studied 43 people with RRMS and truncal ataxia, a condition that can diminish balance and the ability to walk. In the first phase of their study, half of the participants received actual magnetic stimulation while the other half received a sham treatment. In the study’s second phase, all subjects received 12 sessions of magnetic stimulation over four weeks every third month, for a total of 48 sessions. Each session lasted several minutes. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and 10-Minute Walk Test (10MWT) were used to measure the impact of treatment, with patients assessed before, during, and at the completion of treatment. The researchers reported that from the pre-treatment baseline to the last session, participants saw a 36-percent improvement in the 10MWT and a 46-percent improvement in BBS score. These individuals also saw improvement on an imaging assessment of white matter in the brain. The investigators said that the adverse effects of treatment were mild and transitory, with two people reporting nausea, two experiencing dizziness, and three having headaches. Based on these findings, the researchers said that non-invasive, high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has a long-term beneficial effect on improving balance in people with MS and ataxia.

54577771-adaf-4cdb-a0c1-bac3dd4075c4,"The first three long-term treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) became available in the early to mid 1990s and were dubbed the “A-B-C” drugs because of their brand names: , , and . These are interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, and glatiramer acetate, respectively. In 2002, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved another interferon, (interferon beta-1a), for the long-term treatments of MS. This is the same drug as Avonex, but is injected differently and in more frequent and higher doses. In 2009, (interferon beta-1b) was also approved. This is the same medicinal product as Betaseron and is given in the same doses, but is marketed under a different brand name and by a different pharmaceutical company. In 2014, (peginterferon beta-1a) became the 11th DMT approved for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) – and the fifth interferon medication approved for MS. Plegridy is a pegylated version of interferon beta-1a. Pegylation is a chemical modification of a molecule (in this case the interferon beta-1a molecule) that extends its half-life, which refers to how long a drug stays active in the body before it is metabolized or eliminated. While Copaxone (noted earlier) was initially approved as a daily 20-mg injection, a 40-mg dose of Copaxone injected three-times weekly was approved by the FDA in 2014; physicians and their patients may choose either dose regimen. In April 2015, (glatiramer acetate injection) was approved as the 13th long-term treatment for individuals with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Glatopa is a generic version of Copaxone (glatiramer acetate injection), given at the original 20-mg daily dose, and as of February 2018, was also approved at the newer, 40-mg three-times-weekly injected dose. This is the first generic version of a disease-modifying therapy for MS to be approved by the FDA. In October 2017, was approved at both the 20-mg daily injected dose and the 40-mg three-times-weekly injected dose. All eight of these self-injected disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) listed above are approved by the FDA for treating either relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or all relapsing forms of MS. Some of these DMTs have also been approved for “clinically isolated syndrome” (CIS), which refers to the initial symptom a patient reports prior to a diagnosis of MS. Each of these treatments is administered by self injection at one’s home, with the frequency of injections ranging from once daily to once every two weeks, depending on the drug prescribed. These therapies have been used for several years and research shows that many people are doing well on these medications for extended periods of time (some for more than 20 years). Most side effects (such as flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions) are manageable through various strategies and over-the-counter medications. Blood tests may be given periodically to monitor various items, such as liver enzymes, the number of red blood cells and white blood cells, and the possible development of neutralizing antibodies* (please see note below). In May 2016, (daclizumab) became the 14th disease-modifying therapy to be approved for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of MS (RMS) in adults. However, please note that this medication was voluntarily withdrawn from the marketplace in March 2018 by its manufacturers and is no longer available to the MS community. This voluntary withdrawal was due to new safety concerns, including several cases of inflammatory encephalitis and meningoencephalitis (both forms of brain inflammation) that were reported in Europe, as well as earlier issues with liver failure. As background information, this monoclonal antibody was self-administered subcutaneously (under-the-skin) once per month and had been shown to reduce the number of relapses as well as new or newly enhancing lesions, as compared to another approved MS medication and to placebo, in two separate studies. This medication carried safety risks, which included liver injury and immune conditions. The FDA stated that Zinbryta would only be used in patients who had an inadequate response to two or more MS drugs. Zinbryta had a boxed warning, was available only through a restricted distribution program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, and monthly liver-function tests were required. In August 2020, the FDA approved (ofatumumab) for adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), which includes clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary-progressive disease. Kesimpta is a B-cell therapy, which binds to and depletes B-cells shown to be associated with disease activity in MS. Typically this type of therapy is only available via infusion at a hospital or infusion center; however, Kesimpta is the first self-administered B-cell therapy for MS. It is given monthly via subcutaneous injection at one’s home. The approval of Kesimpta is based on results from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS I and II studies, in which Kesimpta demonstrated superiority over Aubagio (oral teriflunomide) in significantly reducing the annualized relapse rate (ARR), three-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), and the number of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) T1 and new or enlarging T2 lesions. The most common side effects of Kesimpta include upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), with symptoms that include sore throat, runny nose, and headache, as well as headache not related to a URTI. Other serious but less-common side effects can occur. In 2000 (prior to the approval of some of the medications mentioned above), (mitoxantrone) was approved by the FDA for the long-term treatment of MS. This was the first drug indicated for RRMS, secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), and worsening RRMS. Novantrone has been used for many years to treat cancer. It is given via intravenous infusion once every three months. Side effects may include cardiac disease and leukemia, and for this reason, patients must be closely monitored and are limited to a maximum of two to three years of treatment with this drug. Because of the potential risks and with the approval of more long-term treatments for MS, Novantrone is seldom prescribed for individuals with MS. Anyone taking Novantrone now or given Novantrone previously needs to have (as noted in this advisory), even if no longer receiving this medication. In 2004, (natalizumab), was approved for relapsing forms of MS. It is administered via intravenous infusion every four weeks. After its initial approval, Tysabri was temporarily suspended after two individuals (taking Tysabri in combination with Avonex) developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which if not discovered early, is an often-fatal viral infection of the brain. Since that time, Tysabri has been re-approved and patients are closely monitored through the “TOUCH Prescribing Program.” In 2012, the FDA announced that three factors have been identified with increasing the risk of PML for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) being treated with Tysabri. These include: (1) the presence of JC virus antibodies (detected through a blood test); (2) previous treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, such as Novantrone, Imuran, or Cytoxan; and (3) the length of time an individual has been taking Tysabri – specifically beyond the two-year mark. More details are included in MSAA’s article, In November 2014, the FDA announced the approval of (alemtuzumab) for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). This is the 12th DMT to be approved for the long-term treatment of MS, and the third intravenous medication for MS. Given for a course of five days via intravenous (IV) infusion and followed one year later by a second three-day course, Lemtrada has been approved as a second-line therapy. This classification refers to a drug that may only be prescribed when other FDA-approved treatments fail or are not tolerated well by a patient. Lemtrada should generally be prescribed for patients who have had an inadequate response to two or more of the disease-modifying therapies, because of the medication’s safety profile. Adverse events from Lemtrada can include infusion reactions to the medication, an increased risk of infection, emergent autoimmune diseases, and other serious conditions. For early detection and management of these risks, Lemtrada is only available through a restricted distribution program, the Lemtrada REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy). REMS ensures that prescriptions are only given through certified prescribers and that patients are enrolled in this important safety and monitoring program. In March 2017, (ocrelizumab) became the 15th FDA-approved treatment, notably for two types of MS: relapsing forms of MS (RMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS). This is the first time that a medication for MS has been approved for two types of the disease, and the first time that any medication has been approved to treat PPMS. Ocrevus is given via intravenous (IV) infusion every six months. Ocrevus is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to selectively target CD20-positive B cells. These are a specific type of immune cell that is an important contributor to the MS-disease process. The fact that Ocrevus targets B cells differentiates it from most of the previously approved disease-modifying therapies for MS, which target a different type of immune cell called “T cells.” Side effects can include infusion reactions and an increase in infections. Other rare adverse events, including cancer and PML (described earlier with Tysabri), could potentially occur, but these risks are still being investigated. The eighth DMT for MS is (fingolimod), which was approved in September 2010. Pronounced as “Jil-EN-ee-ah,” this is the first oral drug available for the long-term treatment of MS. Until this time, all of the other approved treatments were given either via self injections at home or infusions at a medical facility. The approval of an oral treatment provides a more convenient and comfortable option to some individuals, particularly if they do not respond to or are unable to tolerate the other approved medications. As with the other treatments, Gilenya also has potential side effects and adverse events, including a temporary slowing of the heart rate, edema (swelling) behind the eye, and liver changes. PML (described earlier with Tysabri), could potentially occur, but this risk is still being investigated. In May 2018, Gilenya became the first DMT also approved for the treatment of children and adolescents, ages 10 through 17, with relapsing forms of MS. At this time, Gilenya is the only DMT approved for this patient population, referred to as “pediatric MS.” In December 2019, FDA approved the applications from three separate pharmaceutical companies for the first for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS in adult patients. While generic treatments carry the same benefits and risks of the initially approved medication, this approval does not include the treatment of children and adolescents. Details on when these generic versions will be available to the MS community have not yet been announced. In September 2012, (oral teriflunomide) became the ninth FDA-approved DMT for relapsing forms of MS — and the second approved DMT that is taken orally. Aubagio has been approved in two dose levels: 7 mg and 14 mg. While the higher dose (14 mg) shows greater effectiveness, for individuals who may be more sensitive to the drug and experience greater side effects, the lower dose (7 mg) may be more appropriate. In October 2014, Phase III data was added to Aubagio’s label, noting that it may (1) reduce the relative risk of sustained disability progression (along with reducing the annual relapse rate) and (2) prevent or delay a second clinical attack (relapse) in individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Common adverse events include headache, elevations in liver enzymes, hair thinning, diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia (a condition that reduces the number of certain white blood cells that normally fight infection), and paresthesia (tingling, burning, or numbing sensation). More severe adverse events include the risk of severe liver injury and the risk of birth defects if used during pregnancy. (dimethyl fumarate or DMF, formerly known as BG-12) was approved by the FDA as a first-line therapy for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of MS in March 2013. This is the 10th DMT for the long-term treatment of MS. Tecfidera is administered in pill form orally and is the third oral DMT approved for MS. The approved dosage is 240 mg to be taken two times daily. Clinical trials with Tecfidera showed a reduction in relapse rate, a delay in progression of physical disability, and a slowing in the development of brain lesions, as compared to placebo. The most commonly reported side effects are flushing and gastrointestinal events, occurring more often at the beginning of treatment, and decreasing in frequency after the first one to two months on this medication. PML (described earlier with Tysabri), could potentially occur, but this risk is still being investigated. In August 2020, the FDA awarded early approval of (dimethyl fumarate), an oral medication approved in 2013 for relapsing forms of MS in adults (as noted above). This is the first generic of any MS oral treatment available to individuals in the United States. Generic treatments have the same active ingredients and carry the same benefits and risks of the initially approved (brand-name) medication. Inactive ingredients can differ with generic medications, and generic treatments are not required to conduct the same degree of rigorous clinical trials prior to approval. Mylan’s generic version of Tecfidera is given in the same dosage, with both 120-mg and 240-mg delayed-release capsules available. In March 2019, (siponimod) oral tablets became the 16th approved DMT to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The approval includes individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) – a form of MS where someone with RRMS advances to experiencing a more steady increase in disability, but relapses are still occurring. Taken by mouth once daily, Mayzent has been shown to reduce the risk of three-month and six-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), slow the rate of brain volume loss, and reduce the annual relapse rate. Headache, high blood pressure, and changes in liver function tests were the most common adverse reactions reported. Patients taking Mayzent need to be monitored for changes in vision caused by macular edema, transient decreases in heart rate, decline in lung function, and changes in liver enzymes; women who could become pregnant should use contraception during and for 10 days after stopping treatment. Also in March 2019, (cladribine) oral tablets became the 17th approved DMT to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The approval is for individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and for individuals with active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Mavenclad is generally recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the treatment of MS. This oral medication is given in two annual courses for a maximum of 20 days over two years; no treatment is needed for Years 3 and 4. Mavenclad has been shown to reduce disease activity in patients with relapsing MS, including disability progression, annualized relapse rate, and MRI activity. Potential adverse events include lymphopenia, a condition that causes abnormally low counts of white blood cells that play a role in fighting infection, and herpes zoster infection. Mavenclad has a Boxed Warning for an increased risk of malignancy (cancer) and fetal harm. The most common adverse reactions include upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and decreased lymphocyte counts. In December 2019, the FDA approved (diroximel fumarate) oral capsules to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). This approval includes the treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). This medication is taken by mouth twice daily. Vumerity is in the same class of MS therapy as Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), but is believed to cause fewer gastrointestinal (GI) side effects – such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. (ozanimod) was approved in March 2020 for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). This once-daily oral medication is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator and joins two other previously approved S1P receptor modulators: Gilenya (fingolimod) and Mayzent (siponimod). However, unlike the first two medications, Zeposia does not require a genetic test or label-based first-dose observation. In clinical trials, Zeposia was shown to have a significant effect on reducing the annual relapse rate (ARR) as well as the number of brain lesions, when compared to Avonex (interferon beta-1a). The most common adverse reactions include: upper respiratory infection; elevated liver enzymes; orthostatic hypotension, which is a sudden drop in blood pressure when changing position; urinary tract infection; back pain; and high blood pressure. Warnings and precautions include an increased risk of infections, heart-rhythm issues, liver injury, fetal risk if pregnant while taking Zeposia, a decline in pulmonary (respiratory) function, and macular edema (swelling behind the eye). The launch date for Zeposia has not yet been announced. In April 2020, the FDA approved (monomethyl fumarate) delayed-release oral capsules to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Bafiertam is a “bioequivalent alternative” to Biogen’s Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), which means that the active ingredient and site of action do not differ significantly between the two medications. The therapeutic effect is assumed to be equivalent. Since a lower dose of Bafiertam is equivalent to Tecfidera, this may potentially lead to a reduction in gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. However, these side effects have not been evaluated in clinical trials in people with relapsing forms of MS. The launch date for Bafiertam has not yet been announced. Individuals are usually prescribed only one type of DMT during any one time period. Several large clinical trials have been conducted to study each of these drugs separately for their safety and effectiveness in MS. Although differences exist in study design and specific findings, trials generally showed these common results: Reduced the development of new areas of inflammation as seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans Showed some evidence of delaying disease progression and/or disability Some may prevent or delay a second clinical attack (relapse) for individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CIS refers to individuals who do not meet the criteria to be diagnosed with MS, but have experienced symptoms. The documented effectiveness of each of these drugs varies to some extent, and differences can be attributed to the type of the drug, dose and administration, as well as variations in study design. Stronger drugs may offer greater effectiveness but may also pose greater health risks. Additionally, the effectiveness and side effects of each drug may vary from one patient to another, so individuals need to consult with their physician to determine which treatment might be the best option for them. Each of the approved treatments has side effects that are usually manageable. At this time, Novantrone is the only drug that has a set limit of doses, which is necessary to avoid cardiotoxicity (heart damage). Tysabri increases the risk of PML (described above) and patients are closely monitored through the “TOUCH Prescribing Program.” For early detection and management of potentially severe adverse events, Lemtrada is only available through the Lemtrada REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy). Patients beginning on Gilenya are monitored for changes in heart rate and are given baseline evaluations for any issues with the heart, lungs, liver, eyes and vision, as well as white-blood-cell count. The other drugs mentioned earlier appear safe provided the person taking the drug is not experiencing any adverse effects and blood tests continue to be normal. While no damage to the reproductive system or the fetus has been observed, these drugs are not recommended if a woman is pregnant or considering pregnancy during her treatment period. Male patients considering certain long-term treatments may want to discuss options for family planning with their doctor. Other treatments are sometimes used to try to slow MS disease progression when other therapies have been ineffective. Such treatments are approved by the FDA for other illnesses, but not specifically for the treatment of MS. These include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy, methotrexate, azathioprine (Imuran), and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan). In 2014, the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition (MSC) published two papers detailing the current evidence that supports the FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for the long-term treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). The first paper was written for medical professionals. The second paper summarizes the information and has been written for members of the MS community. To view either of these papers, please go to the following links: For medical professionals (updated June 2019): The Use of Disease-Modifying Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis: Principles and Current Evidence For members of the MS community (updated March 2017): The Use of Disease-Modifying Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis: Principles and Current Evidence; SUMMARY *Additional information about interferons: Some individuals develop neutralizing antibodies (NABs) to the interferons (Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif, and Extavia), but their impact on the effectiveness of these medications has not been established. Many continue to do well on these drugs despite the presence of NABs. Others may have sub-optimal results even without NABs present. The MS Council and the American Academy of Neurology have concluded that the higher-dosed interferons are likely to be more effective than lower-dosed interferons. Several factors, however, must be considered when selecting one of these drugs, and this decision must be made on an individual basis under the guidance of a qualified physician. Please note that MSAA does not endorse or recommend any specific drug or treatment. Individuals are advised to consult with a physician about the potential benefits and risks of the different treatment therapies.

a4fda9bb-219d-4e01-9a1c-5a491b400638,"Disease Course, Diagnosis, Treatment Options, and Overall Wellness Edited by Susan Wells Courtney, MSAA Senior Writer Reviewed by Barry A. Hendin, MD, MSAA Chief Medical Officer The last few years have seen plenty of welcome news regarding pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS). In 2018, Gilenya (fingolimod) became the first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children and adolescents. Several other DMTs already approved for use in adults are in late stages of evaluation for pediatric MS. Researchers are investigating a role for stem-cell therapy, and are pursuing new classes of drugs that would restore the nerve-protecting myelin sheath that becomes damaged in MS. Experts report that the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of pediatric MS is declining, which means that the medical community is considering the possibility of an MS diagnosis in young patients at an earlier time. Clinicians have more knowledge than ever about the course of MS in children and adolescents, risk factors for relapse, how to manage symptoms, and other aspects of medical management. Risk Factors for Pediatric MS Coming into Sharper Focus Clinical Trials: The Key to Progress in Treating Pediatric MS Support and Resources for Families Facing Pediatric MS Mary Karpinski, LMSW, reviews those encouraging developments when she meets with the parents of a young person recently diagnosed with MS, but the most reassuring message she delivers concerns something that can’t be seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or quantified in an annualized relapse rate. “I remind parents that children are incredibly resilient. I explain that I’ve found young people with MS to be particularly strong, and that they can get through pretty much anything so long as parents give them the building blocks to succeed, and do not let their own worries lead them to impose well-intentioned but overly restrictive limits on what their child can do.” Ms. Karpinski speaks from considerable experience. For the past 13 years she has served as the single point of access for young people with MS receiving care at the Pediatric MS Center of the UBMD Neurology/Jacobs Neurological Institute of the University at Buffalo. “I’ve been privileged to work with and assist many young people with MS as they’ve moved from childhood into adulthood. When parents first learn that their child has MS, one of the questions they inevitably ask is, ‘What will the future hold?’ I tell them about the many young people I’ve worked with who have earned college degrees, married, built meaningful careers, and had children of their own. Some have faced more challenges than others, and everyone’s path is different, but these children – and their parents – are the most inspiring people I have met,” the social worker says. This cover story examines the progress that has been made in helping these young people deal with MS, developments on the near horizon, the key unanswered questions about pediatric MS, and experts’ advice on enhancing the health and quality of life for young people with MS. Latest information about the course of pediatric MS Exploring how – and why – pediatric MS is similar to and different from MS in adults has been a major focus of researchers. These investigators are analyzing the commonalities and contrasts for insights into everything from the factors that trigger the onset of MS in young people, to the way therapies approved for use in adults are likely to affect the course of MS in children and adolescents. While relapsing-remitting MS is by far the most common form of the disease in newly diagnosed adults, it appears to be even more predominant in children and adolescents, representing 93% or more of all pediatric cases. Meanwhile, researchers at Partners Multiple Sclerosis Center in Boston have found that young people have relapses two to three times more often than adults, and that this difference persists over at least the first six years from onset of symptoms. However, there is evidence that young people generally recover from relapses more quickly than adults. Research suggests that pediatric-onset MS takes longer to diminish physical abilities than does adult-onset MS, and also is slower to develop into secondary-progressive MS. British researchers who examined long-term outcomes in more than 2,000 MS patients found that those who developed the disease before 18 years of age, took on average, 23.8 years to reach an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 4 (on the scale, 0 represents no disability, while progression toward higher numbers leading up to 10, indicates increasing disability) versus 15.5 years for people who developed MS as adults. Similarly, time to development of secondary-progressive MS was 32 years for pediatric-onset patients and 18 years for adult-onset patients. Conversely, compared to adult-onset MS, pediatric-onset MS appears to have a greater impact on cognitive function in the years following onset of symptoms. Italian investigators who studied 48 pediatric MS patients found that 31% had some degree of cognitive impairment on initial evaluation, and that this proportion increased to 38% over five years. Meanwhile, a recent study of more than 5,700 adults with MS found that those who developed the disease as children or adolescents were roughly 1.5-times more likely to have cognitive impairment in adulthood than people whose symptoms began when they already were adults, and that this increased risk was independent of the person’s age or duration of MS. Given these findings, Emmanuelle Waubant, MD, recommends neuropsychological testing of children and adolescents who are newly diagnosed with MS. “Getting a baseline is very helpful, and can help inform approaches to working with the child’s school and other aspects of comprehensive care,” explains Dr. Waubant, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) with extensive clinical and research expertise in pediatric MS. She advises follow-up testing two-to-three years later, unless a concern in the interim warrants earlier re-evaluation. Ms. Karpinski notes that the testing can help parents identify areas of strength and need – and, as a result – better understand the challenges their child may be facing, set realistic expectations, and advocate effectively for their son or daughter. She adds, however, that it is important for parents to meet with the specialist who evaluated their child to review the test results and their implications. “The reports containing the test results can be difficult to read, both in terms of the technical language employed, and sometimes, in terms of what the evaluation identified. Rather than trying to puzzle that out on their own, parents should sit with the specialist and get the background needed to avoid misunderstandings and put the results in context,” she says. Parents also need to be aware of the heightened presence of anxiety and mood disorders in young people with MS, and to include mental-health professionals in their care team, as needed, Ms. Karpinski adds. A study of 23 young people aged 6 to 17 who had MS or another demyelinating disorder found that 48% met the criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis, with almost one-third having anxiety disorders and about 10% having depression. Another study, this one involving 45 young people, found that cognitive impairment is more common among pediatric MS patients with mood and anxiety disorders than among those without a psychiatric diagnosis. Eighty percent of the study participants who had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, a depressive disorder, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), had evidence of cognitive impairment. By contrast, 55% of the 20 participants who did not have a psychiatric disorder demonstrated cognitive impairment on testing. In exploring why the course of pediatric MS often differs from that of adult MS, researchers have noted that disease onset in young people is marked by a higher disease burden and more disease activity on MRI than is seen in adults. In a study of 41 individuals with pediatric-onset MS and 35 individuals who developed MS as adults, Dr. Waubant and colleagues found that the children had a median 21 T2-bright lesions, as opposed to six in adults, and had more T2-bright areas generally and focal points in enhancing lesions, indicating greater disease activity. Another study involving 19 children and 12 adults with MS found that the pediatric patients hadw more extensive acute damage to the axons that carry electrical impulses from the central nervous system’s main type of cell, the neuron. Those and other findings suggest that pediatric MS is more inflammatory in nature than adult-onset MS. Meanwhile, another age-related aspect of MS may offer important insights into factors contributing to onset of disease. While less than 1% of all cases of MS develop before age 10 to 12 years, the condition affects boys and girls in that age group in roughly equal proportion. By age 12 and older, however, the female:male ratio in pediatric MS shifts to 2.8:1, a gender split similar to that seen in adult-onset patients. Tanuja Chitnis, MD, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and pediatric MS expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, noted in a 2013 article that this shift suggests a role for puberty in MS risk. E. Ann Yeh, MD, MA, FCRPC, says that just 15 years or so ago, the main challenge in diagnosing pediatric MS wasn’t necessarily obtaining an MRI to see what happening in a brain. Rather, she explains, the bigger issue often was what was happening in a brain. “Pediatricians, and even child neurologists, just weren’t trained to think in terms of children having MS. We were given the impression in residency and fellowship that MS did not occur in children, or that if it did, it was so rare that MS should not be high on the list of possibilities to consider when a young person presented with symptoms that could reflect a demyelinating event,” recalls Dr. Yeh. Today, as director of the MS and Demyelinating Disorders Program at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto, the physician sees dozens of children with MS from across Ontario and nearby Canadian provinces and American states. Greater awareness that pediatric MS is a real – albeit quite uncommon – condition has contributed to significant improvements in the timeliness and accuracy of diagnosis, according to Dr. Yeh, who is also a senior associate scientist in Neurosciences & Mental Health at SickKids and a professor of pediatrics (Neurology) at the University of Toronto. Factors such as increased access to MRI and the development of a diagnostic pathway by the International Pediatric MS Study Group (IPMSSG) have been particularly important in this regard, notes Dr. Yeh, who estimates that the average child with MS is now diagnosed within about six months of symptom onset. The IPMSSG guidance is intended to help clinicians evaluate young people who present with indications of a possible acquired demyelinating syndrome, meaning symptoms suggesting that the myelin sheath that coats nerves in the central nervous system has been damaged. Such symptoms may include visual loss, double vision, sensations of tingling or numbness, weakness, abnormal or uncoordinated movements, and urinary issues, similar to adults who develop relapsing-remitting MS. Acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS) in pediatric patients include acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), clinically isolated syndromes (CIS), and multiple sclerosis. Beyond distinguishing between the conditions within that group of disorders, however, pediatric neurologists also need to consider other conditions that may cause the same symptoms seen with demyelinating syndromes. “The differential diagnosis for pediatric MS is quite broad, and includes a number of ‘MS mimics’ that are different from those that have to be considered when evaluating potential adult-onset MS,” notes Dr. Waubant. To help narrow that differential diagnosis, which essentially is a list of possible causes, the IPMSSG’s 2016 evaluation pathway identifies red flags that suggest a child may not have a demyelinating syndrome. The document also recommends a protocol for employing blood tests, assessment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), imaging, and other steps to identify specific demyelinating syndromes, including MS. The IPMSSG notes that a diagnosis of pediatric MS is warranted when a child or adolescent has two or more episodes presumed to be caused by inflammatory demyelination that do not represent ADEM and that occur more than 30 days apart. The episodes must involve more than one site in the central nervous system. The group also identifies three other, less-common scenarios that justify the diagnosis. However, Dr. Waubant notes that an intriguing, related question remains unanswered. “In the last 10 years or so, we’ve tended to see more patients with pediatric MS than we did previously. Greater awareness of the condition and improved diagnosis clearly play roles in this, but we just don’t know whether – beyond those factors – there also has been an increase in the actual number of children and adolescents who are developing MS,” she explains. Dr. Yeh agrees, and notes that as physicians become more skilled at making an early diagnosis, along with greater patient access to magnetic resonance imaging, the proportion of cases of pediatric MS that go unrecognized will be reduced. According to Dr. Yeh, “We should be able to tell what’s happening.” She adds that even accounting for such issues, “the numbers do seem to be going up.” (See “Risk Factors for Pediatric MS Coming into Sharper Focus.”) Recent study-based estimates of the incidence – or number of new cases per year – of pediatric MS vary from 0.07 to 2.9 per 100,000 children. Even the higher figure in that range represents an extremely small percentage of young people, however, and it is estimated that there are fewer than 5,000 pediatric MS patients in the United States. More treatment options and more patients receiving treatment The FDA has approved 17 DMTs for use in adults with MS. Eight, including the longest-approved agents, are administered by injection, while five are taken orally, and four are infused intravenously. Only one of those medications, the oral-agent Gilenya (fingolimod), is also approved for use in children and adolescents aged 10 years and older. The FDA expanded Gilenya’s indication to include pediatric MS patients in May 2018. Even before that approval, many pediatric MS specialists prescribed DMTs for their patients in an attempt to prevent relapses and disease progression. However, they often proceeded hesitantly because of a lack of data on the agents’ optimal dosing and safety profile in children and adolescents. Recent years have seen that hesitancy yields to a more pro-active approach, according to Dr. Waubant. “There has been a trend over time to treat pediatric MS more aggressively,” she notes, explaining that several factors are propelling the trend. One, she notes, is growing evidence that early intervention in the MS-disease process can favorably impact not only a patient’s current health, but also long-term well-being. At the same time, clinical trials, observational studies, and patient registries are providing reassuring data about the safety profiles of DMTs in children and adolescents. Expanded options, particularly in terms of route of administration, also has helped. “Teenagers very often are reluctant to consider agents that require an injection, but are willing to take an oral agent,” the pediatric MS expert notes. The fact that one agent has been approved by the FDA for use in children and adolescents, and that other DMTs approved for adults are in late stages in clinical evaluation in pediatric populations, has also made both parents and payers (insurance companies) more receptive to DMTs for young patients, Dr. Waubant adds. Gilenya secured its pediatric indication on the basis of the Phase III PARADIGMS trial, which studied more than 200 young people with pediatric MS. Other pediatric studies of DMTs already approved for use in adults include ongoing Phase III trials of Aubagio (teriflunomide) and Tecfidera (dimethyl fumaric acid), an ongoing open-label trial of Lemtrada (alemtuzumab), and completed open-label trials of Tysabri (natalizumab) and Tecfidera. However, Dr. Waubant and several of her colleagues belonging to the IPMSSG note that enrollment challenges and other obstacles mean that “Phase III trials for every newly approved therapy for adult MS in the pediatric MS population are simply not feasible.” Writing in the journal earlier this year, they noted, “In the last years, convincing evidence has emerged that the biological processes involved in MS are largely shared across the age span. As such, treatments proven efficacious for the care of adults with MS have a biological rationale for use in pediatric MS given the relapsing-remitting course at onset and high relapse frequency. There are also ethical considerations on conducting clinical trials in this age group including the use of placebo owing to highly active disease. It is imperative to reconsider study design and implementation based on what information is needed.” The group went on to propose recommendations that would enable future studies to adequately assess the safety of DMT use in pediatric patients while avoiding some of the trial-design issues that made it difficult to obtain timely, meaningful results. (See ) Such studies are all the more important given the above-referenced trend toward the increased use of DMTs in children and adolescents. An analysis of 748 pediatric MS patients receiving care at practices in the US Network of Pediatric MS Centers found that 78% had received a DMT before reaching 18 years of age. However, there are indications that the more-proactive approach being taken by clinicians at pediatric MS centers is not being uniformly adopted nationwide. An analysis of claims data for 288 children and adolescents diagnosed with pediatric MS from 2010 to 2017 found that 65% did not receive a DMT in the 12 months following their diagnosis. Other research into treatment of pediatric MS is looking beyond DMTs. Several small studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of Rituxan (rituximab) in pediatric MS. This monoclonal antibody, which depletes certain types of B cells, primarily is used in the treatment of leukemias and lymphomas. It is not approved for use in either adult or pediatric MS, but has been employed by some clinicians to treat multiple sclerosis. Investigators are also exploring the role that stem-cell therapy may play in treating pediatric MS, and are pursuing other treatments that would have remyelinating and neuroprotective effects. “One of the greatest unmet needs in pediatric MS relates to the fact that we don’t have a sufficient understanding of why there is disease progression even with adequate control of inflammation. Figuring out a way to control that progression is super important,” says Dr. Yeh. She adds that agents with mechanisms of action different from those of current DMTs will likely be needed to halt the disease progression not driven by inflammation and, hopefully, to exercise a regenerative effect. Promoting wellness for the whole person as well as for family members “Yes, MS is a part of your life, but it needn’t define your life,” Ms. Karpinski tells the young people she works with at UBMD Neurology in Buffalo. Often, she adds, parents need to hear that message more than their children do, given a parent’s increased concerns. The concerns that parents have for a child newly diagnosed with MS are often accompanied by a tendency to be over-protective, and even to feel a sense of guilt, experts say. “Parents often ask, ‘Did I do something that put my child at risk for this?’” notes Dr. Yeh. Beyond allaying parents’ unfounded fears that they are responsible for their child’s MS, she uses the question to refocus parents on ways to optimize their daughter’s or son’s health. The pediatric neurologist explains that those steps include participating in physical activity, ensuring sufficient sleep, and eating a balanced diet while avoiding extreme eating plans not supported by scientific evidence. “I particularly stress the importance of the child staying active and leading a normal life. If parents unnecessarily limit a child’s activities because of concerns about their MS, it can have a negative impact in terms of forging friendships and developing socially,” she adds. Dr. Waubant counsels parents along the same lines, and notes the importance of having a smoke-free household, and also recommends Vitamin D supplementation. In many cases, she adds, the parents’ concerns about MS extend to their newly diagnosed child’s siblings. When asked about the chances that another of their children will also develop MS, Dr. Waubant explains to parents that people who have a first-degree relative with MS have a 2% to 3% lifetime chance of having MS. “Where is my child going to be 10 years from now?” is another question Dr. Waubant hears frequently. “I explain that children with MS are less likely to have problems with physical disability than adults and, for reasons we don’t entirely understand, children are better able to recover from relapses,” the neurologist says. She also urges parents to connect with support networks for families affected by MS. (See “Support and Resources for Families Facing Pediatric MS”) Ms. Karpinski agrees that these support groups and networks are valuable resources for parents, and can help them obtain insights into handling practical issues. One example is to work with school officials to accommodate their child’s educational needs. “School districts often have many children with a diagnosis of ADHD or seizure disorder, and so they have experience with formulating educational plans centered around those conditions. But it is not unusual for a child at our clinic to be the only student in his or her district with multiple sclerosis, and educators may not appreciate the need for certain accommodations, such as extended time for test-taking or standing permission to use the restroom,” says Ms. Karpinski. After more than a decade of working with children at UBMD, Ms. Karpinski has helped several patients make the adjustment from grammar school to high school, and then to college. Along the way, she has addressed issues ranging from compliance with medication regimens to what and how a teen with MS may want to tell classmates, or a boyfriend or girlfriend, about the condition. She also has worked with patients and parents on family dynamics and practical approaches to dealing with symptoms such as fatigue and heat sensitivity. The experience, she says, has left her in awe of children with MS. “It is a privilege to work with them, and to see them flourish. They’re just amazing people, and they give me so much hope.” Support and Resources for Families Facing Pediatric MS Learning that your child has a serious, lifelong condition can be overwhelming. When that condition is so uncommon that you do not know of anyone else in the same situation, a sense of isolation can add to a parent’s anxiety. Resources including the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA) are available to assist. Parents may call MSAA’s toll-free Helpline at , to speak to an MSAA specialist. Parents and others also can obtain information from MSAA’s Helpline by emailing , and by using the online MS Chat feature on MSAA’s website at . MSAA’s website also has numerous other resources of interest to people of all ages who are coping with the challenges of MS. Other MS advocacy organizations also offer resources and support for young people with MS and their relatives. One group – the Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Alliance – is dedicated exclusively to connecting, supporting, and advocating for children and adolescents with MS and their families. The Alliance’s website, at , includes a directory of centers specializing in pediatric MS, a resource center where visitors can download parents’ guides to understanding the condition, information about camps for young people with MS, and more. This organization also helps the parents of children with MS connect with one another online. Jeong A, Oleske DM, Holman J.

8ae5757c-45d8-4f3f-a080-d480d9d358ad,"Reviewed by MSAA Chief Medical Officer Experimental and Approved Disease-Modifying Therapies This edition of MSAA’s “What’s New in MS Research” provides highlights from this year’s European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) annual meeting. Experts from throughout the world gathered in Stockholm, Sweden in mid-September to share and discuss the latest research into the causes, diagnosis, course, and treatment of multiple sclerosis. Those investigators and clinicians were gathered for the 35th annual Congress of ECTRIMS, a key forum for presenting the findings that help advance evidence-based management of MS. This article focuses on more than a dozen studies with significance for people living with MS. The studies featured obviously constitute a very small sampling of the research unveiled in Stockholm. However, they provide a good sense of the depth, breadth, and innovation that mark the current state of research into multiple sclerosis. Experimental and Approved Disease-Modifying Therapies Ofatumumab: Favorable Phase III results set stage for seeking FDA approval Ofatumumab is a monoclonal antibody that people with relapsing-remitting MS could inject at home once a month. This experimental medication demonstrated positive Phase III study results, which were announced at the ECTRIMS 2019 meeting. Based on those results, the pharmaceutical company Novartis said it will file paperwork with the FDA by the end of this year seeking approval for use of ofatumumab in relapsing-remitting MS. The medication is already approved for the treatment of certain forms of leukemia under the brand name Arzerra. Two identically designed Phase III trials, ASCLEPIOS I and ASCEPLIOS II, compared ofatumumab to Aubagio (teriflunomide). More than 1,800 patients from 37 countries were enrolled in the trials. Those people were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either 20 mg of ofatumumab injected subcutaneously every four weeks, or daily, oral doses of 14 mg of Aubagio, for up to 30 months. The primary endpoint of both trials was impact on the annualized relapse rate, or ARR. In both studies, the ARR for patients receiving ofatumumab was less than half that of those receiving Aubagio. Ofatumumab also demonstrated greater suppression of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions on MRI – an indication of inflammatory activity – compared with Aubagio, and reduced the risk of three-month and six-month confirmed disability progression by roughly one-third relative to Aubagio. Meanwhile, safety data in the trial were comparable with that seen in earlier studies of the agent. Mayzent and delay in time to disability progression in secondary-progressive MS Mayzent (siponimod) helps patients with secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) delay the time until they need to use a wheelchair, according to a team of international researchers. In March 2019, the FDA approved Mayzent as the first oral drug to treat SPMS with active disease. The FDA’s approval was based on results of the Phase III EXPAND trial. Researchers drew on data from that trial to assess the impact that Mayzent had on people reaching an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 7.0, which reflects an inability to walk beyond a few steps and the need for wheelchair use. Analysis of data on more than 1,100 study participants found that, compared to placebo, Mayzent lengthened the median time to reaching an EDSS score of 7 or greater by 4.3 years (12.0 years for placebo vs 16.3 years for Mayzent). The reduction in risk of need for a wheelchair was greatest in people with more significant disability. In more than 400 study participants with an EDSS score of 6.5 at the study’s start, Mayzent cut the risk of needing a wheelchair by 28% to 36%, depending on the type of analysis employed. Impact of extending Tysabri dosing interval on relapse rates Tysabri (natalizumab) has demonstrated its efficacy in treating relapsing-remitting MS, but the standard dosing schedule of a 300-mg infusion every four weeks is associated with increased risk for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a serious and potentially life-threatening disease. In an effort to continue providing people with MS with the benefits of Tysabri while reducing their risk for PML, researchers have explored whether extending the period between infusions can preserve the disease-modifying effects of the drug while diminishing the chances of developing PML. With earlier research showing that extended interval dosing (EID) lowers the risk of PML compared to standard interval dosing (SID), a large, long-term observational study presented at ECTRIMS 2019 examined the differences in effectiveness when extending the time between treatments. Investigators drew on data from the Tysabri Observational Program (TOP) to compare 135 pairs of patients. One patient in each pair had received Tysabri on the standard-interval schedule, while the other had extended-interval dosing. The researchers found no significant difference in annualized relapse rate (ARR) or risk of relapse between the two groups. They added that a randomized, prospective study comparing the two treatment approaches is needed to provide more-definitive evidence. What’s the risk of “rebound” disease activity after stopping Gilenya? People with MS may decide to stop a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for any number of reasons, ranging from side effects or a perceived lack of effectiveness to a desire to switch to another agent or to be “treatment-free” for a period of time. The importance of consulting with a clinician before stopping treatment is underscored by the risk for rebound disease activity, or RDA, which can occur once a medication that is taken to control MS is discontinued. Investigators recently examined the records of 117 patients to determine the risk for RDA after stopping Gilenya, and to see if any factors made people more prone to experiencing “rebound.” The group included 86 women and 31 men. Nine of the 117 patients, or 7.7%, had RDA after stopping Gilenya, with the rebound activity marked by severe clinical relapses with exaggerated MRI lesions compared to their level of disease activity before starting the DMT. Compared to patients who did not experience RDA upon stopping treatment, those who did have rebound activity had a higher annualized relapse rate (ARR) before initiating Gilenya, and also had a shorter interval between their last relapse and their first dose of the medication. The duration of Gilenya treatment did not appear to affect the likelihood of rebound. The researchers added that eight of the nine people experiencing RDA had stopped treatment abruptly. In an observation that again reinforces the importance of working closely with a clinician when considering any change to treatment approach, the investigators concluded, “Our results indicate that [a] fingolimod every-other-day cessation strategy may help to prevent RDA.” Patients at the Cleveland Clinic’s Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis had lower rates of adverse events (AEs) with Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) than did patients in the Phase III clinical trials that led to the disease-modifying therapy’s approval in March 2017, according to Mellen Center researchers. In the Mellen Center cohort, 3.3% had a serious adverse event, while 21% had an infection – typically a urinary tract infection or upper respiratory infection – and 18% had an infusion-related reaction. By contrast, in the OPERA I and OPERA II trials of Ocrevus in RRMS, 6.9% and 7.0%, respectively, of patients receiving Ocrevus had a serious adverse event, 56.9% and 60.2% had an infection, and 30.9% and 37.6% had at least one infusion-related reaction. Similarly, in the ORATORIO trial of Ocrevus in PPMS, 20.4% of Ocrevus patients had a serious adverse event, and 39.9% had one or more infusion-related reactions. The Mellen Center researchers noted that the lower rates of adverse events that they recorded may have been due to differences in reporting. They also observed that patients at their institution had longer average disease duration and fewer enhancing lesions at baseline than clinical trial participants. The real-world findings are, nonetheless, welcome and reassuring. FDA approves Vumerity™, a fumarate medication designed to address GI tolerability Clinicians know that the medications that work best are those that patients take regularly. For this reason, the tolerability of an agent can be as important as its effectiveness. In a nod to this reality, Biogen and Alkermes developed Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate) to provide the efficacy already demonstrated by Biogen’s disease-modifying therapy Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), but with fewer of the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects reported with the latter medication. In late October, a few weeks after MS researchers returned from ECTRIMS 2019, the FDA announced that it had approved Vumerity for use in relapsing forms of MS, including clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting MS. In pursuing FDA approval for Vumerity, Biogen provided data from the EVOLVE-MS-1 study, an ongoing, Phase III, single-arm, open-label, two-year safety study enrolling patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Interim results from the study submitted to the FDA showed that 6.3% of patients had stopped Vumerity due to adverse events, with fewer than 1% stopping because of gastrointestinal events. In the clinical trials leading to approval of Tecfidera, 18% of patients reported abdominal pain, 14% reported diarrhea, 12% cited nausea, and 9% reported vomiting. A tilt toward monoclonal antibody therapy as first-line MS treatment Neurologists’ top choice of an initial multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment has shifted from interferon-based medications to monoclonal antibodies. That was the main finding of an analysis of data on more than 1,000 people with MS who began their first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) in late 2018 or early 2019. In December 2018 and January 2019, investigators drew on records from 213 U.S. neurologists to examine those physicians’ prescribing of MS medications over the prior three months. They then compared that 2018-2019 information with comparable data on the first medications prescribed to more than 1,000 “treatment-naïve” patients (individuals who had never taken a DMT previously) in early 2018, and another 1,020 patients who received their first DMT in 2017. Researchers found that in late 2018-early 2019, 18% of treatment-naïve patients started a monoclonal antibody medication as their first DMT, compared with 8% in 2017. Conversely, the proportion of newly treated patients receiving an interferon-based medication declined from 26% in 2017 to 17% in 2019. The investigators noted that greater prescribing of Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) drove much of the increase in monoclonal antibody use, and was accompanied by a quantitatively measured increase in neurologists’ comfort level with using Ocrevus for relapsing-remitting forms of MS. They added that the 2017 approval of a generic version of Copaxone (glatiramer acetate, or GA) also had significantly affected neurologists’ choice of a first-line DMT, with branded GA seeing its share of first-line prescriptions declining from 27% in 2017 to 18% in 2019, while generic GA went from accounting for 4% of first-line prescriptions in 2017 to 13% in 2019. Further evidence supporting early initiation of disease-modifying therapy Increasing age, duration of multiple sclerosis (MS), and greater disability detract from the effectiveness of disease-modifying therapies, according to an analysis of data on more than 14,000 patients. While those findings may seem intuitive, the researchers went further and quantified the extent to which medication therapy was diminished per year, per 1-point change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, and other measures. The study drew on the MSBase Registry, examining data for 14,717 people who had been followed for at least one year. Seventy-two percent of the patients were female. The mean age at first visit was 36 years, and the patients had a mean duration of disease of 5.7 years and a median EDSS score of 2. Roughly three-quarters had clinically definite MS, while 20% had a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). The researchers found that patients receiving treatment were 39% more likely to experience confirmed improvement of disability than their untreated counterparts. However, this effect of therapy declined with age (-2% per year), disease duration (-6% per year), and disability (-8% per EDSS step). In an observation that reinforces the value of early initiation of treatment, the investigators concluded, “Immunotherapies exert their maximum effect in young patients with shorter disease course, mild disability and a previous stability on treatment.” Tracking changes in use of DMTs as well as complementary and alternative interventions People with MS are drawing on both disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions in managing their health, according to a recent survey of more than 1,100 patients in Oregon and southwest Washington. Fielded from September 2018 to April 2019, the survey identified respondents’ use of both prescription medications for MS and interventions such as herbs and supplements, cannabis, dietary plans, and yoga. In addition to assessing current approaches to MS, researchers compared results from the 2018-2019 questionnaire with answers to a similar survey conducted in 2001. Those investigators found that the proportion of people taking a DMT at the time they were surveyed increased from 47% in 2001 to 69% now. Use of CAM at time of survey response also increased during that period, from 68% to 93%. Eighty-six percent of respondents to the 2018-2019 survey reported having employed exercise in managing their MS, with the proportion of people who have tried yoga increasing from 23% in 2001 to 46% in the recent survey. The proportion of people reporting having used meditation also increased, 16% to 39%. A majority of respondents to both surveys reported having used diet to manage their MS, with a slight increase from 59% in 2001 to 66% more recently. Low-carbohydrate and anti-inflammatory diets were the most commonly followed approaches in both surveys. Researchers noted that they will further analyze their data to explore differences in perceived benefit of DMTs between CAM users and nonusers. Three key take-aways emerge from this research. First, more people are doing more than ever before to take a pro-active approach to dealing with their MS. Second, many people have rejected the false dichotomy of either using only a prescription medication or rejecting such agents in favor of exclusive reliance on alternative approaches. Third, as use of alternative approaches grows, it is important for patients to talk openly with their clinicians about all interventions they are employing or considering, particularly given the potential for interaction between herbs and some supplements and prescription medications. Ninety-three percent of the 81 MS patients to undergo stem-cell transplantation at a Swedish center between 2004 and February 2019 remained progression free over an average follow-up period of 3.9 years, and none have died since undergoing the procedure. The investigators presenting that heartening news at the 2019 ECTRIMS meeting added that 87% of the patients had not experienced a relapse since transplantation, and that the annualized relapse rate (ARR) for the entire group was 0.022. By comparison, the group’s mean ARR for the year prior to the procedure was 2.2. The patients consisted of 56 women and 25 men. Their median age was 29 years, and 95% had relapsing-remitting MS. Conversely, stem-cell transplantation did not reduce the number of active lesions seen on MRI after 24 weeks of treatment in a major international study, but did show promise in reducing the relapse rate, one of the investigation’s lead researchers told the press in discussing preliminary results presented at the 2019 ECTRIMS meeting. The MESEMS trial (MEsenchymal StEm cells for Multiple Sclerosis) was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over phase II trial examining the impact of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Most of the 144 patients randomized for treatment had relapsing-remitting MS, while roughly 20% had secondary-progressive MS, and a little over 10% had primary-progressive MS. The study’s authors noted that the results presented at ECTRIMS were preliminary, and that further analysis is needed. Assessing the impact of plasma exchange when steroids don’t help with relapses Therapeutic plasma exchange – or plasmapheresis – is a technique clinicians sometimes employ when steroids aren’t helping to resolve an MS relapse. The process involves withdrawing whole blood from a vein, separating the plasma – or liquid portion of the blood – from the red and white blood cells, and then transfusing the red and white blood cells back into the patient, along with plasma replacement fluid. This “blood cleansing” approach is fairly uncommon, so Austrian and German researchers recently analyzed 14 years’ worth of data on 133 patients at their MS clinics to better understand its effectiveness. The investigators assessed clinical response to plasma exchange, with a marked clinical response defined as ≥1 step improvement in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and mild clinical improvement – which was characterized by improvement in neurological examination with change of EDSS <1 step. They also identified patients who had no improvement. Seventy-six percent of patients undergoing therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) saw improvement, with 36% having marked improvement and 40% experiencing mild improvement. In general, TPE was more effective in younger patients, those with a shorter duration of disease, and with a shorter interval between relapse and receiving TPE. By exploring how often and to what extent TPE helps patients who have not benefited sufficiently from steroids during relapses – and by identifying which patients are likely to have the best response to the treatment – the researchers have provided clinicians with valuable insights on a less commonly employed treatment option. A team of Canadian researchers showed in a small study that blood levels of a protein called serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) measured in the first five years after onset of symptoms can provide important insights on a patient’s likely course over the next 15 years. In analyzing data on 64 people with MS, they found that patients with a serum NfL level greater than 7.62 pg/mL had a nine-times greater risk of developing secondary-progressive MS over the following several years than people with lower blood levels of the protein. Similarly, when they divided patients into three groups, based on whether they had low, medium, or high NfL levels, they found that those with the highest level had more aggressive disease progression, with their Expanded Disability Stats Scale (EDSS) score increasing by 0.16 per year, reflecting greater impairment. Similarly, patients in the lowest NfL levels were 5.3-times less likely than others to reach an EDSS of 4.0 or greater. The researchers noted that their findings were consistent across the adult age range and in both men and women. They concluded that their study “demonstrates an association between early disease serum NfL and long term clinical outcomes over the longest follow-up to-date. Whether the course of such patients can be altered by earlier treatment will require further study.” In another study, a Spanish investigator has developed evidence indicating that the presence and prevalence of certain types of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract can serve as predictive factors in assessing the long-term course of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The gut microbiome – the milieu of bacteria and other molecules found in the gastrointestinal tract – is a major component of the body’s immune system, and in recent years has emerged as a focus of intense study in MS. Earlier research indicates that people with MS or at heightened risk for MS have imbalances in the mix of bacteria normally found in the GI tract of healthy people. The study reported at the 2019 ECTRIMS meeting involved using molecular sequencing of stool samples to study the gut microbiota – or composition of bacterial species – of 16 people with RRMS and 15 healthy controls. The investigators then followed the people with MS over 24 months. They found that levels of family of bacteria, and particularly two types of bacteria within that family known as and were associated with an increased risk of relapses and new lesions appearing on MRI. While this was a small study whose findings need to be explored on a larger scale, it points to the many ways researchers are homing in on factors that help chart the likely course of disease – and that eventually will help patients and their clinicians formulate treatment plans accordingly. People with MS have elevated risk for other conditions even before their MS diagnosis Even before they are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, people with MS are more likely than others to have bladder problems, eye issues, and other conditions, according to a Swedish study involving more than 6,600 people with MS and almost 62,000 healthy controls. The people ultimately identified as having MS had a higher pre-diagnosis incidence of epilepsy (1.5% vs. 0.8%), autoimmune disease (1.3% vs 0.7%), bladder dysfunction (1.2% vs 0.2%), and retinal disorders (2.4% vs 1.2%) compared with controls. After MS diagnosis, the patients continued to have considerably higher rates of epilepsy, autoimmune diseases, and bladder dysfunction, as well as of toxic liver disease. The research team concluded, “Before a diagnosis of MS, patients already displayed an increased rate of comorbidity compared with MS-free controls. After diagnosis, patients with MS continued to display increased risk of several comorbidities, some of which may be explained by surveillance bias due to more frequent contact with healthcare.” Measuring the toll of MS on women’s physical, mental function Multiple sclerosis accelerates age-related physiologic decline in physical and mental function by 10-20 years in women with MS compared to their same-age counterparts. That is the unwelcome but important conclusion of researchers who drew on data from the large-scale Nurses Health Study and Nurses Health Study II and compared participants’ physical function and cognitive function scores with those of 582 women with confirmed MS. They found that women with MS who were ages 36 to 41 years had, on average, physical function comparable to that of unaffected women aged 58 to 62 years. Middle-aged women with MS were about three-times more likely than their age peers to report a slower walking pace and more than twice as likely to report almost daily urine leaks. At higher ages, women with MS were five-times more likely than unaffected peers to report problems with balance. Among women over age 75 years, women with MS were less likely to report good cognitive function than women without MS. The results, while not encouraging, are not entirely surprising either, and underscore the importance of pursuing overall good health through clinician-approved diet and exercise programs in order to optimize well-being. Recurrent demyelinating events in children: Identifying frequency and risk factors Two-thirds of children who have a first demyelinating event (FDE) will go on to have at least one more such event, with older age at FDE, presence of more than five lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and symptoms suggestive of a brainstem syndrome being among several risk factors for further events. Those were the key findings to emerge from an observational cohort study involving 75 children who had an FDE between 1999 and 2018. The children included 46 girls and 29 boys; their median age was 12 years. In 80% of cases, the FDE involved a single neurological symptom. Thirty-six had optic neuritis, while 15 had transverse myelitis, and 14 had symptoms indicative of a brainstem syndrome. Final diagnoses included multiple sclerosis (32 children), relapsing optic neuritis (7), and syndromes including polyphasic acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and neuromyelitis optica. Fifty-six percent of the children experienced a relapse within 60 months of their FDE, and the overall risk of relapse was calculated at 65%. A clinical presentation indicating a brainstem syndrome was associated with a 10-fold higher risk for a second demyelinating event compared with other clinical presentations, while being age 11 years or older at the time of the FDE more than doubled the risk of recurrence compared to younger children. MRI findings of periventricular, subcortical, brainstem, and lateral spinal lesions also were associated with increased risk. As investigators better understand the risks of – and risk factors for – recurrent demyelinating events in young people, clinicians can formulate their counseling approaches, diagnostic strategies, and treatment decisions accordingly to enhance care and help children and their families know what to anticipate.

51fcecbd-d232-4861-9956-e7a5975770a1,"Investigational Agent Slows Brain Shrinkage in Progressive MS Recognizing the Frequency – and Addressing the Impact – of Swallowing Problems in MS How Impact on Quality of Life Differs by Type of MS More Sun Early in Life May Mean Lower MS Risk Later in Life Research into the causes, diagnosis, impact, and management of multiple sclerosis (MS) continues to move forward on a broad front and at a rapid pace. While many advances are announced at medical meetings, such as the annual gatherings of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), American Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS), Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), and European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), other findings are reported in medical journals throughout the year. Below, we highlight several noteworthy studies published in recent months. Investigational Agent Slows Brain Shrinkage in Progressive MS People with progressive MS who took the investigational agent ibudilast for 96 weeks had roughly one-half the amount of brain atrophy (the shrinking or reduction in brain volume) than the amount experienced by their counterparts who were given a placebo. These results are according to a study published in August in . [Fox 2018] The study enrolled 255 individuals with progressive MS. A total of 129 study participants received an oral dose of up to 100 mg of ibudilast daily. The other 126 participants received placebo. A slight majority of individuals in both groups had primary-progressive MS (PPMS), while the remainder had secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). The main adverse events seen in the ibudilast group were gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, and depression. These occurred more often in people receiving the drug than in those receiving placebo. This Phase II trial was conducted at 28 sites, and was sponsored by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, among others. Ibudilast is an oral anti-inflammatory and potentially neuroprotective agent being developed by MediciNova. The company is also exploring the potential role of ibudilast in treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis – also known as ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease – and other conditions. With limited treatment options for progressive forms of MS, this Phase II study is extremely interesting and promising. Hopefully it sets the stage for a Phase III trial examining the impact of ibudilast on MS symptoms and outcomes. Gilenya (fingolimod) reduced the annualized relapse rate in children and adolescents with MS relative to these individuals’ earlier relapse rates. This reduced relapse rate is also relative to other pediatric patients treated with interferon beta-1a (Avonex). [Chitnis 2018] This reduction in the annualized relapse rate was the main finding from the PARADIGMS study, the first global, completed, controlled, randomized study specifically designed for children aged 10 to 17 years with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. While the study was published in in August 2018, results from the trial prompted the FDA to approve Gilenya in May 2018 as the first MS treatment for pediatric patients. Gilenya was approved for use in adults with relapsing MS in 2010. A total of 215 children and adolescents participated in the PARADIGMS trial, with 107 randomized to receive Gilenya and 108 to receive interferon beta-1a. Participants in the Gilenya group received 0.5 mg of the oral agent per day (or 0.25 mg per day for those weighing 40 kg – roughly 88 pounds – or less). Participants in the comparison group received an intramuscular injection of 30 ug of interferon beta-1a per week. Both treatments were given for up to two years. The mean average age of the participants was 15.3 years, and these individuals had experienced a mean average of 2.4 relapses in the preceding two years – or more than one relapse per year. The adjusted annualized relapse rate in the Gilenya group was 0.12 versus a 0.67 rate in the interferon beta-1a group. This absolute difference of 0.55 relapses was statistically significant. Compared to their peers receiving interferon beta-1a, children and adolescents receiving Gilenya also had roughly one-half as many new or newly enlarged central nervous system (CNS) lesions identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A total of 89 percent of participants receiving Gilenya and 95 percent of those receiving interferon beta-1a experienced adverse events, with 16.8 percent of those taking Gilenya and 6.5 percent of those taking interferon beta-1a having serious adverse events. In the Gilenya group, serious events included convulsions in six participants, infection in four, and a reduction in white blood cell count in two. In the interferon beta-1a group, two individuals had infection and one experienced an abnormal heart rate. The availability of a treatment shown to reduce relapses in children and adolescents represents a major milestone in pediatric MS. As the PARADIGMS study’s lead author Tanuja Chitnis, MD, and her colleagues noted, the reduction in relapses, lessened accumulation of new or enlarging CNS lesions, and higher rate of serious adverse events seen with Gilenya (relative to interferon beta-1a), underscore the need for longer studies to determine the durability and safety of Gilenya in pediatric patients. Meanwhile, however, clinicians and their young patients finally have an FDA-approved treatment option. A study was designed to determine the effectiveness of group, cognitive rehabilitation (CR) therapy in women with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). The study found that these women performed better on memory assessments than their counterparts who did not participate in such sessions. [Mani 2018] Researchers assigned 17 women with RRMS and evidence of impaired cognitive function to participate in eight, two-hour sessions of cognitive rehabilitation (CR) over a four-week period. Those CR sessions focused on memory, attention, and executive function. A second control group of 17 women with RRMS and cognitive impairment attended a separate set of group sessions that did not involve cognitive rehabilitation. All participants underwent assessment of cognitive function before the start of the group sessions and three months after the sessions ended. At the three-month follow-up, the CR group had significantly greater improvement from baseline in visual and verbal memory than the control group. The CR group also outperformed the control group in an overall assessment of memory function. Further, women in the CR group did better on a card-sorting exercise that tests memory than did those in the control group. Attention was the only domain in which no significant difference was found between the groups. Cognitive impairment eventually affects up to two-thirds of people with MS. While this study had a small number of subjects and did not include men, it may have identified a valuable strategy for helping preserve or enhance memory function in people with RRMS.   Recognizing the Frequency – and Addressing the Impact – of Swallowing Problems in MS More than one-third of people receiving care at an Australian MS clinic reported swallowing problems when specifically asked about the issue on a questionnaire. [Alali 2018] Difficulty swallowing – known as dysphagia in medical terminology – was reported by 38 percent of the 103 adults with MS participating in this study. The nature and severity of the problems ranged from coughing and throat clearing, to choking on food and liquid. Patients also reported a reduced desire to eat, longer time required to eat, and mealtime anxiety. Researchers conducting the study noted that, if left untreated, swallowing problems eventually can lead to complications including malnutrition, dehydration, and pneumonia. They recommended that people with MS who have dysphagia see a speech pathologist as early as possible for evaluation and management to improve swallowing function. This study highlights the importance of promptly recognizing and addressing a common symptom of MS rather than minimizing its impact or deferring care. How Impact on Quality of Life Differs by Type of MS The symptoms that most affect health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with progressive MS differ significantly from those affecting people with relapsing forms of the condition. [Barin 2018] This difference between symptoms was the main finding from a study of 855 people participating in the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Registry. Researchers used two scales with ranges from 0 to 100 to measure the impact of various symptoms in 611 people with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 244 people with progressive MS (PMS). They found that in individuals with RRMS, gait and balance problems were the symptoms that had the most impact. By contrast, people with progressive MS cited spasticity and paralysis as the issues that most detracted from their health-related quality of life. Fatigue, depression, dizziness, and spasticity also were frequently cited issues for people with RRMS, while the PMS group identified pain as another symptom adversely affecting their quality of life. While the findings are not surprising, given the different courses of relapsing-remitting and progressive MS, they reinforce the importance of understanding how several factors – including MS type – contribute to the disease burden that patients experience. They also underscore the need for people to talk with their clinicians, not only about the presence of various symptoms, but also about the extent to which each symptom is affecting their quality of life.  More Sun Early in Life May Mean Lower MS Risk Later in Life Growing up in a sunny area reduces the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS), according to a recent study by investigators in the United States and Canada. [Tremlett 2018] The researchers matched 151 people with MS with 235 similarly aged healthy controls from the Nurses’ Health Study. The investigators classified each person as having low, medium, or high exposure to ambient ultraviolet (UV-B) light at ages 5 to15 years, 16 to 20 years, and every 10 years thereafter. The classification was based on factors including the latitude, altitude, and cloud cover where a person lived. Researchers also documented hours per week of sun exposure in summer and winter. A total of 98 percent of the study subjects were Caucasian, and the mean average age of MS onset in the 151 people with MS was 39.5 years. The study found that people living in a high UV-B area before the mean average age of MS onset had a 45-percent lower risk of developing MS than people living in a low UV-B area. Additional analysis showed that having medium or high exposure at ages 5 to 15 cut the risk of MS by more than one-half, relative to people living in low-exposure areas. This study extends a line of inquiry into the association between Vitamin D levels and MS risk. Sunlight is a major source of Vitamin D, and research has shown that many people with MS have relatively low levels of the vitamin. Additionally, epidemiological research has shown MS to be more prevalent in northern countries, where individuals receive less year-round sun exposure than in lower latitudes. Given the very real dangers of sun-related skin cancer, this research is not a reason to engage in tanning for potential preventive purposes, but it does add to the knowledge base about risk factors for MS.

fcf8df43-af3b-4d59-bb99-0559ea3926a1,"Many effective medications are available for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). These types of drugs may be prescribed for three different categories of MS treatment. The first area of treatment is to slow MS activity and progression; the second area is to reduce the severity and duration of a relapse; and the third area is to treat the symptoms of MS individually. All of these medications are prescribed by a physician – usually a neurologist who specializes in MS. Individuals considering a change to their present treatment regimen should always consult their physician. are also referred to as disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Presently, these include more than 20 approved brand-name and generic DMTs to slow MS activity and progression, each of which is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for relapsing forms of MS in adults – and some are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome, prior to the diagnosis of MS. Newer approvals also include other forms of MS, as noted in the details to follow. In 2017, Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab) was approved for two types of MS: relapsing forms of MS (RMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS). In 2019, Mayzent® (siponimod) oral tablets, Mavenclad® (cladribine) oral tablets, and Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate) oral capsules, were approved to treat RMS as well as active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), which is a more steady form of MS that follows RRMS, but still has relapses. Mayzent and Vumerity are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).These are the only DMTs to be approved in recent years for active SPMS. While both are approved for RMS and active SPMS, Mayzent is also approved for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Another DMT, Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab), is the only DMT that is also approved for primary-progressive MS. Additionally, Gilenya® (fingolimod), is the only DMT also approved for the treatment of children and adolescents, ages 10 through 17, with relapsing forms of MS. Young people under the age of 18 who are diagnosed with MS are referred to having “pediatric MS”; the vast majority (98 percent) of individuals with pediatric MS are diagnosed with the relapsing form of the disease. In nearly all instances, these drugs are prescribed individually, so a patient only takes one DMT during any time period. Of these 20-plus approved brand-name and generic medications, eight are given at home via injection; four are given by a medical professional via intravenous (IV) infusion; and nine* are taken orally. *Please note that these nine oral medications include three approved generic versions of Gilenya® (fingolimod) capsules, which are not yet available. helps to control the sudden flare-up of symptoms, also referred to as exacerbations or attacks. Relapses usually range in length from a few days to a few months before subsiding. While such treatments may be able to shorten the length of the relapse and lessen its severity, treating a relapse does not appear to affect the long-term progression of the disease or its symptoms. is another equally important area in the overall treatment of MS. Symptoms vary greatly from one individual to another, and each symptom needs to be addressed by healthcare professionals who specialize in MS. In addition to medications prescribed for a specific symptom, other treatment therapies – such as rehabilitation, counseling, and exercise, for example – may be recommended by the healthcare team to increase the effectiveness of managing certain symptoms. Most of these medications are available by prescription only, but even with over-the-counter medications, anyone considering making a change to his or her present regimen should consult a physician. Some of the medications listed may cause side effects, and these can be managed by one’s medical professional through adjusting dosage, switching drugs, or adding other medications. Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant need to discuss any medications they are taking and any new medications they are considering with their doctor. For more information on pregnancy and MS, as well as the different classifications of FDA drug warnings for pregnancy, please see “.” Please refer to MSAA’s listing of for information on financial help with many of these medications.

The results of numerous significant studies were reported at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), held in Los Angeles in April, and the Annual Meeting of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), which took place in Nashville in May. We have summarized some of the most interesting findings from those conferences in this update. Disease-Modifying Therapies in the Research Pipeline The treatment options for people with MS are likely to continue to expand in the years just ahead, as several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are in late stages of clinical development and/or are under review by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Five noteworthy studies of such “pipeline” medications are summarized here. Cladribine and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes Cladribine is an oral medication taken for up to 20 days over a period of two years. It selectively targets the immune system’s B cells and T cells, leading to depletion of those cells followed by a distinct pattern of “reconstitution” as new B cells and T cells are produced. It is approved for use in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) in several countries, but is not yet approved for use in the United States. In the Phase III CLARITY study, cladribine showed efficacy when compared to placebo over the course of two years of use by people with RRMS. A post-hoc analysis of that study’s data examined the impact of cladribine on a subset of individuals who had high disease activity as measured by relapses, MRI findings, and other characteristics. The analysis found that the effectiveness of cladribine versus placebo in this subpopulation was comparable to that seen in the overall CLARITY population in terms of reducing MRI markers of disease activity. This includes reducing such MRI markers as cumulative new T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions and cumulative combined unique active lesions. This post-hoc analysis did not focus on safety. However, in the CLARITY study from which this analysis’ MRI data were derived, certain adverse events occurred more frequently in the cladribine groups than in participants receiving placebo. These adverse events included lymphocytopenia (21.6 percent in the 3.5-mg cladribine group and 31.5 percent in the 5.25-mg group, versus 1.8 percent in the placebo group), and herpes zoster (eight patients and 12 patients, respectively, versus no patients). As clinicians experience continued progress in treating MS overall, an increasing focus is placed on improving outcomes in people with high disease activity. Studies of this type help provide informed treatment strategies for these individuals. Opicinumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets LINGO-1, a protein in the central nervous system whose role is to halt myelination (repair of the protective covering of the nerves) and prevent the survival of neurons (nerve cells). The SYNERGY trial assessed various doses of opicinumab, given by intravenous infusion, in combination with interferon beta-1a, over the course of 72 weeks in people with relapsing forms of MS (RMS). The results showed a sort of “inverted U” effect with more favorable outcomes in the 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg dose groups, indicating that other factors may have been involved in how the participants responded. That finding prompted investigators to explore those factors associated with a better response to opicinumab. Their post-hoc analysis identified three factors associated with better response to the medication: shorter disease duration (less than 20 years); lower baseline magnetization transfer ratio values in T2 lesions, which may signify lower myelin content in those lesions; and lower baseline diffusion tensor imaging-radial diffusivity values in T2 lesions, a characteristic that may be consistent with greater structural integrity. Practicing “precision medicine” involves identifying those factors that enable clinicians to give the right medication to the right patient at the right time. As this study shows, that effort may entail drawing on highly technical, and possibly even less understood, biomedical characteristics and concepts in the service of individualizing care. Ublituximab and central nervous system lesions in relapsing MS Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody given by infusion. Like Ocrevus, ublituximab targets the CD20 molecule. Researchers evaluated 24-week data from a Phase II trial of the medication in people with relapsing forms of MS. Among 31 individuals who had a total of 73 T1 gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions on MRI at baseline, no T1 Gd+ lesions were found at Week 24. Additionally, T2-lesion volume decreased by 8.1 percent from baseline to Week 24, prompting the authors to conclude that ublituximab has “robust efficacy” on MRI endpoints. Ozanimod is an oral, once-daily medication being evaluated for use in RRMS. It is a selective modulator of two types of S1P receptors: S1P1 and S1P5. Data from two Phase III studies, SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B, show that ozanimod, given at 1 mg/daily and 0.5 mg/daily, had favorable outcomes relative to Avonex (interferon beta-1a) – both in terms of annualized relapse rate (ARR) and MRI findings. Annualized relapse rate, or ARR, refers to how many relapses a person in a particular study group is likely to have, on average, over a one-year period. For example, if the placebo group in a clinical study had an ARR of “1,” the average person in that group could expect to have one relapse per year. Ozanimod, given at doses of either 1.0 mg or 0.5 mg, reduced the ARR by 48 percent and 31 percent respectively, compared to interferon beta-1a in the SUNBEAM trial. In these same doses, it also reduced the ARR by 38 percent and 21 percent respectively, compared to interferon beta-1a in the RADIANCE trial. Meanwhile, the adjusted mean number of new or enlarging T2 lesions was reduced by 25 percent to 48 percent in people taking ozanimod versus those receiving interferon beta-1a. Additionally, the individuals taking ozanimod had fewer adverse events overall and fewer adverse events leading to study discontinuation. Siponimod, relapses, and disability progression in secondary-progressive MS Siponimod is an oral medication being studied for use in secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Its mechanism of action is similar to that of Gilenya (fingolimod), in that it works at the S1P receptor family to block the movement of lymph cells from lymph nodes; however, siponimod appears to interact with fewer of the receptors than Gilenya does – with its primary actions at the S1P1 and the S1P5 receptors, the same receptors that ozanimod targets. The Phase III EXPAND study showed that siponimod reduced confirmed disability progression (CDP). Investigators analyzed the results of that trial to understand to what extent, if any, this effect was related to a reduction in relapses. This information is important to uncover, because it could have implications for the effectiveness of the medication in people who do not experience relapses or who have very infrequent relapses. Using sophisticated statistical analyses, the researchers concluded that, “Siponimod treatment reduces the risk for CDP in both relapsing and non-relapsing SPMS patients. Our analyses suggest that siponimod’s effect on disability is largely independent from the effect on relapses.” Research into the safety and effectiveness of a DMT does not stop when that medication wins approval from the FDA. Several recently reported studies provide ongoing information on approved DMTs or findings from focused analyses of data from those medications’ major Phase III clinical trials. Highlights from several such studies are reported below. Ocrevus (ocrelimzumab) was approved by the FDA in 2017 for RMS and PPMS. The medication is administered by IV infusion, with 600 mg given every six months. The safety and efficacy of Ocrevus were assessed in two large clinical trials, OPERA I and OPERA II, in which individuals with relapsing MS received either Ocrevus or Rebif (interferon beta-1a). At the end of those trials, study participants were allowed to continue on Ocrevus or switch from Rebif to Ocrevus during a so-called “open-label extension” (OLE) period. A recent analysis found that switching from Rebif to Ocrevus at the start of the OLE period was associated with rapid and significant reductions in disease activity as identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients who changed therapies in the OLE went from having an adjusted number of 0.48 T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions per scan prior to switching, to an average 0.00 such lesions per scan after one year and two years on Ocrevus. Tysabri (natalizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that is administered by IV infusion of a 300-mg dose every four weeks. The medication was approved for use in adults with relapsing MS in 2004. However, Tysabri was voluntarily withdrawn from the market the next year after three cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but potentially fatal brain infection caused by the JC virus, were identified in individuals taking the medication. Tysabri became available again in 2006, following implementation of a comprehensive risk-management program, which includes testing potential Tysabri users to see if they have anti-JC virus antibodies. Now, a team of New Zealand researchers have reported favorable results with administering Tysabri every six weeks rather than every four weeks, noting that they pursued extended-interval dosing with a view toward reducing the risk of PML. Those investigators report that after administering Tysabri at six-week intervals to 27 patients for an average of two years, none of the participants had lesions on MRI, and only one reported relapse. No participants were diagnosed with PML. This treatment strategy reflects ongoing efforts across the MS treatment spectrum to balance efficacy and safety to the patient’s maximal advantage. Aubagio (teriflunomide) was approved in 2012 for use in relapsing MS. It is an oral medication administered as 7-mg or 14-mg once daily. An analysis of long-term data on patients with relapsing MS who participated in two Phase III trials of the medication and the extensions of those trials found that 74 percent taking the 14-mg dose had stable or improved Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores over five years. Mean EDSS scores at five years were higher (indicating disease progression) in those who experienced a relapse, compared with those who did not – at 2.70 and 2.43 respectively. A separate study examined 169 pregnancies in women who took Aubagio during pregnancy. Based on findings of teratogenicity – an elevated incidence of birth defects – in animal studies, use of the medication is contraindicated in pregnant women and females of reproductive potential not using effective contraception. Nonetheless, some women have taken the medication shortly before conceiving or while pregnant. In this study, the final dose of Aubagio was administered pre-conception or in the first trimester in all but four cases. Outcomes were known for 67 of the 169 pregnancies. Two structural abnormalities were reported: one case of congenital hydrocephalus in a full-term pregnancy and one cystic hygroma (a fluid-filled sac resulting from a blockage in the lymphatic system) detected on ultrasound during pregnancy (with the outcome of that pregnancy unknown). Researchers concluded that the current data from pregnancies exposed to teriflunomide show no warning signs of a treatment-related increased risk for birth defects. Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) is a monoclonal antibody approved for use in RMS in 2014. It is administered by intravenous infusion over four hours for two multi-day treatment courses 12 months apart. Researchers recently analyzed data on 393 individuals who had participated in clinical trials of Lemtrada and then remained on the medication during a longer-term extension study. The researchers found that after using Lemtrada for six years, 77 percent of the more than 300 patients studied showed stable or improved Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores compared to their baseline scores. Additionally, 43 percent achieved a six-month confirmed disability improvement (CDI), further underscoring the long-term benefits of treatment. Another analysis examined outcomes in extension-study patients who received re-treatment with Lemtrada due to disease activity after the initial two courses of therapy. Among 178 participants who received at least one re-treatment, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) fell from 0.85 (12 months before receiving a third course of Lemtrada) to 0.20 (12 months after the third course). The percentage of individuals with a CDI increased from 4 percent to 14 percent over those two time periods. Researchers concluded, “Patients who were re-treated due to relapse and/or MRI activity after the initial two courses demonstrate continued alemtuzumab [Lemtrada] efficacy after [Course 3] with reduced relapses and stable or improved disability.” Glatiramer acetate is an injectable DMT approved for use in relapsing forms of MS. It is available both as a branded medication (Copaxone) and in generic form from two other companies. In a one-year, placebo-controlled study, administering the medication in a dose of 40 mg/mL three-times weekly reduced the annualized relapse rate (ARR) by 34 percent and MRI disease activity by 34.7 percent relative to placebo. A new analysis shows that those benefits were sustained for up to five years in people participating in the open-label phase of the study, which was supported by Teva. The overall ARR during the entire long-term follow-up period was 0.26 for individuals who started on glatiramer acetate in the placebo-controlled phase of the study, and was 0.32 for those who switched from placebo to glatiramer acetate in the open-label phase. Researchers added that the most common adverse events seen over the long term were generally mild and consistent with the medication’s established safety profile. Interferon beta-1b was the first DMT approved for use in MS, and today is available in branded form as Betaseron and Extavia. A 23-year observational follow-up study was conducted with 87 patients treated at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. The study found that 29 percent of individuals used the medication for less than one year, while 18 percent remained on therapy for more than 15 years. Of the individuals who stopped treatment, side effects were the reason cited most often in those who discontinued therapy before five years of use, while lack of efficacy was given as the reason for stopping in those who used the medication for longer periods. A stable disease course on a DMT does not predict continued stability after discontinuing that therapy, regardless of a person’s age. Noting that clinicians sometimes recommend stopping DMT therapy as individuals with MS get older, researchers assessed the advisability of this strategy by examining data from the New York State MS Consortium (NYSMSC) database. Of 135 patients who were considered stable on DMT therapy as determined by minimal change in EDSS score, 35.6 percent saw their EDSS score worsen after stopping their DMT. Age did not affect post-discontinuation course, with 34.1 percent of people age 54 years and younger and 37.7 percent of people age 55 years and older recording unfavorable changes in their EDSS scores after going off a DMT. People with MS and their healthcare providers today face a “welcome dilemma” unimaginable even 20 years ago. With more than a dozen disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) now approved by the FDA for use in adults, patients and clinicians have an opportunity (and challenge) to select the medication likely to best address the each individual’s specific health status and needs. That can be a daunting prospect, particularly because few clinical trials have directly compared one agent with another. Given the scarcity of such studies, investigators often rely on sophisticated analytical methods – such as propensity scoring and other techniques – to assess the merits of one agent relative to others. Those methods, while useful, typically are considered by physicians to be less authoritative than a head-to-head trial of two agents. This section highlights five recently presented studies that compared agents within the same trial or via analysis of data drawn from different trials or large patient databases. In considering various treatments, however, it is critical to not only look at clinical trial data and other analyses, but also for individuals to talk with their clinician about their specific history and circumstances – in order to individualize their care and achieve an optimal effect. DMT impact on cognition in patients at increased risk of progressive disease The OPERA 1 and OPERA 2 trials were identical Phase III studies that compared the effectiveness and safety of Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) to Rebif (interferon beta-1a) in people with relapsing MS. Study participants received either 600 mg of Ocrevus every 24 weeks or 44 ug of Rebif three times a week for 96 weeks. The studies included 186 individuals receiving Ocrevus and 180 receiving Rebif who were considered to be at increased risk of progressive disease based on their Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and pyramidal Kurtzke Functional Systems scores. Participants completed the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) at baseline and during the course of 96 weeks to assess their cognitive function. Over the study period, individuals receiving Ocrevus who were at increased risk for disease progression had a greater mean improvement in SDMT scores than did increased-risk individuals receiving Rebif (6.2 for Ocrevus versus 2.6 for Rebif). Assessing DMTs in terms of annualized relapse rates Annualized relapse rate (ARR) is a measure of a DMT’s impact on disease course in MS. Researchers drew on data from two studies of Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) and two studies of Aubagio (teriflunomide) to assess the ARR in newly diagnosed individuals starting one or the other of those medications. The participants had been diagnosed with relapsing MS within one year of study enrollment and had not taken other DMTs. The investigators used individual patient data from the studies to match analyzed subjects by key baseline characteristics. Their analysis showed that at 108 weeks after treatment initiation, the ARR was numerically lower in newly diagnosed individuals receiving Plegridy than in newly diagnosed Aubagio patients. However, this difference was not statistically significant. In a separate study, a German network of more than 130 neurologists drew on its database of roughly 25,000 individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) to assess various DMTs in terms of ARR. The analysis found that Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) had a statistically significant reduction in ARR versus interferon medications. Tecfidera also performed better than the other agents in terms of time to first relapse. A third study assessed the ARR in people with highly active RRMS who switched to either Tysabri (natalizumab) or Gilenya (fingolimod) after inadequate response to DMTs that are considered first-line therapies in Europe. Such medications include interferon medications, glatiramer acetate, Aubagio, and Tecfidera. Researchers analyzed data for 897 “patient triplets” or matched sets of individuals who either switched from one first-line therapy to another or from a first-line therapy to Tysabri or Gilenya. The study drew from the MSBase Registry, an international online registry for neurologists studying multiple sclerosis and other neuro-immunological diseases. The analysis found that after switching, individuals moving from a first-line therapy to Tysabri had an ARR of 0.21; those moving to Gilenya had an ARR of 0.30; and those switching from one first-line therapy to another had an ARR of 0.33. The ARR was statistically significantly reduced for Tysabri, with no evidence of difference for Gilenya. Earlier this year, Gilenya (fingolimod) became the first DMT approved to treat relapsing MS in adolescents and children aged 10 years and older. This medication was approved for use in adults with RMS in 2010. The Phase III PARADIGMS study compared use of Gilenya to interferon beta-1a for up to two years in 214 individuals aged 10 to 17 years with pediatric-onset MS. At the end of the study, Gilenya reduced the annualized rate of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions by 52.6 percent and the number of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions per scan by 66.0 percent compared with interferon beta-1a. The early recognition of MS and the evidence-based assessment of likely disease course are critical to patients’ and physicians’ ability to engage in shared decision-making on treatment choices and overall wellness strategies. A significant amount of research is being conducted to map the connections between imaging findings or biomarker levels and establishing the diagnosis and predicting the course of MS. Other studies are focused on what measures of physical function may reveal about current and future health status. Several recent studies exploring these issues are highlighted below. 2017 McDonald Criteria apply well to children at MS onset MRI findings play a key role in the diagnosis of MS, but most research on the significance of imaging results has been focused on adults. Now, a study by investigators from The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and other institutions, has found that the 2017 McDonald Criteria are largely applicable to children, as well as adults, when assessing patients at clinical disease onset. The researchers assessed more than 2,800 MRI scans from 331 pediatric patients with MS, acquired demyelinating syndrome, and related conditions, and followed those patients’ course over a median of six years. They found that the presence of ≥one T1-hypointense lesions or ≥one periventricular lesions were the MRI features most predictive of MS outcome. The 2010 McDonald criteria and 2017 version of those criteria had comparable utility in predicting a pediatric patient’s disease course, but the investigators said the 2017 criteria were easier to apply. “Both ‘black holes’ and periventricular lesions at baseline are strong predictors of MS” in children, as they are in adults, the researchers concluded, adding that evidence of new disease activity is required to confirm MS in children who present with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Location of brain lesions predictive of walking speed The presence of MRI-detected lesions in the infratentorial/cerebellar region of the brain is associated with slower walking speed in people with MS, according to a retrospective chart review of 82 individuals. A team of Connecticut-based researchers reviewed magnetic resonance images and medical records to determine whether the location of lesions in four areas of the central nervous system – the spinal cord, and the infratentorial/cerebellar, juxtacortical, and periventricular regions of the brain – was associated with mobility and disability in people with MS. No significant relationship was found between number of CNS regions with lesions and Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score or time in performing the Timed 25-Foot Walk test. Similarly, no significant relationship was seen between the presence of lesions in any one region of the CNS and EDSS score. Higher number of oligoclonal bands correlates with relapses and disease progression People with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) who had 10 or more oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were far more likely to have relapses and disease progression over the ensuing two years than individuals with RRMS who had <10 OCBs in their CSF samples. That was the finding from a retrospective study of 128 people with RRMS on DMT therapy. Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania also found that in addition to having more relapses and more new lesions on MRI, people with ≥10 OCBs were more likely to begin using an assistive device relative to their counterparts with fewer OCBs. “As OCBs may have greater diagnostic weight going forward, the quantity may be important in guiding selection of DMTs,” the study’s authors noted. Tapping into a new means of assessing MS subtype and mobility The number of times a person with MS can tap his or her foot in 10 seconds correlates with MS subtype and with results of mobility measures such as the 25-Foot Walk Test (25FWT). This finding was discovered by researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and related institutions. In a study of 30 people with non-progressive MS, 30 with progressive MS, and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, 10-second tap counts distinguished people with MS from healthy controls, and those with progressive MS from their peers with non-progressive MS. Further, slower foot tapping correlated with slower performance on the 25FWT and Timed Up and Go test (TUG). “The associations between foot tap speed and mobility measures, such as the TUG test and 25FWT, suggest that rapid foot-tapping may be a useful marker for tracking or predicting progression of mobility dysfunction in people with MS, regardless of their ability to ambulate,” the researchers noted. Various Strategies for Wellness and Symptom Management, Physical Activity and Exercise, Vitamin D, and Reproductive-Health Topics People with MS often must contend with a wide range of issues affecting their quality of life, overall health status, and general well-being. As the nature and impact of those issues have become better understood in recent years, an array of healthcare professionals – from psychologists and physical therapists to health educators and epidemiologists – are analyzing databases and devising innovative programs to further define and more effectively address challenges involving everything from insomnia to infertility. To follow are highlights of research in these areas. These were reported earlier this year at the Annual Meetings of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC). Well, maybe not the absolute best medicine, but apparently good medicine when it comes to addressing depression in people with MS and other neurologic conditions. Researchers at Evergreen Health in Kirkland, Washington, conducted a prospective, open trial of laughter therapy (LT) for 31 participants: 17 with MS, eight with Parkinson’s disease, two with spinal cord injury, and the remainder with other disorders of the central nervous system. After participating in eight, 60-minute laughter therapy classes taught by a certified LT instructor (yes, there is such a thing), participants who completed the course saw an improvement from baseline in their scores on a measure of depression. Scores on a separate measure of anxiety essentially were unchanged from baseline. “Our findings show that LT may reduce depression and be administered across a variety of neurological deficits, including for people with limited exercise options due to severe disability,” the researchers noted. However, they added that the approximate 50 percent attrition rate – with 14 participants not completing the program – may indicate a potential shortcoming for when the intervention is employed in people with neurological conditions. Comparing strategies for stress reduction in people with MS Both mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and group education on stress reduction can provide short-and long-term benefits to people with MS, according to a randomized study involving 62 adults with MS and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of ≤8.0. Compared to their status at the start of the study, people in both groups experienced significant reductions in stress both eight weeks and 12 months after participating in an MBRS program or group education. Both groups also saw improvement on a measure of emotional well-being at eight weeks, but that improvement was no longer statistically significant at 12 months. No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of degree of stress reduction achieved or improvement in emotional well-being, suggesting that both approaches are viable options for addressing the stress and other emotional issues that can be part of living with MS. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may improve insomnia symptoms, sleep quality, and fatigue in the roughly 40 percent of people with MS who experience chronic insomnia, according to an ongoing study. Seven people have completed the randomized controlled trial thus far, with five participating in a six-week program of CBT for insomnia and two serving as controls. The CBT group showed a 78 percent improvement from baseline on a measure of insomnia symptoms, compared to a 38 percent improvement in the control group. Similarly, sleep quality improved by 63 percent for people in the CBT group and 32 percent in the control group. Additionally, two measures of fatigue showed improvements of 70 percent and 50 percent, respectively, for people receiving CBT, versus a 37 percent improvement and 20 percent worsening, respectively, for control group members. Can shared medical appointments enhance wellness in MS? So much needs to happen in an MS patient’s regular visit with his or her clinician. As a result, education on wellness, managing co-morbidities, and other important topics can get lost in the time crunch. Two researchers from Cleveland explored whether shared medical appointments, or SMAs, may be a solution to that problem. In the typical SMA model, individual appointments for patients are scheduled around a time set aside for group instruction and discussion. In this case, the Cleveland researchers offered a monthly SMA, with group sessions covering topics such as nutrition, therapeutic yoga, and guided imagery. Thirty-three patients attended at least one SMA, with 45 percent of those participants returning for at least one more SMA, and 36 percent attending three or more sessions. Patient-satisfaction assessments found 75 percent of participants had a favorable view of the value of the information presented and regarding attending future SMAs. Female patients attended preferentially relative to men, noted the researchers, adding that “encouraging wellness interventions at an earlier age and to wider demographics and disability level” may encourage more people with MS to adopt healthy lifestyle practices. Becoming physically active is a challenge for people with MS – and for all people, for that matter. Staying active after completing a formal physical therapy or exercise program can be even more of a challenge. However, two New York City physical therapists have reported success in encouraging ongoing physical activity among seven of eight participants in a six-week wellness exercise class (WEC) they conducted. All eight of the program’s participants recently had been discharged from outpatient physical therapy. The weekly exercise class that they then entered consisted of 60 minutes of progressive aerobic and resistance training, as well as stretching. Upon completing the six-week class, participants showed improvement from baseline on several measures of the physical and psychological impact of MS. And, in keeping with the adage that success begets success, at a follow-up four weeks after completing the class, seven of the eight class members reported being active in an independent gym program. The researchers concluded, “Providers should work with physical therapists to assure that, after rehabilitation, affordable opportunities such as group WEC exist to help those with MS have the opportunity to independently engage in an exercise program. This bridge between therapy and discharge could safely enhance adherence to exercise post rehabilitation, and potentially decrease the need for a future prolonged course of PT.” Research supports maximal strength training for people with MS Properly supervised maximal strength training (MST) is safe for people with MS and can help improve their strength, balance, and walking speed, according to a team of researchers from Hunter College in New York City. Those researchers conducted a pilot study in which nine people with MS (six women and three men) participated in an eight-week program. The twice-weekly sessions involved leg press, knee flexion, and ankle plantarflexion, with weights increased based on participant capability and preference. At the end of the exercise program, the participants showed significant improvement from baseline in the Six Minute Walk Test and Mini-BESTest. Meanwhile, measures of fatigue and spasticity did not change significantly from the study’s start until its end, suggesting that the strength training did not increase fatigue or spasticity. The researchers noted that while the study is ongoing, the results to date suggest that “MST is a safe and effective intervention, and that [people with multiple sclerosis] can benefit from a higher intensity of intervention than might have previously been thought.” Time spent in physical activity correlates with higher Vitamin D concentrations in people with MS, according to a study of 23 women and 15 men with multiple sclerosis and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of ≤4.0. Researchers used an activity-monitoring device, patient diaries, and measurement of Vitamin D blood levels to follow patients over a one-month period. The participants did not take Vitamin D supplements before or during the study. The fact that study participants who were more physically active had higher levels of Vitamin D than those who were not as active – despite the fact that they were not taking the Vitamin D supplements, is intriguing. This is because many MS patients have lower-than-normal Vitamin D levels, and because physical activity has been shown to improve outcomes in MS. The study’s authors noted that alternative pathways leading to the connection between disease progression and Vitamin D levels need to be considered. Long-term reduction in spasticity seen with intrathecal baclofen therapy Five years after implantation of a pump to deliver intrathecal baclofen therapy, both ambulatory and non-ambulatory people with MS had significant reductions in spasticity, according to researchers from the Cleveland Clinic Mellen Center and related institutions. Those researchers examined the records of 77 individuals (40 ambulatory and 37 non-ambulatory) who had a pump implanted between 2001 and 2014, and for whom at least three years of follow-up data were available. The patient’s mean age at surgery to implant the pump was 47.1 years; 62 percent of the patients were women. For ambulatory patients, spasticity as measured by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) improved from 14.5 (range 10.8-20.25) at baseline to 2 (range 0-8) after five years on IBT. For non-ambulatory patients, MAS score improved from 24 (range 16.5-26) to 2 (range 0-5) after five years of IBT. Pain scores also improved significantly in both groups. Physical therapy (PT) has been shown to improve gait speed in people with MS. The medication dalfampridine extended-release (DER) also can increase gait speed in those with MS, but only about 38 percent of individuals experience this benefit. Now, the results of a small study support combining the interventions in people with MS who do not see a 20 percent or greater improvement in their Timed 25 Foot Walk test (T25W) after three weeks on the medication. The study involved eight adults with MS. Four of those people had been taking DER for three weeks and did not have a ≥20 percent improvement in T25W at the end of that period. They continued on DER for another six weeks, but also engaged in twice-weekly physical therapy during that period. The other four participants did not receive DER but also engaged in six weeks of twice-weekly PT. Among the DER + PT patients, T25FW results improved by 20.7 percent from Week 3 to Week 9, while the PT-only group had a 6.8 percent improvement in T25W during that period. Infertility and MS – findings from a large database analysis Women with MS are more likely to have a diagnosis of infertility, less likely to use infertility medications, and less likely to have a live birth than their age-matched peers without MS. Those are the main findings from an analysis of United States’ commercial insurance claims for 117,041 women with MS and more than 1.4 million women without MS. The analysis, which spanned the period from 2006 through 2015, found that 8.52 percent of women with MS and 8.02 percent of those without MS had a diagnosis of infertility. While that percentage difference is small, the researchers noted that it is statistically significant. Similarly, a significantly lower proportion of women with MS used any fertility treatment relative to women without MS (1.01 percent versus 1.19 percent). Finally, the rate of live births in women on any infertility treatment was 5.00 percent among women with MS, compared with 6.98 percent among those who did not have MS. Data from the New York State Multiple Sclerosis Consortium (NYSMSC) provide reassuring news regarding both the incidence of relapses during pregnancy and the near-term effect on infants of maternal use of DMTs in pregnancy. Among 109 women who reported a pregnancy after being diagnosed with MS, 48.6 percent had a relapse in the two years before becoming pregnant, but just 11.9 percent reported a relapse during pregnancy. Those relapses were more common in the first and second trimesters than in the third trimester. Meanwhile, 45.8 percent of the women reported a relapse in the first two years after birth, with most of the relapses occurring in the first year after delivery. Women who had experienced a relapse in the 24 months before pregnancy were more likely than others to have a relapse in the 24 months after birth, while relapse during pregnancy was not associated with postpartum relapse. Eleven of the women in the analysis were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for at least part of their pregnancy, with six continuing to use their DMT through their entire pregnancy. None of those women reported birth problems, and none of their children had been referred for special medical services at age 1 or 2 years. Hot Topics in MS: Stem Cells, Lipoic Acid, Diet and MS, Obesity and MS, Gut Microbiome, and Medical Marijuana Research into interventions for MS extends far beyond the important efforts to develop new pharmacologic treatments and to better understand the efficacy and safety profile of currently approved medications. Increasingly, investigators are assessing the impact of diet, the gut microbiome – a key component of the immune system – and various substances as they look for ways to manage symptoms and improve outcomes. Studies also are exploring the role of two very different types of interventions long used to treat other conditions — medical marijuana and stem-cell transplantation – in MS. This section reviews pertinent findings in these and other areas reported at the 2018 Annual Meetings of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC). When relapses continue while taking a DMT – a role for stem-cell therapy? An international team of researchers is assessing the role of stem-cell transplantation for individuals with highly active RRMS who continue to have relapses despite taking a DMT. At the AAN’s annual meeting, those scientists reported interim results from their Multiple Sclerosis International Stem cell Transplant (MIST) trial. The study involves 110 individuals with RRMS on a DMT who have had two or more relapses in the past 12 months. Fifty-five patients were randomly assigned to receive stem-cell transplantation, while the other 55 continue to receive the DMT that their treating neurologist deemed best for them. Importantly, the study is employing “non-myeloablative” stem-cell transplantation, meaning that patients can go through a less-demanding pre-treatment regimen than what was first used in stem-cell transplantation and still often used in treating certain types of cancer. The study’s main endpoint is treatment failure, defined as a 1.0 increase in EDSS sustained for six months or more. After a mean follow-up of three years, 60 percent of patients in the DMT arm had experienced a treatment failure, compared to just 6 percent of those in the stem-cell transplant group. During the first year after transplant, those receiving stem cells saw their EDDS score improve from 3.5 to 2.4, while it worsened in the DMT group from 3.3 to 3.9. Both of those findings were statistically significant. No deaths occurred in the stem-cell transplant group. These results led the researchers to conclude that in people with RRMS who have more than two relapses in a year while on a DMT, stem-cell transplantation is superior to continued use of a disease-modifying therapy. Meanwhile, a separate, smaller study from a single center suggests that stem-cell transplantation may be a first-line option for the minority of MS patients who have rapidly evolving severe multiple sclerosis (RESMS), also known as highly active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). British investigators performed stem-cell transplantation on five men and two women who had not received a disease-modifying therapy (DMT), and who had experienced two or more severe relapses in the 12 months before the procedure. These individuals all had clinical or imaging findings that suggested that their MS would continue to worsen, and all had at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion seen on MRI associated with their relapses. They ranged in age from 27 to 52 years old, and their median time between symptom onset and treatment was nine months. The investigators used each patient’s own stem cells for the procedure. After a median follow-up period of 18 months, none of the participants had experienced a relapse following the transplantation, although one had a single new gadolinium-enhancing lesion six months after treatment. The median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score for these individuals improved from a median 5.5 before treatment to 3 at the last follow-up. No serious adverse effects were observed. The investigators concluded that autologous (using the patient’s own cells) hematopoietic (blood-cell producing) stem-cell transplantation is safe and effective for previously untreated patients with rapidly evolving, severe MS. Lipoic acid is a naturally occurring compound that exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Its potential role as a dietary supplement for people with MS has been the focus of recent research, including a study by investigators from the Oregon Health & Science University and VA Portland Health Care System. Those researchers administered 1,200 mg of oral lipoic acid to people with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), and healthy controls. They then drew blood samples to measure the amount of lipoic acid found in the plasma of all three groups, as well as levels of substances involved in immune system responses. In particular, the investigators wanted to see if taking lipoic acid would stimulate the body’s production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which plays a role in modulating the immune system. They found that two hours and four hours after ingesting lipoic acid, the health controls and people with SPMS had increased cAMP levels relative to baseline, while those with RRMS had decreases in cAMP. Also, women with RRMS had lower plasma concentrations of prostaglandin E2, which stimulates cAMP, compared to women with SPMS and women without MS four hours after taking lipoic acid. These findings prompted the investigators to conclude that the differences in the way people with RRMS responded to lipoic acid relative to those without MS or with SPMS may have implications for the efficacy of immunomodulatory agents in RRMS. Following a paleolithic diet can help decrease fatigue in MS through changes in people’s lipid profiles, according to a study reported at the AAN annual meeting. The paleolithic – or so-called “caveman” diet – focuses on eating meat, fish, nuts, and vegetables available before the advent of processed food. A one-year study of 18 people with progressive MS found that a comprehensive intervention that included following a paleolithic diet, neuromuscular stimulation, and stress reduction reduced participants’ mean Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score from 5.51 at baseline to 3.03 at 12 months. During that time, participants saw their HDL-C (“good cholesterol”) levels increase, their total cholesterol levels decrease, and their body mass index (BMI) fall (BMI is a measure of healthy or unhealthy weight). The researchers concluded, “Lipid profile variables are associated with the improvements in fatigue in progressive MS patients on a modified Paleolithic diet-based multimodal intervention.” Meanwhile, researchers from Johns Hopkins reported on people with MS who follow a Mediterranean-style diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, seafood and polyunsaturated fats while eating little red meat and drinking in moderation. The researchers found that these individuals appear to have less severe depressive and cognitive symptoms than people with MS who follow a more-traditional American diet. The researchers had 34 people with MS complete dietary recall surveys and then assessed those people for depression, cognitive impairment, and other known symptoms of MS. The investigators noted that the results of this cross-sectional survey need to be validated by interventional studies that could better examine the nature of the relationship seen between diet and the MS symptoms studied. Other research being conducted at Johns Hopkins is examining how caloric restriction affects the metabolite profiles of people with MS. In a six-month study, 19 people with MS who were receiving monthly injections of Tysabri and who had a higher body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m (indicating that they are overweight) chose from one of two calorie-restriction strategies. The first strategy, chosen by 11 individuals, involved continuous calorie restriction (CCR), with participants consuming 78.6 percent of their daily caloric needs each day. The other approach, chosen by eight participants, entailed intermittent calorie restriction (ICR), with people consuming only 25 percent of their daily caloric needs two days per week, and consuming their full caloric needs on the other days of the week. Nine of the 11 people in the CCR group and six of the eight in the ICR group completed the study. Researchers are assessing blood samples collected at baseline, three months, and six months to see how the two calorie-restriction approaches influenced the production of metabolites. They note that the results of their analysis may provide new information on how dietary changes affect clinical outcomes in MS. People who are obese at the onset of MS are likely to experience greater functional impairment and higher risk of relapses in the first two years after onset than people with a healthy weight, according to a study of more than 1,500 people with MS. Drawing on data for 1,524 participants in the Accelerated Cure Project’s study, researchers found that obesity was associated with a 15-percent increase in the number of impaired functional domains and a 30-percent increase in early relapse activity. People who were obese also were on average 8-percent older than non-obese patients at the onset of MS. The investigators explain, “These results warrant further investigation into the impact of this proinflammatory phenotype [obesity] in MS.” Gut reaction? Exploring potential ties between MS and the digestive tract’s microbiome The mix of bacteria found in the digestive tracts of people with MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) differ from the bacterial milieu found in the gastrointestinal systems of people who don’t have those conditions, two recent studies found. Those studies reflect a growing research focus on potential links between MS and the “gut microbiome,” the digestive tract’s bacterial environment, which is known to play a major role in immune-system function. In the first study, American researchers used sophisticated genetic testing to analyze 42 stool samples from individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), as well as stool samples from 28 healthy donors. Compared to the samples from healthy volunteers, stool samples from people with RRMS had a statistically significant greater abundance of several types of bacteria, including Ruminococcus torques, Ruminococcus obeum, and Lactospiraces. Escherichia coli and Oscillibacter also were found more often in people with RRMS than in healthy controls. Conversely, people who did not have MS had a higher concentration of other bacteria – including bacteroides fragilis and Roseburia – than did study participants with MS. The researchers noted that further, larger studies are needed to determine whether these findings can help pave the way for markers of disease activity or even therapies that target the composition of the gut microbiome. Meanwhile, Italian investigators found differences in both the stool and blood samples of individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) – referring to individuals experiencing a symptom of MS, but who have not yet been diagnosed – relative to healthy volunteers. They found that butyrate-producing bacteria were more abundant in the healthy volunteers compared to those with CIS. Additionally, the blood of people with CIS had an increased level of a type of white blood cell involved in immune function – T helper (Th) 17 – and fewer T regulatory (Treg) cells producing Interleukin 10, compared to healthy volunteers. The researchers said that both findings indicate that gut microbiome dysfunction or imbalance exists at the earliest stages of MS. Most people with MS who use medical marijuana (MM), find that the medication helps manage their pain, spasticity, and other symptoms. This is according to two recent small-scale studies. In the first study, 14 individuals at the University of Rochester MS Center (13 with MS and one with transverse myelitis) enrolled in the New York State Medical Marijuana Program and completed a survey on their experience with MM. Ninety-three percent of these individuals who were certified by the state program to use medical marijuana actually had tried the medication at least once, with 77 percent reporting ongoing use, and 62 percent saying they used MM at least daily. Seventy-seven percent of participants said MM was helpful in managing their symptoms, 70 percent said that their quality of life improved with marijuana use, and most respondents reported no side effects. Most subjects estimated that they spent between $100 and $300 per month on MM, and cost was cited as a factor in stopping use of MM or using the agent less frequently.   The second study is being conducted in Colorado, where cannabis use – for any purpose, not just medical reasons – is legal. The experience and beliefs of 25 patients from the Rocky Mountain Multiple Sclerosis Center at the University of Colorado were reported in preliminary findings from the research. Fifty-six percent of those participants believe cannabis has a beneficial effect on MS symptoms, while 8 percent think marijuana could entail harm in terms of MS symptoms. Seventy-six percent said they would consider cannabis use to ease their symptoms. Pain was the reason most frequently cited for using cannabis (by 57 percent of respondents), followed by spasticity/muscle tightness (29 percent), and muscle spasms (14 percent). Slowed thinking was the most commonly reported side effect, cited by 29 percent of participants. Forty-eight percent of survey respondents said that they were not currently using cannabis, with half of those people saying their non-usage was because they did not know enough about the medication. The authors of the second study noted, “As cannabis becomes more available under the laws of individual states, the results of this ongoing study may have important implications in the future landscape of MS symptom treatment and research exploring the efficacy of cannabis for MS symptom management.” For general information or to speak with a trained Client Services Specialist, please call MSAA’s Helpline at .

2a3f72b7-e391-412b-b439-58440a3640d1,"A sudden or severe exacerbation (also known as a relapse, attack, flare-up, or episode), in which existing symptoms worsen, or new symptoms develop. To be considered a true relapse, symptoms must be present for at least 24 to 48 hours, and not be associated with other factors that might mimic an acute attack, such as a urinary tract infection, anxiety, depression, hot weather, and extreme exercise. Relapses occur with relapsing-remitting, progressive-relapsing, and sometimes secondary-progressive forms of MS. Written instructions that provide specific directions to doctors and family regarding a person’s end-of-life choices in advance, should this person become unable to make these decisions on his or her own when needed. Typically include appointing a healthcare representative or proxy as well as creating a “living will.” A brace that holds and angles the foot and ankle in the best position for maximum comfort and mobility. This device can also relieve stress on the knee. A protein produced by the body’s immune system when it detects foreign substances, called antigens. Examples of antigens include microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses) and chemicals. Antibodies may be produced when the immune system mistakenly targets healthy tissue, which happens with an autoimmune disorder. Each type of antibody is unique and defends the body against one specific type of antigen. A foreign molecule or substance that stimulates the immune system to activate a series of events to eliminate the antigen. In MS, the immune system misdirects the reactivity to antigens to damage the CNS, which is referred to as autoimmunity. Tools, products, or types of equipment that help someone perform tasks and activities. They may help individuals to move around, see, communicate, eat, or get dressed. Some are high-tech tools, such as computers (which can be adapted to meet various disabilities such as reduced vision or dexterity/mobility problems). Others are much simpler, like a “reacher” – a tool that helps someone to grasp an object that is difficult to reach. Any service or tool that can help a person with a disability perform activities that might otherwise be difficult or not be possible. Inability to coordinate walking movements. The decrease in the volume of brain or muscle tissue often associated with MS. When the body’s own immune system attacks its own tissue, it is known as an autoimmune disease. MS is believed to be an autoimmune disease. The ANS helps control blood flow to and from the extremities; it also controls: heart rate; blood pressure; bowel, bladder, and sexual activity; and other automatic bodily functions. The wire-like nerve fibers that conduct signals between neurons (nerves of the brain and spinal cord). Axons have a protective myelin covering and are found in the white matter of the brain. Damaged nerves that are unable to efficiently conduct impulse flow. Immune-system cells that produce antibodies to fight against “foreign invaders” (such as bacteria or viruses) within the body and help to regulate other immune cells. These cells have been shown to be an element of the autoimmune destruction seen in MS. The Babinski reflex occurs after the sole of the foot has been firmly stroked. The big toe then moves upward or toward the top surface of the foot. The other toes fan out. This reflex is normal in children up to 2-years old. It disappears as the child gets older. When the Babinski reflex is present in a child older than 2 years or in an adult, it is often a sign of a brain or nervous-system disorder. Multiple sclerosis is among the disorders that could be indicated by this reflex in people older than 2 years. Bell’s palsy is the most common cause of facial paralysis. It usually affects just one side of the face. Symptoms appear suddenly and are at their worst about 48 hours after they start. They can range from mild to severe and include twitching, weakness, paralysis, drooping eyelid or corner of mouth, drooling, dry eye or mouth, excessive tearing in the eye, and impaired ability to taste. Scientists think that a viral infection makes the facial nerve swell or become inflamed. Individuals are most likely to get Bell’s palsy if pregnant, diabetic, or sick with a cold or flu. It can also occur with multiple sclerosis. Three out of four patients improve without treatment. With or without treatment, most people begin to get better within two weeks and recover completely within three to six months. A protective barrier that lines the blood vessels, this layer of cells is designed to prevent damaging cells and other substances in the blood (including those that could cause disease) from entering the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord of the CNS. Consists of the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord and functions to send and receive nerve impulses throughout the body. The liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Prior to a diagnosis of MS, CIS is a single attack (or the appearance of one or more symptoms characteristic of MS), with a very high risk of developing MS, when no other diseases or causes for symptoms are apparent. A group of mental processes that include functions such as memory, decision making, and concentration, which is the ability to focus on specific tasks and planning. Some of the cognitive functions typically affected in people with MS include: information processing; perceiving; attending/responding to incoming information; information-processing speed; cognitive flexibility, such as attending to multiple stimuli at the same time (“multi-tasking”); problems with storage, manipulation, and retrieval of information; and executive function, which includes planning, working memory, attention, and problem-solving. A type of steroid that works by reducing inflammation in the CNS. A steroid first used to treat MS relapses in 1951. Small proteins that may stimulate or inhibit the function of other cells. They connect to specific receptors found on the surface of cells and send messages from one cell to another. They can stimulate or inhibit the inflammation process. Damage to the protective (insulating) covering of the nerves (myelin) of the CNS, causing interruptions in the flow of nerve impulses in the CNS. This can ultimately affect a wide range of function. Double vision resulting from lesions in the brain stem, a part of the nervous system between the brain and cervical spinal cord. Neither the participants nor the medical staff administering or evaluating the new treatment are told who is receiving the drug and who is receiving the placebo or other drug being compared to the test drug. Speech that is slurred or poorly articulated; it can involve a loss of volume control, unnatural emphasis on words or sentences, and a slower rate of speaking. Type of pain that is experienced as a burning, aching, or “pins and needles” type of sensation under the skin. For some, this can be painful; for others, it is more bothersome. Disorder causing changes in the quality of speech, such as a breathless quality to the voice, or speech that sounds harsh. An electrical test used to evaluate nerve and muscle problems. Evoked potentials measure the speed of the brain’s response to visual, auditory (sound), or sensory (feeling) stimuli to the central nervous system, using electrodes (taped to the patient’s head) and a computer. This system measures the time for an impulse to travel from the eye, ear, arm, or leg to the brain. This 10-point scale (from 1 to 10 with half points) measures degrees of disability, largely in terms of mobility. Points 1 to 3 on the scale are primarily used to measure function; points 4 to 9 measure mobility. Half points are used for higher clarity. An MS-like disease in animals, induced through the injection of myelin plus adjuvant (a substance that enhances the body’s response), to enable investigators to see how experimental treatments affect this MS-like disorder (often in mice). A type of dye given via injection prior to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It serves to enhance areas of active inflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. A procedure to help bring urinary symptoms under control by inserting a catheter (a specially designed thin tube) into the urinary opening to drain urine from the bladder, for people who cannot empty their bladder normally (see neurogenic bladder). An electric shock-like sensation down the spine and legs when the neck is flexed forward; approximately 40 percent of individuals with MS experience this type of pain, although it usually does not require any treatment. It is often an indication of myelin damage in the spinal-cord area. Also known as a spinal tap, LP is a procedure where a very thin needle is inserted at the lower back and a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is collected to look for induced changes or other problems. A type of white blood cell that plays a strong role in the body’s immune system, which works to defend the body against foreign bodies and disease. In MS, the lymphocytes may be misdirected to cause damage to the central nervous system. Some lymphocytes help to control the MS damage (T-regulatory cells). Type of white blood cell that works to ingest and destroy foreign substances. Scan of the brain and/or spine. The MRI uses a computer, radiofrequency stimulator, and a large electromagnet to provide a picture of the brain. Monoclonal antibodies are produced to defend the body and are derived from cells that are identical (cloned from a single cell and then replicated). They are produced from animal tissue, most commonly laboratory mice. Humanized monoclonal antibodies are antibodies from non-human species whose protein sequences have been modified to increase their similarity to antibodies produced naturally in humans. Monoclonal antibodies are an important type of medication, as they can be specifically targeted to perform a particular action, which is desirable when trying to impact a complex structure like the immune system. The name of all monoclonal antibodies ends with “mab.” These antibodies attack and destroy specific inflammatory lymphocytes that may be damaging the CNS in MS. A scale that measures lower-limb function (walking), upper-limb function (arm movements), and cognition. Myelin is a fatty protein that serves as a protective covering and insulation to the nerves (called axons) that work like wires to carry messages to and from the CNS. Bladder problems resulting from demyelination in the nervous system pathways that control the muscles of the bladder and the sphincters of the urinary tract. The three categories of bladder problems are usually referred to as “failure to store” (small, spastic bladder), “failure to empty” (large, flaccid bladder), and “dyssynergia,” which is a disconnect between the muscles of the bladder wall and the urinary sphincter. Involuntary movements of the eyes that result from lesions in the brain stem, a part of the nervous system between the brain and cervical spinal cord. It typically is an uncontrolled side-to-side (horizontal) or up-and-down (vertical) movements of the eye. It can be asymptomatic (causing no visual problems) or severe enough to disturb vision. Objects may appear to jump or move unpredictably as the two eyes no longer coordinate well with each other. Nystagmus can be more of a nuisance than a major problem and is usually temporary. It may sometimes distort vision. Abnormal immune proteins called immunoglobulins. These are present in the CSF of roughly 90 percent of individuals with MS, however, they can occur with several other neurological disorders. Since the introduction of the MRI, CSF analysis is used less often, but it can be helpful in supporting an MS diagnosis if the MRI results are normal or inconclusive. Cells that produce and maintain myelin. Over time, oligodendrocytes may be damaged or lost and fail to repair the damaged myelin. A condition that causes decreased or blurred vision. This is an inflammation of the optic nerve, which – unlike the nerves that innervate most of the body that are part of the peripheral nervous system – is actually part of the central nervous system and is myelinated in the same way as axons in the brain and spinal cord. Tingling, burning, or numbing sensation. Sudden recurrence of a symptom, spasm, or seizure. Area around the cerebro-spinal fluid in the brain. Areas of inflammation and damage in the brain or spinal cord in MS. This form of MS presents a gradual but steady accumulation of neurological problems from the onset, without the presence of relapses and remissions. A progressive course of MS from the onset with acute relapses occurring later in the disease course. Characterized by uncontrolled, inappropriate, and/or exaggerated episodes of crying, laughing, or other emotional display. PBA occurs involuntarily with little or no stimulation to invoke such a response. A temporary worsening of symptoms without actual myelin inflammation or damage, brought on by other influences. These can include other illnesses or infection, over-exercise, a warm environment, depression, exhaustion, and stress. When symptoms flare, checking for a fever is important, since even a minor infection and slight increase in temperature can cause symptoms to appear. A temporary worsening or recurrence of existing symptoms and/or the appearance of new symptoms (also called an “acute attack;” definition shown above), caused by inflammation occurring along the nerves and the myelin. This can range from a few days in duration to a few months, followed by a complete or partial recovery (remission). Acute physical symptoms and neurological signs must be present for at least 24 to 48 hours, without any signs of infection or fever, before the treating physician may consider this type of flare-up to be a true relapse. Treatments may improve recovery time. A course of MS that includes temporary symptom flare-ups (also referred to as relapses, attacks, exacerbations, or bouts), which typically last for one to three months. These are followed by a complete or partial recovery. Reduction and stability in severity of one’s MS, or the disappearance of symptoms. The restoration or repair of myelin (protective covering to the nerves). Characterized by long pauses between syllables and words with loss of melody in speech production; it is a type of dysarthria. Blind spot in the center of the visual field. This phase of MS follows relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and is reached when the patient experiences a progressive worsening of symptoms. SPMS may occur with or without superimposed relapses. Disease-modifying therapies for MS help to delay the conversion from RRMS to SPMS. A tightness or stiffness of the muscles – occurring typically in the legs (calf or thigh), groin, buttocks, arms, or hands. Immune-system cells that have the ability to increase an immune response within the body, causing inflammation and damage in MS. A spontaneous, sharp or shooting facial pain, often brought on by a light touch or movement. The sensation of “spinning or rotation,” which may occur as the result of lesions in the brainstem areas that coordinate balance.

Current research in , , , and , together with , provide support for the notion that MS is not a single disease but rather a spectrum. There are three : , characterized by periods of neurological worsening following by remissions; , in which there is gradual progression of neurological dysfunction with fewer or no relapses; and , in which neurological deterioration is observed from onset. is a convergence of pathology with physiology. Pathology is the medical discipline that describes conditions typically observed during a disease state; whereas physiology is the biological discipline that describes processes or mechanisms operating within an organism. Referring to MS, the physiology refers to the different processes that lead to the development of the lesions and the pathology refers to the condition associated with the lesions. Multiple sclerosis can be pathologically defined as the presence of distributed (or ) in the disseminated in time (DIT) and space (DIS). The gold standard for MS diagnosis is pathological correlation, though given its limited availability, other diagnosis methods are normally used. The scleroses that define the disease are the remainders of previous demyelinating lesions in the CNS white matter of a patient () showing special characteristics, such as confluent instead of perivenous demyelination. There are two phases for how an unknown underlying condition may cause damage in MS: An unknown soluble factor (produced by CD8+ T-cells or CD20+ B-cells), creates a toxic environment that activates microglia. with hidden damage appear in the brain and spine (). Some clusters of activated , axonal transection and myelin degeneration are present. appear and immune cells infiltrate, causing . and axon destruction. Multiple sclerosis differs from other in its confluent cortical lesions. These types of lesions are the most specific finding for MS, being exclusively present in MS patients, though currently they can only be detected at autopsy. Most MS findings take place inside the white matter, and lesions appear mainly in a periventricular distribution (clustered around the ventricles of the brain). Apart from demyelination, the and deep (GM) nuclei can be affected, together with diffuse injury of the NAWM. GM atrophy is independent of classical MS lesions and is associated with physical disability, fatigue, and cognitive impairment in MS At least five characteristics are present in CNS tissues of MS patients: beyond classical white matter lesions, production with , an environment fostering immune cell persistence, and a disruption of the outside of active lesions. The that give the name to the condition are produced by healing old lesions. MS is active even during remission periods. -like aggregates in the are formed only in secondary progressive MS. and correlate with the degree of subpial cortical demyelination and brain atrophy, suggesting that they might contribute to cortical pathology in SPMS These follicles are composed mainly of infected B-cells. Four different damage patterns have been identified in patient's brain tissues. The original report suggests that there may be several types of MS with different immune causes, and that MS may be a family of several diseases. Though originally a biopsy was required to classify the lesions of a patient, since 2012 it is possible to classify them by a blood test looking for antibodies against 7 lipids, three of which are cholesterol derivatives are believed to both impair myelin repair and aggravate inflammation. It is believed that they may correlate with differences in disease type and prognosis, and perhaps with different responses to treatment. In any case, understanding lesion patterns can provide information about differences in disease between individuals and enable doctors to make more effective treatment decisions. According to one of the researchers involved in the original research, ""Two patterns (I and II) showed close similarities to T-cell-mediated or T-cell plus antibody-mediated autoimmune encephalomyelitis, respectively. The other patterns (III and IV) were highly suggestive of a primary oligodendrocyte dystrophy, reminiscent of virus- or toxin-induced demyelination rather than autoimmunity."" The scar presents and around blood vessels, with preservation of , but no signs of activation. The scar presents T-cells and macrophages around blood vessels, with preservation of oligodendrocytes, as before, but also signs of activation can be found. This pattern has been considered similar to damage seen in NMO, though AQP4 damage does not appear in pattern II MS lesions Nevertheless, pattern II has been reported to respond to , which points to something pathogenic into the blood serum. The infiltration in these cases convert this pattern into a candidate for research into autoimmune connections like anti-, anti- or About the last possibility, research has found antiMOG antibodies in some pattern-II MS patients. Pattern II pathogenic T cells has been shown to be different from others The functional characterization shows that T cells releasing Th2 cytokines and helping B cells dominate the T-cell infiltrate in pattern II brain lesions. The scars are diffuse with inflammation, distal , activation and loss of (MAG). It is considered atypical and an overlap between MS and . The scars do not surround the blood vessels, and a rim of preserved myelin appears around the vessels. There is evidence of partial remyelinization and oligodendrocyte apoptosis. At first, some researchers thought it was an early stage of the evolution of the other patterns. Recently, it is thought that it represents ischaemia-like injury with absence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF, related to the pathogenesis of . The scar presents sharp borders and degeneration, with a rim of normal-appearing . There is a lack of oligodendrocytes in the center of the scar. There is no complement activation or MAG loss. These differences are noticeable only in early lesions and the heterogeneity was controversial for some time because some research groups thought that these four patterns could be a consequence of the age of the lesions. Nevertheless, after some debate among research groups, the four patterns model is accepted and the exceptional case found by Prineas has been classified as NMO For some investigation teams this means that MS is an immunopathogenetically heterogeneous disease. The latter hypothesis is further corroborated by a recent study that demonstrated significant differences in routine cerebrospinal fluid findings between patients with pattern I lesions and patients with non-pattern I lesions, including a lack of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands, in most pattern II and III patients. Finally, some previously diagnosed with pattern II MS were later found to have in fact MOG-IgG-related encephalomyelitis, suggesting that both the current clinicoradiological diagnostic criteria for MS and the histopathological criteria for MS may be insufficiently specific. This was already indicated by previous studies that found a relatively high rate of false diagnoses of MS among patients with AQP4-IgG-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders or MOG encephalomyelitis. Currently antibodies to and in sera, detected by , can be used as markers of the pathological subtype given by brain biopsy. Another development in this area is the finding that some lesions present defects that could distinguish types of lesions. In multiple sclerosis, inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration are observed together. Some clinical trials have shown that the inflammation produces both the relapses and the demyelination, and that neurodegeneration (axonal transection) is independent from inflammation, produces the accumulative disability, and advances even when inflammation and demyelination are delayed. It seems that neurodegeneration is produced by damaged , which in turn comes from activated . Currently it is unknown what the primary cause of MS is; if MS is a heterogeneous disease, the lesion development process would not be unique. In particular, some PPMS patients having a special clinical course named could have a special genetic cause and a different development process. Several types of damage appear in the brain: and characteristic . Changes in NAWM include axonal injury without demyelination, low-grade inflammation, and microglial and astrocytic activation Illustration of the four different types of glial cells found in the central nervous system: ependymal cells, astrocytes, microglial cells, and oligodendrocytes MS lesions develop inside NAWM areas. Their shape is influenced by their activity The most accepted sequence of events is first NAWM appearance, then the so-called pre-active lesions, with activated microglia, and finally the BBB breakdown, which enables the entry of T-cells to the CNS. This marks the beginning of an autoimmune attack which destroys myelin in active lesions. When the attack is resolved, a characteristic is formed by astrocytes. Current models can be divided into two categories: and . In the former, it is hypothesized that a problem in CNS cells produces an immune response that destroys myelin and subsequently breaks the BBB. In latter, an external factor produces BBB leaks, enters the CNS, and destroys myelin and axons. Whatever the underlying condition for MS is, it appears that damage is triggered by an unknown soluble factor in the CSF, potentially produced in meningeal areas; this factor can diffuse into the cortical parenchyma and destroy myelin either directly or indirectly through microglia activation. The evolution of a preactive lesion is related to reactivity. Increased expression of pro-inflammatory cell surface markers have been observed in NAWM and ""initial"" lesions, corresponding to a so-called loss of homeostatic microglial equilibrium. Some authors report active lesion formation before BBB breakdown; others point to as a factor of the breakdown. MS lesions are driven mainly by . It has been found recently that B-cells are also involved. The () is a protective barrier that denies the entrance of foreign material into the nervous system. BBB disruption is the moment in which penetration of the barrier by lymphocytes occur and has been considered one of the early problems in MS lesions. The BBB is composed of which line the walls of the central nervous system. Compared to normal endothelial cells, the cells lining the BBB are connected by and which form in order to create a barrier to keep out larger molecules such as proteins. In order to pass through, molecules must be taken in by or an alteration in the BBB permeability must occur, such as interactions with associated like ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3. The BBB is compromised due to active recruitment of lymphocytes and monocytes and their migration across the barrier. Release of allow for the activation of on the lymphocytes and monocytes, resulting in an interaction with the endothelial cells of the BBB which then activate the expression of to degrade the barrier. This results in disruption of the BBB, causing an increase in barrier permeability due to the degradation of tight junctions which maintain barrier integrity. Inducing the formation of tight junctions can restore BBB integrity and reduces its permeability, which can be used to reduce the damage caused by lymphocyte and monocyte migration across the barrier as restored integrity would restrict their movement. After barrier breakdown symptoms may appear, such as . Activation of and lymphocytes and their migration across the barrier may result in direct attacks on myelin sheaths within the central nervous system, leading to the characteristic demyelination event observed in MS. After demyelination has occurred, the degraded myelin sheath components, such as and , are then used as identifying factors to facilitate further immune activity upon myelin sheaths. Further activation of cytokines is also induced by macrophage and lymphocyte activity, promoting inflammatory activity as well continued activation of such as matrix metalloproteinases, which have detrimental effect on BBB integrity. Recently it has been found that BBB damage happens even in non-enhancing lesions. MS has an important vascular component. Postmortem studies of the BBB, especially the vascular endothelium, show immunological abnormalities. Microvessels in periplaque areas coexpressed HLA-DR and VCAM-1, some others HLA-DR and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, and others HLA-DR and ICAM-1. The damaged white matter is known as ""Normal-appearing white matter"" (NAWM) and is where lesions appear. These lesions form in NAWM before blood–brain barrier breakdown. BBB can be broken centripetally (the most normal) or centrifugally. Several possible biochemical disrupters were proposed. Some hypotheses about how the BBB is compromised revolve around the presence of compounds in the blood that could interact with vessels only in the NAWM areas. The permeability of two , and , may be involved in BBB breakdown. Breakdown is responsible for infiltration and inflammation in the brain. Monocyte migration and -mediated attachment to brain microvascular endothelia is regulated by through . Using iron nanoparticles, involvement of macrophages in BBB breakdown can be detected. A special role is played by . These increase BBB T-cell permeability, specially in the case of MMP-9 and are supposedly related to the mechanism of action of interferons. Whether BBB dysfunction is the cause or the consequence of MS is disputed, because activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins. Apart from that, activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins. (Adhesion molecules could also play a role in inflammation) In particular, one of these adhesion proteins involved is (Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule, also called ), and is under study as therapeutic target. Another protein involved is , which is found also in brain biopsies of inflammatory elements, and which could be related to the behavior of under therapy. Some molecular biochemical models for relapses have been proposed. Normally, gadolinium enhancement is used to show BBB disruption on MRIs. Abnormal tight junctions are present in both SPMS and PPMS. They appear in active white matter lesions and in gray matter in SPMS. They persist in inactive lesions, particularly in PPMS. A deficiency was implicated in this process. Uric acid added in physiological concentrations (i.e. achieving normal concentrations) is therapeutic in MS by preventing BBB breakdown through inactivation of . The low level of uric acid found in MS victims is manifestedly causative rather than a tissue damage consequence in the white matter lesions, but not in the grey matter lesions. Uric acid levels are lower during relapses. It is not known what causes MS. Several problems appear together with the white matter lesions, like cortical lesions and normal-appearing tissues. Several theories have been proposed to explain it. Some areas that appear normal under normal MRI look abnormal under special MRI, like magnetisation transfer MTR-MRI. These are called Normal Appearing White Matter (NAWM) and Normal Appearing Grey Matter (NAGM). The cause why the normal appearing areas appear in the brain is unknown, but seems clear that they appear mainly in the ventricles and that they predict the course of the disease. Given that MS lesions begin inside the NAWM areas, these areas are expected to be produced by the same underlying condition that produces the lesions, and therefore the ultimate MS underlying condition, whatever it is. Historically, several theories about how these areas appear have been presented: The search for an auto-antigen has taken a long time, but at least there is one reported. It is the enzyme This theory in part could also explain why some patients report amelioration under dietary treatment. (HERVs) have been reported in MS for several years. In fact, one of the families, was first discovered while studying MS patients. Recent research as of 2019 point to one of the HERV-W viruses (pHEV-W), and specifically one of the proteins of the that has been found to activate in vitro. Activated microglia in turn produces demyelination. Some interactions between the and the HERVs could be the trigger of the MS microglia reactions. Supporting this study, a against the viral capside () has shown good results in trials in phase IIb. Venous pathology has been associated with MS for more than a century. Pathologist noted in 1863 that the inflammation-associated lesions were distributed around veins. Some other authors like pointed to venous obstructions. Mechanical flow: Later the focus moved to softer hemodynamic abnormalities, which were showing precede changes in sub-cortical gray matter and in substantia nigra. However, such reports of a ""hemodynamic cause of MS"" are not universal, and possibly not even common. At this time the evidence is largely anecdotal and some MS patients have no blood flow issues. Possibly vascular problems may be an aggravating factor, like many others in MS. Indeed, the research, by demonstrating patients with no hemodynamic problems actually prove that this is not the only cause of MS. Endothelium: Other theories point to a possible primary endothelial dysfunction. The importance of vascular misbehaviour in MS pathogenesis has also been independently confirmed by seven-tesla . It is reported that a number of studies have provided evidence of vascular occlusion in MS, which suggest the possibility of a primary vascular injury in MS lesions or at least that they are occasionally correlated. Venous insufficiency: Some morphologically special medullar lesions (wedge-shaped) have also been linked to venous insufficiency. BBB infection: It has also been pointed out that some infectious agents with positive correlation to MS, specially , can cause problems in veins and arteries walls CCSVI: The term ""chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency"" was coined in 2008 by Paolo Zamboni, who described it in patients with multiple sclerosis. Instead of intracranial venous problems he described extracranial blockages, and he stated that the location of those obstructions seemed to influence the clinical course of the disease. According to Zamboni, CCSVI had a high differentiating healthy individuals from those with . Zamboni's results were criticized as some of his studies were not blinded and they need to be verified by further studies. As of 2010 the theory is considered at least defensible A more detailed evidence of a correlation between the place and type of venous malformations imaged and the reported symptoms of multiple sclerosis in the same patients was published in 2010. Haemodynamic problems have been found in the blood flow of MS patients using Doppler, initially using (TCCS), pointing to a relationship with a vascular disease called (CCSVI). In 2010 there were conflicting results when evaluating the relationship between MS and CCSVI. but is important to note that positives have appeared among the blinded studies. CSF flow: Other theories focus in the possible role of flow impairment. This theory could be partially consistent with the previous one. Currently a small trial with 8 participants has been performed Whatever the underlying primary condition is, it is expected to be a soluble factor in the CSF, maybe an unknown or , or a combination of them. Also B-cells and microglia could be involved. In particular, it is known that B-cells of MS patients secrete an unknown toxin against oligodendrocytes It has been reported several times that CSF of some MS patients can damage myelin in culture and mice and have been recently brought into the stage. Whatever the problem is, it produces of neurons respecting astrocytes In 2012 it was reported that a subset of MS patients have a seropositive anti- status, which can represent up to a 47% of the MS cases, and the study has been reproduced by at least two other groups. In 2016 a similar association was reported for anti--2 If the existence of any of these subsets of MS is confirmed, the situation would be similar to what happened for Devic Disease and . MS could be considered a or a new medical entity will be defined for these cases. Some authors propose a primary neurodegenerative factor. Maybe the strongest argument supporting this theory comes from the comparison with NMO. Though autoimmune demyelination is strong, axons are preserved, showing that the standard model of a primary demyelination cannot be hold. The theory of the trans-synaptic degeneration, is compatible with other models based in the CSF biochemistry. Others propose an oligodendrocyte stress as primary dysfunction, which activates microglia creating the NAWM areas and others propose a yet-unknown intrinsic CNS trigger induces the microglial activation and clustering, which they point out could be again axonal injury or oligodendrocyte stress. Finally, other authors point to a cortical pathology which starts in the brain external layer () and progresses extending into the brain inner layers If as expected MS is an heterogeneous disease and the lesion development process would not be unique. In particular, some PPMS patients have been found to have a special genetic variant named which would behave differently from what here is explained. It is due to a mutation inside the , an to mutation in the position p.Arg415Gln, in an area that codifies the . Several for diagnosis, disease evolution and response to medication (current or expected) are under research. While most of them are still under research, there are some of them already well stablished: : They present proteins that are in the CNS or in blood. Those that are in CNS but not in blood suggest a diagnosis of MS. A polyspecific antiviral immune response against the viruses of , and found in 1992. In some reports the MRZR showed a lower sensitivity than OCB (70% vs. 100%), but a higher specificity (69% vs. 92%) for MS. (FLC). Several authors have reported that they are comparable or even better than oligoclonal bands. Golan, Daniel; Staun-Ram, Elsebeth; Miller, Ariel (2016). ""Shifting paradigms in multiple sclerosis"". .

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development A complete neurological exam and medical history are needed to diagnose . There are no specific tests for . Instead, a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis often relies on ruling out other conditions that might produce similar signs and symptoms, known as a differential diagnosis. Your doctor is likely to start with a thorough medical history and examination. During a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) procedure, you typically lie on your side with your knees drawn up to your chest. Then a needle is inserted into your spinal canal — in your lower back — to collect cerebrospinal fluid for testing. Brain MRI scan showing white lesions associated with multiple sclerosis. to help rule out other diseases with symptoms similar to . Tests to check for specific biomarkers associated with are currently under development and may also aid in diagnosing the disease. in which a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid is removed from your spinal canal for laboratory analysis. This sample can show abnormalities in antibodies that are associated with . A spinal tap can also help rule out infections and other conditions with symptoms similar to . which can reveal areas of (lesions) on your brain and spinal cord. You may receive an intravenous injection of a contrast material to highlight lesions that indicate your disease is in an active phase. which record the electrical signals produced by your nervous system in response to stimuli. An evoked potential test may use visual stimuli or electrical stimuli. In these tests, you watch a moving visual pattern, or short electrical impulses are applied to nerves in your legs or arms. Electrodes measure how quickly the information travels down your nerve pathways. In most people with relapsing-remitting , the diagnosis is fairly straightforward and based on a pattern of symptoms consistent with the disease and confirmed by brain imaging scans, such as MRI. Diagnosing can be more difficult in people with unusual symptoms or progressive disease. In these cases, further testing with spinal fluid analysis, evoked potentials and additional imaging may be needed. Brain MRI is often used to help diagnose multiple sclerosis. Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your multiple sclerosis-related health concerns There is no cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatment typically focuses on speeding recovery from attacks, slowing the progression of the disease and managing symptoms. Some people have such mild symptoms that no treatment is necessary. Multiple sclerosis research laboratory at Mayo Clinic such as oral prednisone and intravenous methylprednisolone, are prescribed to reduce nerve inflammation. Side effects may include insomnia, increased blood pressure, increased blood glucose levels, mood swings and fluid retention. The liquid portion of part of your blood (plasma) is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then mixed with a protein solution (albumin) and put back into your body. Plasma exchange may be used if your symptoms are new, severe and haven't responded to steroids. For primary-progressive , ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is the only FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Those who receive this treatment are slightly less likely to progress than those who are untreated. For relapsing-remitting , several disease-modifying therapies are available. Much of the immune response associated with occurs in the early stages of the disease. Aggressive treatment with these medications as early as possible can lower the relapse rate, slow the formation of new lesions, and potentially reduce risk of brain atrophy and disability accumulation. Many of the disease-modifying therapies used to treat carry significant health risks. Selecting the right therapy for you will depend on careful consideration of many factors, including duration and severity of disease, effectiveness of previous treatments, other health issues, cost, and child-bearing status. Treatment options for relapsing-remitting include injectable and oral medications. These drugs are among the most commonly prescribed medications to treat . They are injected under the skin or into muscle and can reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Side effects of interferons may include flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions. You'll need blood tests to monitor your liver enzymes because liver damage is a possible side effect of interferon use. People taking interferons may develop neutralizing antibodies that can reduce drug effectiveness. This medication may help block your immune system's attack on myelin and must be injected beneath the skin. Side effects may include skin irritation at the injection site. This once-daily oral medication reduces relapse rate. You'll need to have your heart rate and blood pressure monitored for six hours after the first dose because your heartbeat may be slowed. Other side effects include rare serious infections, headaches, high blood pressure and blurred vision. This twice-daily oral medication can reduce relapses. Side effects may include flushing, diarrhea, nausea and lowered white blood cell count. This drug requires blood test monitoring on a regular basis. This twice-daily capsule is similar to dimethyl fumarate but typically causes fewer side effects. It's approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of . This once-daily oral medication can reduce relapse rate. Teriflunomide can cause liver damage, hair loss and other side effects. This drug is associated with birth defects when taken by both men and women. Therefore, use contraception when taking this medication and for up to two years afterward. Couples who wish to become pregnant should talk to their doctor about ways to speed elimination of the drug from the body. This drug requires blood test monitoring in a regular basis. Research shows that this once-daily oral medication can reduce relapse rate and help slow progression of . It's also approved for secondary-progressive . Possible side effects include viral infections, liver problems and low white blood cell count. Other possible side effects include changes in heart rate, headaches and vision problems. Siponimod is harmful to a developing fetus, so women who may become pregnant should use contraception when taking this medication and for 10 days after stopping the medication. Some might need to have the heart rate and blood pressure monitored for six hours after the first dose. This drug requires blood test monitoring on a regular basis This medication is generally prescribed as second line treatment for those with relapsing-remitting . It was also approved for secondary-progressive . It is given in two treatment courses, spread over a two-week period, over the course of two years. Side effects include upper respiratory infections, headaches, tumors, serious infections and reduced levels of white blood cells. People who have active chronic infections or cancer should not take this drug, nor should women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Men and women should use contraception when taking this medication and for the following six months. You may need monitoring with blood tests while taking cladribine. This humanized monoclonal antibody medication is the only approved by the FDA to treat both the relapse-remitting and primary-progressive forms of . Clinical trials showed that it reduced relapse rate in relapsing disease and slowed worsening of disability in both forms of the disease. Ocrelizumab is given via an intravenous infusion by a medical professional. Infusion-related side effects may include irritation at the injection site, low blood pressure, a fever and nausea, among others. Some people may not be able to take ocrelizumab, including those with a hepatitis B infection. Ocrelizumab may also increase the risk of infections and some types of cancer, particularly breast cancer. This medication is designed to block the movement of potentially damaging immune cells from your bloodstream to your brain and spinal cord. It may be considered a first line treatment for some people with severe or as a second line treatment in others. This medication increases the risk of a potentially serious viral infection of the brain called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in people who are positive for antibodies to the causative agent of JC virus. People who don't have the antibodies have extremely low risk of . This drug helps reduce relapses of by targeting a protein on the surface of immune cells and depleting white blood cells. This effect can limit potential nerve damage caused by the white blood cells. But it also increases the risk of infections and autoimmune disorders, including a high risk of thyroid autoimmune diseases and rare immune mediated kidney disease. Treatment with alemtuzumab involves five consecutive days of drug infusions followed by another three days of infusions a year later. Infusion reactions are common with alemtuzumab. The drug is only available from registered providers, and people treated with the drug must be registered in a special drug safety monitoring program. Alemtuzumab is usually recommended for those with aggressive or as second line treatment for patients who failed another medication. Physical therapy can build muscle strength and ease some of the symptoms of . A physical or occupational therapist can teach you stretching and strengthening exercises and show you how to use devices to make it easier to perform daily tasks. Physical therapy along with the use of a mobility aid when necessary can also help manage leg weakness and other gait problems often associated with . You may experience painful or uncontrollable muscle stiffness or spasms, particularly in your legs. Muscle relaxants such as baclofen (Lioresal, Gablofen), tizanidine (Zanaflex) and cyclobenzaprine may help. Onabotulinumtoxin A treatment is another option in those with spasticity. Amantadine (Gocovri, Osmolex), modafinil (Provigil) and methylphenidate (Ritalin) may be helpful in reducing -related fatigue. Some drugs used to treat depression, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may be recommended. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) may help to slightly increase walking speed in some people. People with a history of seizures or kidney dysfunction should not take this medication. Medications also may be prescribed for depression, pain, sexual dysfunction, insomnia, and bladder or bowel control problems that are associated with . Estriol as a potential treatment option for multiple sclerosis (MS) Long-term safety of natalizumab for treating multiple sclerosis testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease. To help relieve the signs and symptoms of , try to: Look at your sleep habits to make sure you're getting the best possible sleep. To make sure you're getting enough sleep, you may need to be evaluated — and possibly treated — for sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea. If you have mild to moderate , regular exercise can help improve your strength, muscle tone, balance and coordination. Swimming or other water exercises are good options if you're bothered by heat. Other types of mild to moderate exercise recommended for people with include walking, stretching, low-impact aerobics, stationary bicycling, yoga and tai chi. symptoms often worsen when the body temperature rises in some people with . Avoiding exposure to heat and using devices such as cooling scarves or vests can be helpful. Since there's little evidence to support a particular diet, experts recommend a generally healthy diet. Some research suggests that vitamin D may have potential benefit for people with . Stress may trigger or worsen your signs and symptoms. Yoga, tai chi, massage, meditation or deep breathing may help. Mindfulness practice: Can it reduce symptoms of MS? Vitamins for MS: Do supplements make a difference? Many people with use a variety of alternative or complementary treatments or both to help manage their symptoms, such as fatigue and muscle pain. Activities such as exercise, meditation, yoga, massage, eating a healthier diet, acupuncture and relaxation techniques may help boost overall mental and physical well-being, but there are few studies to back up their use in managing symptoms of . According to guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology, research strongly indicates that oral cannabis extract (OCE) may improve symptoms of muscle spasticity and pain. There is a lack of evidence that cannabis in any other form is effective in managing other symptoms. Daily intake of vitamin D3 of 2,000-5,000 international units daily is recommended in those with .

That experience motivated me to want to care for people, and lead me to the field of neuroimmunology. I have since discovered a drug for multiple sclerosis, which is FDA approved. I would like to solve other diseases and make them past history, like polio, something we no longer fear. We have three other new drugs in clinical trials for diseases ranging from type 1 diabetes to progressive multiple sclerosis. Especialidades médicas y/o especialidades quirúrgicas Stanford University Dept of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 06/30/1974 Stanford University Neurology Residency, Palo Alto, CA, 06/30/1980 Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, 06/30/1976 Neurology, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology Biological Significance of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies: Lessons Learned From Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy. OBJECTIVE: To discuss the pathogenic and diagnostic relevance of cellular and humoral immune responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) and pertinent observations made in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).METHODS: Review of pertinent literature. RESULTS: There is at least 1 precedent for an antibody response against a viral pathogen that fails to provide host protection in the absence of immune-competent CD4+ T cells. PML is an infection of the CNS caused by JC virus (JCV), which commonly occurs during treatment with the therapeutic monoclonal antibody natalizumab. In this context, the humoral immune response fails to prevent JCV reactivation, and elevated anti-JCV serum indices are associated with a higher PML incidence. The more relevant immune-competent cells in host defense against JCV appear to be T cells. T cell-mediated responses are also detectable in convalescing patients with SARS-COV-2 irrespective of the humoral immune response.CONCLUSION: Based on pathogenic lessons learned from PML under natalizumab therapy, we suggest the incorporation of functional assays that determine neutralizing properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. In addition, we outline the potential role of T-cell detection assays in determining herd immunity in a given population or in studying therapeutic responses to vaccines. Reduced development of COVID-19 in children reveals molecular checkpoints gating pathogenesis illuminating potential therapeutics. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Steinman, J. B., Lum, F. M., Ho, P. P., Kaminski, N., Steinman, L. The reduced development of COVID-19 for children compared to adults provides some tantalizing clues on the pathogenesis and transmissibility of this pandemic virus. First, ACE2, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor, is reduced in the respiratory tract in children. Second, coronavirus associated with common colds in children may offer some protection, due to cross-reactive humoral immunity and T cell immunity between common coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2. Third, T helper 2 immune responses are protective in children. Fourth, surprisingly, eosinophilia, associated with T helper 2, may be protective. Fifth, children generally produce lower levels of inflammatory cytokines. Finally, the influence of the downturn in the global economy, the impact of living in quarters among families who are the most at risk, and factors including the openings of some schools, are considered. Those most disadvantaged socioeconomically may suffer disproportionately with COVID-19. A sugar-coated strategy to treat a rare neurologic disease provides a blueprint for a decoy glycan therapeutic and a potential vaccine for CoViD-19: An Editorial Highlight for ""Selective inhibition of anti-MAG IgM autoantibody binding to myelin by an antigen specific glycopolymer""on https://doi.org/10.1111/jnc.15021. In a rare neurologic disease known as IgM monoclonal gammopathy the immune system targets a sulfated trisaccharide known as the Human Natural Killer-1 (HNK-1) epitope that comprises a constituent of the myelin sheath known as MAG (myelin-associated glycoprotein). This Editorial highlights a study by Aliu and colleagues in the current issue of the Journal of Neurochemistry, in which the investigators constructed a biodegradable poly-l-lysine backbone withmultiple copies of this sulfated HNK-1trisaccharide.This decoy, poly(phenyl disodium 3-O-sulfo--d-glucopyranuronate)-(13)--d-galactopyranoside, known as PPSGG, removedanti-MAG IgM autoantibodies from the blood, while not activating the immune system. These findings provide a path for the selective removal of a pathogenic set of antibodies that target the myelin sheath resulting in neuropathy. These findings are applicable to a parallel strategy for the generation of polysaccharides similar to those present in the receptor-binding domain of CoViD-19, which might inhibit viral adhesion to its receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein, thereby impairing cellular uptake of the virus itself. The deployment of complex polysaccharides that mimic actual COVID19 polysaccharides on the spike protein may also provide a feasible structural basis for a vaccine. Carbohydrate mimics, if conjugated to a carrier or backbone, might provoke an immune response to the spike protein. A vaccine that targets critical carbohydrates on COVID19, and then neutralizes the virus would recapitulate a successful strategy employed in other microbial vaccines, like the pneumococcal vaccines and the meningococcal vaccines. These vaccines direct an immune response to complex carbohydrates and successfully prevent life-threatening disease. This paper provides lessons from a rare neurologic disease that may teach us strategies applicable to a global pandemic. Autoantibodies against central nervous system antigens in a subset of B cell-dominant multiple sclerosis patients. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Kuerten, S., Lanz, T. V., Lingampalli, N., Lahey, L. J., Kleinschnitz, C., Murer, M., Schroeter, M., Braune, S., Ziemssen, T., Ho, P. P., Robinson, W. H., Steinman, L. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), with characteristic inflammatory lesions and demyelination. The clinical benefit of cell-depleting therapies targeting CD20 has emphasized the role of B cells and autoantibodies in MS pathogenesis. We previously introduced an enzyme-linked immunospot spot (ELISpot)-based assay to measure CNS antigen-specific B cells in the blood of MS patients and demonstrated its usefulness as a predictive biomarker for disease activity in measuring the successful outcome of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Here we used a planar protein array to investigate CNS-reactive antibodies in the serum of MS patients as well as in B cell culture supernatants after polyclonal stimulation. Anti-CNS antibody reactivity was evident in the sera of the MS cohort, and the antibodies bound a heterogeneous set of molecules, including myelin, axonal cytoskeleton, and ion channel antigens, in individual patients. Immunoglobulin reactivity in supernatants of stimulated B cells was directed against a broad range of CNS antigens. A group of MS patients with a highly active B cell component was identified by the ELISpot assay. Those antibody reactivities remained stable over time. These assays with protein arrays identify MS patients with a highly active B cell population with antibodies directed against a swathe of CNS proteins. Epstein-Barr Virus in Multiple Sclerosis: Theory and Emerging Immunotherapies. Bar-Or, A., Pender, M. P., Khanna, R., Steinman, L., Hartung, H., Maniar, T., Croze, E., Aftab, B. T., Giovannoni, G., Joshi, M. J. New treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) focused on B cells have created an atmosphere of excitement in the MS community. B cells are now known to play a major role in disease, demonstrated by the highly impactful effect of a B cell-depleting antibody on controlling MS. The idea that a virus may play a role in the development of MS has a long history and is supported mostly by studies demonstrating a link between B cell-tropic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and disease onset. Efforts to develop antiviral strategies for treating MS are underway. Although gaps remain in our understanding of the etiology of MS, the role, if any, of viruses in propagating pathogenic immune responses deserves attention. Antigen-specific tolerance to self-antigens in protein replacement therapy, gene therapy and autoimmunity. Steinman, L., Ho, P. P., Robinson, W. H., Utz, P. J., Villoslada, P. Trials of antigen-specific tolerance have been undertaken in the clinic for over fifty years and the results of these antigen-specific clinical trials are described in this review. Antigen-specific tolerization of the immune system in protein replacement therapy for hemophilia A is an accepted treatment. Clinical trials are ongoing for autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and rheumatoid arthritis with various antigen-specific strategies. Trials for tolerization in celiac disease aim for antigen specific tolerance to gluten, an environmental trigger, which may then halt the progression to autoimmunity targeting a self-antigen, tissue transglutaminase. Although many promising approaches have been demonstrated in pre-clinical models, this review will focus primarily on clinical trials of antigen-specific tolerance that have been taken to the clinic and with initial results reported in the peer reviewed literature. A separate article on approaches with CAR-T cells appears in this volume. Small Heat Shock Proteins, Amyloid Fibrils, and Nicotine Stimulate a Common Immune Suppressive Pathway with Implications for Future Therapies Rothbard, J. B., Kurnellas, M. P., Ousman, S.

View details for Immune tolerance in multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica with peptide-loaded tolerogenic dendritic cells in a phase 1b trial. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Zubizarreta, I., Florez-Grau, G., Vila, G., Cabezon, R., Espana, C., Andorra, M., Saiz, A., Llufriu, S., Sepulveda, M., Sola-Valls, N., Martinez-Lapiscina, E. H., Pulido-Valdeolivas, I., Casanova, B., Martinez Gines, M., Tellez, N., Oreja-Guevara, C., Espanol, M., Trias, E., Cid, J., Juan, M., Lozano, M., Blanco, Y., Steinman, L., Benitez-Ribas, D., Villoslada, P. There are adaptive T-cell and antibody autoimmune responses to myelin-derived peptides in multiple sclerosis (MS) and to aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSDs). Strategies aimed at antigen-specific tolerance to these autoantigens are thus indicated for these diseases. One approach involves induction of tolerance with engineered dendritic cells (tolDCs) loaded with specific antigens. We conducted an in-human phase 1b clinical trial testing increasing concentrations of autologous tolDCs loaded with peptides from various myelin proteins and from AQP4. We tested this approach in 12 patients, 8 with MS and 4 with NMOSD. The primary end point was the safety and tolerability, while secondary end points were clinical outcomes (relapses and disability), imaging (MRI and optical coherence tomography), and immunological responses. Therapy with tolDCs was well tolerated, without serious adverse events and with no therapy-related reactions. Patients remained stable clinically in terms of relapse, disability, and in various measurements using imaging. We observed a significant increase in the production of IL-10 levels in PBMCs stimulated with the peptides as well as an increase in the frequency of a regulatory T cell, known as Tr1, by week 12 of follow-up. In this phase 1b trial, we concluded that the i.v. administration of peptide-loaded dendritic cells is safe and feasible. Elicitation of specific IL-10 production by peptide-specific T cells in MS and NMOSD patients indicates that a key element in antigen specific tolerance is activated with this approach. The results warrant further clinical testing in larger trials. Small Heat Shock Proteins, Amyloid Fibrils, and Nicotine Stimulate a Common Immune Suppressive Pathway with Implications for Future Therapies. Rothbard, J. B., Kurnellas, M. P., Ousman, S. S., Brownell, S., Rothbard, J. J., Steinman, L. The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) is central to the anti-inflammatory function of the vagus nerve in a physiological mechanism termed the inflammatory reflex. Studies on the inflammatory reflex have been instrumental for the current development of the field of bioelectronic medicine. An independent investigation of the biological role of alphaB-crystallin (HspB5), the most abundant gene transcript present in active multiple sclerosis lesions in human brains, also led to alpha7nAChR. Induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in HspB5-/- mice results in greater paralytic signs, increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and T-lymphocyte activation relative to wild-type animals. Administration of HspB5 was therapeutic in animal models of multiple sclerosis, retinal and cardiac ischemia, and stroke. Structure-activity studies established that residues 73-92 were as potent as the parent protein, but only when it formed amyloid fibrils. Amyloid fibrils and small heat shock proteins (sHsps) selectively bound alpha7nAChR on peritoneal macrophages (MPhis) and B lymphocytes, converting the MPhis to an immune suppressive phenotype and mobilizing the migration of both cell types from the peritoneum to secondary lymph organs. Here, we review multiple aspects of this work, which may be of interest for developing future therapeutic approaches for multiple sclerosis and other disorders. Engineered DNA plasmid reduces immunity to dystrophin while improving muscle force in a model of gene therapy of Duchenne dystrophy. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Ho, P. P., Lahey, L. J., Mourkioti, F., Kraft, P. E., Filareto, A., Brandt, M., Magnusson, K. E., Finn, E. E., Chamberlain, J. S., Robinson, W. H., Blau, H. M., Steinman, L. In gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy there are two potential immunological obstacles. An individual with Duchenne muscular dystrophy has a genetic mutation in dystrophin, and therefore the wild-type protein is ""foreign,"" and thus potentially immunogenic. The adeno-associated virus serotype-6 (AAV6) vector for delivery of dystrophin is a viral-derived vector with its own inherent immunogenicity. We have developed a technology where an engineered plasmid DNA is delivered to reduce autoimmunity. We have taken this approach into humans, tolerizing to myelin proteins in multiple sclerosis and to proinsulin in type 1 diabetes. Here, we extend this technology to a model of gene therapy to reduce the immunogenicity of the AAV vector and of the wild-type protein product that is missing in the genetic disease. Following gene therapy with systemic administration of recombinant AAV6-microdystrophin to mdx/mTRG2 mice, we demonstrated the development of antibodies targeting dystrophin and AAV6 capsid in control mice. Treatment with the engineered DNA construct encoding microdystrophin markedly reduced antibody responses to dystrophin and to AAV6. Muscle force in the treated mice was also improved compared with control mice. These data highlight the potential benefits of administration of an engineered DNA plasmid encoding the delivered protein to overcome critical barriers in gene therapy to achieve optimal functional gene expression. An amyloidogenic hexapeptide derived from amylin attenuates inflammation and acute lung injury in murine sepsis Mahapatra, S., Ying, L., Ho, P., Kurnellas, M., Rothbard, J., Steinman, L., Cornfield, D. N. Although the accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins in neuroinflammatory conditions is generally considered pathologic, in a murine model of multiple sclerosis, amyloid-forming fibrils, comprised of hexapeptides, are anti-inflammatory. Whether these molecules modulate systemic inflammatory conditions remains unknown. We hypothesized that an amylin hexapeptide that forms fibrils can attenuate the systemic inflammatory response in a murine model of sepsis. To test this hypothesis, mice were pre-treated with either vehicle or amylin hexapeptide (20 g) at 12 hours and 6 hours prior to intraperitoneal (i.p.) lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 20 mg/kg) administration. Illness severity and survival were monitored every 6 hours for 3 days. Levels of pro- (IL-6, TNF-, IFN-) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines were measured via ELISA at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after LPS (i.p.). As a metric of lung injury, pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) barrier function was tested 24 hours after LPS administration by comparing lung wet-to-dry ratios, Evan's blue dye (EBD) extravasation, lung histology and caspase-3 activity. Compared to controls, pretreatment with amylin hexapeptide significantly reduced mortality (p<0.05 at 72 h), illness severity (p<0.05), and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, while IL-10 levels were elevated (p<0.05). Amylin pretreatment attenuated LPS-induced lung injury, as demonstrated by decreased lung water and caspase-3 activity (p<0.05, versus PBS). Hence, in a murine model of systemic inflammation, pretreatment with amylin hexapeptide reduced mortality, disease severity, and preserved lung barrier function. Amylin hexapeptide may represent a novel therapeutic tool to mitigate sepsis severity and lung injury. Molecular signature of Epstein-Barr virus infection in MS brain lesions. Moreno, M. A., Or-Geva, N., Aftab, B. T., Khanna, R., Croze, E., Steinman, L., Han, M. H. Objective: We sought to confirm the presence and frequency of B cells and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (latent and lytic phase) antigens in archived MS and non-MS brain tissue by immunohistochemistry.Methods: We quantified the type and location of B-cell subsets within active and chronic MS brain lesions in relation to viral antigen expression. The presence of EBV-infected cells was further confirmed by in situ hybridization to detect the EBV RNA transcript, EBV-encoded RNA-1 (EBER-1).Results: We report the presence of EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) in 93% of MS and 78% of control brains, with a greater percentage of MS brains containing CD138+ plasma cells and LMP-1-rich populations. Notably, 78% of chronic MS lesions and 33.3% of non-MS brains contained parenchymal CD138+ plasma cells. EBV early lytic protein, EBV immediate-early lytic gene (BZLF1), was also observed in 46% of MS, primarily in association with chronic lesions and 44% of non-MS brain tissue. Furthermore, 85% of MS brains revealed frequent EBER-positive cells, whereas non-MS brains seldom contained EBER-positive cells. EBV infection was detectable, by immunohistochemistry and by in situ hybridization, in both MS and non-MS brains, although latent virus was more prevalent in MS brains, while lytic virus was restricted to chronic MS lesions.Conclusions: Together, our observations suggest an uncharacterized link between the EBV virus life cycle and MS pathogenesis. Identification of a common immune regulatory pathway induced by small heat shock proteins, amyloid fibrils, and nicotine. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Rothbard, J. B., Rothbard, J. J., Soares, L., Fathman, C. G., Steinman, L. Although certain dogma portrays amyloid fibrils as drivers of neurodegenerative disease and neuroinflammation, we have found, paradoxically, that amyloid fibrils and small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). They reduce clinical paralysis and induce immunosuppressive pathways, diminishing inflammation. A key question was the identification of the target for these molecules. When sHsps and amyloid fibrils were chemically cross-linked to immune cells, a limited number of proteins were precipitated, including the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 NAChR). The alpha7 NAChR is noteworthy among the over 20 known receptors for amyloid fibrils, because it plays a central role in a well-defined immune-suppressive pathway. Competitive binding between amyloid fibrils and alpha-bungarotoxin to peritoneal macrophages (MPhis) confirmed the involvement of alpha7 NAChR. The mechanism of immune suppression was explored, and, similar to nicotine, amyloid fibrils inhibited LPS induction of a common set of inflammatory cytokines while inducing Stat3 signaling and autophagy. Consistent with this, previous studies have established that nicotine, sHsps, and amyloid fibrils all were effective therapeutics in EAE. Interestingly, B lymphocytes were needed for the therapeutic effect. These results suggest that agonists of alpha7 NAChR might have therapeutic benefit for a variety of inflammatory diseases. Blocking immune intrusion into the brain suppresses epilepsy in Rasmussen's encephalitis model Rasmussen's encephalitis (RE) is a neuroinflammatory disease that typically affects only one hemisphere of the brain, resulting in severe seizures. Sixty years after the disease was first described, the preferred and best treatment option for RE is grotesque and involves removing a hemisphere of the brain (hemispherectomy); therefore, a better understanding of this seizure disorder may provide additional, less invasive therapeutic options. In this issue of the JCI, Carmant and colleagues have developed an animal model of this focal seizure disorder. The model provides experimental insights into the pathogenesis of RE and potential new treatments for this disease. View details for Single-cell mass cytometry reveals distinct populations of brain myeloid cells in mouse neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration models. Ajami, B., Samusik, N., Wieghofer, P., Ho, P. P., Crotti, A., Bjornson, Z., Prinz, M., Fantl, W. J., Nolan, G. P., Steinman, L. Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration may represent two poles of brain pathology. Brain myeloid cells, particularly microglia, play key roles in these conditions. We employed single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to compare myeloid cell populations in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis, the R6/2 model of Huntington's disease (HD) and the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (mSOD1) model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We identified three myeloid cell populations exclusive to the CNS and present in each disease model. Blood-derived monocytes comprised five populations and migrated to the brain in EAE, but not in HD and ALS models. Single-cell analysis resolved differences in signaling and cytokine production within similar myeloid populations in EAE compared to HD and ALS models. Moreover, these analyses highlighted alpha5 integrin on myeloid cells as a potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammation. Together, these findings illustrate how neuropathology may differ between inflammatory and degenerative brain disease. Narcolepsy and influenza vaccination-induced autoimmunity A Journey in Science: The Privilege of Exploring the Brain and the Immune System. Real innovations in medicine and science are historic and singular; the stories behind each occurrence are precious. At Molecular Medicine we have established the Anthony Cerami Award in Translational Medicine to document and preserve these histories. The monographs recount the seminal events as told in the voice of the original investigators who provided the crucial early insight. These essays capture the essence of discovery, chronicling the birth of ideas that created new fields of research; and launched trajectories that persisted and ultimately influenced how disease is prevented, diagnosed, and treated. In this volume, the Cerami Award Monograph is by Lawrence Steinman, MD, of Stanford University in California. A visionary in the field of neurology, this is the story of Dr. Steinman's scientific journey. View details for Obeticholic acid, a synthetic bile acid agonist of the farnesoid X receptor, attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Bile acids are ligands for the nuclear hormone receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR). The bile acid-FXR interaction regulates bile acid synthesis, transport, and cholesterol metabolism. Recently, bile acid-FXR regulation has been reported to play an integral role in both hepatic and intestinal inflammation, and in atherosclerosis. In this study, we found that FXR knockout mice had more disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Obeticholic acid (6-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid, 6-ECDCA), a synthetic FXR agonist, is an orally available drug that is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. When we treated mice exhibiting established EAE with 6-ECDCA, or the natural FXR ligand chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), clinical disease was ameliorated by (i) suppressing lymphocyte activation and proinflammatory cytokine production; (ii) reducing CD4(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cell populations and their expression of negative checkpoint regulators programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA); (iii) increasing CD8(+) T cells and PD1, PDl-1, and BTLA expression; and (iv) reducing VLA-4 expression in both the T- and B-cell populations. Moreover, adoptive transfer of 6-ECDCA- or CDCA-treated donor cells failed to transfer disease in naive recipients. Thus, we show that FXR functions as a negative regulator in neuroinflammation and we highlight that FXR agonists represent a potential previously unidentified therapy for MS. View details for Amyloid fibrils activate B-1a lymphocytes to ameliorate inflammatory brain disease PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Kurnellas, M. P., Ghosn, E. E., Schartner, J. M., Baker, J., Rothbard, J. J., Negrin, R. S., Herzenberg, L. A., Fathman, C. G., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. Amyloid fibrils composed of peptides as short as six amino acids are therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), reducing paralysis and inflammation, while inducing several pathways of immune suppression. Intraperitoneal injection of fibrils selectively activates B-1a lymphocytes and two populations of resident macrophages (Ms), increasing IL-10 production, and triggering their exodus from the peritoneum. The importance of IL-10-producing B-1a cells in this effective therapy was established in loss-of-function experiments where neither B-cell-deficient (MT) nor IL10(-/-) mice with EAE responded to the fibrils. In gain-of-function experiments, B-1a cells, adoptively transferred to MT mice with EAE, restored their therapeutic efficacy when Amylin 28-33 was administered. Stimulation of adoptively transferred bioluminescent Ms and B-1a cells by amyloid fibrils resulted in rapid (within 60 min of injection) trafficking of both cell types to draining lymph nodes. Analysis of gene expression indicated that the fibrils activated the CD40/B-cell receptor pathway in B-1a cells and induced a set of immune-suppressive cell-surface proteins, including BTLA, IRF4, and Siglec G. Collectively, these data indicate that the fibrils activate B-1a cells and F4/80(+) Ms, resulting in their migration to the lymph nodes, where IL-10 and cell-surface receptors associated with immune-suppression limit antigen presentation and T-cell activation. These mechanisms culminate in reduction of paralytic signs of EAE. Antibodies to influenza nucleoprotein cross-react with human hypocretin receptor 2 Ahmed, S. S., Volkmuth, W., Duca, J., Corti, L., Pallaoro, M., Pezzicoli, A., Karle, A., Rigat, F., Rappuoli, R., Narasimhan, V., Julkunen, I., Vuorela, A., Vaarala, O., Nohynek, H., Pasini, F. L., Montomoli, E., Trombetta, C., Adams, C. M., Rothbard, J., Steinman, L. The sleep disorder narcolepsy is linked to the HLA-DQB1*0602 haplotype and dysregulation of the hypocretin ligand-hypocretin receptor pathway. Narcolepsy was associated with Pandemrix vaccination (an adjuvanted, influenza pandemic vaccine) and also with infection by influenza virus during the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza pandemic. In contrast, very few cases were reported after Focetria vaccination (a differently manufactured adjuvanted influenza pandemic vaccine). We hypothesized that differences between these vaccines (which are derived from inactivated influenza viral proteins) explain the association of narcolepsy with Pandemrix-vaccinated subjects. A mimic peptide was identified from a surface-exposed region of influenza nucleoprotein A that shared protein residues in common with a fragment of the first extracellular domain of hypocretin receptor 2. A significant proportion of sera from HLA-DQB1*0602 haplotype-positive narcoleptic Finnish patients with a history of Pandemrix vaccination (vaccine-associated narcolepsy) contained antibodies to hypocretin receptor 2 compared to sera from nonnarcoleptic individuals with either 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic influenza infection or history of Focetria vaccination. Antibodies from vaccine-associated narcolepsy sera cross-reacted with both influenza nucleoprotein and hypocretin receptor 2, which was demonstrated by competitive binding using 21-mer peptide (containing the identified nucleoprotein mimic) and 55-mer recombinant peptide (first extracellular domain of hypocretin receptor 2) on cell lines expressing human hypocretin receptor 2. Mass spectrometry indicated that relative to Pandemrix, Focetria contained 72.7% less influenza nucleoprotein. In accord, no durable antibody responses to nucleoprotein were detected in sera from Focetria-vaccinated nonnarcoleptic subjects. Thus, differences in vaccine nucleoprotein content and respective immune response may explain the narcolepsy association with Pandemrix. View details for No quiet surrender: molecular guardians in multiple sclerosis brain The brain under immunological attack does not surrender quietly. Investigation of brain lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) reveals a coordinated molecular response involving various proteins and small molecules ranging from heat shock proteins to small lipids, neurotransmitters, and even gases, which provide protection and foster repair. Reduction of inflammation serves as a necessary prerequisite for effective recovery and regeneration. Remarkably, many lesion-resident molecules activate pathways leading to both suppression of inflammation and promotion of repair mechanisms. These guardian molecules and their corresponding physiologic pathways could potentially be exploited to silence inflammation and repair the injured and degenerating brain and spinal cord in both relapsing-remitting and progressive forms of MS and may be beneficial in other neurologic and psychiatric conditions. View details for Mechanisms of action of therapeutic amyloidogenic hexapeptides in amelioration of inflammatory brain disease. Kurnellas, M. P., Schartner, J. M., Fathman, C. G., Jagger, A., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. Amyloid fibrils composed of peptides as short as six amino acids are effective therapeutics for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Immunosuppression arises from at least two pathways: (1) expression of type 1 IFN by pDCs, which were induced by neutrophil extracellular traps arising from the endocytosis of the fibrils; and (2) the reduced expression of IFN-, TNF, and IL-6. The two independent pathways stimulated by the fibrils can act in concert to be immunosuppressive in Th1 indications, or in opposition, resulting in inflammation when Th17 T lymphocytes are predominant. The generation of type 1 IFN can be minimized by using polar, nonionizable, amyloidogenic peptides, which are effective in both Th1 and Th17 polarized EAE. Immunology of Relapse and Remission in Multiple Sclerosis Eighty percent of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) initially develop a clinical pattern with periodic relapses followed by remissions, called relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). This period of fluctuating disease may last for a decade or more. Clinical relapses reflect acute inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), composed of the brain and spinal cord. Often, different anatomic areas in the CNS are involved each time a relapse occurs, resulting in varied clinical manifestations in each instance. Relapses are nearly always followed by some degree of remission, though recovery to baseline status before the flare is often incomplete. There are nine approved drugs for treatment of RRMS. The most potent drug for inhibiting relapses, the humanized anti-4 integrin antibody known as Natalizumab, blocks homing of mononuclear cells to the CNS. The mechanisms of action of the approved drugs for RRMS provide a strong foundation for understanding the pathobiology of the relapse. Despite substantial progress in controlling relapses with the current armamentarium of medications, there is much to learn and ever more effective and safe therapies to develop.

S., Wu, L., Acharya, S., Arac, A., Blaho, V. A., Huang, Y., Moon, B. S., Axtell, R. C., Ho, P. P., Steinberg, G. K., Lewis, D. B., Sobel, R. A., Han, D. K., Steinman, L., Snyder, M. P., Hla, T., Han, M. H. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling regulates lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs into systemic circulation. The sphingosine phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) agonist FTY-720 (Gilenya) arrests immune trafficking and prevents multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses. However, alternative mechanisms of S1P-S1P1 signaling have been reported. Phosphoproteomic analysis of MS brain lesions revealed S1P1 phosphorylation on S351, a residue crucial for receptor internalization. Mutant mice harboring an S1pr1 gene encoding phosphorylation-deficient receptors (S1P1(S5A)) developed severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) due to autoimmunity mediated by interleukin 17 (IL-17)-producing helper T cells (TH17 cells) in the peripheral immune and nervous system. S1P1 directly activated the Jak-STAT3 signal-transduction pathway via IL-6. Impaired S1P1 phosphorylation enhances TH17 polarization and exacerbates autoimmune neuroinflammation. These mechanisms may be pathogenic in MS. Plasmid-Encoded Proinsulin Preserves C-Peptide While Specifically Reducing Proinsulin-Specific CD8+ T Cells in Type 1 Diabetes. Roep, B. O., Solvason, N., Gottlieb, P. A., Abreu, J. R., Harrison, L. C., Eisenbarth, G. S., Yu, L., Leviten, M., Hagopian, W. A., Buse, J. B., von Herrath, M., Quan, J., King, R. S., Robinson, W. H., Utz, P. J., Garren, H., Steinman, L. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), there is an intense inflammatory response that destroys the cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, the site where insulin is produced and released. A therapy for T1D that targets the specific autoimmune response in this disease while leaving the remainder of the immune system intact, has long been sought. Proinsulin is a major target of the adaptive immune response in T1D. We hypothesized that an engineered DNA plasmid encoding proinsulin (BHT-3021) would preserve cell function in T1D patients through reduction of insulin-specific CD8(+) T cells. We studied 80 subjects over 18 years of age who were diagnosed with T1D within the past 5 years. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive intramuscular injections of BHT-3021 or BHT-placebo, weekly for 12 weeks, and then monitored for safety and immune responses in a blinded fashion. Four dose levels of BHT-3021 were evaluated: 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 mg. C-peptide was used both as an exploratory efficacy measure and as a safety measure. Islet-specific CD8(+) T cell frequencies were assessed with multimers of monomeric human leukocyte antigen class I molecules loaded with peptides from pancreatic and unrelated antigens. No serious adverse events related to BHT-3021 were observed. C-peptide levels improved relative to placebo at all doses, at 1 mg at the 15-week time point (+19.5% BHT-3021 versus -8.8% BHT-placebo, P < 0.026). Proinsulin-reactive CD8(+) T cells, but not T cells against unrelated islet or foreign molecules, declined in the BHT-3021 arm (P < 0.006). No significant changes were noted in interferon-, interleukin-4 (IL-4), or IL-10 production in CD4 T cells. Thus, we demonstrate that a plasmid encoding proinsulin reduces the frequency of CD8(+) T cells reactive to proinsulin while preserving C-peptide over the course of dosing. Expansion of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells following SIRT1 inactivation in the adult brain. Rafalski, V. A., Ho, P. P., Brett, J. O., Ucar, D., Dugas, J. C., Pollina, E. A., Chow, L. M., Ibrahim, A., Baker, S. J., Barres, B. A., Steinman, L., Brunet, A. Oligodendrocytes-the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system-can be regenerated during adulthood. In adults, new oligodendrocytes originate from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), but also from neural stem cells (NSCs). Although several factors supporting oligodendrocyte production have been characterized, the mechanisms underlying the generation of adult oligodendrocytes are largely unknown. Here we show that genetic inactivation of SIRT1, a protein deacetylase implicated in energy metabolism, increases the production of new OPCs in the adult mouse brain, in part by acting in NSCs. New OPCs produced following SIRT1 inactivation differentiate normally, generating fully myelinating oligodendrocytes. Remarkably, SIRT1 inactivation ameliorates remyelination and delays paralysis in mouse models of demyelinating injuries. SIRT1 inactivation leads to the upregulation of genes involved in cell metabolism and growth factor signalling, in particular PDGF receptor (PDGFR). Oligodendrocyte expansion following SIRT1 inactivation is mediated at least in part by AKT and p38 MAPK-signalling molecules downstream of PDGFR. The identification of drug-targetable enzymes that regulate oligodendrocyte regeneration in adults could facilitate the development of therapies for demyelinating injuries and diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Amyloid Fibrils Composed of Hexameric Peptides Attenuate Neuroinflammation Kurnellas, M. P., Adams, C. M., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. The amyloid-forming proteins tau, B crystallin, and amyloid P protein are all found in lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS). Our previous work established that amyloidogenic peptides from the small heat shock protein B crystallin (HspB5) and from amyloid fibrils, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, were therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), reflecting aspects of the pathology of MS. To understand the molecular basis for the therapeutic effect, we showed a set of amyloidogenic peptides composed of six amino acids, including those from tau, amyloid A4, major prion protein (PrP), HspB5, amylin, serum amyloid P, and insulin B chain, to be anti-inflammatory and capable of reducing serological levels of interleukin-6 and attenuating paralysis in EAE. The chaperone function of the fibrils correlates with the therapeutic outcome. Fibrils composed of tau 623-628 precipitated 49 plasma proteins, including apolipoprotein B-100, clusterin, transthyretin, and complement C3, supporting the hypothesis that the fibrils are active biological agents. Amyloid fibrils thus may provide benefit in MS and other neuroinflammatory disorders. View details for A writing-intensive course improves biology undergraduates' perception and confidence of their abilities to read scientific literature and communicate science Most scientists agree that comprehension of primary scientific papers and communication of scientific concepts are two of the most important skills that we can teach, but few undergraduate biology courses make these explicit course goals. We designed an undergraduate neuroimmunology course that uses a writing-intensive format. Using a mixture of primary literature, writing assignments directed toward a layperson and scientist audience, and in-class discussions, we aimed to improve the ability of students to 1) comprehend primary scientific papers, 2) communicate science to a scientific audience, and 3) communicate science to a layperson audience. We offered the course for three consecutive years and evaluated its impact on student perception and confidence using a combination of pre- and postcourse survey questions and coded open-ended responses. Students showed gains in both the perception of their understanding of primary scientific papers and of their abilities to communicate science to scientific and layperson audiences. These results indicate that this unique format can teach both communication skills and basic science to undergraduate biology students. We urge others to adopt a similar format for undergraduate biology courses to teach process skills in addition to content, thus broadening and strengthening the impact of undergraduate courses.

Inflammatory Cytokines at the Summits of Pathological Signal Cascades in Brain Diseases When considering the hierarchical organization of pathological signaling cascades in immunological disorders of the brain, certain cytokines might be considered pinnacles of pathophysiological importance, with their presence determining the appearance or the course of a particular disease. Interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor are critical for the pathogenesis of inflammation in specific brain disorders. Targeting these cytokines or their receptors can alter the course of several neurological diseases, but the effects may be beneficial or harmful.

Four questions were posed about multiple sclerosis (MS) at the 2011 Charcot Lecture, Oct. 22, 2011. 1. The Male/Female Disparity: Why are women developing MS so much more frequently than men? 2. Neuronal and Glial Protection: Are there guardian molecules that protect the nervous system in MS? 3. Predictive Medicine: With all the approved drugs, how can we rationally decide which one to use? 4. The Precise Scalpel vs. the Big Hammer for Therapy: Is antigen-specific therapy for demyelinating disease possible? To emphasize how our views on the pathogenesis and treatment of MS are evolving, and given the location of the talk in Amsterdam, Piet Mondrian's progressive interpretations of trees serve as a heuristic.

Journal of undergraduate neuroscience education : JUNE : a publication of FUN, Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience The discovery of natalizumab, a potent therapeutic for multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the major inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. There is strong evidence that an immune response in the brain is a critical component of the disease. In 1992, in a collaboration between academia and biotechnology, my colleagues and I showed that 4 integrin was the critical molecule involved in the homing of immune cells into the inflamed brain. Was it sheer luck that these results led to the development of a drug for MS?

V., Rajadas, J., Dolganov, G., Chopra, S., Schoolnik, G. K., Sobel, R. A., Webster, J., Ousman, S. S., Becker, R. A., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. To determine whether the therapeutic activity of B crystallin, small heat shock protein B5 (HspB5), was shared with other human sHsps, a set of seven human family members, a mutant of HspB5 G120 known to exhibit reduced chaperone activity, and a mycobacterial sHsp were expressed and purified from bacteria. Each of the recombinant proteins was shown to be a functional chaperone, capable of inhibiting aggregation of denatured insulin with varying efficiency. When injected into mice at the peak of disease, they were all effective in reducing the paralysis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Additional structure activity correlations between chaperone activity and therapeutic function were established when linear regions within HspB5 were examined. A single region, corresponding to residues 73-92 of HspB5, forms amyloid fibrils, exhibited chaperone activity, and was an effective therapeutic for encephalomyelitis. The linkage of the three activities was further established by demonstrating individual substitutions of critical hydrophobic amino acids in the peptide resulted in the loss of all of the functions. Reversal of Paralysis and Reduced Inflammation from Peripheral Administration of beta-Amyloid in T(H)1 and T(H)17 Versions of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis Grant, J. L., Ghosn, E. E., Axtell, R. C., Herges, K., Kuipers, H. F., Woodling, N. S., Andreasson, K., Herzenberg, L. A., Herzenberg, L. A., Steinman, L. -Amyloid 42 (A42) and -amyloid 40 (A40), major components of senile plaque deposits in Alzheimer's disease, are considered neurotoxic and proinflammatory. In multiple sclerosis, A42 is up-regulated in brain lesions and damaged axons. We found, unexpectedly, that treatment with either A42 or A40 peptides reduced motor paralysis and brain inflammation in four different models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) with attenuation of motor paralysis, reduction of inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), and suppression of lymphocyte activation. A42 and A40 treatments were effective in reducing ongoing paralysis induced with adoptive transfer of either autoreactive T helper 1 (T(H)1) or T(H)17 cells. High-dimensional 14-parameter flow cytometry of peripheral immune cell populations after in vivo A42 and A40 treatment revealed substantial modulations in the percentage of lymphoid and myeloid subsets during EAE. Major proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were reduced in the blood after A peptide treatment. Protection conferred by A treatment did not require its delivery to the brain: Adoptive transfer with lymphocytes from donors treated with A42 attenuated EAE in wild-type recipient mice, and A deposition in the brain was not detected in treated EAE mice by immunohistochemical analysis. In contrast to the improvement in EAE with A treatment, EAE was worse in mice with genetic deletion of the amyloid precursor protein. Therefore, in the absence of A, there is exacerbated clinical EAE disease progression. Because A42 and A40 ameliorate experimental autoimmune inflammation targeting the CNS, we might now consider its potential anti-inflammatory role in other neuropathological conditions.

Comparison of transcriptomic and proteomic data from pathologically similar multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions reveals down-regulation of CD47 at the messenger RNA level and low abundance at the protein level. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that CD47 is expressed in normal myelin and in foamy macrophages and reactive astrocytes within active MS lesions. We demonstrate that CD47(-/-) mice are refractory to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), primarily as the result of failure of immune cell activation after immunization with myelin antigen. In contrast, blocking with a monoclonal antibody against CD47 in mice at the peak of paralysis worsens EAE severity and enhances immune activation in the peripheral immune system. In vitro assays demonstrate that blocking CD47 also promotes phagocytosis of myelin and that this effect is dependent on signal regulatory protein (SIRP-). Immune regulation and phagocytosis are mechanisms for CD47 signaling in autoimmune neuroinflammation. Depending on the cell type, location, and disease stage, CD47 has Janus-like roles, with opposing effects on EAE pathogenesis.

Z., Prat, A., Steinman, L., Dunn, S. E. Women develop certain autoimmune diseases more often than men. It has been hypothesized that this may relate to the development of more robust T-helper (Th)1 responses in women. To test whether women exhibit a Th1 bias, we isolated nave cluster of differentiation (CD)4(+) T cells from peripheral blood of healthy women and men and measured the proliferation and cytokine production by these cells in response to submaximal amounts of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. We observed that CD4(+) T cells from women produced higher levels of IFN as well as tended to proliferate more than male CD4(+) T cells. Intriguingly, male CD4(+) T cells instead had a predilection toward IL-17A production. This sex dichotomy in Th cytokine production was found to be even more striking in the Swiss/Jackson Laboratory (SJL) mouse. Studies in mice and humans indicated that the sexual dimorphism in Th1 and Th17 cytokine production was dependent on the androgen status and the T-cell expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) and PPAR. Androgens increased PPAR and decreased PPAR expression by human CD4(+) T cells. PPAR siRNA-mediated knockdown had the effect of increasing IFN by male CD4(+) T cells, while transfection of CD4(+) T cells with PPAR siRNAs increased IL-17A production uniquely by female T cells. Together, our observations indicate that human T cells exhibit a sex difference in the production of IFN and IL-17A that may be driven by expressions of PPAR and PPAR.

Lipids constitute 70% of the myelin sheath, and autoantibodies against lipids may contribute to the demyelination that characterizes multiple sclerosis (MS). We used lipid antigen microarrays and lipid mass spectrometry to identify bona fide lipid targets of the autoimmune response in MS brain, and an animal model of MS to explore the role of the identified lipids in autoimmune demyelination. We found that autoantibodies in MS target a phosphate group in phosphatidylserine and oxidized phosphatidylcholine derivatives. Administration of these lipids ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by suppressing activation and inducing apoptosis of autoreactive T cells, effects mediated by the lipids' saturated fatty acid side chains. Thus, phospholipids represent a natural anti-inflammatory class of compounds that have potential as therapeutics for MS. Protective effect of an elastase inhibitor in a neuromyelitis optica-like disease driven by a peptide of myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein Herges, K., de Jong, B.

The pathology of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), in contrast to multiple sclerosis, comprises granulocyte infiltrates along extensive lengths of spinal cord, as well as optic nerve. Furthermore, IFN- treatment worsens NMO. We recently found that experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced with Th17 cells is exacerbated by IFN-, in contrast to disease induced with Th1 where treatment attenuated symptoms.This study demonstrates the similarities between NMO and Th17 EAE and how neutrophils mediate pathology in Th17 disease.Levels of blood biomarkers in NMO were assessed by Luminex and ELISA. Effects of IFN- on neutrophils were assessed by culture assays and immunofluorescence. EAE was induced by transfer of myelin-specific Th1 or Th17 cells and treated with Sivelestat sodium hydrate, a neutrophil elastase inhibitor.We show Th17 cytokines, granulocyte chemokines, type 1 interferon and neutrophil elastase are elevated in patients with definitive NMO. In culture, we find that IFN- stimulates neutrophils to release neutrophil elastase. In Th17 EAE, we demonstrate neutrophilic infiltration in the optic nerve and spinal cord which was not present in Th1 EAE. Blockade of neutrophil elastase with Sivelestat had efficacy in Th17 EAE but not Th1 EAE.The similarities between Th17 EAE and NMO indicate that this model represents several aspects of NMO. Neutrophils are critical in the pathologies of both Th17-EAE and NMO, and therefore blockade of neutrophil elastase is a promising target in treating NMO.

P., Brownell, S., Adams, C. M., Su, L., Axtell, R. C., Chen, R., Fathman, C. G., Robinson, W. H., Steinman, L. The therapeutic benefit of the small heat shock protein B-crystallin (HspB5) in animal models of multiple sclerosis and ischemia is proposed to arise from its increased capacity to bind proinflammatory proteins at the elevated temperatures within inflammatory foci. By mass spectral analysis, a common set of 70 ligands was precipitated by HspB5 from plasma from patients with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and amyloidosis and mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These proteins were distinguished from other precipitated molecules because they were enriched in the precipitate as compared with their plasma concentrations, and they exhibited temperature-dependent binding. More than half of these ligands were acute phase proteins or members of the complement or coagulation cascades. Consistent with this proposal, plasma levels of HspB5 were increased in patients with multiple sclerosis as compared with normal individuals. The combination of the thermal sensitivity of the HspB5 combined with the high local concentration of these ligands at the site of inflammation is proposed to explain the paradox of how a protein believed to exhibit nonspecific binding can bind with some relative apparent selectivity to proinflammatory proteins and thereby modulate inflammation.

This report describes a unique target for effective treatment of stroke, even 12 h after onset, by the administration of B-crystallin (Cryab), an endogenous immunomodulatory neuroprotectant. In Cryab(-/-) mice, there was increased lesion size and diminished neurologic function after stroke compared with wild-type mice. Increased plasma Cryab was detected after experimental stroke in mice and after stroke in human patients. Administration of Cryab even 12 h after experimental stroke reduced both stroke volume and inflammatory cytokines associated with stroke pathology. Cryab is an endogenous anti-inflammatory and neuroprotectant molecule produced after stroke, whose beneficial properties can be augmented when administered therapeutically after stroke.

Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) is an important cause of acute vision loss in adults, and there is no effective treatment. We studied early changes following experimental AION and tested the benefit of a potential treatment.Materials andWe induced experimental AION in adult mice and tested the effects of short-term (daily for 3 days) and long-term (every other day for 3 weeks) B-crystallin (BC) treatment using histological and serial intracranial flash visual evoked potential recordings.One day after experimental AION, there was swelling at the optic nerve (ON) head and increased expression of BC, a small heat shock protein important in ischemia and inflammation. This upregulation coincided with microglial and astrocytic activation. Our hypothesis was that BC may be part of the endogenous protective mechanism against injury, thus we tested the effects of BC on experimental AION. Daily intraveneous or intravitreal BC injections did not improve visual evoked potential amplitude or latency at days 1-2. However, BC treatment decreased swelling and dampened the microglial and astrocytic activation on day 3. Longer treatment with intravenous BC led to acceleration of visual evoked potential latency over 3 weeks, without improving amplitude. This latency acceleration did not correlate with increased retinal ganglion cell survival but did correlate with complete rescue of the ON oligodendrocytes, which are important for myelination.We identified BC as an early marker following experimental AION. Treatment with BC enhanced this endogenous, post-ischemic response by decreasing microglial activation and promoting ON oligodendrocyte survival. View details for Interferon-beta exacerbates Th17-mediated inflammatory disease Interferon (IFN)- is the treatment most often prescribed for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). 30-50% of MS patients, however, do not respond to IFN-. In some cases, IFN- exacerbates MS, and it consistently worsens neuromyelitis optica (NMO). To eliminate unnecessary treatment for patients who are non-responsive to IFN-, and to avoid possible harm, researchers are identifying biomarkers that predict treatment outcome before treatment is initiated. These biomarkers reveal insights into the mechanisms of disease. Recent discoveries on human samples from patients with RRMS, NMO, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and ulcerative colitis, indicate that IFN- is ineffective and might worsen clinical status in diverse diseases when a Th17 immune response is prominent. View details for Chaperone Activity of alpha B-Crystallin Is Responsible for Its Incorrect Assignment as an Autoantigen in Multiple Sclerosis Rothbard, J. B., Zhao, X., Sharpe, O., Strohman, M. J., Kurnellas, M., Mellins, E. D., Robinson, W. H., Steinman, L. For 15 y, B-crystallin (heat shock protein [Hsp] B5) has been labeled an autoantigen in multiple sclerosis (MS) based on humoral and cellular responses found in humans and animal models. However, there have been several scientific inconsistencies with this assignment, ranging from studies demonstrating small differences in anticrystallin responses between patients and healthy individuals to the inability of crystallin-specific T cells to induce symptoms of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in animal models. Experiments in this article demonstrate that the putative anti-HspB5 Abs from 23 MS patients cross-react with 7 other members of the human small Hsp family and were equally present in normal plasma. Biolayer interferometry demonstrates that the binding was temperature dependent, and that the calculated K(a) increased as the concentration of the sHsp decreased. These two patterns are characteristic of multiple binding sites with varying affinities, the composition of which changes with temperature, supporting the hypothesis that HspB5 bound the Ab and not the reverse. HspB5 also precipitated Ig heavy and L chains from sera from patients with MS. These results establish that small Hsps bind Igs with high affinity and refute much of the serological data used to assign B-crystallin as an autoantigen.

E., Bhat, R., Straus, D. S., Sobel, R. A., Axtell, R., Johnson, A., Nguyen, K., Mukundan, L., Moshkova, M., Dugas, J. C., Chawla, A., Steinman, L. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs; PPAR-alpha, PPAR-delta, and PPAR-gamma) comprise a family of nuclear receptors that sense fatty acid levels and translate this information into altered gene transcription. Previously, it was reported that treatment of mice with a synthetic ligand activator of PPAR-delta, GW0742, ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), indicating a possible role for this nuclear receptor in the control of central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune inflammation. We show that mice deficient in PPAR-delta (PPAR-delta(-/-)) develop a severe inflammatory response during EAE characterized by a striking accumulation of IFN-gamma(+)IL-17A(-) and IFN-gamma(+)IL-17A(+) CD4(+) cells in the spinal cord. The preferential expansion of these T helper subsets in the CNS of PPAR-delta(-/-) mice occurred as a result of a constellation of immune system aberrations that included higher CD4(+) cell proliferation, cytokine production, and T-bet expression and enhanced expression of IL-12 family cytokines by myeloid cells. We also show that the effect of PPAR-delta in inhibiting the production of IFN-gamma and IL-12 family cytokines is ligand dependent and is observed in both mouse and human immune cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that PPAR-delta serves as an important molecular brake for the control of autoimmune inflammation. View details for Inverse vaccination, the opposite of Jenner's concept, for therapy of autoimmunity DNA-based vaccines to induce antigen-specific inhibition of immune responses in human autoimmune diseases represent the inverse of what Jenner intended when he invented vaccination. Jenner's vaccine induced antigen-specific immunity to small pox. DNA vaccines for autoimmunity have been developed in preclinical settings, and now tested in human trials. The first two clinical trials, one in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, and the other in type 1 diabetes indicate that specific inhibition of antigen-specific antibody and T-cell responses is attainable in humans. Further development of this approach is ongoing. This new version of immunization termed 'inverse vaccination' when applied to autoimmune diseases, may allow targeted reduction of unwanted antibody and T-cell responses to autoantigens, while leaving the remainder of the immune system intact. The method of specifically reducing a pathological adaptive autoimmune response is termed inverse vaccination. View details for T helper type 1 and 17 cells determine efficacy of interferon-beta in multiple sclerosis and experimental encephalomyelitis Axtell, R. C., de Jong, B. A., Boniface, K., Van der Voort, L. F., Bhat, R., De Sarno, P., Naves, R., Han, M., Zhong, F., Castellanos, J. G., Mair, R., Christakos, A., Kolkowitz, I., Katz, L., Killestein, J., Polman, C. H., Malefyt, R. d., Steinman, L., Raman, C. Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) is the major treatment for multiple sclerosis. However, this treatment is not always effective. Here we have found congruence in outcome between responses to IFN-beta in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). IFN-beta was effective in reducing EAE symptoms induced by T helper type 1 (T(H)1) cells but exacerbated disease induced by T(H)17 cells. Effective treatment in T(H)1-induced EAE correlated with increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) production by splenocytes. In T(H)17-induced disease, the amount of IL-10 was unaltered by treatment, although, unexpectedly, IFN-beta treatment still reduced IL-17 production without benefit. Both inhibition of IL-17 and induction of IL-10 depended on IFN-gamma. In the absence of IFN-gamma signaling, IFN-beta therapy was ineffective in EAE. In RRMS patients, IFN-beta nonresponders had higher IL-17F concentrations in serum compared to responders. Nonresponders had worse disease with more steroid usage and more relapses than did responders. Hence, IFN-beta is proinflammatory in T(H)17-induced EAE. Moreover, a high IL-17F concentration in the serum of people with RRMS is associated with nonresponsiveness to therapy with IFN-beta. View details for Inhibitory role for GABA in autoimmune inflammation PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Bhat, R., Axtell, R., Mitra, A., Miranda, M., Lock, C., Tsien, R. W., Steinman, L. GABA, the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, has a parallel inhibitory role in the immune system. We demonstrate that immune cells synthesize GABA and have the machinery for GABA catabolism. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) express functional GABA receptors and respond electrophysiologically to GABA. Thus, the immune system harbors all of the necessary constituents for GABA signaling, and GABA itself may function as a paracrine or autocrine factor. These observations led us to ask further whether manipulation of the GABA pathway influences an animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Increasing GABAergic activity ameliorates ongoing paralysis in EAE via inhibition of inflammation. GABAergic agents act directly on APCs, decreasing MAPK signals and diminishing subsequent adaptive inflammatory responses to myelin proteins. View details for Innate and Adaptive Autoimmunity Directed to the Central Nervous System The immune system has two major components, an innate arm and an adaptive arm. Certain autoimmune diseases of the brain represent examples of disorders where one of these constituents plays a major role. Some rare autoimmune diseases involve activation of the innate arm and include chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular (CINCA) syndrome. In contrast, adaptive immunity is prominent in multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and the paraneoplastic syndromes where highly specific T cell responses and antibodies mediate these diseases. Studies of autoimmune brain disorders have aided in the elucidation of distinct neuronal roles played by key molecules already well known to immunologists (e.g., complement and components of the major histocompatibility complex). In parallel, molecules known to neurobiology and sensory physiology, including toll-like receptors, gamma amino butyric acid and the lens protein alpha B crystallin, have intriguing and distinct functions in the immune system, where they modulate autoimmunity directed to the brain.

M., Ho, P. P., Han, M. H., Lanz, T. V., Phillips, L. K., Goldstein, M. J., Bhat, R., Raine, C. S., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a major regulator of blood pressure. The octapeptide angiotensin II (AII) is proteolytically processed from the decapeptide AI by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and then acts via angiotensin type 1 and type 2 receptors (AT1R and AT2R). Inhibitors of ACE and antagonists of the AT1R are used in the treatment of hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke. We now show that the RAAS also plays a major role in autoimmunity, exemplified by multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Using proteomics, we observed that RAAS is up-regulated in brain lesions of MS. AT1R was induced in myelin-specific CD4+ T cells and monocytes during autoimmune neuroinflammation. Blocking AII production with ACE inhibitors or inhibiting AII signaling with AT1R blockers suppressed autoreactive TH1 and TH17 cells and promoted antigen-specific CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) with inhibition of the canonical NF-kappaB1 transcription factor complex and activation of the alternative NF-kappaB2 pathway. Treatment with ACE inhibitors induces abundant CD4+FoxP3+ T cells with sufficient potency to reverse paralytic EAE. Modulation of the RAAS with inexpensive, safe pharmaceuticals used by millions worldwide is an attractive therapeutic strategy for application to human autoimmune diseases. View details for A molecular trio in relapse and remission in multiple sclerosis Two thirds of patients with multiple sclerosis have the relapsing-remitting form, which often progresses to more debilitating disease. Striking clinical recovery, termed remission, often follows these periodic neurological defects, termed relapses. Recent work has revealed the role of three key molecules in relapse and remission: alpha4beta1 integrin (also known as VLA4) is an adhesion molecule that mediates T cell migration from the blood into the brain; osteopontin binds to alpha4beta1 integrin, stimulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting apoptosis; and alphaB crystallin inhibits inflammation in the brain. This Review discusses how this molecular trio interacts to initiate relapses (in the case of osteopontin and alpha4beta1 integrin) and then to terminate them as remissions in multiple sclerosis (in the case of alphaB crystallin).

Insulin is a major target for the autoimmune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells during the pathogenesis of type I diabetes. A plasmid DNA vaccine encoding mouse proinsulin II reduced the incidence of diabetes in a mouse model of type I diabetes when administered to hyperglycemic (therapeutic mode) or normoglycemic (prophylactic mode) NOD mice. Therapeutic administration of proinsulin DNA was accompanied by a rapid decrease in the number of insulin-specific IFN-gamma-producing T cells, whereas prophylactic treatment was accompanied by enhanced IFN-gamma-secreting cells and a decrease in insulin autoantibodies. Adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that the protection was not mediated by induction of CD25(+)/CD4(+) T regulatory cells. The efficacy of the DNA vaccine was enhanced by increasing the level of expression of the encoded Ag, more frequent dosing, increasing dose level, and localization of the protein product to the intracellular compartment. The efficacy data presented in this study demonstrate that Ag-specific plasmid DNA therapy is a viable strategy for preventing progression of type I diabetes and defines critical parameters of the dosing regime that influences tolerance induction. View details for Nuanced roles of cytokines in three major human brain disorders The three most prevalent human disorders of the CNS in which immunity and inflammation are likely to have vital roles (excluding infection of the CNS) are fever, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Alzheimer disease (AD). As reviewed here, cytokines are critical in the induction of fever, the pathogenesis of MS, and the pathobiology of AD. Indeed, antibodies targeting cytokines have been used as a therapy for individuals with unusual and persistent febrile reactions not responsive to common antipyretics, while a recombinant cytokine is the most popular treatment for the relapsing-remitting form of MS. Although cytokine-modulating therapies are not currently in clinical use for the treatment of AD, cytokines can ameliorate disease pathology in certain experimental models of AD, suggesting a potential for future therapeutic opportunities. View details for Some immunologists have characterized T helper (Th)17 T cells as the master mediators of tissue damage in a variety of pathological conditions. New data now demonstrate that Th1 and Th17 T cells are independently capable of inducing disease in two established models of autoimmunity.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of BHT-3009 in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and to confirm that BHT-3009 causes immune tolerance.BHT-3009 is a tolerizing DNA vaccine for MS, encoding full-length human myelin basic protein. Relapsing-remitting MS patients were randomized 1:1:1 into three groups: placebo, 0.5 mg BHT-3009, or 1.5 mg BHT-3009, given intramuscularly at weeks 0, 2, 4, and every 4 weeks thereafter until week 44. The primary end point was the 4-week rate of occurrence of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions on brain magnetic resonance images from weeks 28 to 48. Protein microarrays were used to measure levels of anti-myelin autoantibodies.Compared with placebo, in the 267 patient analysis population the median 4-week rate of new enhancing lesions during weeks 28 to 48 was 50% lower with 0.5 mg BHT-3009 (p = 0.07) and during weeks 8 to 48 was 61% lower with 0.5 mg BHT-3009 (p = 0.05). The mean volume of enhancing lesions at week 48 was 51% lower on 0.5 mg BHT-3009 compared with placebo (p = 0.02). No significant improvement in magnetic resonance imaging lesion parameters was observed with 1.5 mg BHT-3009. Dramatic reductions in 23 myelin-specific autoantibodies in the 0.5 mg BHT-3009 arm were observed, but not with placebo or 1.5 mg BHT-3009.In relapsing-remitting MS patients, treatment with the lower dose (0.5 mg) of BHT-3009 for 44 weeks nearly attained the primary end point for reduction of the rate of new enhancing magnetic resonance imaging lesions (p = 0.07) and achieved several secondary end points including a reduction of the rate of enhancing magnetic resonance imaging lesions from weeks 8 to 48 (p = 0.05). Immunological data in a preselected subgroup of patients also indicated that treatment with 0.5 mg induced antigen-specific immune tolerance. The greater dose was ineffective.

H., Gerlitz, B., Robinson, W. H., Baranzini, S. E., Grinnell, B. W., Raine, C. S., Sobel, R. A., Han, D. K., Steinman, L. Understanding the neuropathology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is essential for improved therapies. Therefore, identification of targets specific to pathological types of MS may have therapeutic benefits. Here we identify, by laser-capture microdissection and proteomics, proteins unique to three major types of MS lesions: acute plaque, chronic active plaque and chronic plaque. Comparative proteomic profiles identified tissue factor and protein C inhibitor within chronic active plaque samples, suggesting dysregulation of molecules associated with coagulation. In vivo administration of hirudin or recombinant activated protein C reduced disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and suppressed Th1 and Th17 cytokines in astrocytes and immune cells. Administration of mutant forms of recombinant activated protein C showed that both its anticoagulant and its signalling functions were essential for optimal amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. A proteomic approach illuminated potential therapeutic targets selective for specific pathological stages of MS and implicated participation of the coagulation cascade. Induction of antigen-specific tolerance in multiple sclerosis after immunization with DNA encoding myelin basic protein in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1/2 trial Bar-Or, A., Vollmer, T., Antel, J., Arnold, D.

J., Valone, F., Weiner, L., Steinman, L., Garren, H. To assess safety and immune modulation by BHT-3009, a tolerizing DNA vaccine encoding full-length human myelin basic protein, in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects receiving placebo were crossed over into an active arm after treatment unblinding.The trial was conducted at 4 academic institutions within North America. Patients Thirty patients with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS who were not taking any other disease-modifying drugs were enrolled in the trial. Further, the patients were required to have either 1 to 5 gadolinium-enhancing lesions on screening brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a relapse in the previous 2 years, or disease worsening in the previous 2 years.BHT-3009 was administered as intramuscular injections at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 9 after randomization into the trial, with or without 80 mg of daily oral atorvastatin calcium in combination. Three dose levels of BHT-3009 were tested (0.5 mg, 1.5 mg, and 3 mg).The primary outcome measures were safety and tolerability of BHT-3009. Secondary outcome measures included the number and volume of gadolinium-enhanced lesions on MRI, relapses, and analysis of antigen-specific immune responses.BHT-3009 was safe and well tolerated, provided favorable trends on brain MRI, and produced beneficial antigen-specific immune changes. These immune changes consisted of a marked decrease in proliferation of interferon-gamma-producing, myelin-reactive CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood and a reduction in titers of myelin-specific autoantibodies from cerebral spinal fluid as assessed by protein microarrays. We did not observe a substantial benefit of the atorvastatin combination compared with BHT-3009 alone.In patients with MS, BHT-3009 is safe and induces antigen-specific immune tolerance with concordant reduction of inflammatory lesions on brain MRI.

A., Sobel, R. A., Robinson, W. H., Steinman, L. alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) is the most abundant gene transcript present in early active multiple sclerosis lesions, whereas such transcripts are absent in normal brain tissue. This crystallin has anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective functions. CRYAB is the major target of CD4+ T-cell immunity to the myelin sheath from multiple sclerosis brain. The pathophysiological implications of this immune response were investigated here. We demonstrate that CRYAB is a potent negative regulator acting as a brake on several inflammatory pathways in both the immune system and central nervous system (CNS). Cryab-/- mice showed worse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) at the acute and progressive phases, with higher Th1 and Th17 cytokine secretion from T cells and macrophages, and more intense CNS inflammation, compared with their wild-type counterparts. Furthermore, Cryab-/- astrocytes showed more cleaved caspase-3 and more TUNEL staining, indicating an anti-apoptotic function of Cryab. Antibody to CRYAB was detected in cerebrospinal fluid from multiple sclerosis patients and in sera from mice with EAE. Administration of recombinant CRYAB ameliorated EAE. Thus, the immune response against a negative regulator of inflammation, CRYAB, in multiple sclerosis, would exacerbate inflammation and demyelination. This can be countered by giving CRYAB itself for therapy of ongoing disease. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha expression in T cells mediates gender differences in development of T cell-mediated autoimmunity Dunn, S. E., Ousman, S. S., Sobel, R. A., Zuniga, L., Baranzini, S. E., Youssef, S., Crowell, A., Loh, J., Oksenberg, J., Steinman, L. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha is a nuclear receptor that mediates gender differences in lipid metabolism. PPARalpha also functions to control inflammatory responses by repressing the activity of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and c-jun in immune cells. Because PPARalpha is situated at the crossroads of gender and immune regulation, we hypothesized that this gene may mediate sex differences in the development of T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. We show that PPARalpha is more abundant in male as compared with female CD4(+) cells and that its expression is sensitive to androgen levels. Genetic ablation of this gene selectively removed the brake on NF-kappaB and c-jun activity in male T lymphocytes, resulting in higher production of interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor (but not interleukin 17), and lower production of T helper (Th)2 cytokines. Upon induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, male but not female PPARalpha(-/-) mice developed more severe clinical signs that were restricted to the acute phase of disease. These results suggest that males are less prone to develop Th1-mediated autoimmunity because they have higher T cell expression of PPARalpha. View details for A brief history of T(H)17, the first major revision in the T(H)1/T(H)2 hypothesis of T cell-mediated tissue damage For over 35 years, immunologists have divided T-helper (T(H)) cells into functional subsets. T-helper type 1 (T(H)1) cells-long thought to mediate tissue damage-might be involved in the initiation of damage, but they do not sustain or play a decisive role in many commonly studied models of autoimmunity, allergy and microbial immunity. A major role for the cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) has now been described in various models of immune-mediated tissue injury, including organ-specific autoimmunity in the brain, heart, synovium and intestines, allergic disorders of the lung and skin, and microbial infections of the intestines and the nervous system. A pathway named T(H)17 is now credited for causing and sustaining tissue damage in these diverse situations. The T(H)1 pathway antagonizes the T(H)17 pathway in an intricate fashion. The evolution of our understanding of the T(H)17 pathway illuminates a shift in immunologists' perspectives regarding the basis of tissue damage, where for over 20 years the role of T(H)1 cells was considered paramount. View details for Osteopontin-induced relapse and progression of autoimmune brain disease through enhanced survival of activated T cells Hur, E. M., Youssef, S., Haws, M. E., Zhang, S. Y., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L. Relapses and disease exacerbations are vexing features of multiple sclerosis. Osteopontin (Opn), which is expressed in multiple sclerosis lesions, is increased in patients' plasma during relapses. Here, in models of multiple sclerosis including relapsing, progressive and multifocal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), Opn triggered recurrent relapses, promoted worsening paralysis and induced neurological deficits, including optic neuritis. Increased inflammation followed Opn administration, whereas its absence resulted in more cell death of brain-infiltrating lymphocytes. Opn promoted the survival of activated T cells by inhibiting the transcription factor Foxo3a, by activating the transcription factor NF-kappaB through induction of phosphorylation of the kinase IKKbeta and by altering expression of the proapoptotic proteins Bim, Bak and Bax. Those mechanisms collectively suppressed the death of myelin-reactive T cells, linking Opn to the relapses and insidious progression characterizing multiple sclerosis. View details for Isoprenoids determine Th1/Th2 fate in pathogenic T cells, providing a mechanism of modulation of autoimmunity by atorvastatin Dunn, S. E., Youssef, S., Goldstein, M. J., Prod'homme, T., Weber, M. S., Zamvil, S. S., Steinman, L. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is a critical enzyme in the mevalonate pathway that regulates the biosynthesis of cholesterol as well as isoprenoids that mediate the membrane association of certain GTPases. Blockade of this enzyme by atorvastatin (AT) inhibits the destructive proinflammatory T helper cell (Th)1 response during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. Here we present evidence linking specific isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway to signaling pathways that regulate T cell autoimmunity. We demonstrate that the isoprenoid geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP) mediates proliferation, whereas both GGPP and its precursor, farnesyl-PP, regulate the Th1 differentiation of myelin-reactive T cells. Depletion of these isoprenoid intermediates in vivo via oral AT administration hindered these T cell responses by decreasing geranylgeranylated RhoA and farnesylated Ras at the plasma membrane. This was associated with reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 phosphorylation and DNA binding of their cotarget c-fos in response to T cell receptor activation. Inhibition of ERK and p38 mimicked the effects of AT and induced a Th2 cytokine shift. Thus, by connecting isoprenoid availability to regulation of Th1/Th2 fate, we have elucidated a mechanism by which AT may suppress Th1-mediated central nervous system autoimmune disease. View details for Lipid microarrays identify key mediators of autoimmune brain inflammation Kanter, J. L., Narayana, S., Ho, P. P., Catz, I., Warren, K. G., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Recent studies suggest that increased T-cell and autoantibody reactivity to lipids may be present in the autoimmune demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. To perform large-scale multiplex analysis of antibody responses to lipids in multiple sclerosis, we developed microarrays composed of lipids present in the myelin sheath, including ganglioside, sulfatide, cerebroside, sphingomyelin and total brain lipid fractions. Lipid-array analysis showed lipid-specific antibodies against sulfatide, sphingomyelin and oxidized lipids in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) derived from individuals with multiple sclerosis. Sulfatide-specific antibodies were also detected in SJL/J mice with acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Immunization of mice with sulfatide plus myelin peptide resulted in a more severe disease course of EAE, and administration of sulfatide-specific antibody exacerbated EAE. Thus, autoimmune responses to sulfatide and other lipids are present in individuals with multiple sclerosis and in EAE, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune demyelination. Treatment of autoimmune neuroinflammation with a synthetic tryptophan metabolite Platten, M., Ho, P. P., Youssef, S., Fontoura, P., Garren, H., Hur, E. M., Gupta, R., Lee, L. Y., Kidd, B. A., Robinson, W. H., Sobel, R. A., Selley, M. L., Steinman, L. Local catabolism of the amino acid tryptophan (Trp) by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is considered an important mechanism of regulating T cell immunity. We show that IDO transcription was increased when myelin-specific T cells were stimulated with tolerogenic altered self-peptides. Catabolites of Trp suppressed proliferation of myelin-specific T cells and inhibited production of proinflammatory T helper-1 (T(H)1) cytokines. N-(3,4,-Dimethoxycinnamoyl) anthranilic acid (3,4-DAA), an orally active synthetic derivative of the Trp metabolite anthranilic acid, reversed paralysis in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Trp catabolites and their derivatives offer a new strategy for treating T(H)1-mediated autoimmune diseases such as MS. Design of effective immunotherapy for human autoimmunity A better understanding of the molecules involved in immune responses has identified many potential targets for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. But although successful therapies have been found for immune disorders in animal studies, few have passed the much harder test of treating human diseases. So far, non-antigen-specific approaches, such as the blocking of tumour-necrosis factor, are achieving some success but the same is not true for antigen-specific approaches. Future therapies will probably include both non-antigen-specific strategies that target cytokines (cell-cell signalling molecules) or block the molecules that stimulate immune responses, and antigen-specific therapies that induce tolerance to self antigens. View details for Blocking adhesion molecules as therapy for multiple sclerosis: Natalizumab Immunologists have long hypothesized that particular 'molecular addresses' govern lymphocyte entry to a given organ. In 1992, alpha4beta1 integrin was identified as the key molecule involved in homing to inflamed regions of the brain. An antibody to alpha4beta1integrin blocked paralysis in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, and the humanized monoclonal antibody natalizumab, which binds alpha4beta1 integrin, reduced relapses 66% in clinical trials in multiple sclerosis. Three months after its expedited approval by the FDA, natalizumab was removed from the market after two cases of deadly progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy were reported among the few thousand patients who had taken this drug in those clinical trials. View details for Our increasing understanding of the pathophysiology of autoimmune disease has revealed a number of checkpoints that can be targeted with immune therapy, including key mediators of lymphocyte adhesion and migration, destructive cytokines involved in tissue damage, and the complex of molecules critical in the presentation of self-antigen and the activation of autoaggressive T lymphocytes. In many organ-specific autoimmune diseases, the identity of the molecules attacked by T cells and autoantibodies is known and attempts are under way to tolerize the immune system with a high level of specificity to these targets.

A., Lanier, L., Lim, M., Steinman, L. Administration of a monoclonal antibody (GK1.5) that recognizes the L3T4 marker present on helper T cells prevented the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. Furthermore, treatment with GK1.5 reversed EAE when the antibody was given to paralyzed animals. In vivo injection of GK1.5 selectively reduced the number of L3T4+ cells in the spleen and the lymph nodes. These results suggest that manipulation of the human equivalent of the murine L3T4+ T-cell subset with monoclonal antibodies may provide effective therapy for certain autoimmune diseases.

K., Hardy, R. R., Hayakawa, K., Steinman, L., Herzenberg, L. A., Herzenberg, L. A. Previous studies have shown that treatment with antibodies to the murine I-A antigen encoded in the major histocompatibility complex attenuates experimental allergic encephalitis and experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. These studies were conducted with SJL mice, an inbred strain that is highly susceptible to the induction of these diseases. Here we show that injection of monoclonal anti-I-A antibody in the amounts used for the above studies rapidly depletes B cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) multiparameter analysis of the B-cell subpopulations in treated animals shows that maximum depletion occurs around 5 days after treatment and that recovery of some subpopulations i still incomplete 1 month later. SJL mice are more sensitive to this B-cell depletion and recover more slowly than putatively normal C3H.Ighb (CKB) mice. Some components of the primary, secondary and tertiary IgG antibody responses are reduced in anti-I-A-treated SJL animals immunized after the first and second anti-I-A injections. The persistence of some antibody response impairment well beyond the time when anti-I-A disappears raises a note of caution concerning human therapy protocols based on the injection of anti-Ia antibodies.

K., Sriram, S., McDevitt, H. O., Steinman, L. A monoclonal antibody to I-A gene products of the immune response gene complex attenuates both humoral and cellular responses to acetylcholine receptor and appears to suppress clinical manifestations of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. This demonstrates that use of antibodies against immune response gene products that are associated with susceptibility to disease may be feasible for therapy in autoimmune conditions such as myasthenia gravis. View details for Mitigating alemtuzumab-associated autoimmunity in MS: A ""whack-a-mole"" B-cell depletion strategy. Meltzer, E., Campbell, S., Ehrenfeld, B., Cruz, R. A., Steinman, L., Parsons, M. S., Zamvil, S. S., Frohman, E. M., Frohman, T. C. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the punctuated administration of low-dose rituximab, temporally linked to B-cell hyperrepopulation (defined when the return of CD19+ B cells approximates 40%-50% of baseline levels as measured before alemtuzumab treatment inception), can mitigate alemtuzumab-associated secondary autoimmunity.METHODS: In this hypothesis-driven pilot study, 10 patients received low-dose rituximab (50-150 mg/m2), a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, after either their first or second cycles of alemtuzumab. These patients were then routinely assessed for the development of autoimmune disorders and safety signals related to the use of dual monoclonal antibody therapy.RESULTS: Five patients received at least 1 IV infusion of low-dose rituximab, following alemtuzumab therapy, with a mean follow-up of 41 months. None of the 5 patients developed secondary autoimmune disorders. An additional 5 patients with follow-up over less than 24 months received at least 1 infusion of low-dose rituximab treatment following alemtuzumab treatment. No secondary autoimmune diseases were observed.CONCLUSIONS: An anti-CD20 ""whack-a-mole"" B-cell depletion strategy may serve to mitigate alemtuzumab-associated secondary autoimmunity in MS by reducing the imbalance in B- and T-cell regulatory networks during immune reconstitution. We believe that these observations warrant further investigation.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that for people with MS, low-dose rituximab following alemtuzumab treatment decreases the risk of alemtuzumab-associated secondary autoimmune diseases.

SARS-CoV-2 triggered 'PANIC' attack in severe COVID-19. Frohman, E. M., Villemarette-Pittman, N. R., Melamed, E., Cruz, R. A., Longmuir, R., Varkey, T. C., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S., Frohman, T. C. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has produced a world-wide collapse of social and economic infrastructure, as well as constrained our freedom of movement. This respiratory tract infection is nefarious in how it targets the most distal and highly vulnerable aspect of the human bronchopulmonary tree, specifically, the delicate yet irreplaceable alveoli that are responsible for the loading of oxygen upon red cell hemoglobin for use by all of the body's tissues. In most symptomatic individuals, the disease is a mild immune-mediated syndrome, with limited damage to the lung tissues. About 20% of those affected experience a disease course characterized by a cataclysmic set of immune activation responses that can culminate in the diffuse and irreversible obliteration of the distal alveoli, leading to a virtual collapse of the gas-exchange apparatus. Here, in Part I of a duology on the characterization and potential treatment for COVID-19, we define severe COVID-19 as a consequence of the ability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to trigger what we now designate for the first time as a 'Prolific Activation of a Network-Immune-Inflammatory Crisis', or 'PANIC' Attack, in the alveolar tree. In Part II we describe an immunotherapeutic hypothesis worthy of the organization of a randomized clinical trial in order to ascertain whether a repurposed, generic, inexpensive, and widely available agent is capable of abolishing 'PANIC'; thereby preventing or mitigating severe COVID-19, with monumental ramifications for world health, and the global pandemic that continues to threaten it.

View details for New targets and therapeutics for neuroprotection, remyelination and repair in multiple sclerosis. Introduction: Immunotherapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) significantly decrease the risk of new relapses. However, the chronic compartmentalized inflammation and neurodegeneration that define progressive MS are not prevented by these therapies and so significant damage to the brain and spinal cord and resulting disability ensues. Hence, the possibility of combining current immunotherapies with neuroprotective, remyelinating or regenerative therapies should be pursued.Areas Covered: This article sheds light on neuroprotective, remyelination and neurorepair strategies for MS, the numerous mechanisms for therapeutic targeting and the new candidates for combination therapies. We searched PubMed for articles with the terms, 'neuroprotection', remyelination' or 'regeneration' and 'therapies' or 'drugs' and 'Multiple Sclerosis'.Expert Opinion: An enriched understanding of the neurobiology and molecular changes that are activated by inflammatory CNS damage will provide new opportunities for the identification of neuroprotective, remyelinating and regenerative therapies. Success will depend on the improvement of CNS drug delivery, the identification of new predictive biomarkers, the optimization of clinical trials by assessment of the damage to the visual pathway and the testing of novel therapies in acute optic neuritis.

M., Villemarette-Pittman, N. R., Cruz, R. A., Longmuir, R., Rowe, V., Rowe, E. S., Varkey, T. C., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S., Frohman, T. C. Here, in Part II of a duology on the characterization and potential treatment for COVID-19, we characterize the application of an innovative treatment regimen for the prevention of the transition from mild to severe COVID-19, as well as detail an intensive immunotherapy intervention hypothesis. We propose as a putative randomized controlled trial that high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin (HDMTX-LR) rescue can abolish 'PANIC', thereby 'left-shifting' severe COVID-19 patients to the group majority of those infected with SARS-CoV-2, who are designated as having mild, even asymptomatic, disease. HDMTX-LR is endowed with broadly pleiotropic properties and is a repurposed, generic, inexpensive, and widely available agent which can be administered early in the course of severe COVID-19 thus rescuing the critical and irreplaceable gas-exchange alveoli. Further, we describe a preventative treatment intervention regimen for those designated as having mild to moderate COVID-19 disease, but who exhibit features which herald the transition to the severe variant of this disease. Both of our proposed hypothesis-driven questions should be urgently subjected to rigorous assessment in the context of randomized controlled trials, in order to confirm or refute the contention that the approaches characterized herein, are in fact capable of exerting mitigating, if not abolishing, effects upon SARS-CoV-2 triggered 'PANIC Attack'. Confirmation of our immunotherapy hypothesis would have far-reaching ramifications for the current pandemic, along with yielding invaluable lessons which could be leveraged to more effectively prepare for the next challenge to global health.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Costanza, M., Poliani, P. L., Portararo, P., Cappetti, B., Musio, S., Pagani, F., Steinman, L., Colombo, M. P., Pedotti, R., Sangaletti, S. The extrusion of DNA traps contributes to a key mechanism in which innate immune cells clear pathogens or induce sterile inflammation. Here we provide evidence that CD4+ T cells, a critical regulator of adaptive immunity, release extracellular threads of DNA on activation. These DNA extrusions convey autocrine costimulatory signals to T lymphocytes and can be detected in lymph nodes isolated during the priming phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a CD4+ T cell-driven mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) abolishes the extrusion of DNA by CD4+ T cells, reducing cytokine production in vitro and T cell priming against myelin in vivo. Moreover, mtROS blockade during established EAE markedly ameliorates disease severity, dampening autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system. Taken together, these experimental results elucidate a mechanism of intrinsic immune costimulation mediated by DNA threads released by activated T helper cells, and identify a potential therapeutic target for such disorders as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and CD4+ T cell-mediated disorders.

The development of neuroprotective therapies is a sought-after goal. By screening combinatorial chemical libraries using in vitro assays, we identified the small molecule BN201 that promotes the survival of cultured neural cells when subjected to oxidative stress or when deprived of trophic factors. Moreover, BN201 promotes neuronal differentiation, the differentiation of precursor cells to mature oligodendrocytes in vitro, and the myelination of new axons. BN201 modulates several kinases participating in the insulin growth factor 1 pathway including serum-glucocorticoid kinase and midkine, inducing the phosphorylation of NDRG1 and the translocation of the transcription factor Foxo3 to the cytoplasm. In vivo, BN201 prevents axonal and neuronal loss, and it promotes remyelination in models of multiple sclerosis, chemically induced demyelination, and glaucoma. In summary, we provide a new promising strategy to promote neuroaxonal survival and remyelination, potentially preventing disability in brain diseases. Safety and efficacy of ozanimod versus interferon beta-1a in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RADIANCE): a multicentre, randomised, 24-month, phase 3 trial. Cohen, J. A., Comi, G., Selmaj, K. W., Bar-Or, A., Arnold, D. L., Steinman, L., Hartung, H. P., Montalban, X., Kubala Havrdov, E., Cree, B. A., Sheffield, J. K., Minton, N., Raghupathi, K., Huang, V., Kappos, L. Ozanimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, which selectively binds to sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtypes 1 and 5 with high affinity. In the RADIANCE phase 2 study in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis, ozanimod was associated with better efficacy than placebo on MRI measures and was well tolerated. The RADIANCE phase 3 study aimed to confirm the safety and efficacy of ozanimod versus interferon beta-1a in individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis.We did a 24-month, multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy phase 3 trial in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis at 147 medical centres and clinical practices in 21 countries. Participants were aged 18-55 years, had multiple sclerosis according to 2010 McDonald criteria, a relapsing clinical course, brain MRI lesions consistent with multiple sclerosis, an expanded disability status scale score of 00-50, and either at least one relapse within 12 months before screening or at least one relapse within 24 months before screening plus at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion within the 12 months before randomisation. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via an interactive voice response system to daily oral ozanimod 10 mg or 05 mg or weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a 30 g. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was annualised relapse rate (ARR) over 24 months. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population of all participants who received study drug and safety was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received study drug, grouped by highest dose of ozanimod received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02047734, and EudraCT, 2012-002714-40.Between Dec 27, 2013, and March 31, 2015, we screened 1695 participants, of which 375 did not meet inclusion criteria. 1320 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to a group, of whom 1313 received study drug (433 assigned to ozanimod 10 mg, 439 assigned to ozanimod 05 mg, and 441 assigned to interferon beta-1a) and 1138 (867%) completed 24 months of treatment. Adjusted ARRs were 017 (95% CI 014-021) with ozanimod 10 mg, 022 (018-026) with ozanimod 05 mg, and 028 (023-032) with interferon beta-1a, with rate ratios versus interferon beta-1a of 062 (95% CI 051-077; p<00001) for ozanimod 10 mg and 079 (065 to 096; p=00167) for ozanimod 05 mg. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was higher in the interferon beta-1a group (365 [830%] of 440 participants) than in the ozanimod 10 mg group (324 [747%] of 434) or the ozanimod 05 mg group (326 [743%] of 439). More participants in the interferon beta-1a group had treatment-emergent adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation than in the ozanimod groups. Incidences of infections and serious treatment-emergent adverse events were similar across treatment groups. No cases of ozanimod-related symptomatic reduction in heart rate and no second-degree or third-degree cases of atrioventricular block were reported.In this 24-month phase 3 study in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis, ozanimod was well tolerated and associated with a significantly lower rate of clinical relapses than intramuscular interferon beta-1a. These findings show the potential of ozanimod as an effective oral therapy for individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis.Celgene International II.

The RADIANCE phase 2 study showed that ozanimod had better efficacy than placebo on MRI measures, with a favourable safety profile, in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis. The SUNBEAM study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ozanimod versus intramuscular interferon beta-1a in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis.SUNBEAM was a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled phase 3 trial done at 152 academic medical centres and clinical practices in 20 countries. We enrolled participants aged 18-55 years with relapsing multiple sclerosis, baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score of 00-50, and either at least one relapse within the 12 months before screening or at least one relapse within 24 months plus at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion within 12 months before screening. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 by a blocked algorithm stratified by country and baseline EDSS score to at least 12 months treatment of either once-daily oral ozanimod 10 mg or 05 mg or weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a 30 g. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was annualised relapse rate (ARR) during the treatment period and was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all participants according to the highest dose of ozanimod received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02294058 and EudraCT, number 2014-002320-27.Between Dec 18, 2014, and Nov 12, 2015, 1346 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to ozanimod 10 mg (n=447), ozanimod 05 mg (n=451), or interferon beta-1a (n=448). 91 (68%) participants discontinued the study drug (29 in the ozanimod 10 mg group; 26 in the ozanimod 05 mg group; and 36 in the interferon beta-1a group). Adjusted ARRs were 035 (028-044) for interferon beta-1a, 018 (95% CI 014-024) for ozanimod 10 mg (rate ratio [RR] of 052 [041-066] vs interferon beta-1a; p<00001), and 024 (019-031) for ozanimod 05 mg (RR 069 [055-086] vs interferon beta-1a; p=00013). Few ozanimod-treated participants discontinued treatment because of adverse events (13 [29%] who received ozanimod 10 mg; seven [15%] who received ozanimod 05 mg; and 16 [36%] who received interferon beta-1a). No first-dose, clinically significant bradycardia or second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block was reported. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and similar across treatment groups (13 [29%] participants who received ozanimod 10 mg; 16 [35%] who received ozanimod 05 mg; and 11 [25%] who received interferon beta-1a). No serious opportunistic infections occurred in ozanimod-treated participants.In participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis treated for at least 12 months, ozanimod was well tolerated and demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate than interferon beta-1a. These findings provide support for ozanimod as an oral therapy for individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis.Celgene International II.

To evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine profiles in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein IgG-positive (MOG-IgG+) disease in adult and paediatric patients.In this cross-sectional study, we measured 27 cytokines in the CSF of MOG-IgG+ disease in acute phase before treatment (n=29). The data were directly compared with those in aquaporin-4 antibody-positive (AQP4-IgG+) neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) (n=20), multiple sclerosis (MS) (n=20) and non-inflammatory controls (n=14).In MOG-IgG+ disease, there was no female preponderance and the ages were younger (mean 18 years, range 3-68; 15 were below 18 years) relative to AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD (41, 15-77) and MS (34, 17-48). CSF cell counts were higher and oligoclonal IgG bands were mostly negative in MOG-IgG+ diseaseand AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD compared with MS. MOG-IgG+ disease had significantly elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, interferon-, IL-10, IL-1 receptor antagonist, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 as compared with MS. No cytokine in MOG-IgG+ disease was significantly different from AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD. Moreover many elevated cytokines were correlated with each other in MOG-IgG+ diseaseand AQP4-IgG+ NMOSDbut not in MS. No difference in the data was seen between adult and paediatric MOG-IgG+ cases.The CSF cytokine profile in the acute phase of MOG-IgG+ disease is characterised by coordinated upregulation of T helper 17 (Th17) and other cytokines including some Th1-related and regulatory T cells-related ones in adults and children, which is similar to AQP4-IgG+ NMOSDbut clearly different from MS. The results suggest that as with AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD, some disease-modifying drugs for MS may be ineffective in MOG-IgG+ disease while they may provide potential therapeutic targets.

M., Glanville, J., Volkmuth, W., Emerling, D. E., Robinson, W. H. There is significant debate regarding whether B cells and their antibodies contribute to effective anti-cancer immune responses. Here we show that patients with metastatic but non-progressing melanoma, lung adenocarcinoma, or renal cell carcinoma exhibited increased levels of blood plasmablasts. We used a cell-barcoding technology to sequence their plasmablast antibody repertoires, revealing clonal families of affinity matured B cells that exhibit progressive class switching and persistence over time. Anti-CTLA4 and other treatments were associated with further increases in somatic hypermutation and clonal family size. Recombinant antibodies from clonal families bound non-autologous tumor tissue and cell lines, and families possessing immunoglobulin paratope sequence motifs shared across patients exhibited increased rates of binding. We identified antibodies that caused regression of, and durable immunity toward, heterologous syngeneic tumors in mice. Our findings demonstrate convergent functional anti-tumor antibody responses targeting public tumor antigens, and provide an approach to identify antibodies with diagnostic or therapeutic utility.

Ozanimod, an oral immunomodulator, selectively targets sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 1 and 5.Evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis.In the RADIANCE Part A phase II study (NCT01628393), participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis were randomized (1:1:1) to once-daily ozanimod hydrochloride (0.5 or 1mg) or placebo. After 24weeks, participants could enter a 2-year, dose-blinded extension. Ozanimod-treated participants continued their assigned dose; placebo participants were re-randomized (1:1) to ozanimod hydrochloride 0.5 or 1mg (equivalent to ozanimod 0.46 and 0.92mg).A total of 223 (89.6%) of the 249 participants completed the blinded extension. At 2years of the extension, the percentage of participants who were gadolinium-enhancing lesion-free ranged from 86.5% to 94.6%. Unadjusted annualized relapse rate during the blinded extension (week 24-end of treatment) was 0.32 for ozanimod hydrochloride 0.5mg ozanimod hydrochloride 0.5mg, 0.18 for ozanimod hydrochloride 1mg ozanimod hydrochloride 1mg, 0.30 for placebo ozanimod hydrochloride 0.5 mg, and 0.18 for placebo ozanimod hydrochloride 1mg. No second-degree or higher atrioventricular block or serious opportunistic infection was reported.Ozanimod demonstrated sustained efficacy in participants continuing treatment up to 2years and reached similar efficacy in participants who switched from placebo; no unexpected safety signals emerged. Amelioration of ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with fluoxetine Bhat, R., Mahapatra, S., Axtell, R. C., Steinman, L. In patients with multiple sclerosis, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, resulted in less acute disease activity. We tested the immune modulating effects of fluoxetine in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, i.e. experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We show that fluoxetine delayed the onset of disease and reduced clinical paralysis in mice with established disease. Fluoxetine had abrogating effects on proliferation of immune cells and inflammatory cytokine production by both antigen-presenting cells and T cells. Specifically, in CD4 T cells, fluoxetine increased Fas-induced apoptosis. We conclude that fluoxetine possesses immune-modulating effects resulting in the amelioration of symptoms in EAE.

Demyelinated brain lesions, a hallmark of autoimmune neuroinflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis, result from oligodendroglial cell damage. Activated microglia are considered a major source of nitric oxide and subsequent peroxynitrite-mediated damage of myelin. Here, we provide biochemical and biophysical evidence that the oxidoreductase glutaredoxin 2 inhibits peroxynitrite formation by transforming nitric oxide into dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron-complexes. Glutaredoxin 2 levels influence both survival rates of primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and preservation of myelin structure in cerebellar organotypic slice cultures challenged with activated microglia or nitric oxide donors. Of note, glutaredoxin 2-mediated protection is not linked to its enzymatic activity as oxidoreductase, but to the disassembly of its uniquely coordinated iron-sulfur cluster using glutathione as non-protein ligand. The protective effect of glutaredoxin 2 is connected to decreased protein carbonylation and nitration. In line, brain lesions of mice suffering from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis, show decreased glutaredoxin 2 expression and increased nitrotyrosine formation indicating that this type of protection is missing in the inflamed central nervous system. Our findings link inorganic biochemistry to neuroinflammation and identify glutaredoxin 2 as a protective factor against neuroinflammation-mediated myelin damage. Thus, improved availability of glutathione-coordinated iron-sulfur clusters emerges as a potential therapeutic approach in inflammatory demyelination.

L., Fontana, E., Cominelli, M., Abolafio, G., Steinman, L., Pedotti, R. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of targeting the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (FcepsilonRI), that plays a central role in allergic responses and is constitutively expressed on mast cells and basophils, in clinical disease and autoimmune T-cell response in experimental MS.METHODS: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in C57BL/6 mice by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55. Anti-FcepsilonRI alpha-chain antibody was administered intraperitoneally. CNS immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry analysis of immune cell populations, IgE and histamine serum concentration, immune cell proliferation, and cytokine measurement were performed. In BALB/c mice, EAE was induced by immunization with myelin proteolipid protein 185-206.RESULTS: Treatment with anti-FcepsilonRIalpha antibody resulted in exacerbation of EAE and increased CNS inflammation in C57BL/6 mice. Treated mice displayed long-lasting complete depletion of basophils in the blood stream and peripheral lymphoid organs and increased antigen-induced immune cell proliferation and production of interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-17, IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In BALB/c mice, which are T-helper (Th) 2 prone and resistant to EAE, treatment with anti-FcepsilonRIalpha antibody restored susceptibility to EAE.CONCLUSION: Our observations that anti-FcepsilonRIalpha antibody increases Th1 and Th17 responses against myelin antigen and exacerbates EAE suggest that FcepsilonRI, basophils, and possibly other FcepsilonRI-bearing cells that might be affected by this antibody play important roles in influencing the severity of CNS autoimmunity.

View details for Time correlation between mononucleosis and initial symptoms of MS To determine the average age of MS onset vs the age at which Epstein-Barr infection has previously occurred and stratify this analysis by sex and the blood level of Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) antibody.Using infectious mononucleosis (IM) as a temporal marker in data from the Swedish epidemiologic investigation of MS, 259 adult IM/MS cases were identified and then augmented to account for ""missing"" childhood data so that the average age of MS onset could be determined for cases binned by age of IM (as stratified by sex and EBNA1 titer level).Mean age of IM vs mean age of MS reveals a positive time correlation for all IM ages (from 5 to 30 years), with IM-to-MS delay decreasing with increased age. When bifurcated by sex or EBNA1 blood titer levels, males and high-titer subpopulations show even stronger positive time correlation, while females and low-titer populations show negative time correlation in early childhood (long IM/MS delay). The correlation becomes positive in females beyond puberty.IM/MS time correlation implies causality if IM is time random. Alternative confounding models seem implausible, in light of constraints imposed by time-invariant delay observed here. Childhood infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in females and/or those genetically prone to low EBNA1 blood titers will develop MS slowly. Males and/or high EBNA1-prone develop MS more rapidly following IM infection at all ages. For all, postpubescent EBV infection is critical for the initiation and rapid development of MS.

Expression of Spam1/PH20 and its modulation of high/low molecular weight hyaluronan substrate have been proposed to play an important role in murine oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) maturation in vitro and in normal and demyelinated central nervous system (CNS). We reexamined this using highly purified PH20.Steady-state expression of mRNA in OPCs was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction; the role of PH20 in bovine testicular hyaluronidase (BTH) inhibition of OPC differentiation was explored by comparing BTH to a purified recombinant human PH20 (rHuPH20). Contaminants in commercial BTH were identified and their impact on OPC differentiation characterized. Spam1/PH20 expression in normal and demyelinated mouse CNS tissue was investigated using deep RNA sequencing and immunohistological methods with two antibodies directed against recombinant murine PH20.BTH, but not rHuPH20, inhibited OPC differentiation in vitro. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was identified as a significant contaminant in BTH, and bFGF immunodepletion reversed the inhibitory effects of BTH on OPC differentiation. Spam1 mRNA was undetected in OPCs in vitro and in vivo; PH20 immunolabeling was undetected in normal and demyelinated CNS.We were unable to detect Spam1/PH20 expression in OPCs or in normal or demyelinated CNS using the most sensitive methods currently available. Further, ""BTH"" effects on OPC differentiation are not due to PH20, but may be attributable to contaminating bFGF. Our data suggest that caution be exercised when using some commercially available hyaluronidases, and reports of Spam1/PH20 morphogenic activity in the CNS may be due to contaminants in reagents.

F., Yoon, J., van Horssen, J., Han, M. H., Bollyky, P. L., Palmer, T. D., Steinman, L. The small heat shock protein B-crystallin (CRYAB) has been implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. Earlier studies have indicated that CRYAB inhibits inflammation and attenuates clinical disease when administered in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of MS. In this study, we evaluated the role of CRYAB in primary demyelinating events. Using the cuprizone model of demyelination, a noninflammatory model that allows the analysis of glial responses in MS, we show that endogenous CRYAB expression is associated with increased severity of demyelination. Moreover, we demonstrate a strong correlation between the expression of CRYAB and the extent of reactive astrogliosis in demyelinating areas and in in vitro assays. In addition, we reveal that CRYAB is differentially phosphorylated in astrocytes in active demyelinating MS lesions, as well as in cuprizone-induced lesions, and that this phosphorylation is required for the reactive astrocyte response associated with demyelination. Furthermore, taking a proteomics approach to identify proteins that are bound by the phosphorylated forms of CRYAB in primary cultured astrocytes, we show that there is clear differential binding of protein targets due to the specific phosphorylation of CRYAB. Subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of these targets reveals implications for intracellular pathways and biological processes that could be affected by these modifications. Together, these findings demonstrate that astrocytes play a pivotal role in demyelination, making them a potential target for therapeutic intervention, and that phosphorylation of CRYAB is a key factor supporting the pathogenic response of astrocytes to oligodendrocyte injury.

C., Cen, S. Y., Tauhid, S., Neema, M., Steinman, L. The objective of this study was to evaluate monthly intramuscular adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) gel versus intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) add-on therapy to interferon for breakthrough disease in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.This was a prospective, open-label, examiner-blinded, 15-month pilot study evaluating patients with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 3.0-6.5 and at least one clinical relapse or new T2 or gadolinium-enhanced lesion in the previous year. Twenty-three patients were randomized to ACTH (n = 12) or IVMP (n = 11) and completed the study. The primary outcome measure was the cumulative number of relapses. Secondary outcomes included EDSS, Mental Health Inventory (MHI), plasma cytokines, MS Functional Composite (MSFC), Quality-of-Life (MS-QOL) score, bone mineral density (BMD), and new or worsened psychiatric symptoms per month. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was analyzed post hoc. This was a preliminary and small-scale study.Relapse rates differed significantly [ACTH 0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01-0.54 versus IVMP 0.80, 95% CI 0.36-1.75; rate ratio, IVMP versus ACTH: 9.56, 95% CI 1.23-74.6; p = 0.03]. ACTH improved (p = 0.03) MHI (slope 0.95 0.38 points/month; p = 0.02 versus slope -0.38 0.43 points/month; p = 0.39). On-study decreases (all p < 0.05) in eight cytokine levels occurred only in the ACTH group. However, on-study EDSS, MSFC, MS-QOL, BMD, and MRI lesion changes were not significant between groups. Psychiatric symptoms per patient were greater with IVMP than ACTH (0.55, 95% CI 0.12-2.6 versus 0; p < 0.0001). Other common adverse events were insomnia and urinary tract infections (IVMP, seven events each) and fatigue or flu symptoms (ACTH, five events each).This study provided class II evidence that ACTH produced better examiner-assessed cumulative rates of relapses per patient than IVMP in the adjunctive treatment of breakthrough disease in multiple sclerosis. Regulator of oligodendrocyte maturation, miR-219, a potential biomarker for MS. Bruinsma, I. B., van Dijk, M., Bridel, C., van de Lisdonk, T., Haverkort, S. Q., Runia, T. F., Steinman, L., Hintzen, R. Q., Killestein, J., Verbeek, M. M., Teunissen, C. E., de Jong, B. A. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and degenerative disease of the central nervous system. Normally, demyelination is followed by remyelination, which requires repopulation of a demyelinated area by oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Although large numbers of precursor cells are present in MS lesions, remyelination often fails, in part by the inability of precursor cells to differentiate into mature myelin-forming cells. In mouse and rat, miR-219 is required for this differentiation. Previously, we identified decreased miR-219 expression in tissue of MS patients compared to controls. Cell-free miRNAs have been detected in many different body fluids including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and may reflect disease processes going on in the central nervous system. This prompted us to investigate the biomarker performance of CSF miR-219 for MS diagnosis.Quantitative PCR was performed measuring miR-219 levels in CSF of MS patients and controls in three independent cohorts.All three cohorts of MS patients and controls revealed that absence of miR-219 detection in CSF is consistently associated with MS.We have been able to identify and validate absence of miR-219 detection in CSF of MS patients compared to controls, suggesting that it may emerge as a candidate biomarker for MS diagnosis. Induction of Paralysis and Visual System Injury in Mice by T Cells Specific for Neuromyelitis Optica Autoantigen Aquaporin-4. Sagan, S. A., Cruz-Herranz, A., Spencer, C. M., Ho, P. P., Steinman, L., Green, A. J., Sobel, R. A., Zamvil, S. S. While it is recognized that aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-specific T cells and antibodies participate in the pathogenesis of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), a human central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune demyelinating disease, creation of an AQP4-targeted model with both clinical and histologic manifestations of CNS autoimmunity has proven challenging. Immunization of wild-type (WT) mice with AQP4 peptides elicited T cell proliferation, although those T cells could not transfer disease to nave recipient mice. Recently, two novel AQP4 T cell epitopes, peptide (p) 135-153 and p201-220, were identified when studying immune responses to AQP4 in AQP4-deficient (AQP4-/-) mice, suggesting T cell reactivity to these epitopes is normally controlled by thymic negative selection. AQP4-/- Th17 polarized T cells primed to either p135-153 or p201-220 induced paralysis in recipient WT mice, that was associated with predominantly leptomeningeal inflammation of the spinal cord and optic nerves. Inflammation surrounding optic nerves and involvement of the inner retinal layers (IRL) were manifested by changes in serial optical coherence tomography (OCT). Here, we illustrate the approaches used to create this new in vivo model of AQP4-targeted CNS autoimmunity (ATCA), which can now be employed to study mechanisms that permit development of pathogenic AQP4-specific T cells and how they may cooperate with B cells in NMO pathogenesis. Tolerance checkpoint bypass permits emergence of pathogenic T cells to neuromyelitis optica autoantigen aquaporin-4 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Sagan, S.

J., Anderson, M. S., Sobel, R. A., Zamvil, S. S. Aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-specific T cells are expanded in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients and exhibit Th17 polarization. However, their pathogenic role in CNS autoimmune inflammatory disease is unclear. Although multiple AQP4 T-cell epitopes have been identified in WT C57BL/6 mice, we observed that neither immunization with those determinants nor transfer of donor T cells targeting them caused CNS autoimmune disease in recipient mice. In contrast, robust proliferation was observed following immunization of AQP4-deficient (AQP4(-/-)) mice with AQP4 peptide (p) 135-153 or p201-220, peptides predicted to contain I-A(b)-restricted T-cell epitopes but not identified in WT mice. In comparison with WT mice, AQP4(-/-) mice used unique T-cell receptor repertoires for recognition of these two AQP4 epitopes. Donor T cells specific for either determinant from AQP4(-/-), but not WT, mice induced paralysis in recipient WT and B-cell-deficient mice. AQP4-specific Th17-polarized cells induced more severe disease than Th1-polarized cells. Clinical signs were associated with opticospinal infiltrates of T cells and monocytes. Fluorescent-labeled donor T cells were detected in CNS lesions. Visual system involvement was evident by changes in optical coherence tomography. Fine mapping of AQP4 p201-220 and p135-153 epitopes identified peptides within p201-220 but not p135-153, which induced clinical disease in 40% of WT mice by direct immunization. Our results provide a foundation to evaluate how AQP4-specific T cells contribute to AQP4-targeted CNS autoimmunity (ATCA) and suggest that pathogenic AQP4-specific T-cell responses are normally restrained by central tolerance, which may be relevant to understanding development of AQP4-reactive T cells in NMO.

G., Benners, E., Shinohara, M. L. Inflammation induced by innate immunity influences the development of T cell-mediated autoimmunity in multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found that strong activation of innate immunity induced Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-independent and interferon- (IFN)-resistant EAE (termed type B EAE), whereas EAE induced by weak activation of innate immunity requires the NLRP3 inflammasome and is sensitive to IFN treatment. Instead, an alternative inflammatory mechanism, including membrane-bound lymphotoxin- receptor (LTR) and CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), is involved in type B EAE development, and type B EAE is ameliorated by antagonizing these receptors. Relative expression of Ltbr and Cxcr2 genes was indeed enhanced in patients with IFN-resistant multiple sclerosis. Remission was minimal in type B EAE due to neuronal damages induced by semaphorin 6B upregulation on CD4(+) T cells.

In this second of a 2-part article, we present further perspectives regarding the pathogenesis of NMO/SD and how this disease might be amenable to emerging technologies aimed at restoring immune tolerance to disease-implicated self-antigens. NMO/SD appears to be particularly well-suited for these strategies since aquaporin-4 has already been identified as the dominant autoantigen. The recent technical advances in reintroducing immune tolerance in experimental models of disease as well as in humans should encourage quantum leaps in this area that may prove productive for novel therapy. In this part of the article series, the potential for regulatory T and B cells is brought into focus, as are new approaches to oral tolerization. Finally, a roadmap is provided to help identify potential issues in clinical development and guide applications in tolerization therapy to solving NMO/SD through the use of emerging technologies. Each of these perspectives is intended to shine new light on potential cures for NMO/SD and other autoimmune diseases, while sparing normal host defense mechanisms. Restoring immune tolerance in neuromyelitis optica Part I Steinman, L., Bar-Or, A., Behne, J. M., Benitez-Ribas, D., Chin, P. S., Clare-Salzler, M., Healey, D., Kim, J. I., Kranz, D. M., Lutterotti, A., Martin, R., Schippling, S., Villoslada, P., Wei, C., Weiner, H. L., Zamvil, S. S., Yeaman, M. R., Smith, T. J., Guthy-Jackson Charitable Fdn Int Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and spectrum disorder (NMO/SD) represent a vexing process and its clinical variants appear to have at their pathogenic core the loss of immune tolerance to the aquaporin-4 water channel protein. This process results in a characteristic pattern of astrocyte dysfunction, loss, and demyelination that predominantly affects the spinal cord and optic nerves. Although several empirical therapies are currently used in the treatment of NMO/SD, none has been proven effective in prospective, adequately powered, randomized trials. Furthermore, most of the current therapies subject patients to long-term immunologic suppression that can cause serious infections and development of cancers. The following is the first of a 2-part description of several key immune mechanisms in NMO/SD that might be amenable to therapeutic restoration of immune tolerance. It is intended to provide a roadmap for how potential immune tolerance restorative techniques might be applied to patients with NMO/SD. This initial installment provides a background rationale underlying attempts at immune tolerization. It provides specific examples of innovative approaches that have emerged recently as a consequence of technical advances. In several autoimmune diseases, these strategies have been reduced to practice. Therefore, in theory, the identification of aquaporin-4 as the dominant autoantigen makes NMO/SD an ideal candidate for the development of tolerizing therapies or cures for this increasingly recognized disease. Genetic background modulates outcome of therapeutic amyloid peptides in treatment of neuroinflammation Kraus, A., Race, B., Phillips, K., Winkler, C., Saturday, G., Kurnellas, M., Rothbard, J. B., Groveman, B. R., Steinman, L., Caughey, B. Amyloid hexapeptide molecules are effective in the treatment of the murine model of neuroinflammation, known as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Efficacy however differs between two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J (B6) and C57BL/10SnJ (B10). Amyloid hexapeptide treatments improved the clinical outcomes of B6, but not B10 mice, indicating that genetic background influences therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, although previous studies indicated that prion protein deficiency results in more severe EAE in B6 mice, we observed no such effect in B10 mice. In addition, we found that amyloid hexapeptide treatments of B10 and B6 mice elicited differential IL4 responses. Thus, the modulatory potential of prion protein and related treatments with other amyloid hexapeptides in EAE depends on mouse strain.

G., Marshall, P. L., Gebe, J. A., Ishak, H. D., Keswani, S. G., Bollyky, J., Frymoyer, A. R., Wight, T. N., Steinman, L., Bollyky, P. L. Recently, there has been considerable interest in using 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) to inhibit hyaluronan synthesis in mouse models of cancer, autoimmunity, and a variety of other inflammatory disorders where hyaluronan (HA) has been implicated in disease pathogenesis. In order to facilitate future studies in this area, we have examined the dosing, treatment route, treatment duration, and metabolism of 4-MU in both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. Mice fed chow containing 5% 4-MU, a dose calculated to deliver 250 mg/mouse/day, initially lose substantial weight but typically resume normal weight gain after one week. It also takes up to a week to see a reduction in serum HA in these animals, indicating that at least a one-week loading period on the drug is required for most protocols. At steady state, over 90% of the drug is present in plasma as the glucuronidated metabolite 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide (4-MUG), with the sulfated metabolite, 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate (4-MUS) comprising most of the remainder. Chow containing 5% but not 0.65% 4-MU was effective at preventing disease in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis as well as in the DORmO mouse model of autoimmune diabetes. While oral 4-MU was effective at preventing EAE, daily intraperitoneal injections of 4-MU were not. Factors potentially affecting 4-MU uptake and plasma concentrations in mice include its taste, short half-life and low bioavailability. These studies provide a practical resource for implementing oral 4-MU treatment protocols in mice. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

View details for CEACAM1 mediates B cell aggregation in central nervous system autoimmunity Rovituso, D. M., Scheffler, L., Wunsch, M., Kleinschnitz, C., Doerck, S., Ulzheimer, J., Bayas, A., Steinman, L., Erguen, S., Kuerten, S. B cell aggregates in the central nervous system (CNS) have been associated with rapid disease progression in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we demonstrate a key role of carcinoembryogenic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule1 (CEACAM1) in B cell aggregate formation in MS patients and a B cell-dependent mouse model of MS. CEACAM1 expression was increased on peripheral blood B cells and CEACAM1(+) B cells were present in brain infiltrates of MS patients. Administration of the anti-CEACAM1 antibody T84.1 was efficient in blocking aggregation of B cells derived from MS patients. Along these lines, application of the monoclonal anti-CEACAM1 antibody mCC1 was able to inhibit CNS B cell aggregate formation and significantly attenuated established MS-like disease in mice in the absence of any adverse effects. CEACAM1 was co-expressed with the regulator molecule T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain -3 (TIM-3) on B cells, a novel molecule that has recently been described to induce anergy in T cells. Interestingly, elevated coexpression on B cells coincided with an autoreactive T helper cell phenotype in MS patients. Overall, these data identify CEACAM1 as a clinically highly interesting target in MS pathogenesis and open new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of the disease. Beginning of the end of two-stage theory purporting that inflammation then degeneration explains pathogenesis of progressive multiple sclerosis The review discusses future directions in research on multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica, as long-held beliefs about these diseases are undermined with data from recent clinical trials.Results of clinical trials for registration (phase 3) were reported in the last year. Anti-inflammatory approaches, such as daclizumab high-yield process targeting IL-2 receptor, and ocrelizumab targeting CD20 B cells, confirmed a beneficial role of immune suppression in relapsing-remitting disease. And now for the first time achieving the primary end point in primary progressive multiple sclerosis was attained with ocrelizumab.The results in the past year challenge the long-held belief that relapsing-remitting disease is inflammatory, whereas progressive forms of the disease are 'less inflammatory' and more 'degenerative.'

D., Tangsombatvisit, S., Haynes, W. A., Diep, V., Steinman, L., Faix, J., Utz, P. J. Type I interferon (IFN) signaling is a central pathogenic pathway in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and therapeutics targeting type I IFN signaling are in development. Multiple proteins with overlapping functions play a role in IFN signaling, but the signaling events downstream of receptor engagement are unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate the roles of the type I and type II IFN signaling components IFN-// receptor 2 (IFNAR-2), IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF-9), and STAT-1 in a mouse model of SLE.We used immunohistochemical staining and highly multiplexed assays to characterize pathologic changes in histology, autoantibody production, cytokine/chemokine profiles, and STAT phosphorylation in order to investigate the individual roles of IFNAR-2, IRF-9, and STAT-1 in MRL/lpr mice.We found that STAT-1(-/-) mice, but not IRF-9(-/-) or IFNAR-2(-/-) mice, developed interstitial nephritis characterized by infiltration with retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor t-positive lymphocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils. Despite pronounced interstitial kidney disease and abnormal kidney function, STAT-1(-/-) mice had decreased proteinuria, glomerulonephritis, and autoantibody production. Phosphospecific flow cytometry revealed shunting of STAT phosphorylation from STAT-1 to STAT-3/4.We describe unique contributions of STAT-1 to pathology in different kidney compartments in a mouse model, and provide potentially novel insight into tubulointerstitial nephritis, a poorly understood complication that predicts end-stage kidney disease in SLE patients.

To evaluate serum cytokine profiles for their utility to determine the heterogeneous responses to interferon (IFN)- treatment in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).Patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or clinically isolated syndrome receiving de novo IFN- treatment were included in this prospective, observational study. Number of relapses and changes in disability were assessed 2 years prior to and 2 years after initiation of treatment. Sera were collected at baseline and after 3 months on therapy. Cytokine levels in sera were assessed by Luminex multiplex assays. Baseline cytokine profiles were grouped by hierarchical clustering analysis. Demographic features, changes in cytokines, and clinical outcome were then assessed in the clustered patient groups.A total of 157 patients were included in the study and clustered into 6 distinct subsets by baseline cytokine profiles. These subsets differed significantly in their clinical and biological response to IFN- therapy. Two subsets were associated with patients who responded poorly to therapy. Two other subsets, associated with a good response to therapy, showed a significant reduction in relapse rates and no worsening of disability. Each subset also had differential changes in cytokine levels after 3 months of IFN- treatment.There is heterogeneity in the immunologic pathways of the RRMS population, which correlates with IFN- response. Anti-Insulin Immune Responses Are Detectable in Dogs with Spontaneous Diabetes Kim, J., Furrow, E., Ritt, M. G., Utz, P. J., Robinson, W. H., Yu, L., Eckert, A., Stuebner, K., O'Brien, T. D., Steinman, L., Modiano, J. F. Diabetes mellitus occurs spontaneously in dogs. Although canine diabetes shares many features with human type-1 diabetes, there are differences that have cast doubt on the immunologic origin of the canine disease. In this study, we examined whether peripheral immune responses directed against islet antigens were present in dogs with diabetes. Routine diagnostics were used to confirm diabetic status, and serum samples from dogs with (N = 15) and without (N = 15) diabetes were analyzed for the presence of antibodies against islet antigens (insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, insulinoma-associated protein tyrosine phosphatase, and islet beta-cell zinc cation efflux transporter) using standard radioassays. Interferon- production from peripheral blood T cells stimulated by porcine insulin and by human insulin was tested using Elispot assays. Anti-insulin antibodies were detectable in a subset of diabetic dogs receiving insulin therapy. Pre-activated T cells and incipient insulin-reactive T cells in response to porcine or human insulin were identified in non-diabetic dogs and in dogs with diabetes. The data show that humoral and cellular anti-insulin immune responses are detectable in dogs with diabetes. This in turn provides support for the potential to ethically use dogs with diabetes to study the therapeutic potential of antigen-specific tolerance. The Safety of Adjuvanted Vaccines Revisited: Vaccine-Induced Narcolepsy Ahmed, S. S., Montomoli, E., Pasini, F. L., Steinman, L. Despite the very high benefit-to-risk ratio of vaccines, the fear of negative side effects has discouraged many people from getting vaccinated, resulting in the reemergence of previously controlled diseases such as measles, pertussis and diphtheria. This fear has been amplified more recently by multiple epidemiologic studies that confirmed the link of an AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine (Pandemrix, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Germany) used in Europe during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [A(H1N1) pdm09] with the development of narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder, in children and adolescents. However, public misperceptions of what adjuvants are and why they are used in vaccines has created in some individuals a closed ""black box"" attitude towards all vaccines. The focus of this review article is to revisit this ""black box"" using the example of narcolepsy associated with the European AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine. View details for Multiplexed autoantigen microarrays identify HLA as a key driver of anti-desmoglein and -non-desmoglein reactivities in pemphigus PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Sajda, T., Hazelton, J., Patel, M., Seiffert-Sinha, K., Steinman, L., Robinson, W., Haab, B. B., Sinha, A. A. Patients with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) harbor antibodies reactive against self-antigens expressed at the surface of keratinocytes, primarily desmoglein (Dsg) 3 and, to a lesser extent, Dsg1. Conventionally, only antibodies targeting these molecules have been thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis. This notion has been challenged by a growing pool of evidence that suggests that antibodies toward additional targets may play a role in disease. The aims of this study were to (i) establish high-throughput protein microarray technology as a method to investigate traditional and putative autoantibodies (autoAbs) in PV and (ii) use multiplexed protein array technology to define the scope and specificity of the autoAb response in PV. Our analysis demonstrated significant IgG reactivity in patients with PV toward the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes 3, 4, and 5 as well as thyroid peroxidase. Furthermore, we found that healthy first- and second-degree relatives of patients with PV express autoAbs toward desmoglein and non-Dsg targets. Our analysis also identified genetic elements, particularly HLA, as key drivers of autoAb expression. Finally, we show that patients with PV exhibit significantly reduced IgM reactivity toward disease-associated antigens relative to controls. The use of protein microarrays to profile the autoAb response in PV advanced the current understanding of disease and provided insight into the complex relationship between genetics and disease development. Hyaluronan synthesis is necessary for autoreactive T-cell trafficking, activation, and Th1 polarization. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Kuipers, H. F., Rieck, M., Gurevich, I., Nagy, N., Butte, M. J., Negrin, R. S., Wight, T. N., Steinman, L., Bollyky, P. L. The extracellular matrix polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) accumulates at sites of autoimmune inflammation, including white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS), but its functional importance in pathogenesis is unclear. We have evaluated the impact of 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), an oral inhibitor of HA synthesis, on disease progression in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. Treatment with 4-MU decreases the incidence of EAE, delays its onset, and reduces the severity of established disease. 4-MU inhibits the activation of autoreactive T cells and prevents their polarization toward a Th1 phenotype. Instead, 4-MU promotes polarization toward a Th2 phenotpye and induction of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. Further, 4-MU hastens trafficking of T cells through secondary lymphoid organs, impairs the infiltration of T cells into the CNS parenchyma, and limits astrogliosis. Together, these data suggest that HA synthesis is necessary for disease progression in EAE and that treatment with 4-MU may be a potential therapeutic strategy in CNS autoimmunity. Considering that 4-MU is already a therapeutic, called hymecromone, that is approved to treat biliary spasm in humans, we propose that it could be repurposed to treat MS.

To study the safety profile and characterize the immunologic effects of high- vs low-dose cholecalciferol supplementation in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).In this double-blind, single-center randomized pilot study, 40 patients with relapsing-remitting MS were randomized to receive 10,400 IU or 800 IU cholecalciferol daily for 6 months. Assessments were performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months.Mean increase of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels from baseline to final visit was larger in the high-dose group (34.9 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] 25.0-44.7 ng/mL) than in the low-dose group (6.9 ng/mL; 95% CI 1.0-13.7 ng/mL). Adverse events were minor and did not differ between the 2 groups. Two relapses occurred, one in each treatment arm. In the high-dose group, we found a reduction in the proportion of interleukin-17(+)CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.016), CD161(+)CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.03), and effector memory CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.021) with a concomitant increase in the proportion of central memory CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.018) and naive CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.04). These effects were not observed in the low-dose group.Cholecalciferol supplementation with 10,400 IU daily is safe and tolerable in patients with MS and exhibits in vivo pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects in MS, which include reduction of interleukin-17 production by CD4(+) T cells and decreased proportion of effector memory CD4(+) T cells with concomitant increase in central memory CD4(+) T cells and naive CD4(+) T cells.This study provides Class I evidence that cholecalciferol supplementation with 10,400 IU daily is safe and well-tolerated in patients with MS and exhibits in vivo pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects. Identification of Candidate Tolerogenic CD8(+) T Cell Epitopes for Therapy of Type 1 Diabetes in the NOD Mouse Model. Yu, C., Burns, J. C., Robinson, W. H., Utz, P. J., Ho, P. P., Steinman, L., Frey, A. B. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells are the target of self-reactive B and T cells. T cells reactive with epitopes derived from insulin and/or IGRP are critical for the initiation and maintenance of disease, but T cells reactive with other islet antigens likely have an essential role in disease progression. We sought to identify candidate CD8(+) T cell epitopes that are pathogenic in type 1 diabetes. Proteins that elicit autoantibodies in human type 1 diabetes were analyzed by predictive algorithms for candidate epitopes. Using several different tolerizing regimes using synthetic peptides, two new predicted tolerogenic CD8(+) T cell epitopes were identified in the murine homolog of the major human islet autoantigen zinc transporter ZnT8 (aa 158-166 and 282-290) and one in a non- cell protein, dopamine -hydroxylase (aa 233-241). Tolerizing vaccination of NOD mice with a cDNA plasmid expressing full-length proinsulin prevented diabetes, whereas plasmids encoding ZnT8 and DH did not. However, tolerizing vaccination of NOD mice with the proinsulin plasmid in combination with plasmids expressing ZnT8 and DH decreased insulitis and enhanced prevention of disease compared to vaccination with the plasmid encoding proinsulin alone.

Tissue Transglutaminase contributes to experimental multiple sclerosis pathogenesis and clinical outcome by promoting macrophage migration van Strien, M. E., de Vries, H. E., Chrobok, N. L., Bol, J. G., Breve, J. J., van der Pol, S. M., Kooij, G., van Buul, J. D., Karpuj, M., Steinman, L., Wilhelmus, M. M., Sestito, C., Drukarch, B., Van Dam, A. Multiple sclerosis is a serious neurological disorder, resulting in e.g., sensory, motor and cognitive deficits. A critical pathological aspect of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the influx of immunomodulatory cells into the central nervous system (CNS). Identification of key players that regulate cellular trafficking into the CNS may lead to the development of more selective treatment to halt this process. The multifunctional enzyme tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) can participate in various inflammation-related processes, and is known to be expressed in the CNS. In the present study, we question whether TG2 activity contributes to the pathogenesis of experimental MS, and could be a novel therapeutic target. In human post-mortem material, we showed the appearance of TG2 immunoreactivity in leukocytes in MS lesions, and particular in macrophages in rat chronic-relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (cr-EAE), an experimental MS model. Clinical deficits as observed in mouse EAE were reduced in TG2 knock-out mice compared to littermate wild-type mice, supporting a role of TG2 in EAE pathogenesis. To establish if the enzyme TG2 represents an attractive therapeutic target, cr-EAE rats were treated with TG2 activity inhibitors during ongoing disease. Reduction of TG2 activity in cr-EAE animals dramatically attenuated clinical deficits and demyelination. The mechanism underlying these beneficial effects pointed toward a reduction in macrophage migration into the CNS due to attenuated cytoskeletal flexibility and RhoA GTPase activity. Moreover, iNOS and TNF levels were selectively reduced in the CNS of cr-EAE rats treated with a TG2 activity inhibitor, whereas other relevant inflammatory mediators were not affected in CNS or spleen by reducing TG2 activity. We conclude that modulating TG2 activity opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention in MS which does not affect peripheral levels of inflammatory mediators.

This region of EPO has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Use of a peptide sequence from this region provides the potential for an effective therapeutic without effects on erythropoiesis. The re-emergence of antigen-specific tolerance as a potential therapy for MS Ideal therapy for inflammatory disease in the nervous system would preserve normal immune function, while suppressing only the pathologic immune responses that damage tissue and allowing for repair. In principle, antigen-specific therapy would eradicate unwanted adaptive immune responses-antibody and T-cell mediated--while preserving the integrity of other adaptive responses to infectious agents and retaining the ability to fight malignancy. However, at this time, for multiple sclerosis (MS) we do not have compelling evidence that would support any particular dominant immune response to any specific antigen or even a limited group of antigens. In fact, there are adaptive immune responses to a wide swathe of proteins and lipids found on neurons and myelin in MS. Unless controlling a few of the known immune responses is sufficient, antigen-specific therapy in MS may not have enough of an impact to modulate clinical outcome. However, in other neuroinflammatory conditions, such as neuromyelitis optica, the adaptive immune response is highly focused. Trials of antigen-specific therapy for neuroinflammatory disease might first be tested in diseases with a more limited adaptive immune response like neuromyelitis optica. The likelihood of a significant success for this therapeutic strategy might then ensue.

C., Newell, E. W., Nolan, G., Ansel, K. M., Davis, M. M., Steinman, L., Chen, C. Understanding the consequences of tuning TCR signaling on selection, peripheral T cell function, and tolerance in the context of native TCR repertoires may provide insight into the physiological control of tolerance. In this study, we show that genetic ablation of a natural tuner of TCR signaling, mir-181a-1/b-1, in double-positive thymocytes dampened TCR and Erk signaling and increased the threshold of positive selection. Whereas mir-181a-1/b-1 deletion in mice resulted in an increase in the intrinsic reactivity of naive T cells to self-antigens, it did not cause spontaneous autoimmunity. Loss of mir-181a-1/b-1 dampened the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and reduced basal TCR signaling in peripheral T cells and their migration from lymph nodes to pathogenic sites. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tolerance can be modulated by microRNA gene products through the control of opposing activities in T cell selection and peripheral T cell function. View details for HDL-bound sphingosine-1-phosphate restrains lymphopoiesis and neuroinflammation. Blaho, V. A., Galvani, S., Engelbrecht, E., Liu, C., Swendeman, S. L., Kono, M., Proia, R. L., Steinman, L., Han, M. H., Hla, T. Lipid mediators influence immunity in myriad ways. For example, circulating sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a key regulator of lymphocyte egress. Although the majority of plasma S1P is bound to apolipoprotein M (ApoM) in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle, the immunological functions of the ApoM-S1P complex are unknown. Here we show that ApoM-S1P is dispensable for lymphocyte trafficking yet restrains lymphopoiesis by activating the S1P1 receptor on bone marrow lymphocyte progenitors. Mice that lacked ApoM (Apom(-/-)) had increased proliferation of Lin(-) Sca-1(+) cKit(+) haematopoietic progenitor cells (LSKs) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) in bone marrow. Pharmacological activation or genetic overexpression of S1P1 suppressed LSK and CLP cell proliferation in vivo. ApoM was stably associated with bone marrow CLPs, which showed active S1P1 signalling in vivo. Moreover, ApoM-bound S1P, but not albumin-bound S1P, inhibited lymphopoiesis in vitro. Upon immune stimulation, Apom(-/-) mice developed more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, characterized by increased lymphocytes in the central nervous system and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Thus, the ApoM-S1P-S1P1 signalling axis restrains the lymphocyte compartment and, subsequently, adaptive immune responses. Unique biological functions imparted by specific S1P chaperones could be exploited for novel therapeutic opportunities.

To investigate the potential role of prokineticin 2 (PK2), a bioactive peptide involved in multiple biological functions including immune modulation, in CNS autoimmune demyelinating disease.We investigated the expression of PK2 in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), and in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. We evaluated the biological effects of PK2 on expression of EAE and on development of T-cell response against myelin by blocking PK2 in vivo with PK2 receptor antagonists. We treated with PK2 immune cells activated against myelin antigen to explore the immune-modulating effects of this peptide in vitro.Pk2 messenger RNA was upregulated in spinal cord and lymph node cells (LNCs) of mice with EAE. PK2 protein was expressed in EAE inflammatory infiltrates and was increased in sera during EAE. In patients with relapsing-remitting MS, transcripts for PK2 were significantly increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with healthy controls, and PK2 serum concentrations were significantly higher. A PK2 receptor antagonist prevented or attenuated established EAE in chronic and relapsing-remitting models, reduced CNS inflammation and demyelination, and decreased the production of interferon (IFN)- and interleukin (IL)-17A cytokines in LNCs while increasing IL-10. PK2 in vitro increased IFN- and IL-17A and reduced IL-10 in splenocytes activated against myelin antigen.These data suggest that PK2 is a critical immune regulator in CNS autoimmune demyelination and may represent a new target for therapy. Cerebrospinal Fluid Aquaporin-4 Antibody Levels in Neuromyelitis Optica Attacks Sato, D. K., Callegaro, D., Jorge, F. H., Nakashima, I., Nishiyama, S., Takahashi, T., Simm, R.

Y., Steinman, L. Natalizumab treatment alters peripheral CD4 cells counts in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, providing a way to monitor the pharmacodynamic effects of the drug. The study was undertaken to assess whether CD4 cell counts correlate with different phases of natalizumab treatment of relapsing MS patients, including during a 12-week planned treatment interruption, and whether that might provide insights on lymphocyte trafficking. Clinical outcomes, MRI data, and CD4 cell counts were assessed at baseline prior to initiating natalizumab, while on regular dosing, at the end of the 12-week extended dosing interval, and at the time of reinitiation of natalizumab. The 12-week interruption was well tolerated and not associated with return of MS activity, disability progression, or new or worsened MRI data. Observed significant shifts in CD4 counts - dramatically increasing from the baseline while on treatment and decreasing back to the baseline level off treatment, then rising in a similar manner on natalizumab reinitiation, suggest that these measurements may aid in monitoring modulation of lymphocyte trafficking and cell redistribution. IFN- Treatment Requires B Cells for Efficacy in Neuroautoimmunity. Schubert, R. D., Hu, Y., Kumar, G., Szeto, S., Abraham, P., Winderl, J., Guthridge, J. M., Pardo, G., Dunn, J., Steinman, L., Axtell, R. C. IFN- remains the most widely prescribed treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Despite widespread use of IFN-, the therapeutic mechanism is still partially understood. Particularly, the clinical relevance of increased B cell activity during IFN- treatment is unclear. In this article, we show that IFN- pushes some B cells into a transitional, regulatory population that is a critical mechanism for therapy. IFN- treatment increases the absolute number of regulatory CD19(+)CD24(++)CD38(++) transitional B cells in peripheral blood relative to treatment-naive and Copaxone-treated patients. In addition, we found that transitional B cells from both healthy controls and IFN--treated MS patients are potent producers of IL-10, and that the capability of IFN- to induce IL-10 is amplified when B cells are stimulated. Similar changes are seen in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. IFN- treatment increases transitional and regulatory B cell populations, as well as IL-10 secretion in the spleen. Furthermore, we found that IFN- increases autoantibody production, implicating humoral immune activation in B cell regulatory responses. Finally, we demonstrate that IFN- therapy requires immune-regulatory B cells by showing that B cell-deficient mice do not benefit clinically or histopathologically from IFN- treatment. These results have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Prolactin: A versatile regulator of inflammation and autoimmune pathology Costanza, M., Binart, N., Steinman, L., Pedotti, R. Prolactin (PRL) has long been proposed as an immune-stimulating and detrimental factor in autoimmune disorders. However, recent findings have challenged this common view, showing that PRL does not play a crucial role in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, animal model for multiple sclerosis (MS), and even protects against adjuvant-induced model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this review we provide a critical overview of data supporting a role for PRL in the regulation of immune responses. In addition, we focus on studies exploring the involvement of PRL in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, MS and RA, in light of the recently-outlined regenerative properties of this hormone. View details for B-Lymphocyte-Mediated Delayed Cognitive Impairment following Stroke. Doyle, K. P., Quach, L. N., Sol, M., Axtell, R. C., Nguyen, T. V., Soler-Llavina, G. J., Jurado, S., Han, J., Steinman, L., Longo, F. M., Schneider, J. A., Malenka, R. C., Buckwalter, M. S. Each year, 10 million people worldwide survive the neurologic injury associated with a stroke. Importantly, stroke survivors have more than twice the risk of subsequently developing dementia compared with people who have never had a stroke. The link between stroke and the later development of dementia is not understood. There are reports of oligoclonal bands in the CSF of stroke patients, suggesting that in some people a B-lymphocyte response to stroke may occur in the CNS. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that a B-lymphocyte response to stroke could contribute to the onset of dementia. We discovered that, in mouse models, activated B-lymphocytes infiltrate infarcted tissue in the weeks after stroke. B-lymphocytes undergo isotype switching, and IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies are found in the neuropil adjacent to the lesion. Concurrently, mice develop delayed deficits in LTP and cognition. Genetic deficiency, and the pharmacologic ablation of B-lymphocytes using an anti-CD20 antibody, prevents the appearance of delayed cognitive deficits. Furthermore, immunostaining of human postmortem tissue revealed that a B-lymphocyte response to stroke also occurs in the brain of some people with stroke and dementia. These data suggest that some stroke patients may develop a B-lymphocyte response to stroke that contributes to dementia, and is potentially treatable with FDA-approved drugs that target B cells. View details for Role reversal: infiltrating T cells protect the brain Inflammatory conditions intensify and then resolve, often sparing and recovering some of the injured tissue. While the ebb and flow of inflammation can be followed in many tissues, there is not a great deal of information on how inflammation regresses in the brain. In this issue of the JCI, Walsh, Hendrix, and colleagues illuminate a cellular mechanism whereby T cells that infiltrate the brain after nerve crush or contusion actually protect neurons from injury. These infiltrating T cells produce IL-4 and do so independently of a classic adaptive T cell immune response. The T cells respond to mediators produced by damaged neurons, without the classic three-way interaction among antigen, the major histocompatibility complex, and the T cell receptor. After brain injury, these protective T cells produce IL-4, which attenuates damage via IL-4 receptors on neurons. View details for A century of pavlovian experiments forming a circuit from the elucidation of neural reflexes to pharmaceuticals and electroceuticals to treat diseases The re-emergence of antigen-specific tolerance as a potential therapy for MS. Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England) Ideal therapy for inflammatory disease in the nervous system would preserve normal immune function, while suppressing only the pathologic immune responses that damage tissue and allowing for repair. In principle, antigen-specific therapy would eradicate unwanted adaptive immune responses-antibody and T-cell mediated--while preserving the integrity of other adaptive responses to infectious agents and retaining the ability to fight malignancy. However, at this time, for multiple sclerosis (MS) we do not have compelling evidence that would support any particular dominant immune response to any specific antigen or even a limited group of antigens. In fact, there are adaptive immune responses to a wide swathe of proteins and lipids found on neurons and myelin in MS. Unless controlling a few of the known immune responses is sufficient, antigen-specific therapy in MS may not have enough of an impact to modulate clinical outcome. However, in other neuroinflammatory conditions, such as neuromyelitis optica, the adaptive immune response is highly focused. Trials of antigen-specific therapy for neuroinflammatory disease might first be tested in diseases with a more limited adaptive immune response like neuromyelitis optica. The likelihood of a significant success for this therapeutic strategy might then ensue. THE AMYLOIDOGENIC HEXAPEPTIDE, AMYLIN 28-33, AMELIORATES SEPSIS Mahapatra, S., Kurnellas, M., Rothbard, J., Steinman, L. View details for Self-Assembling Peptides Form Immune Suppressive Amyloid Fibrils Effective in Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis. Amyloidogenic proteins have long been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. However, amyloid fibrils composed of six amino acids are protective in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, decrease in the number of inflammatory foci in the parenchyma and meninges of the brain and spinal cord, and amelioration of the neurological signs of EAE when amyloid fibril-forming hexapeptides are administered reveal that some fibrils provide benefit. The therapeutic activity of the amyloid fibrils arise from diverse pathways that include binding of pro-inflammatory mediators in the plasma, reduction of IL-6, TNF-, and IFN- levels, and induction of type 1 interferon (IFN). Type 1 IFN has been used widely as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of MS and has been shown to be therapeutic in EAE with adoptive transfer of Th1 lymphocytes. However, type 1 IFN is known to exacerbate EAE with adoptive transfer of Th17 lymphocytes. Indeed, the amyloid fibril-forming peptide Tau 623-628 was therapeutic in Th1 adoptively transferred EAE, but ineffective in Th17 adoptively transferred EAE. However, the therapeutic effect of Tau 623-628 was restored in IFN-/ receptor (IFNAR) knockout mice, indicating that other immune pathways independent of type 1 IFN induction play a role in the amelioration of EAE. Moreover, Amylin 28-33, a polar, non-ionizable peptide that does not form fibrils as rapidly as Tau 623-628, induces a small fraction of type 1 IFN compared to Tau 623-628 and is therapeutic in Th17 EAE. The diverse immunological pathways modulated by the self-assembling hexapeptides are under investigation with a goal to develop novel, safe, and potent therapeutics for neuroinflammation. Gene expression analysis of histamine receptors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with clinically-isolated syndrome and different stages of multiple sclerosis Costanza, M., Di Dario, M., Steinman, L., Farina, C., Pedotti, R. Along with their established role in allergic reactions, histamine and its receptors have been implicated in the pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. In this study we analyzed the gene expression of histamine receptor 1 (HRH1), HRH2 and HRH4 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting (RR) MS, secondary-progressive (SP) MS, primary-progressive (PP) MS, and healthy controls (HC). We found that HRH1 transcript was significantly down-modulated in SP-MS compared with HC, and HRH4 was increased in this group compared to HC, CIS and RR-MS. No other differences in the expression of histamine receptors were observed between HC, CIS and other clinical forms of definite MS.

Their application of the animal model, known as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), for the discovery of Copaxone, opened a new path for testing of drug candidates in MS. By measuring clinical, pathologic, and immunologic outcomes, the biological implications of new drugs could be elucidated. Using EAE they established the efficacy of Copaxone as a therapy for preventing and reducing paralysis and inflammation in the central nervous system without massive immune suppression. This had a huge impact on the field of drug discovery for MS. Much like the use of parabiosis to discover soluble factors associated with obesity, or the replica plating system to probe antibiotic resistance in bacteria, the pioneering research on Copaxone using the EAE model, paved the way for the discovery of other therapeutics in MS, including Natalizumab and Fingolimod. Future applications of this approach may well elucidate novel therapies for the neurodegenerative phase of multiple sclerosis associated with disease progression. View details for Conflicting consequences of immunity to cancer versus autoimmunity to neurons: Insights from paraneoplastic disease Immunologists are well aware that cancer regression and increased patient survival with the use of checkpoint inhibitors, such as ipilimumab, an antibody directed against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, CTLA-4 (CD152), is accompanied by concomitant autoimmunity. For over 30 years, a small group of investigators have shown that the rare paraneoplastic syndromes are caused by immunity to shared antigens found on both tumors and on components of the nervous system. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, Blachre et al. [Eur. J. Immunol. 2014. 44: 3240-3251] elucidate some of the molecular mechanisms underlying the tolerance to neuronal antigens which share epitopes with oncologic antigens, observed in the context of paraneoplastic syndromes in mice. The presence of the shared tumor antigen on a nonhematopoietic cell underlies the basis for a certain level of tolerance in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, preventing these cells from attacking the brain, but allowing them to lyse the tumor upon transfer into tumor-bearing recipient mice. Comparisons between the paraneoplastic syndromes and the new autoimmune conditions seen with antibodies to immune checkpoints at CD152 or at CD279 are likely to illuminate shared mechanisms and solutions to these vexing diseases.

The most significant developments in neuroimmunology will involve explorations of the roles for the immune system in neurodegenerative conditions often associated with the presence of amyloid deposits. Here I present my personal perspectives on four of the most intriguing challenges that we face in the future of neuroimmunology: (1) Why are the traditional hallmarks of innate and adaptive inflammation conspicuously absent from brains of individuals with prion disease and amyloid pathology? (2) What is the role of adaptive and innate immunity in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis? (3) Is molecular mimicry an adequate explanation for the initiation of neuroinflammatory disease and for exacerbations in conditions like multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, and neuromyelitis optica? (4) Do neural pathways regulate inflammatory diseases outside the nervous system? View details for Thymic Epithelium Determines a Spontaneous Chronic Neuritis in Icam1(tm1Jcgr)NOD Mice Horste, G. M., Mausberg, A. K., Cordes, S., El-Haddad, H., Partke, H., Leussink, V. I., Roden, M., Martin, S., Steinman, L., Hartung, H., Kieseier, B. C. The NOD mouse strain spontaneously develops autoimmune diabetes. A deficiency in costimulatory molecules, such as B7-2, on the NOD genetic background prevents diabetes but instead triggers an inflammatory peripheral neuropathy. This constitutes a shift in the target of autoimmunity, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that NOD mice deficient for isoforms of ICAM-1, which comediate costimulatory functions, spontaneously develop a chronic autoimmune peripheral neuritis instead of diabetes. The disease is transferred by CD4(+) T cells, which infiltrate peripheral nerves together with macrophages and B cells and are autoreactive against peripheral myelin protein zero. These Icam1(tm1Jcgr)NOD mice exhibit unaltered numbers of regulatory T cells, but increased IL-17-producing T cells, which determine the severity, but not the target specificity, of autoimmunity. Ab-mediated ICAM-1 blockade triggers neuritis only in young NOD mice. Thymic epithelium from Icam1(tm1Jcgr)NOD mice features an altered expression of costimulatory molecules and induces neuritis and myelin autoreactivity after transplantation into nude mice in vivo. Icam1(tm1Jcgr)NOD mice exhibit a specifically altered TCR repertoire. Our findings introduce a novel animal model of chronic inflammatory neuropathies and indicate that altered expression of ICAM-1 on thymic epithelium shifts autoimmunity specifically toward peripheral nerves. This improves our understanding of autoimmunity in the peripheral nervous system with potential relevance for human diseases.

The CSF aquaporin-4 antibody levels during attacks (but not in sera) closely correlated with pleocytosis, inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 that can regulate antibody-producing plasmablasts, and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels in the CSF. The amount of aquaporin-4 antibodies present in the central nervous system may have therapeutic implications, as it is associated with astrocyte injury and inflammatory responses during NMOSD attacks.

In Alzheimer's Disease two amyloid molecules A A4 and tau vie for consideration as the main pathogenic culprit. But molecules obey the laws of chemistry and defy the way we categorize them as humans with our well-known proclivities to bias in our reasoning. We have been exploring the brains of multiple sclerosis patients to identify molecules that are associated with protection from inflammation and degeneration. In 2001 we noted that aB crystallin (cryab) was the most abundant transcript found in MS lesions, but not in healthy brains. Cryab can reverse paralysis and attenuate inflammation in several models of inflammation including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and various models of ischemia. Cryab is an amyloid forming molecule. We have identified a core structure common to many amyloids including amyloid protein A A4, tau, amylin, prion protein, serum amyloid protein P, and cryab. The core hexapeptide structure is highly immune suppressive and can reverse paralysis in EAE when administered systemically. Administration of this amyloid forming hexapeptide quickly lowers inflammatory cytokines in plasma like IL-6 and IL-2.

Uncovering Cryptic Glycan Markers in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) Wang, D., Bhat, R., Sobel, R. A., Huang, W., Wang, L., Olsson, T., Steinman, L. Using an integrated antigen microarray approach, we observed epitope-spreading of autoantibody responses to a variety of antigenic structures in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and in the serum of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These included previously described protein- and lipid-based antigenic targets and newly discovered autoimmunogenic sugar moieties, notably, autoantibodies specific for the oligomannoses in both MS patient CSF and the sera of mice with EAE. These glycans are often masked by other sugar moieties and belong to a class of cryptic autoantigens. We further determined that these targets are highly expressed on multiple cell types in MS and EAE lesions. Co-immunization of SJL/J mice with a Man9-KLH conjugate at the time of EAE induction elicited highly significant levels of anti-Man9-cluster autoantibodies. Nevertheless, this anti-glycan autoantibody response was associated with a significantly reduced clinical severity of EAE. The potential of these cryptic glycan markers and targeting antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions of neurological disorders has yet to be explored.

View details for Development of therapies for autoimmune disease at Stanford: a tale of multiple shots and one goal The title of this contribution on Immunology at Stanford is purposely ambiguous. One goal is the development of safe and effective therapy for autoimmune diseases. Another definition of goal is to score, and this would ultimately mean the development of an approved drug. Indeed, the efforts in my four decades at Stanford, have included the discovery and subsequent development of a monoclonal antibody to block homing to the inflamed brain, leading to natalizumab, an approved therapeutic for two autoimmune diseases: relapsing-remitting MS and for inflammatory bowel disease. Multiple attempts to develop new therapies for autoimmune disease are described here: The trimolecular complex and the immune synapse serve as one major set of targets, with attempts to inhibit particular major histocompatibility molecules, the variable regions of the T cell receptor, and CD4. Other approaches focusing on antigen-specific tolerance include ongoing attempts with tolerizing DNA vaccines in type 1 diabetes. Finally, the repurposing of popular drugs approved for other indications, including statins and inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme is under development and showing promise in the clinic, particularly for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The milieu within Stanford Immunology has helped to nurture these efforts to translate discoveries in immunology and to take them from bench to bedside. View details for Narcolepsy, 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic influenza, and pandemic influenza vaccinations: What is known and unknown about the neurological disorder, the role for autoimmunity, and vaccine adjuvants Ahmed, S. S., Schur, P. H., MacDonald, N. E., Steinman, L. The vaccine safety surveillance system effectively detected a very rare adverse event, narcolepsy, in subjects receiving AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine made using the European inactivation/purification protocol. The reports of increased cases of narcolepsy in non-vaccinated subjects infected with wild A(H1N1) pandemic influenza virus suggest a role for the viral antigen(s) in disease development. However, additional investigations are needed to better understand what factor(s) in wild influenza infection trigger(s) narcolepsy in susceptible hosts. An estimated 31 million doses of European AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine were used in more than 47 countries. The Canadian AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine was used with high coverage in Canada where an estimated 12 million doses were administered. As no similar narcolepsy association has been reported to date with the AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine made using the Canadian inactivation/purification protocol, this suggests that the AS03 adjuvant alone may not be responsible for the narcolepsy association. To date, no narcolepsy association has been reported with the MF59-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine. This review article provides a brief background on narcolepsy, outlines the different types of vaccine preparations including the ones for influenza, reviews the accumulated evidence for the safety of adjuvants, and explores the association between autoimmune diseases and natural infections. It concludes by assimilating the historical observations and recent clinical studies to formulate a feasible hypothesis on why vaccine-associated narcolepsy may not be solely linked to the AS03 adjuvant but more likely be linked to how the specific influenza antigen component of the European AS03-adjuvanted pandemic vaccine was prepared. Careful and long-term epidemiological studies of subjects who developed narcolepsy in association with AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine prepared with the European inactivation/purification protocol are needed. View details for Antiviral drug ganciclovir is a potent inhibitor of microglial proliferation and neuroinflammation. Ding, Z., Mathur, V., Ho, P. P., James, M. L., Lucin, K. M., Hoehne, A., Alabsi, H., Gambhir, S. S., Steinman, L., Luo, J., Wyss-Coray, T. Aberrant microglial responses contribute to neuroinflammation in many neurodegenerative diseases, but no current therapies target pathogenic microglia. We discovered unexpectedly that the antiviral drug ganciclovir (GCV) inhibits the proliferation of microglia in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as in kainic acid-induced excitotoxicity. In EAE, GCV largely prevented infiltration of T lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS) and drastically reduced disease incidence and severity when delivered before the onset of disease. In contrast, GCV treatment had minimal effects on peripheral leukocyte distribution in EAE and did not inhibit generation of antibodies after immunization with ovalbumin. Additionally, a radiolabeled analogue of penciclovir, [(18)F]FHBG, which is similar in structure to GCV, was retained in areas of CNS inflammation in EAE, but not in naive control mice, consistent with the observed therapeutic effects. Our experiments suggest GCV may have beneficial effects in the CNS beyond its antiviral properties. Neither T-helper type 2 nor Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells are necessary for therapeutic benefit of atorvastatin in treatment of central nervous system autoimmunity Weber, M. S., Prod'homme, T., Youssef, S., Dunn, S. E., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Oral atorvastatin has prevented or reversed paralysis in the multiple sclerosis (MS) model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and reduced development of new MS lesions in clinical trials. Besides inhibiting development of encephalitogenic T cells, atorvastatin treatment of EAE has been associated with an induction of anti-inflammatory myelin-reactive T-helper type (Th)-2 cells. To investigate the clinical significance of atorvastatin-mediated Th2 differentiation, we first evaluated atorvastatin treatment in interleukin (IL)-4 green fluorescent protein-enhanced transcript (4-GET) reporter mice. Atorvastatin treatment failed to induce IL-4-producing Th2 cells in vivo; however, when T cells from atorvastatin-treated 4-GET mice were reactivated in vitro, T cells preferentially differentiated into Th2 cells, while antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (interferon gamma, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor and IL-12) were reduced. Oral atorvastatin also prevented or reversed EAE in signal transducer and activator of transcription 6-deficient (STAT6-/-) mice, which cannot generate IL-4-producing Th2 cells. Further, atorvastatin treatment did not induce or expand Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in either wild-type or STAT6-/- mice. In vivo proliferation of T cells, as measured by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine, was inhibited in atorvastatin-treated wild-type and STAT6-/- mice. These data imply that atorvastatin ameliorates central nervous system autoimmune disease primarily by inhibiting proliferation of proinflammatory encephalitogenic T cells, and not simply through induction of anti-inflammatory Th2 cells. This cytostatic effect may be a relevant mechanism of action when considering use of statins in MS and other inflammatory conditions.

J., Lazovic, J., Housman, C., Antonetti, D. A., Koeller, D. M., Connor, J. R., Steinman, L. Metabolic stroke is the rapid onset of lasting central neurological deficit associated with decompensation of an underlying metabolic disorder. Glutaric aciduria type I (GA1) is an inherited disorder of lysine and tryptophan metabolism presenting with metabolic stroke in infancy. The clinical presentation includes bilateral striatal necrosis and spontaneous subdural and retinal hemorrhages, which has been frequently misdiagnosed as non-accidental head trauma. The mechanisms underlying metabolic stroke and spontaneous hemorrhage are poorly understood.Using a mouse model of GA1, we show that metabolic stroke progresses in the opposite sequence of ischemic stroke, with initial neuronal swelling and vacuole formation leading to cerebral capillary occlusion.

CRYAB modulates the activation of CD4(+) T cells from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients Que Lan Quach, Q. L., Metz, L. M., Thomas, J. C., Rothbard, J. B., Steinman, L., Ousman, S. S. BACKGROUND: Suppression of activation of pathogenic CD4(+) T cells is a potential therapeutic intervention in multiple sclerosis (MS). We previously showed that a small heat shock protein, CRYAB, reduced T cell proliferation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and clinical signs of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, a model of MS. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether the ability of CRYAB to reduce the activation of T cells translated to the human disease. METHODS: CD4(+) T cells from healthy controls and volunteers with MS were activated in vitro in the presence or absence of a CRYAB peptide (residues 73-92). Parameters of activation (proliferation rate, cytokine secretion) and tolerance (anergy, activation-induced cell death, microRNAs) were evaluated. RESULTS: The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by CD4(+) T cells was decreased in the presence of CRYAB in a subset of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) participants with mild disease severity while no changes were observed in healthy controls. Further, there was a correlation for higher levels of miR181a microRNA, a marker upregulated in tolerant CD8(+) T cells, in CD4(+) T cells of MS patients that displayed suppressed cytokine production (responders). CONCLUSION: CRYAB may be capable of suppressing the activation of CD4(+) T cells from a subset of RRMS patients who appear to have less disability but similar age and disease duration. View details for Clinical optimization of antigen specific modulation of type 1 diabetes with the plasmid DNA platform Gottlieb, P., Utz, P. J., Robinson, W., Steinman, L. Some clinical trials in humans have aimed at modulation of type 1 diabetes (T1D) via alteration of the immune response to putative islet cell antigens, particularly proinsulin and insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase and the peptide, DiaPep 277, derived from heat shock protein 60. The focus here is on development of a specially engineered DNA plasmid encoding proinsulin to treat T1D. The plasmid is engineered to turn off adaptive immunity to proinsulin. This approach yielded exciting results in a randomized placebo controlled trial in 80 adult patients with T1D. The implications of this trial are explored in regards to the potential for sparing inflammation in islets and thus allowing the functioning beta cells to recover and produce more insulin. Strategies to further strengthen the effects seen thus far with the tolerizing DNA plasmid to proinsulin will be elucidated. The DNA platform affords an opportunity for easy modifications. In addition standard exploration of dose levels, route of administration and frequency of dose are practical. Optimization of the effects seen to date on C-peptide and on depletion of proinsulin specific CD8 T cells are feasible, with expected concomitant improvement in other parameters like hemoglobin A1c and reduction in insulin usage. T1D is one of the few autoimmune conditions where antigen specific therapy can be achieved, provided the approach is tested intelligently. Tolerizing DNA vaccines to proinsulin and other islet cell autoantigens is a worthy pursuit to potentially treat, prevent and to perhaps even 'cure' or 'prevent' type 1 diabetes.

Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England) Van Haren, K., Tomooka, B. H., Kidd, B. A., Banwell, B., Bar-Or, A., Chitnis, T., Tenembaum, S. N., Pohl, D., Rostasy, K., Dale, R. C., O'Connor, K. C., Hafler, D. A., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) share overlapping clinical, radiologic and laboratory features at onset. Because autoantibodies may contribute to the pathogenesis of both diseases, we sought to identify autoantibody biomarkers that are capable of distinguishing them. METHODS: We used custom antigen arrays to profile anti-myelin-peptide autoantibodies in sera derived from individuals with pediatric ADEM (n = 15), pediatric multiple sclerosis (Ped MS; n = 11) and adult MS (n = 15). Using isotype-specific secondary antibodies, we profiled both IgG and IgM reactivities. We used Statistical Analysis of Microarrays software to confirm the differences in autoantibody reactivity profiles between ADEM and MS samples. We used Prediction Analysis of Microarrays software to generate and validate prediction algorithms, based on the autoantibody reactivity profiles. RESULTS: ADEM was characterized by IgG autoantibodies targeting epitopes derived from myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic glycoprotein, and alpha-B-crystallin. In contrast, MS was characterized by IgM autoantibodies targeting myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic glycoprotein and oligodendrocyte-specific protein. We generated and validated prediction algorithms that distinguish ADEM serum (sensitivity 62-86%; specificity 56-79%) from MS serum (sensitivity 40-87%; specificity 62-86%) on the basis of combined IgG and IgM anti-myelin autoantibody reactivity to a small number of myelin peptides. CONCLUSIONS: Combined profiles of serum IgG and IgM autoantibodies identified myelin antigens that may be useful for distinguishing MS from ADEM. Further studies are required to establish clinical utility. Further biological assays are required to delineate the pathogenic potential of these antibodies.

The Interdependent, Overlapping, and Differential Roles of Type I and II IFNs in the Pathogenesis of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis Naves, R., Singh, S. P., Cashman, K. S., Rowse, A. L., Axtell, R. C., Steinman, L., Mountz, J. D., Steele, C., De Sarno, P., Raman, C. Type I IFNs (IFN- and IFN-) and type II IFN (IFN-) mediate both regulation and inflammation in multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the underlying mechanism for these Janus-like activities of type I and II IFNs in neuroinflammation remains unclear. Although endogenous type I IFN signaling provides a protective response in neuroinflammation, we find that when IFN- signaling is ablated, type I IFNs drive inflammation, resulting in exacerbated EAE. IFN- has a disease stage-specific opposing function in EAE. Treatment of mice with IFN- during the initiation phase of EAE leads to enhanced severity of disease. In contrast, IFN- treatment during the effector phase attenuated disease. This immunosuppressive activity of IFN- required functional type I IFN signaling. In IFN-/ receptor-deficient mice, IFN- treatment during effector phase of EAE exacerbated disease. Using an adoptive transfer EAE model, we found that T cell-intrinsic type I and II IFN signals are simultaneously required to establish chronic EAE by encephalitogenic Th1 cells. However, in Th17 cells loss of either IFN signals leads to the development of a severe chronic disease. The data imply that type I and II IFN signals have independent but nonredundant roles in restraining encephalitogenic Th17 cells in vivo. Collectively, our data show that type I and II IFNs function in an integrated manner to regulate pathogenesis in EAE.

IMPORTANCE High serum levels of interleukin 17F (IL-17F) at baseline have been associated with suboptimal response to interferon beta in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. OBJECTIVE To further investigate the role of IL-17F in predicting treatment response to interferon beta-1b in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis using the Singulex Erenna IL-17F immunoassay. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Serum samples were analyzed from 239 randomly selected patients treated with interferon beta-1b, 250 g, for at least 2 years in the Betaferon Efficacy Yielding Outcomes of a New Dose Study. EXPOSURE Treatment with interferon beta-1b, 250 g, for at least 2 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Levels of IL-17F at baseline and month 6 as well as the difference between the IL-17F levels at month 6 and baseline were compared between the following: (1) patients with less disease activity vs more disease activity; (2) patients with no disease activity vs some disease activity; and (3) responders vs nonresponders. RESULTS Levels of IL-17F measured at baseline and month 6 did not correlate with lack of response to treatment after 2 years using clinical and magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Relapses and new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging were not associated with pretreatment serum IL-17F levels. When patients with neutralizing antibodies were excluded, the results did not change. All patients with levels of IL-17F greater than 200 pg/mL were associated with poor response with some clinical or radiological activity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE An increase of IL-17F before and early after treatment with interferon beta-1b was not associated with poor response. These data do not support the value of IL-17F as a treatment response indicator for therapy of patients with multiple sclerosis with interferon beta, although high levels of IL-17F greater than 200 pg/mL may predict nonresponsiveness. View details for Th17 cells induce Th1-polarizing monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Davidson, M. G., Alonso, M. N., Yuan, R., Axtell, R. C., Kenkel, J. A., Suhoski, M. M., Gonzlez, J. C., Steinman, L., Engleman, E. G. In chronically inflamed tissues, such as those affected by autoimmune disease, activated Th cells often colocalize with monocytes. We investigate in this study how murine Th cells influence the phenotype and function of monocytes. The data demonstrate that Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets promote the differentiation of autologous monocytes into MHC class II(+), CD11b(+), CD11c(+) DC that we call DCTh. Although all Th subsets induce the formation of DCTh, activated Th17 cells uniquely promote the formation of IL-12/IL-23-producing DCTh (DCTh17) that can polarize both naive and Th17 cells to a Th1 phenotype. In the inflamed CNS of mice with Th17-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, Th cells colocalize with DC, as well as monocytes, and the Th cells obtained from these lesions drive the formation of DCTh that are phenotypically indistinguishable from DCTh17 and polarize naive T cells toward a Th1 phenotype. These results suggest that DCTh17 are critical in the interplay of Th17- and Th1-mediated responses and may explain the previous finding that IL-17-secreting Th cells become IFN--secreting Th1 cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and other autoimmune disorders.

A., Chow, L. M., Ibrahim, A., Baker, S. J., Barres, B. A., Steinman, L., Brunet, A. Oligodendrocytes-the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system-can be regenerated during adulthood. In adults, new oligodendrocytes originate from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), but also from neural stem cells (NSCs). Although several factors supporting oligodendrocyte production have been characterized, the mechanisms underlying the generation of adult oligodendrocytes are largely unknown. Here we show that genetic inactivation of SIRT1, a protein deacetylase implicated in energy metabolism, increases the production of new OPCs in the adult mouse brain, in part by acting in NSCs. New OPCs produced following SIRT1 inactivation differentiate normally, generating fully myelinating oligodendrocytes. Remarkably, SIRT1 inactivation ameliorates remyelination and delays paralysis in mouse models of demyelinating injuries. SIRT1 inactivation leads to the upregulation of genes involved in cell metabolism and growth factor signalling, in particular PDGF receptor (PDGFR). Oligodendrocyte expansion following SIRT1 inactivation is mediated at least in part by AKT and p38 MAPK-signalling molecules downstream of PDGFR. The identification of drug-targetable enzymes that regulate oligodendrocyte regeneration in adults could facilitate the development of therapies for demyelinating injuries and diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. The gender gap in multiple sclerosis: intersection of science and society. Type I Interferons: Beneficial in Th1 and Detrimental in Th17 Autoimmunity In relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), type I interferon (IFN) is considered immuno-modulatory, and recombinant forms of IFN- are the most prescribed treatment for this disease. However, within the RRMS population, 30-50% of MS patients are nonresponsive to this treatment, and it consistently worsens neuromyelitis optica (NMO), a disease once considered to be a form of RRMS. In contrast to RRMS, type I IFNs have been shown to have properties that drive the inflammatory pathologies in many other autoimmune diseases. These diseases include Sjgren's syndrome, system lupus erythematosus (SLE), neuromyelitis optica (NMO), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis. Historically, autoimmune diseases were thought to be driven by a TH1 response to auto-antigens. However, since the discovery of the TH17 in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), it is now generally thought that TH17 plays an important role in MS and all other autoimmune diseases. In this article, we will discuss recent clinical and basic research advances in the field of autoimmunity and argue that IFN- and other type I IFNs are immuno-modulatory in diseases driven predominantly by TH1 but in contrast are inflammatory in diseases that have a predominant Th17 response.

A recent type 1 diabetes (T1D) clinical trial of rituximab (a B cell-depleting anti-CD20 antibody) achieved some therapeutic benefit in preserving C-peptide for a period of approximately nine months in patients with recently diagnosed diabetes. Our previous data in the NOD mouse demonstrated that co-administration of antigen (insulin) with anti-CD3 antibody (a T cell-directed immunomodulator) offers better protection than either entity alone, indicating that novel combination therapies that include a T1D-related autoantigen are possible. To accelerate the identification and development of novel combination therapies that can be advanced into the clinic, we have evaluated the combination of a mouse anti-CD20 antibody with either oral insulin or a proinsulin-expressing DNA vaccine. Anti-CD20 alone, given once or on 4 consecutive days, produced transient B cell depletion but did not prevent or reverse T1D in the NOD mouse. Oral insulin alone (twice weekly for 6 weeks) was also ineffective, while proinsulin DNA (weekly for up to 12 weeks) showed a trend toward modest efficacy. Combination of anti-CD20 with oral insulin was ineffective in reversing diabetes in NOD mice whose glycemia was controlled with SC insulin pellets; these experiments were performed in three independent labs. Combination of anti-CD20 with proinsulin DNA was also ineffective in diabetes reversal, but did show modest efficacy in diabetes prevention (p = 0.04). In the prevention studies, anti-CD20 plus proinsulin resulted in modest increases in Tregs in pancreatic lymph nodes and elevated levels of proinsulin-specific CD4+ T-cells that produced IL-4. Thus, combination therapy with anti-CD20 and either oral insulin or proinsulin does not protect hyperglycemic NOD mice, but the combination with proinsulin offers limited efficacy in T1D prevention, potentially by augmentation of proinsulin-specific IL-4 production.

Natalizumab was granted approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2004, only 12 years after its molecular target was cloned. Shortly after initial approval, natalizumab use was suspended pending a safety review when several natalizumab recipients were diagnosed as having progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. After the safety review, natalizumab was reintroduced to the market in 2006. Since then, more than 92,000 patients have been treated with the drug. Risk stratification algorithms and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy management strategies have been developed, which facilitate more personalized decision making and safer natalizumab use. This review article summarizes the evolution of natalizumab from target molecule discovery through regulatory approval, voluntary suspension, reapproval, and clinical use. The natalizumab story highlights both the opportunities and risks inherent in a novel biological therapy for a progressive neurologic disease.

There is a significant unmet need for serum biomarkers in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) that are predictive of therapeutic response to disease-modifying therapies. Following a recent Stanford study which reported that pretreatment levels of serum interleukin (IL)-17F could predict poor response to interferon- (IFN) therapy, we sought to validate the finding using samples from a large clinical trial.The validation cohort included 54 good responders (GR) and 64 poor responders (PR) selected from 762 subjects with RRMS from the IM IFN-1a dose comparison study (Avonex study C94-805). Subjects were classified as GR and PR based on the number of relapses, Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and new and enlarging T2 lesions on MRI. Serum samples were assayed for IL-17F using a multiplexed Luminex assay and for IL-17F/F using an ELISA. Replicate aliquots from the Stanford study were also assayed to assure reproducibility of methods.Median pretreatment and post-treatment serum IL-17F levels were not statistically significantly different between GR and PR, and serum IL-7/IL-17F ratios were also not predictive of response status. Replicate aliquots from the Stanford study showed good correlation to their original cohort (r = 0.77).We were unable to validate the finding that serum IL-17F is a predictor of PR in a large independent cohort of subjects with RRMS. Differences in patient populations and methodology might explain the failure to validate the results from the Stanford study.

A., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system characterized by neuroinflammation and demyelination. Although considered a T cell-mediated disease, multiple sclerosis involves the activation of both adaptive and innate immune cells, as well as resident cells of the central nervous system, which synergize in inducing inflammation and thereby demyelination. Differentiation, survival, and inflammatory functions of innate immune cells and of astrocytes of the central nervous system are regulated by tyrosine kinases. Here, we show that imatinib, sorafenib, and GW2580-small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors-can each prevent the development of disease and treat established disease in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. In vitro, imatinib and sorafenib inhibited astrocyte proliferation mediated by the tyrosine kinase platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), whereas GW2580 and sorafenib inhibited macrophage tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production mediated by the tyrosine kinases c-Fms and PDGFR, respectively. In vivo, amelioration of disease by GW2580 was associated with a reduction in the proportion of macrophages and T cells in the CNS infiltrate, as well as a reduction in the levels of circulating TNF. Our findings suggest that GW2580 and the FDA-approved drugs imatinib and sorafenib have potential as novel therapeutics for the treatment of autoimmune demyelinating disease.

Interleukin-17 (IL-17), which is predominantly produced by T helper 17 cells distinct from T helper 1 or T helper 2 cells, participates in the pathogenesis of infectious, autoimmune, and allergic disorders. However, the precise role in allograft rejection remains uncertain. In the present study, we investigated the role of IL-17 in acute allograft rejection using IL-17-deficient mice.Donor hearts from FVB mice were heterotopically transplanted into either C57BL/6J-IL-17-deficient (IL-17(-/-)) or -wild-type mice. Allograft survival was significantly prolonged in IL-17(-/-) recipient mice due to reduced local inflammation accompanied by decreased inflammatory cell recruitment and cytokine/chemokine expression. IL-17(-/-) recipient mice exhibited decreased IL-6 production and reciprocally enhanced regulatory T cell expansion, suggesting a contribution of regulatory T cells to prolonged allograft survival. Indeed, allografts transplanted into anti-CD25 mAb-treated IL-17(-/-) recipient mice (regulatory T cell-depleted) developed acute rejection similar to wild-type recipient mice. Surprisingly, we found that gamma delta T cells rather than CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were key IL-17 producers in the allografts. In support, equivalent allograft rejection was observed in Rag-2(-/-) recipient mice engrafted with either wild-type or IL-17(-/-) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Finally, hearts transplanted into gamma delta T cell-deficient mice resulted in decreased allograft rejection compared with wild-type controls.During heart transplantation, (1) IL-17 is crucial for acceleration of acute rejection; (2) IL-17-deficiency enhances regulatory T cell expansion; and (3) gamma delta T cells rather than CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are a potential source of IL-17. IL-17 neutralization may provide a potential target for novel therapeutic treatment for cardiac allograft rejection.

L., Liu, H., Rohowsky-Kochan, C., Ichiyama, K., Yoshimura, A., Steinman, L., Christakos, S., Youssef, S. A new class of inflammatory CD4(+) T cells that produce interleukin-17 (IL-17) (termed Th17) has been identified, which plays a critical role in numerous inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], has a direct repressive effect on the expression of IL-17A in both human and mouse T cells. In vivo treatment of mice with ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a mouse model of multiple sclerosis) diminishes paralysis and progression of the disease and reduces IL-17A-secreting CD4(+) T cells in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS). The mechanism of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) repression of IL-17A expression was found to be transcriptional repression, mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Transcription assays, gel shifting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicate that the negative effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on IL-17A involves blocking of nuclear factor for activated T cells (NFAT), recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC), sequestration of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)/VDR, and a direct effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on induction of Foxp3. Our results describe novel mechanisms and new concepts with regard to vitamin D and the immune system and suggest therapeutic targets for the control of autoimmune diseases.

The interleukin-7 receptor chain (IL-7R) gene was identified as a top non-major histocompatibility complex-linked risk locus for multiple sclerosis (MS). Recently, we showed that a T helper 1 (T(H)1)-driven, but not a T(H)17-driven, form of MS exhibited a good clinical response to interferon- (IFN-) therapy. We now demonstrate that high serum levels of IL-7, particularly when paired with low levels of IL-17F, predict responsiveness to IFN- and hence a T(H)1-driven subtype of MS. We also show that although IL-7 signaling is neither necessary nor sufficient for the induction or expansion of T(H)17 cells, IL-7 can greatly enhance both human and mouse T(H)1 cell differentiation. IL-7 alone is sufficient to induce human T(H)1 differentiation in the absence of IL-12 or other cytokines. Furthermore, targeting IL-7/IL-7R is beneficial in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. Mice treated with IL-7R-blocking antibodies before or after onset of paralysis exhibited reduced clinical signs of EAE, with reduction in peripheral nave and activated T cells, whereas central memory T, regulatory T, B, and natural killer cell populations were largely spared. IL-7R antibody treatment markedly reduced lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system in mice with EAE. Thus, a serum profile of high IL-7 may signify a T(H)1-driven form of MS and may predict outcome in MS patients undergoing IFN- therapy. Blockade of IL-7 and the IL-7R pathway may have therapeutic potential in MS and other autoimmune diseases.

H., Chung, J., Itoh, S., Rothbard, J., Yang, P. C., Steinman, L., Robbins, R. C., Fischbein, M. P. This study investigates the protective effect of exogenous B-crystallin (CryAB) on myocardial function after ischemia-reperfusion injury.Mice underwent temporary left anterior descending artery occlusion for 30 minutes. Either CryAB (50 g) or phosphate-buffered saline (100 L [n=6, each group]) were injected in the intramyocardial medial and lateral perinfarct zone 15 minutes before reperfusion. Intraperitoneal injections were administered every other day. Left ventricular ejection fraction was evaluated on postoperative day 40 with magnetic resonance imaging. To investigate the effect of CryAB on apoptosis after hypoxia/reoxygenation in vitro, murine atrial cardiomyocytes (HL-1 cells) or human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were incubated with either 50 g CryAB (500 g /10 mL) or phosphate-buffered saline in a hypoxia chamber for 6, 12, and 24 hours, followed by 30 minutes of reoxygenation at room air. Apoptosis was then assessed by western blot (Bcl-2, free bax, cleaved caspases-3, 9, PARP) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses (cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments and caspase-3 activity).On postoperative day 40, CryAB-treated mice had a 1.8-fold increase in left ventricular ejection fraction versus control mice (27%6% versus 15%4% SD, p<0.005). In vitro, (1) the HL-1 cells showed no significant difference in apoptotic protein expression, cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments, or caspase-3 activity; (2) the HMEC-1 cells had increased but not significant apoptotic protein expression with, however, a significant decrease in cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (1.5-fold, p<0.01) and caspase-3 activity (2.7-fold, p<0.005).Exogenous CryAB administration significantly improves cardiac function after ischemia-reperfusion injury, in vivo. The protective anti-apoptotic affects of CryAB may target the endothelial cell.

Total serum 25(OH)D levels were measured using the DiaSorin Liaison Assay during the third trimester and 2, 4, and 6 months after giving birth. The data were analyzed using longitudinal multivariable methods.Levels of 25(OH)D and relapse rate.Fourteen (50%) women breastfed exclusively, and 12 women (43%) relapsed within 6 months after giving birth. During pregnancy, the average 25(OH)D levels were 25.4 ng/mL (range, 13.7-42.6) and were affected only by season (P=.009). In contrast, in the postpartum period, 25(OH)D levels were significantly affected by breastfeeding and relapse status. Levels of 25(OH)D remained low in the exclusive breastfeeding group, yet rose significantly in the nonexclusive breastfeeding group regardless of season (P=.007, unadjusted; P=.02, adjusted for season). By 4 and 6 months after childbirth, 25(OH)D levels were, on average, 5 ng/mL lower in the women who breastfed exclusively compared with the nonbreastfeeding group (P=.001).Pregnancy and exclusive breastfeeding are strongly associated with low 25(OH)D levels in women with MS. However, these lower vitamin D levels were not associated with an increased risk of postpartum MS relapses. These data suggest that low vitamin D in isolation is not an important risk factor for postpartum MS relapses. View details for Common variants in P2RY11 are associated with narcolepsy Kornum, B.

Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that narcolepsy with cataplexy is an autoimmune disease. We here report genome-wide association analyses for narcolepsy with replication and fine mapping across three ethnic groups (3,406 individuals of European ancestry, 2,414 Asians and 302 African Americans). We identify a SNP in the 3' untranslated region of P2RY11, the purinergic receptor subtype P2Y gene, which is associated with narcolepsy (rs2305795, combined P = 6.1 10, odds ratio = 1.28, 95% CI 1.19-1.39, n = 5689). The disease-associated allele is correlated with reduced expression of P2RY11 in CD8(+) T lymphocytes (339% reduced, P = 0.003) and natural killer (NK) cells (P = 0.031), but not in other peripheral blood mononuclear cell types. The low expression variant is also associated with reduced P2RY11-mediated resistance to ATP-induced cell death in T lymphocytes (P = 0.0007) and natural killer cells (P = 0.001). These results identify P2RY11 as an important regulator of immune-cell survival, with possible implications in narcolepsy and other autoimmune diseases.

N., Srinagesh, H., Axtell, R., Zhang, H., Platten, M., Wyss-Coray, T., Steinman, L. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a key hormonal system regulating blood pressure. However, expression of RAAS components has recently been detected in immune cells, and the RAAS has been implicated in several mouse models of autoimmune disease. Here, we have identified Ang II as a paracrine mediator, sustaining inflammation in the CNS in the EAE mouse model of MS via TGF-beta. Ang II type 1 receptors (AT1Rs) were found to be primarily expressed in CNS-resident cells during EAE. In vitro, astrocytes and microglia responded to Ang II treatment by inducing TGF-beta expression via a pathway involving the TGF-beta-activating protease thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). TGF-beta upregulation in astrocytes and microglia during EAE was blocked with candesartan (CA), an inhibitor of AT1R. Treatment of EAE with CA ameliorated paralysis and blunted lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS, outcomes that were also seen with genetic ablation of AT1Ra and treatment with an inhibitor of TSP-1. These data suggest that AT1R antagonists, frequently prescribed as antihypertensives, may be useful to interrupt this proinflammatory, CNS-specific pathway in individuals with MS.

M., Bsibsi, M., Gerritsen, W. H., van der Valk, P., Bajramovic, J. J., Steinman, L., Amor, S. We present the first comparative analysis of serum immunoglobulin G reactivity profiles against the full spectrum of human myelin-associated proteins in multiple sclerosis patients and healthy control subjects. In both groups, serum antibodies display a consistent and prominent reaction to alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) versus other myelin proteins. As an apparently major target for the adaptive immune system in humans, CRYAB selectively accumulates in oligodendrocytes, but not in astrocytes, or axons in so-called preactive multiple sclerosis lesions. These are clusters of activated HLA-DR-expressing microglia in myelinated normal-appearing white matter with no obvious leukocyte infiltration. They are found in most multiple sclerosis patients at all stages of disease. In these lesion areas, CRYAB in oligodendrocytes may come directly in contact with activated HLA-DR+ microglia. We demonstrate that CRYAB activates innate responses by microglia by stimulating the secretion of leukocyte-recruiting factors, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 17, CCL5, and CCL1, and immune-regulatory cytokines such as interleukin 10, transforming growth factor-beta, and interleukin 13. Together, these data suggest that CRYAB accumulation in preactive lesions may be part of a reversible reparative local response that involves both oligodendrocytes and microglia. At the same time, however, accumulated CRYAB may represent a major target for adaptive immune responses that could contribute to progression of preactive lesions to a stage of demyelination.

Although interleukin-17 (IL-17) has been reported to participate in the pathogenesis of infectious, autoimmune and allergic disorders, the precise role in allograft rejection remains uncertain. This study illustrates that IL-17 contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic allograft rejection.Utilizing a murine heterotopic heart transplant model system, IL-17-deficient recipient mice had decreased allograft inflammatory cell recruitment, decreased IL-6, MCP-1, and KC production, and reduced graft coronary artery disease (GCAD). Intragraft gamma delta (gammadelta) T cells appear to be the predominant source of IL-17 production.Therefore, IL-17 neutralization may provide a potential target for novel therapeutic treatment for cardiac allograft rejection.

P., Steinman, L., Utz, P. J., Ho, P. P. Activation of the innate immune system by DNA containing hypomethylated CpG motifs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here, we examined the consequences of immunostimulatory CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) and inhibitory GpG-ODN treatment in the NZB x NZW F1 (NZB/W) murine model of SLE. Beginning at 5 months of age, we administered CpG-ODN or GpG-ODN at regular intervals to female NZB/W animals. We also determined the effects of ODN administration on NZB/W mouse lymphocyte function, and the specificity of ODN binding to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) other than TLR-9. While CpG-ODN treatment did not appear to have a major impact on disease severity, GpG-ODN treatment significantly delayed the onset of proteinuria in NZB/W mice. Interestingly, short-term GpG-ODN treatment promoted Th2-type T and B cell responses, and inhibited B lymphocyte proliferation in vitro. On the other hand, extended GpG-ODN treatment did not result in sustained Th2 responses or significantly reduced renal disease. Moreover, the binding of CpG-ODN and GpG-ODN was not restricted to TLR-9 as both ODNs also interacted with TLR-3, TLR-7, and TLR-8. Taken together, the data indicate that the protective mechanism of GpG-ODN treatment in the NZB/W model of lupus nephritis involves modulating T cell cytokine profiles and B lymphocyte activation through the inhibition of several TLRs, including TLR-7 and TLR-9.

To determine whether fluctuations in functional T-cell subsets can explain why multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses decline during pregnancy and increase in the postpartum period.Case-control study.Kaiser Permanente Northern California and Stanford University.Twenty-six pregnant women with MS and 24 age-matched, pregnant controls. Intervention We prospectively followed up the pregnant women with MS and the age-matched, pregnant controls; conducted structured interviews; and collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells during each trimester and 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months post partum.Sixteen functional cell types, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)- and tumor necrosis factor-producing T-cell subsets, were measured using multicolor flow cytometry. Since these cell types may also fluctuate with pregnancy, lactational amenorrhea, or MS treatment, the data were analyzed taking into account these factors.Fifteen women with MS (58%) had relapses during the postpartum year. CD4(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells fluctuated with MS relapses, declining during pregnancy in women with MS (P < .001) and continuing to decline after parturition in women with relapses (P = .001), yet rising or remaining stable in women with nonrelapsing MS or healthy pregnant women. Lactational amenorrhea was associated with a rise in CD4(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells in women with MS (P = .009). In contrast, CD4(+) tumor necrosis factor-producing cells decreased during lactational amenorrhea in all groups of women and, once this was taken into account, obscured any relationship to MS relapses. CD8(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells were elevated in women with MS throughout the study (P < .001) but did not fluctuate with relapses.Our findings suggest that a decline in circulating CD4(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells leads to postpartum MS relapses. Our findings also suggest that the decline in these cells may begin during late pregnancy and that lactational amenorrhea induced by exclusive breastfeeding may be able to interrupt this process.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disorder with a high burden on patient quality of life and medical rehabilitation services. Little is known about the acute hospitalization costs and characteristics. We examined the trends in MS hospitalizations from 1993 to 2006.The Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project was searched using the ICD-9 code 340 (MS). Diagnostic, treatment and administrative data were analyzed using basic statistical software.A total of 288,454 hospital admissions with the primary diagnosis of MS occurred between 1993 and 2006, an average of 20,604 admissions annually. The percentage admitted from the emergency department (ED) increased from 19.4 to 60.0% during 1993-2006. The mean cost for each inpatient increased from USD 7,965 to 20,076. The percentage of discharges to home health care increased from 8.6 to 14.9%, and the percentage of discharges to nursing homes and rehabilitation services increased from 8.3 to 22.6%. In 2006, Medicaid patients were significantly more likely to be admitted from the ED (p < 0.001). Medicare payers were significantly more likely to be discharged to a nursing home/rehabilitation (p < 0.0001).National health insurance policies have made measurable effects on MS disease management. MS is becoming more expensive to treat acutely, and improved treatment modalities geared toward decreasing acute flare-ups may provide substantial cost savings by reducing ED visits, inpatient hospitalizations and the need for rehabilitation.

E., Hueber, W., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune synovitis characterized by the presence of anticitrullinated protein Abs, although the exact targets and role of anticitrullinated protein autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of RA remain to be defined. Fibrinogen, which can be citrullinated, has recently emerged as a candidate autoantigen. To determine whether autoimmunity against fibrinogen can mediate inflammatory arthritis, we immunized a variety of common mouse strains with fibrinogen and found that DBA/1 and SJL mice developed an inflammatory and erosive arthritis. Mice with fibrinogen-induced arthritis (FIA) possess fibrinogen-reactive T cells that produce the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma. FIA can be adoptively transferred with either plasma or fibrinogen-specific T cells from diseased mice. Mice with FIA possess rheumatoid factor, circulating immune complexes, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide Abs, all of which are characteristic of human RA. These observations demonstrate that fibrinogen is arthritogenic in mice and that the pathogenesis of FIA is mediated by both autoantibodies and fibrinogen-reactive T cells. Mixed results with modulation of T-H-17 cells in human autoimmune diseases The outcomes of clinical trials provide the most convincing data to clarify the role of particular cytokines in the pathogenesis of human diseases. The immunology community, for a variety of practical reasons, spends most of its research time and funds on studies in model systems, mainly mice. In this perspective I discuss results of clinical trials assessing the effect of blocking the differentiation and/or function of interleukin-17-producing CD4(+) T cells on human autoimmune disease, and devote more limited attention to corroborating preclinical studies from animal models. Thus far, these outcomes in human trials have been mixed, with notable success in psoriasis and Crohn's disease but a negative result in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

Statins are thought to have tumorolytic properties, reducing angiogenesis by inhibiting pro-angiogenic factors and inducing apoptosis of mural pericytes within the tumor vascular tree.An orthotopic mouse glioblastoma (GL-26) model was used to investigate the effect of simvastatin on glioblastoma vasculature in vivo. GL-26 cells were implanted into the striatum of C5LKa mice treated with either control, low- or high-dose simvastatin. Brains were analyzed for necrotic volume, apoptosis, morphology and pericytic cells within the vascular tree.Low-dose simvastatin increased necrosis and apoptosis compared to both control and high-dose simvastatin groups. High-dose simvastatin increased vessel caliber by reducing pericytic cells along the tumor vessel wall compared to both control and low-dose simvastatin groups.Simvastatin has a dual effect on tumorigenesis. At high doses, it may worsen instead of 'normalizing' tumor angio-architecture, albeit low doses affect tumor cell survival by promoting necrosis and apoptosis.

Macrophages rapidly engulf apoptotic cells to limit the release of noxious cellular contents and to restrict autoimmune responses against self antigens. Although factors participating in recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells have been identified, the transcriptional basis for the sensing and the silent disposal of apoptotic cells is unknown. Here we show that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR-delta) is induced when macrophages engulf apoptotic cells and functions as a transcriptional sensor of dying cells. Genetic deletion of PPAR-delta decreases expression of opsonins such as complement component-1qb (C1qb), resulting in impairment of apoptotic cell clearance and reduction in anti-inflammatory cytokine production. This increases autoantibody production and predisposes global and macrophage-specific Ppard(-/-) mice to autoimmune kidney disease, a phenotype resembling the human disease systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, PPAR-delta has a pivotal role in orchestrating the timely disposal of apoptotic cells by macrophages, ensuring that tolerance to self is maintained. Shifting therapeutic attention in MS to osteopontin, type 1 and type 2 IFN It is widely debated whether MS is mediated solely by Th1, or solely by Th17, whether it might be mediated by both pathways, or perhaps by neither pathway. We must integrate the following four facts: first, MS lesions have a signature of IL-6-, IL-17-, osteopontin- and IFN-driven transcriptional activity. Second, MS is worsened with administration of IFN-gamma, the quintessential type 2 IFN and Th1 cytokine. Third, blockade of TNF-alpha worsened MS in clinical trials. Fourth, inhibiting the main driver of Th17, IL-23, failed to modulate relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Against this backdrop, standing outside the framework of the Th1 and Th17 pathways are the type 1 IFN, notably IFN-beta, the most widely used approved therapy for RRMS. A paper in this issue of the European Journal of Immunology demonstrates that IFN-beta suppresses production in CD4(+) T cells of both osteopontin and IL-17. In this commentary, the roles of these two molecules, i.e. osteopontin and IL-17, are discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of MS. Osteopontin may be more important than Th1 or Th17 in the pathogenesis of RRMS. Trials targeting this small integrin-binding protein ought to be pursued in RRMS.

J., Pedotti, R. Induction of T helper 1 (Th1) to Th2 deviation through administration of self- or altered self-peptides holds promise for treatment of autoimmunity. However, administration of self-peptides in models of autoimmunity can result in anaphylactic reactions. Although both IgE and IgG1 antibodies might be involved in the development of anaphylaxis to myelin peptides in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice, the effector cells and molecules involved are not fully understood. Here we show that systemic anaphylaxis to the self-antigen myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55 can occur in mice lacking mast cells (Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) mice) or histamine (histidine decarboxylase-deficient mice), but is prevented in mice lacking IL-4. Treatment of mice with CV6209, a platelet-activating factor antagonist, slightly reduced the incidence of anaphylaxis to self-MOG35-55 in this model, but more effectively protected mice against anaphylaxis to this peptide when self-MOG35-55 was administered in a different immunization protocol that omitted the use of Bordetella pertussis toxin as an adjuvant at the time of immunization. Thus, anaphylactic reactions to self-MOG can occur in the absence of mast cells or histamine, key elements of the classical IgE-, mast cell-, and histamine-dependent pathway of anaphylaxis. View details for Enhanced Immune Recognition of Cryptic Glycan Markers in Human Tumors Newsom-Davis, T. E., Wang, D., Steinman, L., Chen, P. F., Wang, L., Simon, A. K., Screaton, G. R. Abnormal glycosylation is one of the hallmarks of the cancer cell and is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. The development of tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen (TACA) vaccines has been problematic due to poor immunogenicity. However, when appropriate targets can be identified, passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against TACAs has been shown to have antitumor activity. Fas ligand (FasL) is a transmembrane protein that induces apoptosis in cells expressing its receptor, Fas. When grafted into mice, FasL-expressing tumor cells break immunologic tolerance to self-antigens and induce antibody-mediated tumor immunity. Here, five IgM mAbs were produced from mice vaccinated with FasL-expressing B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. They recognize various syngeneic and allogeneic murine tumor cell lines. One mAb, TM10, recognizes a range of human tumor cell lines, including melanoma, prostate, and ovarian cancer. It does not bind to untransformed cells. The epitopes recognized by all the mAbs were carbohydrates expressed on proteins. Using carbohydrate microarrays, the antigenic targets of TM10 were found to be high-mannose core structures of N-linked glycans. In normal cells, high-mannose clusters are hidden by extensive saccharide branching but they become exposed in cancer cells as a result of abnormal glycosylation pathways. Vaccination with FasL-expressing tumors therefore enables the immune system to break tolerance to self-antigens, allowing identification of novel TACAs that can form the basis of future humoral anticancer therapy.

W., Wang, P., Kattah, M. G., Youssef, S., Steinman, L., DeFea, K., Straus, D. S. The IL-23/IL-17 pathway plays an important role in chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. In inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal epithelial cells are an important source of chemokines that recruit inflammatory cells. We examined the effect of IL-17 on chemokine expression of HT-29 colonic epithelial cells. IL-17 strongly repressed TNF-alpha-stimulated expression of CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCL5, but synergized with TNF-alpha for induction of CXCL8, CXCL1, and CCL20 mRNAs. For CXCL10, IL-17 strongly inhibited promoter activity but had no effect on mRNA stability. In contrast, for CXCL8, IL-17 slightly decreased promoter activity but stabilized its normally unstable mRNA, leading to a net increase in steady-state mRNA abundance. IL-17 synergized with TNF-alpha in transactivating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and in activating ERK and p38 MAPK. The p38 and ERK pathway inhibitors SB203580 and U0126 reversed the repressive effect of IL-17 on CXCL10 mRNA abundance and promoter activity and also reversed the inductive effect of IL-17 on CXCL8 mRNA, indicating that MAPK signaling mediates both the transcriptional repression of CXCL10 and the stabilization of CXCL8 mRNA by IL-17. The EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 partially reversed the effects of IL-17 on CXCL8 and CXCL10 mRNA, demonstrating a role for EGFR in downstream IL-17 signaling. The overall results indicate a positive effect of IL-17 on chemokines that recruit neutrophils (CXCL8 and CXCL1), and Th17 cells (CCL20). In contrast, IL-17 represses expression of CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCR5, three chemokines that selectively recruit Th1 but not other effector T cells.

M., Baumgarth, N., Chien, Y. gammadelta T cells uniquely contribute to host immune defense, but how this is accomplished remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the nonclassical major histocompatibility complex class I T10 and T22-specific gammadelta T cells in mice and found that encountering antigen in the thymus was neither required nor inhibitory for their development. But when triggered through the T cell receptor, ligand-naive lymphoid-gammadelta T cells produced IL-17, whereas ligand-experienced cells made IFN-gamma. Immediately after immunization, a large fraction of IL-17(+) gammadelta T cells were found in the draining lymph nodes days before the appearance of antigen-specific IL-17(+) *beta T cells. Thus, thymic selection determines the effector fate of gammadelta T cells rather than constrains their antigen specificities. The swift IL-17 response mounted by antigen-naive gammadelta T cells suggests a critical role for these cells at the onset of an acute inflammatory response to novel antigens.

Inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase enzyme (statins) are cholesterol-lowering drugs that have shown promise as therapeutic agents in various animal models of autoimmune disease. The results of initial clinical trials with statins in multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis have also been encouraging. In this study, we attempted to treat a widely studied murine model of spontaneous systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with atorvastatin.(NZB x NZW)F1 (NZB/NZW) mice received daily oral doses of atorvastatin for 20 weeks. The mice were monitored weekly for survival and proteinuria. Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels in sera were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). T lymphocyte cytokine production in vitro, as well as cytokine levels in vivo, were measured by ELISA. T cell proliferation was assessed by thymidine incorporation assay. Serum cholesterol levels were determined using a standard fluorometric assay. Kidney tissue was harvested and evaluated for pathologic changes.In NZB/NZW mice, oral atorvastatin had significant effects on T cell proliferation and cytokine production in vitro. Atorvastatin also induced significant increases in serum levels of interleukin-4. However, atorvastatin treatment in NZB/NZW mice had no significant impact on proteinuria, survival, serum anti-dsDNA antibody and cholesterol levels, or extent of renal disease.Monotherapy with oral atorvastatin has no protective effects in a murine model of spontaneous SLE. The efficacy of atorvastatin in human SLE remains to be determined.

View details for Extensive fusion of haematopoietic cells with Purkinje neurons in response to chronic inflammation Johansson, C. B., Youssef, S., Koleckar, K., Holbrook, C., Doyonnas, R., Corbel, S. Y., Steinman, L., Rossi, F. M., Blau, H. M. Transplanted bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) have been reported to fuse with cells of diverse tissues, but the extremely low frequency of fusion has led to the view that such events are biologically insignificant. Nonetheless, in mice with a lethal recessive liver disease (tyrosinaemia), transplantation of wild-type BMDCs restored liver function by cell fusion and prevented death, indicating that cell fusion can have beneficial effects. Here we report that chronic inflammation resulting from severe dermatitis or autoimmune encephalitis leads to robust fusion of BMDCs with Purkinje neurons and formation of hundreds of binucleate heterokaryons per cerebellum, a 10-100-fold higher frequency than previously reported. Single haematopoietic stem-cell transplants showed that the fusogenic cell is from the haematopoietic lineage and parabiosis experiments revealed that fusion can occur without irradiation. Transplantation of rat bone marrow into mice led to activation of dormant rat Purkinje neuron-specific genes in BMDC nuclei after fusion with mouse Purkinje neurons, consistent with nuclear reprogramming. The precise neurological role of these heterokaryons awaits elucidation, but their frequency in brain after inflammation is clearly much higher than previously appreciated. View details for CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells specific for a thymus-expressed antigen prevent the development of anaphylaxis to self Scabeni, S., Lapilla, M., Musio, S., Gallo, B., Ciusani, E., Steinman, L., Mantegazza, R., Pedotti, R. A role for CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the control of allergic diseases has been postulated. We developed a mouse model in which anaphylaxis is induced in SJL mice by immunization and challenge with the fragment of self myelin proteolipid protein (PLP)(139-151), that is not expressed in the thymus, but not with fragment 178-191 of the same protein, that is expressed in the thymus. In this study, we show that resistance to anaphylaxis is associated with naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs specific for the self peptide expressed in the thymus. These cells increase Foxp3 expression upon Ag stimulation and suppress peptide-induced proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-) effector T cells. Depletion of Tregs with anti-CD25 in vivo significantly diminished resistance to anaphylaxis to PLP(178-191), suggesting an important role for CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs in preventing the development of allergic responses to this thymus-expressed peptide. These data indicate that naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs specific for a peptide expressed under physiological conditions in the thymus are able to suppress the development of a systemic allergic reaction to self. View details for Bioluminescence in vivo imaging of autoimmune encephalomyelitis predicts disease Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is a widely used animal model to understand not only multiple sclerosis but also basic principles of immunity. The disease is scored typically by observing signs of paralysis, which do not always correspond with pathological changes.Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was induced in transgenic mice expressing an injury responsive luciferase reporter in astrocytes (GFAP-luc). Bioluminescence in the brain and spinal cord was measured non-invasively in living mice. Mice were sacrificed at different time points to evaluate clinical and pathological changes. The correlation between bioluminescence and clinical and pathological EAE was statistically analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis.Bioluminescence from the brain and spinal cord correlates strongly with severity of clinical disease and a number of pathological changes in the brain in EAE. Bioluminescence at early time points also predicts severity of disease.These results highlight the potential use of bioluminescence imaging to monitor neuroinflammation for rapid drug screening and immunological studies in EAE and suggest that similar approaches could be applied to other animal models of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. View details for Epitope spreading to citrullinated antigens in mouse models of autoimmune arthritis and demyelination Kidd, B. A., Ho, P. P., Sharpe, O., Zhao, X., Tomooka, B. H., Kanter, J. L., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies have a diagnostic role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, little is known about their origins and contribution to pathogenesis. Citrullination is the post-translational conversion of arginine to citrulline by peptidyl arginine deiminase, and increased citrullination of proteins is observed in the joint tissue in RA and in brain tissue in multiple sclerosis (MS).We applied synovial and myelin protein arrays to examine epitope spreading of B cell responses to citrullinated epitopes in both the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model for RA and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model for MS. Synovial and myelin protein arrays contain a spectrum of proteins and peptides, including native and citrullinated forms, representing candidate autoantigens in RA and MS, respectively. We applied these arrays to characterise the specificity of autoantibodies in serial serum samples derived from mice with acute and chronic stages of CIA and EAE.In samples from pre-disease CIA and acute-disease EAE, we observed autoantibody targeting of the immunising antigen and responses to a limited set of citrullinated epitopes. Over the course of diseases, the autoantibody responses expanded to target multiple citrullinated epitopes in both CIA and EAE. Using immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified citrullination of multiple polypeptides in CIA joint and EAE brain tissue that have not previously been described as citrullinated.Our results suggest that anti-citrulline antibody responses develop in the early stages of CIA and EAE, and that autoimmune inflammation results in citrullination of joint proteins in CIA and brain proteins in EAE, thereby creating neoantigens that become additional targets in epitope spreading of autoimmune responses.

View details for Preemptive HMG-CoA reductase inhibition provides graft-versus-host disease protection by Th-2 polarization while sparing graft-versus-leukemia activity Zeiser, R., Youssef, S., Baker, J., Kambham, N., Steinman, L., Negrin, R. S. We investigated whether atorvastatin (AT) was capable of protecting animals from acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) across major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mismatch barriers. AT treatment of the donor induced a Th-2 cytokine profile in the adoptively transferred T cells and reduced their in vivo expansion, which translated into significantly reduced aGVHD lethality. Host treatment down-regulated costimulatory molecules and MHC class II expression on recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and enhanced the protective statin effect, without impacting graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity. The AT effect was partially reversed in STAT6(-/-) donors and abrogated by L-mevalonate, indicating the relevance of STAT6 signaling and the L-mevalonate pathway for AT-mediated aGVHD protection. AT reduced prenylation levels of GTPases, abolished T-bet expression, and increased c-MAF and GATA-3 protein in vivo. Thus, AT has significant protective impact on aGVHD lethality by Th-2 polarization and inhibition of an uncontrolled Th-1 response while maintaining GVL activity, which is of great clinical relevance given the modest toxicity profile of AT. Glia-dependent TGF-beta signaling, acting independently of the TH17 pathway, is critical for initiation of murine autoimmune encephalomyelitis Luo, J., Ho, P. P., Buckwalter, M. S., Hsu, T., Lee, L. Y., Zhang, H., Kim, D., Kim, S., Gambhir, S. S., Steinman, L., Wyss-Coray, T. Autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model for multiple sclerosis, is characterized by the activation of immune cells, demyelination of axons in the CNS, and paralysis. We found that TGF-beta1 synthesis in glial cells and TGF-beta-induced signaling in the CNS were activated several days before the onset of paralysis in mice with autoimmune encephalomyelitis. While early production of TGF-beta1 was observed in glial cells TGF-beta signaling was activated in neurons and later in infiltrating T cells in inflammatory lesions. Systemic treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling ameliorated the paralytic disease and reduced the accumulation of pathogenic T cells and expression of IL-6 in the CNS. Priming of peripheral T cells was not altered, nor was the generation of TH17 cells, indicating that this effect was directed within the brain, yet affected the immune system. These results suggest that early production of TGF-beta1 in the CNS creates a permissive and dangerous environment for the initiation of autoimmune inflammation, providing a rare example of the brain modulating the immune system. Importantly, inhibition of TGF-beta signaling may have benefits in the treatment of the acute phase of autoimmune CNS inflammation. Recent evidence points to tryptophan (Trp) degradation as a potent immunosuppressive mechanism involved in the maintenance of immunological tolerance. Both Trp depletion and downstream Trp catabolites (TCs) appear to synergistically confer protection against excessive inflammation. In this review, we give an overview of the immunosuppressive properties of Trp degradation with special focus on TCs. Constitutive and inducible Trp degradation in different cell types and tissues of human and murine origin is summarized. We address the influence of Trp degradation on different aspects of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Possible therapeutic approaches for autoimmune disorders targeting Trp degradation are presented, and key issues relevant for the development of such therapeutic strategies are discussed. View details for Nanosensor detection of an immunoregulatory tryptophan influx/kynurenine efflux cycle Kaper, T., Looger, L. L., Takanaga, H., Platten, M., Steinman, L., Frommer, W. B. Mammalian cells rely on cellular uptake of the essential amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan sequestration by up-regulation of the key enzyme for tryptophan degradation, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), e.g., in cancer and inflammation, is thought to suppress the immune response via T cell starvation. Additionally, the excreted tryptophan catabolites (kynurenines) induce apoptosis of lymphocytes. Whereas tryptophan transport systems have been identified, the molecular nature of kynurenine export remains unknown. To measure cytosolic tryptophan steady-state levels and flux in real time, we developed genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer nanosensors (FLIPW). The transport properties detected by FLIPW in KB cells, a human oral cancer cell line, and COS-7 cells implicate LAT1, a transporter that is present in proliferative tissues like cancer, in tryptophan uptake. Importantly, we found that this transport system mediates tryptophan/kynurenine exchange. The tryptophan influx/kynurenine efflux cycle couples tryptophan starvation to elevation of kynurenine serum levels, providing a two-pronged induction of apoptosis in neighboring cells. The strict coupling protects cells that overproduce IDO from kynurenine accumulation. Consequently, this mechanism may contribute to immunosuppression involved in autoimmunity and tumor immune escape. View details for Inhibition of HMGcoA reductase by atorvastatin prevents and reverses MYC-induced lymphomagenesis Shachaf, C. M., Perez, O. D., Youssef, S., Fan, A. C., Elchuri, S., Goldstein, M. J., Shirer, A. E., Sharpe, O., Chen, J., Mitchell, D. J., Chang, M., Nolan, G. P., Steinman, L., Felsher, D. W. Statins are a class of drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMGcoA) reductase, a critical enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Several reports document that statins may prevent different human cancers. However, whether or not statins can prevent cancer is controversial due to discordant results. One possible explanation for these conflicting conclusions is that only some tumors or specific statins may be effective. Here, we demonstrate in an in vivo transgenic model in which atorvastatin reverses and prevents the onset of MYC-induced lymphomagenesis, but fails to reverse or prevent tumorigenesis in the presence of constitutively activated K-Ras (G12D). Using phosphoprotein fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, atorvastatin treatment was found to result in the inactivation of the Ras and ERK1/2 signaling pathways associated with the dephosphorylation and inactivation of MYC. Correspondingly, tumors with a constitutively activated K-Ras (G12D) did not exhibit dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and MYC. Atorvastatin's effects on MYC were specific to the inhibition of HMGcoA reductase, as treatment with mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase activity, abrogated these effects and inhibited the ability of atorvastatin to reverse or suppress tumorigenesis. Also, RNAi directed at HMGcoA reductase was sufficient to abrogate the neoplastic properties of MYC-induced tumors. Thus, atorvastatin, by inhibiting HMGcoA reductase, induces changes in phosphoprotein signaling that in turn prevent MYC-induced lymphomagenesis. Antigen-specific therapy of multiple sclerosis: The long-sought magic bullet The adaptive immune response in multiple sclerosis (MS) targets various myelin proteins and even some inducible heat shock proteins. A few attempts have been made to tolerize relapsing-remitting patients with MS to either full-length myelin basic protein or to a key peptide epitope between residues 83-99. These trials have demonstrated that this approach may potentially provide benefit to patients with relapsing- remitting MS. However, manipulation of responses to myelin proteins can have deleterious effects. The immune response to myelin components is positioned at a key tipping point in the pathophysiology of the disease. Clarification of the key target antigens in MS, and better understanding of practical methods to attain tolerance to a wide variety of myelin and neuronal molecules will provide the basis for the ultimately successful antigen specific therapy. View details for Statins-treatment option for central nervous system autoimmune disease? Statins, inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, are well-established agents to lower cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular morbidity. Independent of their lipid-lowering properties, statins have been shown to exert pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects in various animal models of human autoimmune disease. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a murine model for multiple sclerosis, statins prevented disease onset and even reversed paralysis when treatment was initiated after experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was fully established. Furthermore, well-tolerated oral statins were recently shown to exert synergistic benefit in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in combination with existing agents for multiple sclerosis therapy. Based primarily on these encouraging results, statins are now being tested in clinical trials as a monotherapy for multiple sclerosis, as well as in combination with approved disease-modifying therapies.

C., Stuve, O., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Treatment with glatiramer acetate (GA, copolymer-1, Copaxone), a drug approved for multiple sclerosis (MS), in a mouse model promoted development of anti-inflammatory type II monocytes, characterized by increased secretion of interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and decreased production of IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). This anti-inflammatory cytokine shift was associated with reduced STAT-1 signaling. Type II monocytes directed differentiation of T(H)2 cells and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (T(reg)) independent of antigen specificity. Type II monocyte-induced regulatory T cells specific for a foreign antigen ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), indicating that neither GA specificity nor recognition of self-antigen was required for their therapeutic effect. Adoptive transfer of type II monocytes reversed EAE, suppressed T(H)17 cell development and promoted both T(H)2 differentiation and expansion of T(reg) cells in recipient mice. This demonstration of adoptive immunotherapy by type II monocytes identifies a central role for these cells in T cell immune modulation of autoimmunity.

The role of autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating diseases is controversial, in part because widely used western blotting and ELISA methods either do not permit the detection of conformation-sensitive antibodies or do not distinguish them from conformation-independent antibodies. We developed a sensitive assay based on self-assembling radiolabeled tetramers that allows discrimination of antibodies against folded or denatured myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) by selective unfolding of the antigen domain. The tetramer radioimmunoassay (RIA) was more sensitive for MOG autoantibody detection than other methodologies, including monomer-based RIA, ELISA or fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS). Autoantibodies from individuals with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) selectively bound the folded MOG tetramer, whereas sera from mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis induced with MOG peptide immunoprecipitated only the unfolded tetramer. MOG-specific autoantibodies were identified in a subset of ADEM but only rarely in adult-onset MS cases, indicating that MOG is a more prominent target antigen in ADEM than MS.

We report that expression of HO-1 dictates the pathologic outcome of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Induction of EAE in Hmox1(-/- )C57BL/6 mice led to enhanced CNS demyelination, paralysis, and mortality, as compared with Hmox1(+/+) mice. Induction of HO-1 by cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX) administration after EAE onset reversed paralysis in C57BL/6 and SJL/J mice and disease relapse in SJL/J mice. These effects were not observed using zinc protoporphyrin IX, which does not induce HO-1. CoPPIX protection was abrogated in Hmox1(-/-) C57BL/6 mice, indicating that CoPPIX acts via HO-1 to suppress EAE progression. The protective effect of HO-1 was associated with inhibition of MHC class II expression by APCs and inhibition of Th and CD8 T cell accumulation, proliferation, and effector function within the CNS. Exogenous CO mimicked these effects, suggesting that CO contributes to the protective action of HO-1. In conclusion, HO-1 or exposure to its end product CO counters autoimmune neuroinflammation and thus might be used therapeutically to treat MS.

Current therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune diseases non-specifically suppress immune function, and there is great need for fundamental approaches such as antigen-specific tolerizing therapy. In this paper we describe development of antigen-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines to treat collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice, and use of protein microarrays to monitor response to therapy and to identify potential additional autoimmune targets for next generation vaccines. We demonstrate that tolerizing DNA vaccines encoding type II collagen (CII) reduced the incidence and severity of CIA. Atorvastatin, a statin drug found to reduce the severity of autoimmunity, potentiated the effect of DNA vaccines encoding CII. Analysis of cytokines produced by collagen-reactive T cells derived from mice receiving tolerizing DNA encoding CII, as compared to control vaccines, revealed reduced production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Arthritis microarray analysis demonstrated reduced spreading of autoantibody responses in mice treated with DNA encoding CII. The development of tolerizing DNA vaccines, and the use of antibody profiling to guide design of and to monitor therapeutic responses to such vaccines, represents a promising approach for the treatment of RA and other autoimmune diseases. Type IIHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (Statins) provide acute-graft-versus-host disease protection by Th-2 cytokine induction while sparing graft-versus-leukemia activity. 48th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Hematology Zeiser, R., Youssef, S., Baker, J., Steinman, L., Negrin, R.

P., Tomooka, B. H., Thomas, F. M., Song, J. J., Goodman, S. B., Lee, D. M., Genovese, M. C., Utz, P. J., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Tyrosine kinases play a central role in the activation of signal transduction pathways and cellular responses that mediate the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Imatinib mesylate (imatinib) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed to treat Bcr/Abl-expressing leukemias and subsequently found to treat c-Kit-expressing gastrointestinal stromal tumors. We demonstrate that imatinib potently prevents and treats murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). We further show that micromolar concentrations of imatinib abrogate multiple signal transduction pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis, including mast cell c-Kit signaling and TNF-alpha release, macrophage c-Fms activation and cytokine production, and fibroblast PDGFR signaling and proliferation. In our studies, imatinib attenuated PDGFR signaling in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) and TNF-alpha production in synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMCs) derived from human RA patients. Imatinib-mediated inhibition of a spectrum of signal transduction pathways and the downstream pathogenic cellular responses may provide a powerful approach to treat RA and other inflammatory diseases.

S., Youssef, S., Dunn, S. E., Prod'homme, T., Neuhaus, O., Stuve, O., Greenwood, J., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, are widely prescribed for their cholesterol-lowering properties to reduce atherogenesis and cardiovascular morbidity. Over recent years, statins have also been shown to exert pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects that might be of therapeutic benefit in autoimmune disorders. The primary mechanism by which statins alter immune function appears to be mediated through the inhibition of post-translational protein prenylation of small GTP-binding proteins and is largely independent of lipid-lowering. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), statins prevent or reverse paralysis and were recently shown to exert synergistic benefit when combined with agents approved for MS therapy. Based primarily upon the beneficial effects in EAE, statins are now being tested in patients in MS clinical trials.

Four easy pieces: interconnections between tissue injury, intermediary metabolism, autoimmunity, and chronic degeneration. Four questions are posed: (1) Can tissue damage itself provoke autoimmunity? (2) Can genetic mutations of key structures produce tissue pathology and thus provoke autoimmunity? (3) Can acute immune damage produce tissue degeneration without further hallmarks of an immune response? (4) Can intermediary metabolism modulate immune damage to tissues? Four answers are given: (1) Tissue injury itself may lead to autoimmunity. Both innate and adaptive immunity may arise as a response to tissue injury, and the immune attack can further damage tissue. (2) Genetic mutations can lead to an immune response indistinguishable from autoimmunity, exemplified from Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. (3) Chronic immune damage may lead to tissue degeneration, with or without further hallmarks of an immune response. Variations on this theme, including inverse scenarios, are also possible: Inborn errors of metabolism may lead to tissue damage that may provoke an adaptive and or innate immune response. The immune response might further damage tissue. (4) Finally, perturbations of intermediary metabolism may modulate the immune response, controlling the extent of immune-mediated damage. Examples are taken from perturbations in the cholesterol pathway that influence the characteristics of the immune response, and with tryptophan metabolites that modulate autoimmunity and graft rejection. Inflammatory, degenerative, and autoimmune neurological disease will be discussed in terms of their implications for pathogenic mechanisms underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. How to successfully apply animal studies in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis to research on multiple sclerosis In their Point of View entitled ""Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis: A Misleading Model of Multiple Sclerosis,"" Sriram and Steiner(1) wrote, ""The most disappointing aspect of EAE [experimental allergic encephalomyelitis] as a potential model for MS is its almost total inability to point toward a meaningful therapy or therapeutic approach for MS."" Actually, EAE has led directly to the development of three therapies approved for use in multiple sclerosis (MS): glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, and natalizumab. Several new approaches to MS are in clinical trials based on positive indications in preclinical work relying on EAE. New clues to the pathogenesis of MS and new potential surrogate markers for MS are shown from research involving EAE when it is critically coupled with actual findings in MS. There are pitfalls in overreliance on the EAE model, or on any animal model for any human disease. Nevertheless, over the past 73 years, the EAE model has proved itself remarkably useful for aiding research on MS. View details for Nogo in multiple sclerosis: Growing roles of a growth inhibitor Symposium on Cognitive Decline in Multiple Sclerosis In recent years, knowledge about the physiological functions of the Nogo-A protein has grown considerably, and this molecule has evolved from being one of the most important axonal regrowth inhibitors present in central nervous system (CNS) myelin, to several other potentially important roles in different areas such as nervous system development, epilepsy, vascular physiology, muscle pathology and CNS tumors. Therapeutically, targeting the Nogo-A protein by means of the immune response has been tried in an attempt to block neurite growth inhibition and promote regeneration in spinal cord injury models; the immune response to Nogo-A, however, has not been extensively studied. We propose to review recent evidence that Nogo-A may also play an important role in autoimmune demyelinating diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis, including that Nogo-66 derived epitopes are encephalitogenic antigens in susceptible mouse strains, and that the immune response to Nogo-66 antigens includes both strong T cell and B cell activation, with epitope spreading of the antibody response to other myelin molecules. In CNS immunotherapy, careful targeting of neural self-antigens is a prerequisite in order to avoid unexpected deleterious effects, and increasing knowledge about the immune response to Nogo-A may provide a safe basis for the development of relevant therapeutic alternatives for several neurological conditions. View details for Emerging therapeutic targets in multiple sclerosis The aim of this review is to describe the recent findings regarding the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and their translation to new therapies.Basic research is providing new insights into the immune elements involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, both in the periphery as well as in the central nervous system. Unveiling the complex interplay of the molecules involved in the immunological cascade of the disease supplies new targets for the development of new immunotherapeutic strategies. Similarly, clinical studies and identification of distinct subgroups of patients based on their responsiveness to immunotherapies provides support for the existence of immunopathological disease subtypes that seem to require different therapeutic approaches. These studies extend the theoretical basis that facilitates development of neuroprotective and repair-promoting therapeutic strategies.The application of novel and cutting-edge technologies in the fields of genomics and proteomics is providing a better understanding of the genetic and environmental factors involved in multiple sclerosis susceptibility and progression, as well as the detection of biomarkers for disease activity and response to therapy. Implementation of these facilitates identification of new targets for therapy towards tailoring treatment to the individual patient with multiple sclerosis. View details for Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and multiple sclerosis: Lessons from natalizumab Three patients have developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy while being treated with natalizumab for their autoimmune diseases. One patient had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), one had Crohn's disease, and one (who had been enrolled in an RRMS phase III trial) had no evidence of multiple sclerosis on autopsy. The patient with RRMS now has severe, permanent neurologic damage and the other two patients died. In this article, we recommend revised entry and diagnostic criteria to prevent enrollment of RRMS patients with a favorable prognosis or questionable diagnosis into trials of drugs with unknown safety profiles. In light of the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, we strongly recommend that RRMS patients who are at low risk of disability not be treated with natalizumab. Finally, we discuss what additional natalizumab efficacy data need to be presented before any decisions should be made about treating RRMS patients with a high risk of developing long-term disability.

View details for Statin therapy and autoimmune disease: from protein prenylation to immunomodulation Statins have been prescribed extensively for their cholesterol-lowering properties and efficacy in cardiovascular disease. However, compelling evidence now exists that statins also have extensive immunomodulatory properties that operate independently of lipid lowering. Consequently, much attention has been directed towards their potential as therapeutic agents for the treatment of autoimmune disease. Modulation of post-translational protein prenylation seems to be a key mechanism by which statins alter immune function. In this Review, the effect of statin therapy on immune function, and how this relates to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, is reviewed alongside current opinion of what the key biological targets of statins are.

Disturbances in crosstalk between the immune system and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) can contribute to the pathogenesis of Th1-mediated autoimmunity. Recent studies indicate that neuropeptide Y (NPY) has a major role in the regulation of Th1 responses. The precise role of NPY has been an enigma, but a recent study provides a breakthrough, demonstrating that NPY has a bimodal role as a negative regulator of T cells and an activator of antigen-presenting cell function.

C., Hemmer, B., Prod'homme, T., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. One approach to improving efficacy in MS therapy is to identify medications that provide additive or synergistic benefit in combination. Orally administered cholesterol-lowering HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (known as statins), which exhibit immunomodulatory properties and are effective in treatment of the MS model EAE, are being tested in MS. As atorvastatin can enhance protective Th2 responses and has a different mechanism of action than glatiramer acetate (GA), a parenterally administered immunomodulatory agent approved for MS treatment, we tested whether the combination of these agents could be beneficial in EAE. Combination therapy using suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and GA prevented or reversed clinical and histologic EAE. Secretion of proinflammatory Th1 cytokines was reduced--and conversely Th2 cytokine secretion was increased--in these mice, but not in mice treated with each drug alone at the same doses. Monocytes treated with the combination of suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and GA secreted an antiinflammatory type II cytokine pattern and, when used as APCs, promoted Th2 differentiation of naive myelin-specific T cells. Our results demonstrate that agents with different mechanisms of immune modulation can combine in a synergistic manner for the treatment of CNS autoimmunity and provide rationale for testing the combination of atorvastatin and GA in MS.

L., Matarese, G., Ohtsu, H., GALLI, S. J., Mantegazza, R., Steinman, L., Pedotti, R. Histamine can modulate the cytokine network and influence Th1 and Th2 balance and Ab-isotype switching. Thus, pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of specific histamine receptors has been shown to reduce the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a prototypic Th1-mediated disease with similarities to human multiple sclerosis. To study the comprehensive contribution of endogenous histamine to the expression of EAE, we attempted to induce EAE in histidine decarboxylase-deficient mice, which are genetically unable to make histamine. In this study, we show that EAE is significantly more severe in HDC-/-, histamine-deficient mice, with diffuse inflammatory infiltrates, including a prevalent granulocytic component, in the brain and cerebellum. Unlike splenocytes from wild-type mice, splenocytes from HDC-/- mice do not produce histamine in response to the myelin Ag, whereas production of IFN-gamma, TNF, and leptin are increased in HDC-/- splenocytes in comparison to those from wild-type mice. Endogenous histamine thus appears to regulate importantly the autoimmune response against myelin and the expression of EAE, in this model, and to limit immune damage to the CNS. Understanding which receptor(s) for histamine is/are involved in regulating autoimmunity against the CNS might help in the development of new strategies of treatment for EAE and multiple sclerosis.

H., Steinman, L. Targeting pathogenic T cells with Ag-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines encoding autoantigens is a powerful and feasible therapeutic strategy for Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. However, plasmid DNA contains abundant unmethylated CpG motifs, which induce a strong Th1 immune response. We describe here a novel approach to counteract this undesired side effect of plasmid DNA used for vaccination in Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. In chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), combining a myelin cocktail plus IL-4-tolerizing DNA vaccine with a suppressive GpG oligodeoxynucleotide (GpG-ODN) induced a shift of the autoreactive T cell response toward a protective Th2 cytokine pattern. Myelin microarrays demonstrate that tolerizing DNA vaccination plus GpG-ODN further decreased anti-myelin autoantibody epitope spreading and shifted the autoreactive B cell response to a protective IgG1 isotype. Moreover, the addition of GpG-ODN to tolerizing DNA vaccination therapy effectively reduced overall mean disease severity in both the chronic relapsing EAE and chronic progressive EAE mouse models. In conclusion, suppressive GpG-ODN effectively counteracted the undesired CpG-induced inflammatory effect of a tolerizing DNA vaccine in a Th1-mediated autoimmune disease by skewing both the autoaggressive T cell and B cell responses toward a protective Th2 phenotype. These results demonstrate that suppressive GpG-ODN is a simple and highly effective novel therapeutic adjuvant that will boost the efficacy of Ag-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines used for treating Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. Virtues and pitfalls of EAE for the development of therapies for multiple sclerosis Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a useful model for aiding the development of new treatments for MS. All therapies approved for MS ameliorate EAE. Two approved medications, glatiramer acetate and Natalizumab, were developed directly from studies in EAE. Several trials are ongoing in MS after success in EAE, including altered peptide ligands of myelin, DNA vaccines and statins. However, EAE has failed to predict the outcome of certain approaches. The reasons underlying such failures are discussed here.

In the management of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), providers are all faced with the highly formidable challenge of ascertaining whether, and to what degree, disease-modifying therapy is effective in the individual patient. While much has been learned in randomized, controlled clinical trials, we cannot simply extrapolate the outcomes of these initiatives and apply them to the care of a single patient. In the future, the application of pharmacogenetic techniques, proteomics, and microarray analysis will yield novel profiling information on individual patients that will substantially refine the specific therapeutic questions of relevance: (1) What is the best treatment for an individual patient? (2) Which patients require intensive therapeutic combination regimens to optimize control of the disease process? (3) What are the appropriate drug dosing targets for an individual patient? and (4) Which patients will be predisposed to the development of drug-related adverse events? Such data may provide a novel variable of drug responsiveness that will mandate its inclusion into the process of covariate analyses for clinical trials. View details for Antigen-specific therapies in multiple sclerosis: Going beyond proteins and peptides Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex immune-mediated disease resulting largely from an autoimmune attack against components of central nervous system myelin, including several proteins and lipids. Knowledge about the details of this anomalous immune response has come mostly from studies in the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this model, it has been possible to prevent and effectively treat established disease through several antigen-specific therapeutic strategies, which have included administration of whole myelin or myelin proteins by various routes, random copolymers consisting of the main major histocompatability complex (MHC) and T-cell receptor (TCR) contact amino acid residues, altered peptide ligands of dominant myelin epitopes in which one or more residues are selectively substituted, and lately DNA vaccination encoding self-myelin antigens. However, there have been difficulties in making successful transitions from animal models to human clinical trials, due either to lack of efficacy or unforeseen complications. Despite these problems, antigen-specific therapies have retained their attraction for clinicians and scientists alike, and hopefully the upcoming generation of agents--including altered peptide ligands and DNA vaccines--will benefit from the increasing knowledge about this disease and surmount existing difficulties to make an impact in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

Major advancements have been achieved in our ability to diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS) and to commence treatment intervention with agents that can favorably affect the disease course. Although MS exacerbations and the emergence of disability constitute the more conspicuous aspects of the disease process, evidence has confirmed that most of the disease occurs on a constitutive and occult basis. Disease-modifying therapies appear to be modest in the magnitude of their treatment effects, particularly in the progressive stage of the disease. Therapeutic strategies currently used for MS primarily target the inflammatory cascade. Several potential mechanisms appear to be involved in the progression of MS. Characterizing these mechanisms will result in a better understanding of the various forms of the disorder and how to effectively treat its clinical manifestations. It is our objective within this 2-part series on progression in MS to offer both evidence-based observations and hypothesis-driven expert perspectives on what constitutes the cause of progression in MS. We have chosen areas of inquiry that appear to have been most productive in helping us to better conceptualize the landscape of what MS looks like pathologically, immunologically, neuroscientifically, radiographically, and genetically. We have attempted to advance hypotheses focused on a deeper understanding of what contributes to the progression of this illness and to illustrate new technical capabilities that are catalyzing novel research initiatives targeted at achieving a more complete understanding of progression in MS.

Nogo-66, the extracellular 66 aa loop of the Nogo-A protein found in CNS myelin, interacts with the Nogo receptor and has been proposed to mediate inhibition of axonal regrowth. It has been shown that immunization with Nogo-A promotes recovery in animal models of spinal cord injury through induction of Ab production. In this report, studies were performed to characterize the immune response to Nogo-66 and to determine the role of Nogo in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Immunization of EAE-susceptible mouse strains with peptides derived from Nogo-66 induced a CNS immune response with clinical and pathological similarities to EAE. The Nogo-66 peptides elicited strong T cell responses that were not cross-reactive to other encephalitogenic myelin Ags. Using a large scale spotted microarray containing proteins and peptides derived from a wide spectrum of myelin components, we demonstrated that Nogo-66 peptides also generated a specific Ab response that spreads to several other encephalitogenic myelin Ags following immunization. Nogo-66-specific T cell lines ameliorated established EAE, via Nogo-66-specific Th2 cells that entered the CNS. These results indicate that some T cell and B cell immune responses to Nogo-66 are associated with suppression of ongoing EAE, whereas other Nogo-66 epitopes can be encephalitogenic. The multifaceted role of transglutaminase in neurodegeneration: Review article 8th International Congress on Amino Acids and Proteins A critical role for transglutaminase [TGase] has been hypothesized in the pathogenesis of the CAG trinucleotide repeat diseases, characterized by proteins with abnormal expansions of a polyglutamine domain. In the last few years the involvement of TGase in neurodegenerative diseases [NDS], including its role in aggregate formation, has been broadened to include Alzheimer's [AD] and Parkinson's Disease [PD]. It is clear that reduction of TGase activity is beneficial for prolonged survival in mouse models of NDS. The pathological progression of these diseases might reflect in part increases of TGase induced aggregates, or changes in other pathways influenced by increases in TGase activity. Neurodegeneration may be influenced by increased TGase activity affecting apoptosis, modulation of GTPase activity and signal transduction. This review will focus on the leading hypotheses in relation to both old and new experimental results.

Numerous groups have now validated high-throughput approaches to autoantibody profiling in a variety of systems. Recently, we have used autoantigen microarray technology to identify distinct autoantibody profiles in H-2 congenic MRL/lpr mice (Sekine et al., manuscript in preparation), and we are expanding this platform to study human and mouse models of IDDM and RA. We are also developing protein arrays for multiplex analysis of serum antibody isotypes. Multiplexed methods for autoantibody profiling will undoubtedly continue to uncover novel aspects of autoimmunity and B cell biology. It is now time to move these technologies beyond the proof-of-concept phase, and start addressing the next series of important questions. These include, but certainly are not limited to: identifying ""autoantibody signatures"" associated with disease state or outcome; profiling autoantibodies during the natural course of murine and human disease; and monitoring changes in autoantibody profiles of patients in response to therapeutic intervention. However, the next set of challenges is just right around the corner. As data and statistical analysis tools become more robust, it will be possible to generate and approach new hypotheses at an unprecedented pace.

S. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (ie, statins) are oral cholesterol-lowering drugs. Statins are well tolerated and have an excellent safety record. These agents competitively inhibit HMG CoA reductase, which is the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to L-mevalonate. Although L-mevalonate is a key intermediate in cholesterol synthesis, several of its metabolites are involved in post-translational modification of specific proteins involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Thus, independent of their cholesterol-reducing properties, statins have important pleiotropic biologic effects. Recent reports indicate that statins have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Whether statins will be of clinical benefit for patients with multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system will only be known after they are evaluated in prospective randomized clinical trials.

View details for Genomic and proteomic analysis of multiple sclerosis - Opinion Multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune diseases result from the dysregulation of genetic and proteomic programs. In MS, the loss of immune homeostasis leads to aberrant targeting and destruction of the myelin sheath, which manifests as the clinical syndrome of MS. The advent of technologies to perform large-scale analysis of mRNA transcript and protein expression will transform our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of MS, and will yield new targets for therapeutic intervention. An immunomodulatory GpG oligonucleotide for the treatment of autoimmunity via the innate and adaptive immune systems Ho, P. P., Fontoura, P., Ruiz, P. J., Steinman, L., Garren, H. Bacterial DNA and immunostimulatory CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) activate the innate immune system to produce proinflammatory cytokines. Shown to be potent Th1-like adjuvants, stimulatory CpG motifs are currently used as effective therapeutic vaccines for various animal models of infectious diseases, tumors, allergies, and autoimmune diseases. In this study, we show that the application of an immunomodulatory GpG ODN, with a single base switch from CpG to GpG, can effectively inhibit the activation of Th1 T cells associated with autoimmune disease. Moreover, this immunomodulatory GpG ODN suppresses the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice, a prototypic Th1-mediated animal disease model for multiple sclerosis.

S. 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, 'statins' are widely used oral cholesterol-lowering drugs. Statins competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of HMG-CoA to L-mevalonate, a key intermediate in cholesterol synthesis. Certain metabolites of mevalonate are also involved in posttranslational modification of specific proteins involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Thus, statins have important biologic effects that may be independent of their cholesterol-reducing properties. Recent studies indicate that statins have antiinflammatory and neuroprotective properties which may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis as well as other central nervous system (CNS) neurodegenerative diseases. This article will outline current experimental evidence that may suggest potential clinical benefits for patients with CNS autoimmune disorders. Ultimately, clinical trials will have to determine the safety and efficacy of statins in this patient population. View details for Protein arrays for autoantibody profiling and fine-specificity mapping Protein arrays provide a powerful approach to study autoimmune disease. Autoimmune responses activate B cells to produce autoantibodies that recognize self-molecules termed autoantigens, many of which are proteins or protein complexes. Protein arrays enable profiling of the specificity of autoantibody responses against panels of peptides and proteins representing known autoantigens as well as candidate autoantigens. In addition to identifying autoantigens and mapping immunodominant epitopes, proteomic analysis of autoantibody responses will further enable diagnosis, prognosis, and tailoring of antigen-specific tolerizing therapy. Statins and their potential targets in multiple sclerosis therapy Stuve, O., Prod'homme, T., Slavin, A., Youssef, S., Dunn, S., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a CNS-demyelinating disease characterised by relapsing and chronic neurological impairment. While traditionally CNS autoantigen-specific CD4(+) T cells have been considered the culprits in the initial phase of the disease, recent observations have altered this concept. It is now recognised that other T lymphocyte subclasses can initiate CNS demyelination. In addition, other cell types and molecules may play an important role in MS pathogenesis. There is overwhelming evidence that MS is a dynamic process, in which recurrent episodes of blood-brain barrier disruption and CNS inflammation play a crucial role in early disease stages, leading eventually to the largely irreversible changes of demyelination, gliosis and axonal degeneration. These observations may have important therapeutic implications. Within the last ten years, several medications have been approved for MS treatment. These agents, all of which are given parenterally, are only partially effective and are often associated with adverse effects and potential toxicities. The number and different types of medications used for MS are likely to increase in the near future, as several novel therapies are currently tested in clinical trials. 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, 'statins', are cholesterol-lowering drugs that are given orally, are safe and have biological effects independent of their cholesterol-reducing properties. Recent reports have shown that statins have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties that may be beneficial in the treatment of MS. This article will outline experimental evidence that suggests potential clinical benefits of statins for MS patients.

E., Amara, R. R., Steinman, L., Utz, P. J., Robinson, H. L., Robinson, W. H. We developed antigen microarrays to profile the breadth, strength, and kinetics of epitope-specific antiviral antibody responses in vaccine trials with a simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. These arrays contained 430 distinct proteins and overlapping peptides spanning the SHIV proteome. In macaques vaccinated with three different DNA and/or recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA) vaccines encoding Gag-Pol or Gag-Pol-Env, these arrays distinguished vaccinated from challenged macaques, identified three novel viral epitopes, and predicted survival. Following viral challenge, anti-SHIV antibody responses ultimately converged to target eight immunodominant B-cell regions in Env regardless of vaccine regimen, host histocompatibility type, and divergent T-cell specificities. After challenge, responses to nonimmunodominant epitopes were transient, while responses to dominant epitopes were gained. These data suggest that the functional diversity of anti-SHIV B-cell responses is highly limited in the presence of persisting antigen.

P., Amor, S., Olsson, T., Utz, P. J., Garren, H., Steinman, L. The diversity of autoimmune responses poses a formidable challenge to the development of antigen-specific tolerizing therapy. We developed 'myelin proteome' microarrays to profile the evolution of autoantibody responses in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis (MS). Increased diversity of autoantibody responses in acute EAE predicted a more severe clinical course. Chronic EAE was associated with previously undescribed extensive intra- and intermolecular epitope spreading of autoreactive B-cell responses. Array analysis of autoantigens targeted in acute EAE was used to guide the choice of autoantigen cDNAs to be incorporated into expression plasmids so as to generate tolerizing vaccines. Tolerizing DNA vaccines encoding a greater number of array-determined myelin targets proved superior in treating established EAE and reduced epitope spreading of autoreactive B-cell responses. Proteomic monitoring of autoantibody responses provides a useful approach to monitor autoimmune disease and to develop and tailor disease- and patient-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines. Diverse targets for intervention during inflammatory and neurodegenerative phases of multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease that causes relapsing and chronic neurologic impairment. Recent observations have altered certain traditional concepts regarding MS pathogenesis. A greater diversity of cell types and molecules involved in MS is now evident. While remyelination can occur during the early inflammatory phase when damage may be reversible, it is impaired in the later stages, which involve axonal death. These observations have important therapeutic implications. View details for Osteopontin polymorphisms and disease course in multiple sclerosis Caillier, S., Barcellos, L. F., Baranzini, S. E., Swerdlin, A., Lincoln, R. R., Steinman, L., Martin, E., Haines, J. L., Pericak-Vance, M., Hauser, S. L., Oksenberg, J. R. Osteopontin (OPN), also known as early T-cell activating gene (Eta-1), has been recently shown to be a critical factor in the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and perhaps multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we investigated whether the 327T/C, 795C/T, 1128A/G or 1284A/C single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the OPN gene were correlated with susceptibility or any of the several clinical end points in a cohort of 821 MS patients. Overall, we observed no evidence of genetic association between the OPN polymorphisms and MS. Although not reaching statistical significance, a modest trend for association with disease course was detected in patients carrying at least one wild-type 1284A allele, suggesting an effect on disease course. Patients with this genotype were less likely to have a mild disease course and were at increased risk for a secondary-progressive clinical type. View details for Statins as potential therapeutic agents in neuroinflammatory disorders Stuve, O., Youssef, S., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Multiple sclerosis is a central nervous system inflammatory demyelinating disease that is thought to have an autoimmune pathogenesis. Recent results indicate that 'statins', 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, which are the most commonly used oral cholesterol-lowering drugs, have immunomodulatory properties. In this article we will review those findings that indicate that statins may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative disease, and ischemic stroke.It was reported that statin treatment could either inhibit or reverse chronic and relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model of multiple sclerosis. Several immunomodulatory properties of statins may account for their beneficial clinical effect: Statins decreased the migration of leukocytes into the central nervous system, inhibited MHC class II and costimulatory signals required for activation of proinflammatory T cells, induced a T(H)2 phenotype in T cells, and decreased the expression of inflammatory mediators in the central nervous system, including nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor alpha. It was also demonstrated that statin use significantly reduced beta-amyloid secretion in the cerebrospinal fluid of experimental animals. Clinically, there is emerging evidence that statins have beneficial effects in patients with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and ischemic stroke.In-vitro studies have indicated that statins may have anti-inflammatory properties. Results from in-vivo animal models suggest that statins may be beneficial in treatment of different central nervous system conditions. Larger scale, randomized, double-blind trials are needed to validate the role of statins as a treatment of inflammatory central nervous system diseases.

Despite an appreciation of the large number of pathways and pathological processes that are involved in these diseases, a few practical targets and several new strategies have emerged from these studies. This review focuses on multiple sclerosis and on the approaches that are being used to identify new targets that might be manipulated to control this disease.

Pedotti, R., Sanna, M., Tsai, M., DeVoss, J., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H., Galli, S. J. Insulin dependent (i.e., ""type 1"") diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is considered to be a T cell mediated disease in which TH1 and Tc autoreactive cells attack the pancreatic islets. Among the beta-cell antigens implicated in T1DM, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 appears to play a key role in the development of T1DM in humans as well as in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, the experimental model for this disease. It has been shown that shifting the immune response to this antigen from TH1 towards TH2, via the administration of GAD65 peptides to young NOD mice, can suppress the progression to overt T1DM. Accordingly, various protocols of ""peptide immunotherapy"" of T1DM are under investigation. However, in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), another autoimmune TH1 mediated disease that mimics human multiple sclerosis, anaphylactic shock can occur when the mice are challenged with certain myelin self peptides that initially were administered with adjuvant to induce the disease.Here we show that NOD mice, that spontaneously develop T1DM, can develop fatal anaphylactic reactions upon challenge with preparations of immunodominant GAD65 self peptides after immunization with these peptides to modify the development of T1DM.These findings document severe anaphylaxis to self peptide preparations used in an attempt to devise immunotherapy for a spontaneous autoimmune disease. Taken together with the findings in EAE, these results suggest that peptide therapies designed to induce a TH1 to TH2 shift carry a risk for the development of anaphylactic reactivity to the therapeutic peptides. Multiple elements of the allergic arm of the immune response modulate autoimmune demyelination PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Pedotti, R., DeVoss, J. J., Youssef, S., Mitchell, D., Wedemeyer, J., Madanat, R., Garren, H., Fontoura, P., Tsai, M., GALLI, S. J., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L. Analysis of mRNA from multiple sclerosis lesions revealed increased amounts of transcripts for several genes encoding molecules traditionally associated with allergic responses, including prostaglandin D synthase, histamine receptor type 1 (H1R), platelet activating factor receptor, Ig Fc epsilon receptor 1 (Fc epsilon RI), and tryptase. We now demonstrate that, in the animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), mediated by T helper 1 (Th1) T cells, histamine receptor 1 and 2 (H1R and H2R) are present on inflammatory cells in brain lesions. Th1 cells reactive to myelin proteolipid protein expressed more H1R and less H2R than Th2 cells. Pyrilamine, an H1R antagonist, blocked EAE, and the platelet activating factor receptor antagonist CV6209 reduced the severity of EAE. EAE severity was also decreased in mice with disruption of the genes encoding Ig Fc gamma RIII or both Fc gamma RIII and Fc epsilon RI. Prostaglandin D synthase and tryptase transcripts were elevated in EAE brain. Taken together, these data reveal extensive involvement of elements of the immune response associated with allergy in autoimmune demyelination. The pathogenesis of demyelination must now be viewed as encompassing elements of both Th1 responses and ""allergic"" responses.

View details for Protein and peptide array analysis of autoimmune disease Molecular cloning, sequencing of the human genome, and other major advances in biomedical research have contributed substantially to our understanding of autoimmune disease. Nevertheless, to date, such advances have failed to reveal the etiology of or yield curative therapies for autoimmune disease. New approaches are needed. Proteomics, the large-scale study of expression and function of proteins that compose our tissues and mediate disease, represents a powerful and promising strategy. We developed protein and peptide arrays to profile autoantibody responses in autoimmune disease. Protein and peptide array analysis of autoimmune samples is revealing human and pathogen proteins involved in initiation and perpetuation of autoimmunity. Proteomic determination of autoantibody profiles can be utilized for diagnosis, prognostication, and guiding tolerizing therapy for autoimmune disease. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, promotes a Th2 bias and reverses paralysis in central nervous system autoimmune disease Youssef, S., Stuve, O., Patarroyo, J. C., Ruiz, P. J., Radosevich, J. L., Hur, E. M., Bravo, M., Mitchell, D. J., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, which are approved for cholesterol reduction, may also be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Atorvastatin (Lipitor) was tested in chronic and relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a CD4(+) Th1-mediated central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease model of multiple sclerosis. Here we show that oral atorvastatin prevented or reversed chronic and relapsing paralysis. Atorvastatin induced STAT6 phosphorylation and secretion of Th2 cytokines (interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-10) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Conversely, STAT4 phosphorylation was inhibited and secretion of Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) was suppressed. Atorvastatin promoted differentiation of Th0 cells into Th2 cells. In adoptive transfer, these Th2 cells protected recipient mice from EAE induction. Atorvastatin reduced CNS infiltration and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression. Treatment of microglia inhibited IFN-gamma-inducible transcription at multiple MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) promoters and suppressed class II upregulation. Atorvastatin suppressed IFN-gamma-inducible expression of CD40, CD80 and CD86 co-stimulatory molecules. l-Mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase, reversed atorvastatin's effects on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and T cells. Atorvastatin treatment of either APC or T cells suppressed antigen-specific T-cell activation. Thus, atorvastatin has pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects involving both APC and T-cell compartments.

C., von Budingen, H. C., Yousef, S., Bowen, J. D., Genain, C. P., Hauser, S. L., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Pharmacotherapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) advanced with the demonstration that interferon beta and glatiramer acetate improve the clinical course of this disease. Mitoxantrone is the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of secondary progressive MS. Despite this progress, the agents presently available are only partially effective, are difficult to administer, and may have significant side effects. Several orally administered immunomodulatory agents are presently being evaluated for treatment of MS. One class of drugs, HMG CoA inhibitors (statins), is safe and well-tolerated and could become another mainstay of MS therapy.This article reviews the clinical evidence for approved MS therapies and discusses their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, the clinical and laboratory data suggesting a potential role for statins in MS therapy are discussed.Although treatment with interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, and mitoxantrone, the approved therapies, provide important treatment options for patients with relapsing-remitting MS and secondary progressive MS, the potential benefits of other medications, including statins, should be explored in controlled clinical trials.

J., Steinman, L. Women with multiple sclerosis have significantly diminished disease activity during pregnancy. The purpose of our study was to identify the underlying mechanism for the diminished disease activity. We found that during the period of late pregnancy there is protection against paralysis, during both the induction and effector phases of relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. We did not find any changes in the cytokine secretion profiles or the proliferative activity of autoreactive T cells from mice induced during late pregnancy compared with virgin controls. In mice mated after disease onset, the inflammatory histologic lesions did not clear, despite marked clinical improvement during pregnancy. We found evidence for a serum factor present in late pregnancy that suppresses T cell activation. In the presence of sera taken from mice late in pregnancy, the proliferative response and IL-2 production of proteolipid protein p139-151-specific T cells were significantly diminished as compared with stimulation in the presence of normal mouse sera. In conclusion, serum from late pregnancy has the capacity to down-regulate T cell responses and might be associated with the amelioration of disease activity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

The development of vaccines is arguably the most significant achievement in medicine to date. The practice of innoculation with the fluid from a sore to protect from a disease actually dates back to ancient China; however, with the introduction of Jenner's smallpox vaccine, and greater understanding of the immune system, vaccines have become specific and systematic. Traditional vaccines have used killed pathogens (hepatitis A and the Salk polio vaccines), immunogenic subunits of a given pathogen (hepatitis B subunit vaccine), or live attenuated pathogens (measles, mumps, rubella, Sabin polio vaccines) to generate protective immunity. Currently, a new generation of vaccines that use the genetic material of a pathogen to elicit protective immunity are being developed. Although the most widespread and successful use of vaccines today remains in the arena of infectious diseases, manipulations of immune responses to protect against cancers, neurologic diseases, and autoimmunity are being explored rigorously.

J., Oksenberg, J. R., Raine, C. S., Heller, R., Steinman, L. Microarray analysis of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions obtained at autopsy revealed increased transcripts of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 and -17, interferon-gamma and associated downstream pathways. Comparison of two poles of MS pathology--acute lesions with inflammation versus 'silent' lesions without inflammation--revealed differentially transcribed genes. Some products of these genes were chosen as targets for therapy of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is upregulated in acute, but not in chronic, MS lesions, and the effect on ameliorating EAE is more pronounced in the acute phase, in contrast to knocking out the immunoglobulin Fc receptor common gamma chain where the effect is greatest on chronic disease. These results in EAE corroborate the microarray studies on MS lesions. Large-scale analysis of transcripts in MS lesions elucidates new aspects of pathology and opens possibilities for therapy.

We constructed miniaturized autoantigen arrays to perform large-scale multiplex characterization of autoantibody responses directed against structurally diverse autoantigens, using submicroliter quantities of clinical samples. Autoantigen microarrays were produced by attaching hundreds of proteins, peptides and other biomolecules to the surface of derivatized glass slides using a robotic arrayer. Arrays were incubated with patient serum, and spectrally resolvable fluorescent labels were used to detect autoantibody binding to specific autoantigens on the array. We describe and characterize arrays containing the major autoantigens in eight distinct human autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. This represents the first report of application of such technology to multiple human disease sera, and will enable validated detection of antibodies recognizing autoantigens including proteins, peptides, enzyme complexes, ribonucleoprotein complexes, DNA and post-translationally modified antigens. Autoantigen microarrays represent a powerful tool to study the specificity and pathogenesis of autoantibody responses, and to identify and define relevant autoantigens in human autoimmune diseases.

V., Becher, M. W., Springer, J. E., Chabas, D., Youssef, S., Pedotti, R., Mitchell, D., Steinman, L. An expanded polyglutamine domain in huntingtin underlies the pathogenic events in Huntington disease (HD), characterized by chorea, dementia and severe weight loss, culminating in death. Transglutaminase (TGase) may be critical in the pathogenesis, via cross-linking huntingtin. Administration of the TGase competitive inhibitor, cystamine, to transgenic mice expressing exon 1 of huntingtin containing an expanded polyglutamine repeat, altered the course of their HD-like disease. Cystamine given intraperitoneally entered brain where it inhibited TGase activity. When treatment began after the appearance of abnormal movements, cystamine extended survival, reduced associated tremor and abnormal movements and ameliorated weight loss. Treatment did not influence the appearance or frequency of neuronal nuclear inclusions. Unexpectedly, cystamine treatment increased transcription of one of the two genes shown to be neuroprotective for polyglutamine toxicity in Drosophila, dnaj (also known as HDJ1 and Hsp40 in humans and mice, respectively). Inhibition of TGase provides a new treatment strategy for HD and other polyglutamine diseases.

Gamma-glutaminyl-lysyl cross-links have been detected in nuclear inclusions in HD brain, indicating that TGase may play a prominent role in the aggregation of huntingtin (htt).

Pathological-length polyglutamine (Q(n)) expansions, such as those that occur in the huntingtin protein (htt) in Huntington's disease (HD), are excellent substrates for tissue transglutaminase in vitro, and transglutaminase activity is increased in post-mortem HD brain. However, direct evidence for the participation of tissue transglutaminase (or other transglutaminases) in HD patients in vivo is scarce. We now report that levels of N(epsilon)-(gamma-L-glutamyl)-L-lysine (GGEL)--a 'marker' isodipeptide produced by the transglutaminase reaction--are elevated in the CSF of HD patients (708 +/- 41 pmol/mL, SEM, n = 36) vs. control CSF (228 +/- 36, n = 27); p < 0.0001. These data support the hypothesis that transglutaminase activity is increased in HD brain in vivo.

R., Denhardt, D. T., Sobel, R. A., Lock, C., Karpuj, M., Pedotti, R., Heller, R., Oksenberg, J. R., Steinman, L. Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease, characterized by inflammation in the brain and spinal cord, possibly due to autoimmunity. Large-scale sequencing of cDNA libraries, derived from plaques dissected from brains of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), indicated an abundance of transcripts for osteopontin (OPN). Microarray analysis of spinal cords from rats paralyzed by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS, also revealed increased OPN transcripts. Osteopontin-deficient mice were resistant to progressive EAE and had frequent remissions, and myelin-reactive T cells in OPN-/- mice produced more interleukin 10 and less interferon-gamma than in OPN+/+ mice. Osteopontin thus appears to regulate T helper cell-1 (TH1)-mediated demyelinating disease, and it may offer a potential target in blocking development of progressive MS.

J., DeVoss, J. J., Nguyen, L. V., Fontoura, P. P., Hirschberg, D. L., Mitchell, D. J., Garcia, K. C., Steinman, L. T cell-mediated destruction of the myelin sheath causes inflammatory damage of the CNS in multiple sclerosis (MS). The major T and B cell responses in MS patients who are HLA-DR2 (about two-thirds of MS patients) react to a region between residues 84 and 103 of myelin basic protein (1 ). The crystal structure of HLA-DR2 complexed with myelin basic protein(84-102) confirmed that Lys(91) is the major TCR contact site, whereas Phe(90) is a major anchor to MHC and binds the hydrophobic P4 pocket (2 ). We have tested peptides containing repetitive 4-aa sequences designed to bind critical MHC pockets and to interfere with T cell activation. One such sequence, EYYKEYYKEYYK, ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats, an animal model of MS.

Spinal cord injury results in a massive loss of neurons, and thus of function. We recently reported that passive transfer of autoimmune T cells directed against myelin-associated antigens provides acutely damaged spinal cords with effective neuroprotection. The therapeutic time window for the passive transfer of T cells was found to be at least 1 week. Here we show that posttraumatic T cell-based active vaccination is also neuroprotective. Immunization with myelin-associated antigens such as myelin basic protein (MBP) significantly promoted recovery after spinal cord contusion injury in the rat model. To reduce the risk of autoimmune disease while retaining the benefit of the immunization, we vaccinated the rats immediately after severe incomplete spinal cord injury with MBP-derived altered peptide ligands. Immunization with these peptides resulted in significant protection from neuronal loss and thus in a reduced extent of paralysis, assessed by an open-field behavioral test. Retrograde labeling of the rubrospinal tracts and magnetic resonance imaging supported the behavioral results. Further optimization of nonpathogenic myelin-derived peptides can be expected to lead the way to the development of an effective therapeutic vaccination protocol as a strategy for the prevention of total paralysis after incomplete spinal cord injury. View details for Immunization with DNA encoding an immunodominant peptide of insulin prevents diabetes in NOD mice Urbanek-Ruiz, I., Ruiz, P. J., Paragas, V., Garren, H., Steinman, L., Fathman, C. G. DNA vaccination is an effective means of protecting experimental animals against infectious pathogens and cancer and has more recently been used to prevent autoimmune disease. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an autoimmune disease characterized by T-cell-mediated destruction of the insulin-secreting beta cells in the pancreas. The NOD mouse is an animal model of IDDM in which several autoantigens, including insulin, have been identified. In this study we demonstrate that vaccination of NOD mice with DNA encoding an immunodominant peptide of insulin (residues 9-23 of the B chain) protects the animals from developing diabetes. Animals injected intramuscularly with a bacterial plasmid encoding the insulin B chain peptide show significantly lower disease incidence and delayed onset of disease when compared to controls. Protection appears to be mediated by insulin B (9-23)-specific down-regulation of IFN-gamma. Our results confirm that DNA vaccination has a protective effect on autoimmunity, the understanding of which will reveal new insights into the immune system and open doors for novel therapies.

A., Fontoura, P., Nguyen, L. V., Estline, E. R., Hirschberg, D. L., Steinman, L. Using a combination of local gene delivery and tolerizing DNA vaccination, we demonstrate that codelivery of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) gene and a DNA vaccine encoding the self-peptide proteolipid protein 139-151 (PLP139-151) provides protective immunity against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We provide evidence for a mechanism whereby IL-4 expressed from the naked DNA is secreted and acts locally on autoreactive T cells via activation of STAT6 to shift their cytokine profile to T helper 2. We also show that DNA vaccines can be used to reverse established EAE by covaccination with the genes for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and IL-4. This treatment strategy combines the antigen-specific effects of DNA vaccination and the beneficial effects of local gene delivery.

View details for Antigen specific immunotherapy of multiple sclerosis The development of antigen specific therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS) involves specifically suppressing undesired immune responses targeting the myelin sheath and underlying axon. We have recently reported some success with altered peptide ligands for a major target of the autoimmune response in MS. Antigen specific therapy has the potential to suppress undesirable autoimmunity, while leaving the rest of the immune system intact. Induction of an antigen specific Th1-to-Th2 shift could achieve this aim, once side effects, such as allergic responses, are minimized with optimal dosing. View details for An unexpected version of horror autotoxicus: anaphylactic shock to a self peptide Pedotti, R., Mitchell, D., Wedemeyer, J., Karpuj, M., Chabas, D., Hattab, E. M., Tsai, M., GALLI, S. J., Steinman, L. EAE can refer either to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis or experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Although EAE is classically a prototypic T helper 1 (TH1) cell-mediated autoimmune disease, it can also be induced by TH2 cells. Characteristically, the most severe manifestation of allergy, anaphylaxis, is associated with exposure to a foreign antigen that is often derived from medication, insect venom or food. We report here that, after self-tolerance to myelin is destroyed, anaphylaxis may be triggered by a self-antigen, in this case a myelin peptide. ""Horror autotoxicus"", which was initially described by Ehrlich, may not only include autoimmunity to self, it may also encompass immediate hypersensitivity to self, which leads to shock and rapid death.

A., Mitchell, D. J., Pattabiraman, K., Pelkey, E. T., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. Certain proteins contain subunits that enable their active translocation across the plasma membrane into cells. In the specific case of HIV-1, this subunit is the basic domain Tat(49-57) (RKKRRQRRR). To establish the optimal structural requirements for this translocation process, and thereby to develop improved molecular transporters that could deliver agents into cells, a series of analogues of Tat(49-57) were prepared and their cellular uptake into Jurkat cells was determined by flow cytometry. All truncated and alanine-substituted analogues exhibited diminished cellular uptake, suggesting that the cationic residues of Tat(49-57) play a principal role in its uptake. Charge alone, however, is insufficient for transport as oligomers of several cationic amino acids (histidine, lysine, and ornithine) are less effective than Tat(49-57) in cellular uptake. In contrast, a 9-mer of l-arginine (R9) was 20-fold more efficient than Tat(49-57) at cellular uptake as determined by Michaelis-Menton kinetic analysis. The d-arginine oligomer (r9) exhibited an even greater uptake rate enhancement (>100-fold). Collectively, these studies suggest that the guanidinium groups of Tat(49-57) play a greater role in facilitating cellular uptake than either charge or backbone structure. Based on this analysis, we designed and synthesized a class of polyguanidine peptoid derivatives. Remarkably, the subset of peptoid analogues containing a six-methylene spacer between the guanidine head group and backbone (N-hxg), exhibited significantly enhanced cellular uptake compared to Tat(49-57) and even to r9. Overall, a transporter has been developed that is superior to Tat(49-57), protease resistant, and more readily and economically prepared. View details for Polyarginine enters cells more efficiently than other polycationic homopolymers Mitchell, D. J., Kim, D. T., Steinman, L., Fathman, C. G., Rothbard, J. B. Homopolymers or peptides containing a high percentage of cationic amino acids have been shown to have a unique ability to cross the plasma membrane of cells, and consequently have been used to facilitate the uptake of a variety of biopolymers and small molecules. To investigate whether the polycationic character of these molecules, or some other structural feature, was the molecular basis for the effect, the ability of a variety of homopolymers to enter cells was assayed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Polymers of L- or D-arginine containing six or more amino acids entered cells far more effectively than polymers of equal length composed of lysine, ornithine and histidine. Peptides of fewer than six amino acids were ineffective. The length of the arginine side-chain could be varied without significant loss of activity. These data combined with the inability of polymers of citrulline to enter cells demonstrated that the guanidine headgroup of arginine was the critical structural component responsible for the biological activity. Cellular uptake could be inhibited by preincubation of the cells with sodium azide, but not by low temperature (3 degrees C), indicating that the process was energy dependent, but did not involve endocytosis.

In this 'double-blind', randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial, we compared an altered peptide ligand of myelin basic protein with placebo, evaluating their safety and influence on magnetic resonance imaging in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. A safety board suspended the trial because of hypersensitivity reactions in 9% of the patients. There were no increases in either clinical relapses or in new enhancing lesions in any patient, even those with hypersensitivity reactions. Secondary analysis of those patients completing the study showed that the volume and number of enhancing lesions were reduced at a dose of 5 mg. There was also a regulatory type 2 T helper-cell response to altered peptide ligand that cross-reacted with the native peptide.

A., Gijbels, K., Tropper, F. D., Bednarski, M., Li, K. C., Steinman, L. The expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules in the intact brains of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) was visualized by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) through the use of a new, target-specific MR contrast agent. Antibody-conjugated paramagnetic liposomes (ACPLs) were designed to achieve in vivo targeting of molecules expressed on vascular endothelium, while providing sufficient signal enhancement at these sites for detection by MRI. ACPLs targeted to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), an endothelial leukocyte receptor upregulated on cerebral microvasculature during EAE, were administered to diseased mice. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that fluorescently-tagged ACPLs were localized to central nervous system (CNS) microvasculature in a pattern consistent with ICAM-1 upregulation described immunohistochemically. High resolution MRI of mouse brains ex vivo demonstrated that ACPL binding conferred significant enhancement of signal intensity (SI) as compared to control images. These results suggest that ACPLs can be used as MRI contrast agents to visualize specific molecules expressed on vascular endothelium during disease.

W., Hirschberg, D. L., Xiao, J., Lu, Q., Roederer, M., Lock, C. B., Herzenberg, L. A., Steinman, L., Herzenberg, L. A. Multigenic programs controlling susceptibility to apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation have not yet been defined. Here, using DNA microarrays, we show gene expression patterns in an apoptosis-sensitive and apoptosis-resistant murine B cell lymphoma model system both before and after irradiation. From the 11,000 genes interrogated by the arrays, two major patterns emerged. First, before radiation exposure the radioresistant LYar cells expressed significantly greater levels of message for several genes involved in regulating intracellular redox potential. Compared with LYas cells, LYar cells express 20- to 50-fold more mRNA for the tetraspanin CD53 and for fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Expression of both of these genes can lead to the increase of total cellular glutathione, which is the principle intracellular antioxidant and has been shown to inhibit many forms of apoptosis. A second pattern emerged after radiation, when the apoptosis-sensitive LYas cells induced rapid expression of a unique cluster of genes characterized by their involvement in mitochondrial electron transport. Some of these genes have been previously recognized as proapoptotic; however others, such as uncoupling protein 2, were not previously known to be apoptotic regulatory proteins. From these observations we propose that a multigenic program for sensitivity to apoptosis involves induction of transcripts for genes participating in mitochondrial uncoupling and loss of membrane potential. This program triggers mitochondrial release of apoptogenic factors and induces the ""caspase cascade."" Conversely, cells resistant to apoptosis down-regulate these biochemical pathways, while activating pathways for establishment and maintenance of high intracellular redox potential by means of elevated glutathione.

A., Gussoni, E., Begovich, A. B., MURRAY, R. S., Zang, Y. Q., Appel, S. H., Steinman, L., Zhang, J. W. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disorder whose etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated the presence of inflammatory infiltrates within ALS spinal cord and suggested the possibility of an immune-mediated process in motor neuron degeneration. We have analyzed the diversity of T-cells in the spinal cord in ALS. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with variable (V) region sequence specific oligonucleotide primers was used to amplify T-cell receptor (TCR)BV transcripts from spinal cords obtained at autopsy from patients with ALS, patients who died without inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, brains from patients with ALS, and brains from patients who died with inflammatory CNS disease. Sequencing was then performed on the amplified transcripts. An overall increase in the level of TCRBV 2 transcripts was detected in ALS specimens when compared to controls. This result was independent of the HLA genotype of the individual. Furthermore, enrichment of TCRBV2-positive T cells could be demonstrated in cerebrospinal fluid derived from patients with ALS, using PCR analysis and a T cell stimulation assay with toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), a Vbeta2-specific superantigen. Our results suggest that an immunological process involving the specific expansion of Vbeta2 TCR-positive T-cells may be important in the pathogenesis of ALS.

V., Garren, H., Slunt, H., Price, D. L., Gusella, J., Becher, M. W., Steinman, L. The protein huntingtin (htt), aggregated in neuronal nuclear inclusions, is pathognomonic of Huntington's disease (HD). Constructs, translated in vitro from the N terminus of htt, containing either polyQ23 from a normal individual, or polyQ41 or polyQ67 from an HD patient, were all soluble. Transglutaminase (TGase) crosslinked these proteins, and the aggregations did not have the staining properties of amyloid. More TGase-catalyzed aggregates formed when the polyglutamine domain of htt exceeded the pathologic threshold of polyQ36. Furthermore, shorter htt constructs, containing 135 aa or fewer, formed more aggregates than did larger htt constructs. TGase activity in the HD brain was increased compared with the control, with notable increases in cell nuclei. The increased TGase activity was brain specific. In lymphoblastoid cells from HD patients, TGase activity was decreased. TGase-mediated crosslinking of htt may be involved in the formation of the nonamyloidogenic nuclear inclusions found in the HD brain. The staining properties of nuclear inclusions in the HD brain revealed that they were not amyloid.

L., VEROMAA, T. The role of various adhesion molecules in lymphocyte homing to the brain and in inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) was examined in mice. Activated T cell lines and clones expressed CD44 and integrin alpha4, but not L-selectin, and entered the CNS independent of their antigen specificity. mAbs directed against CD44 and integrin alpha4 prevented the transfer of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by myelin basic protein-specific T cells. T cells preincubated with anti-CD44 or antiintegrin alpha4 were blocked only partially from entering the brain parenchyma. However, both antibodies efficiently prevented CNS inflammation and clinical expression of EAE when injected in vivo. This effect lasted as long as antibodies were administered. Antibodies specific for L-selectin had no effect on homing of encephalitogenic T cells to the brain or development of EAE. Antiintegrin alpha4 and anti-CD44 did not impair the activation and function of encephalitogenic T cells in vitro and did not deplete integrin alpha4- or CD44-positive cells in vivo. These data suggest that, in the absence of leukocyte recruitment, the entry of a reduced number of activated myelin basic protein-reactive T cells in the CNS is not sufficient for the development and expression of EAE. We propose that antibodies to integrin alpha4 and CD44 prevent clinical disease by partially targeting the primary influx of encephalitogenic T cells and by preventing the secondary influx of leukocytes to lesions initiated by the transferred T cells.

M., Levite, M., Karpuj, M. V., Southwood, S., Sette, A., Conlon, P., Steinman, L. Molecular mimicry refers to structural homologies between a self-protein and a microbial protein. A major epitope of myelin basic protein (MBP), p87-99 (VHFFKNIVTPRTP), induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). VHFFK contains the major residues for binding of this self-molecule to T cell receptor (TCR) and to the major histocompatibility complex. Peptides from papilloma virus strains containing the motif VHFFK induce EAE. A peptide from human papilloma virus type 40 (HPV 40) containing VHFFR, and one from HPV 32 containing VHFFH, prevented EAE. A sequence from Bacillus subtilis (RKVVTDFFKNIPQRI) also prevented EAE. T cell lines, producing IL-4 and specific for these microbial peptides, suppressed EAE. Thus, microbial peptides, differing from the core motif of the self-antigen, MBPp87-99, function as altered peptide ligands, and behave as TCR antagonists, in the modulation of autoimmune disease.

J., Garren, H., Ruiz, I. U., Hirschberg, D. L., Nguyen, L. V., Karpuj, M. V., Cooper, M. T., Mitchell, D. J., Fathman, C. G., Steinman, L. Usually we rely on vaccination to promote an immune response to a pathogenic microbe. In this study, we demonstrate a suppressive from of vaccination, with DNA encoding a minigene for residues 139-151 of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP139-151), a pathogenic self-Ag. This suppressive vaccination attenuates a prototypic autoimmune disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which presents clinically with paralysis. Proliferative responses and production of the Th1 cytokines, IL-2 and IFN-gamma, were reduced in T cells responsive to PLP139-151. In the brains of mice that were successfully vaccinated, mRNA for IL-2, IL-15, and IFN-gamma were reduced. A mechanism underlying the reduction in severity and incidence of paralytic autoimmune disease and the reduction in Th1 cytokines involves altered costimulation of T cells; loading of APCs with DNA encoding PLP139-151 reduced the capacity of a T cell line reactive to PLP139-151 to proliferate even in the presence of exogenous CD28 costimulation. DNA immunization with the myelin minigene for PLP-altered expression of B7.1 (CD80), and B7.2 (CD86) on APCs in the spleen.

T cells with somatically acquired mutations in the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene were isolated from patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) as representatives of populations potentially enriched for in vivo activated T cells. TCRB gene V region usage among mutant isolates from individual IDDM patients, but not from normal controls, showed a pronounced preference for BV14 and, to a lesser extent, BV6. Wild-type (nonmutant) isolates did not show such preferences. Extensive in vivo clonal expansions of the BV14 expressing mutant T cells from IDDM patients were revealed by sequence identity of TCRB chain junctional regions. These data support restricted TCRB gene usage in T cell populations enriched for in vivo activated clones in patients with IDDM.

P., Steinman, L., Fathman, C. G. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that serves as a model for the human disease multiple sclerosis. Paralysis is ""induced"" by CD4+ T cells of the Th1 phenotype. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a Th1 type cytokine, has been shown to be upregulated in the CNS during the onset of EAE, and systemic manipulations of TNF have had substantial effects on disease progression. However, the precise role of TNF in EAE has been called into question by recent experiments utilizing TNF and lymphotoxin knockout mice. We demonstrate here that the local delivery of TNF by myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cells, retrovirally transduced to express TNF, exacerbated MBP-induced disease following adoptive transfer into syngeneic mice. View details for Viral peptide with limited homology to a self peptide can induce clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis Gautam, A. M., Liblau, R., Chelvanayagam, G., Steinman, L., Boston, T. Molecular mimicry has been suggested as a mode of autoreactive T cell stimulation in autoimmune diseases. Myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide 1-11 induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in susceptible strains of mice. Here we show that a herpesvirus Saimiri (HVS) peptide, AAQRRPSRPFA, with a limited homology to MBP1-11 peptide, ASQKRPSQRHG (underlined letters showing homology), can stimulate a panel of MBP-11-specific T cell hybridomas and more importantly cause EAE in mice. We demonstrate that this is due to cross-recognition of these two peptides by TCRs. Results presented in this communication are the first demonstration that a viral peptide with homology at just 5 amino acids with a self peptide can induce clinical signs of EAE in mice. These findings have important implications in understanding the breakdown of T cell tolerance to self Ags in autoimmune diseases by means of cross-reactivity with unrelated peptides.

L., Carmi, P., Erez, N., Garren, H., Herkel, J., Karpuj, M., Steinman, L., Rotter, V., Cohen, I. R. The p53 molecule might serve as a common tumor-associated antigen, as the tumor suppressor gene p53 is mutated and the p53 protein is often over-expressed in tumor cells. We report that effective immunity to p53 can be induced through an idiotypic network by immunization of mice with a monoclonal antibody (PAb-240) specific for mutated p53, or with a peptide derived from the complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 of the variable domain of the light chain (VL) of this antibody. The immunized mice produced IgG antibodies to p53 and mounted a cytotoxic reaction to a tumor line bearing mutated p53. The idiotypically immunized mice were resistant to challenge with the tumor cells. Thus antibodies to p53 might serve as immunogens for activating resistance to some tumors. At the basic level, these findings indicate that a network of p53 immunity may be organized naturally within the immune system.

An immunodominant epitope of myelin basic protein (MBP), VHFFKNIVTPRTP (p87-99), is a major target of T cells in brain lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS), and this peptide can trigger experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We designed truncated peptides based on this pathogenic 13-mer that are not antigenic. These short peptides reduced production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in vivo. Moreover, paraplegic rats given the 7-mer FKNIVTP in soluble form showed total reversal of paralysis in 24 h. Truncated peptides that are too small to stimulate antigenic responses to pathogenic regions of myelin basic protein are nevertheless effective tolerogens and are able to anergize autoreactive T cells. Short peptide-based tolerogens, devoid of immunogenic and pathogenic potential, may be attractive for therapy of autoimmune diseases. View details for Dal Canto, R. A., Shaw, M.

A model will be proposed that includes the initial activation of naive T lymphocytes through T cell receptor-mediated recognition of microbial antigens presented by MHC class II molecules. This event might be followed by re-activation of autoreactive T cells by bacterial and viral superantigens. Both mechanisms could lead to acute and relapsing autoimmune disease. View details for Neuropeptides, via specific receptors, regulate T cell adhesion to fibronectin Levite, M., Cahalon, L., HERSHKOVIZ, R., Steinman, L., Lider, O. The ability of T cells to adhere to and interact with components of the blood vessel walls and the extracellular matrix is essential for their extravasation and migration into inflamed sites. We have found that the beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion of resting human T cells to fibronectin, a major glycoprotein component of the extracellular matrix, is induced by physiologic concentrations of three neuropeptides: calcitonin gene-related protein (CGRP), neuropeptide Y, and somatostatin; each acts via its own specific receptor on the T cell membrane. In contrast, substance P (SP), which coexists with CGRP in the majority of peripheral endings of sensory nerves, including those innervating the lymphoid organs, blocks T cell adhesion to fibronectin when induced by CGRP, neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta, and PMA. Inhibition of T cell adhesion was obtained both by the intact SP peptide and by its 1-4 N-terminal and its 4-11, 5-11, and 6-11 C-terminal fragments, used at similar nanomolar concentrations. The inhibitory effects of the parent SP peptide and its fragments were abrogated by an SP NK-1 receptor antagonist, suggesting they all act through the same SP NK-1 receptor. These findings suggest that neuropeptides, by activating their specific T cell-expressed receptors, can provide the T cells with both positive (proadhesive) and negative (antiadhesive) signals and thereby regulate their function. Thus, neuropeptides may influence diverse physiologic processes involving integrins, including leukocyte-mediated migration and inflammation.

Recent findings, however, beg re-evaluation of the direct role of Th2 cells in the induction or maintenance of tolerance, whereas evidence for the role of a distinct subset of regulatory T cells producing TGF-beta to suppress cell-mediated immunopathology is compelling.

W., Catz, I., Hausmann, S., STROMINGER, J. L., Steinman, L., Warren, K. G. Myelin basic protein (MBP) may be an important autoantigen in multiple sclerosis (MS), with the MBP(82-100) region being immunodominant for T cells and autoantibodies. The structural requirements for autoantibody recognition were compared to those previously defined for MBP-specific T cell clones. MBP autoantibodies were affinity-purified from central nervous system lesions of 11/12 postmortem cases studied. The MBP(83-97) peptide was immunodominant in all 11 cases since it inhibited autoantibody binding to MBP > 95%. Residues contributing to autoantibody binding were located in a 10-amino acid segment (V86-T95) that also contained the MHC/T cell receptor contact residues of the T cell epitope. In the epitope center, the same residues were important for antibody binding and T cell recognition. Based on the antibody-binding motif, microbial peptides were identified that were bound by purified autoantibodies. Autoantibody binding of microbial peptides required sequence identity at four or five contiguous residues in the epitope center. Microbial peptides previously found to activate T cell clones did not have such obvious homology to MBP since sequence identity was not required at MHC contacts. The similar fine specificity of B cells and T cells may be useful for tolerance induction to MBP in MS. View details for Perivascular T cells express the pro-inflammatory chemokine RANTES mRNA in multiple sclerosis lesions Hvas, J., McLean, C., Justesen, J., Kannourakis, G., Steinman, L., Oksenberg, J. R., Bernard, C. C. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by accumulation of mononuclear cells. The pathogenesis of MS is complex and probably involves soluble immune mediators, particularly cytokines, and activated memory T cells, that are thought to migrate into the CNS. During lesion formation in MS, cytokines regulate cell functions, such as cell recruitment and migration. Because the chemokine RANTES play a role in both activating and recruiting leucocytes, particularly memory T cells into inflammatory sites, the authors have assessed RANTES mRNA levels at the site of lesions. Expression levels were analysed in brain samples and compared with neurological, infectious and other controls. RANTES was expressed by activated perivascular memory T cells, predominantly located at the edge of active plaques. While RANTES mRNA was detected in all 17 MS brains analysed, it was only found in six of the 14 control patients and generally at a lower expression level. In view of the regulatory and chemotactic properties of RANTES, these results imply that RANTES in MS lesions may play an important role in the activation and/or selective accumulation of memory T cells and, thereby, in the pathogenic events associated with MS.

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) exerts a major role in the stress response. Both CRF and urocortin, a newly discovered neuropeptide homologous to CRF, suppressed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Suppression of paralysis with CRF involved stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and inhibitory effects on an encephalitogenic T cell line. While CRF increased glucocorticoid production, which is known to block EAE, it also suppressed EAE in adrenalectomized rats, where glucocorticoid stimulation via CRF plays no role. Moreover, the encephalitogenicity of a T cell line exposed to CRF in vitro was reduced. Stress may influence autoimmune disease through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and directly via the immune system.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system which serves as a model for the human disease multiple sclerosis. We demonstrate here that encephalitogenic T cells, transduced with a retroviral gene, construct to express interleukin 4, and can delay the onset and reduce the severity of EAE when adoptively transferred to myelin basic protein-immunized mice. Thus, T lymphocytes transduced with retroviral vectors can deliver ""regulatory cytokines"" in a site-specific manner and may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of autoimmune disease. View details for Multiple sclerosis: a polygenic disease involving epistatic interactions, germline rearrangements and environmental effects Several regions of the human genome are associated with susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS). We review studies of linkage of MS to germline genes using microsatellites. A modest effect on susceptibility was seen with markers in the vicinity of 6p21 (HLA) and 17q22. The influence of epistatic interactions between these genes is considered. The impact of genetic rearrangements of certain germline genes on susceptibility to MS is described. Analysis of TCR gene rearrangements has established some of the target antigens of the immune response in MS. Environmental influences on MS are described with particular attention given to how microbes might trigger demyelinating disease. View details for Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in IL-4-deficient mice Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in an inflammatory demyelinating disease which usually follows a monophasic course. Autoreactive Th1 CD4+ T cells are responsible for the lesions, whereas autoreactive Th2 CD4+ T cells can, upon adoptive transfer, suppress the disease process. However, the role of IL-4 and Th2 cells in the spontaneous remission of EAE and in the prevention of relapses is not known. We have addressed these issues using IL-4-deficient mice in which the differentiation of Th2 CD4+ T cells is severely compromised. The clinical course of actively induced EAE was compared in IL-4+/+, IL-4+ /- and IL-4-/- mice on the PL/J genetic background. No significant differences were noted between groups for the frequency, severity and duration of EAE, and the frequency of relapses. Our results indicate that IL-4, despite its well-documented regulatory role in EAE, is not necessary for the spontaneous remission of disease or for the prevention of relapses. Therefore, in the absence of IL-4, overlapping or compensatory immunoregulatory mechanisms can restrict an inflammatory response within the central nervous system.

A., Chalmers, D., Crowe, P. D., Pahuja, A., Ling, N., Brocke, S., Steinman, L., Conlon, P. J. T-cells specific for a region of human myelin basic protein, amino acids 87-99 (hMBP87-99), have been implicated in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS) a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Administration of soluble altered peptide ligand (APL), made by substituting native residues with alanine at either positions 91(91K > A or A91) or 97 (97R > A or A97) in the hMBP87-99 peptide, blocked the development of chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (R-EAE), in the SJL mouse. The non-encephalitogenic APL A91, appears to induce cytokine shifts from Th1 to Th2 in the target T-cells, whereas the encephalitogenic superagonist APL A97 causes deletion of the MBP87-99 responsive cells. Thus, single amino acid changes at different positions in the same peptide epitope can lead to APL capable of controlling auto-immune disease by different mechanisms.

M., Steinman, L., Blau, H. M. We evaluated myoblast implantation in 10 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and absent dystrophin (age 5-10 years) who were implanted with 100 million myoblasts in the anterior tibial muscle of one leg and placebo in the other. Cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day) was administered for 7 months. Pre- and postimplantation (after 1 and 6 months) muscle biopsies were analyzed. Force generation (tetanic tension and maximum voluntary contraction) was measured monthly in a double-blind design. There was increased force generation in both legs of all boys, probably due to cyclosporine. Using the polymerase chain reaction, evidence of myoblast survival and dystrophin mRNA expression was obtained in 3 patients after 1 month and in 1 patient after 6 months. These studies suggest a salutary effect of cyclosporine upon muscular force generation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy; however, myoblast implantation was not effective in replacing clinically significant amounts of dystrophin in DMD muscle.

H., Steinman, L. Aminoguanidine (AG), a selective inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase, prevented the clinical development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) with a reduction in inflammation and demyelination. Administration of AG reduced the expression of nitrosotyrosine in inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system. Cytokine expression, determined by semiquantitative PCR, revealed increased expression of IFN-gamma, IL-10, and TGF-beta, which was associated with protection from EAE, and reduced TNF-alpha, associated with the development of EAE. Furthermore, AG blocked the secretion of nitric oxide, TNF-alpha, and PGE2 in astrocyte cultures. AG did not influence the proliferation response of T cells to a pathogenic epitope of myelin basic protein. Down-regulation of nitric oxide by AG has widespread consequences for cytokine production in central nervous system inflammation and prevents EAE.

View details for IL-2 and TNF receptors as targets of regulatory T-T interactions - Isolation and characterization of cytokine receptor-reactive T cell lines in the Lewis rat T cells are considered to be of prime importance in immune regulation of both B and T cell functions. The targets of recognition in T-T cell interactions are not clear. Most recent experimental work has focused on the idiotypic regulatory interactions mediated by TCR peptides. There is experimental evidence that regulatory cells exist that do not recognize the TCR. This type of regulation is selectively induced by activated T cells. Therefore, we designed this study to examine the possible role of cytokine receptors as targets of immune regulation. We tested two peptides of IL-2R alpha-chain, 2 of IL-2R beta-chain, and one of TNFR (p60). All peptides were found to be immunogenic at inducing T cell proliferation and four induced Abs in Lewis rats. We generated T cell lines to these five peptides, and tested them both in vitro and in vivo. We found that the T cells exhibited a proliferative response when cultured with activated, irradiated stimulator cells that were augmented upon addition of the cytokine receptor peptide. The cytokine profile of the lines was characterized as well as the Vbeta gene composition. One of the lines significantly protected against active encephalomyelitis. These results point at cytokine receptors as possible targets of immune regulation and T-T cell interactions.

F., Martin, R. We have examined the functional consequences induced by interaction of DR2a-restricted myelin basic protein (MBP) (87-99)-specific T cell clones (TCC) with altered peptide ligands (APL) derived from MBP peptide (87-99). The immunodominant MBP peptide (87-99) has been implicated as a candidate antigen in multiple sclerosis (MS) by several lines of evidence. In the present study, we have defined the T cell receptor (TCR) contact residues for DR2a-restricted, (87-99)-specific T helper type 1 T cells to design APL suitable to modify the functions of such T cells potentially relevant for the pathogenesis of MS. We show that neutral (L-alanine substitutions) or conservative exchanges of the primary and secondary TCR contact residues lead to various alterations of T cell function, ranging from differences in interleukin-2 receptor up-regulation to anergy induction and TCR antagonism. The potential usefulness of APL as an immunomodulating therapy for DR2+ MS patients is discussed. View details for The right stuff: Breaking through the xenotransplant barrier View details for Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease during which an autoimmune reaction is directed against oligodendrocytes. Alterations of normal myelin structure or oligodendrocyte metabolism may be primary events that influence the susceptibility to MS. Once triggered, the immune system attacks and destroys myelin and the myelin forming cell. Evidence is presented that the oligodendrocyte responds to the attack by immune cells and their secreted products through modulation of its metabolism and gene expression. Cytokines, immunoglobulins, and complement complexes may elicit a survival response in the oligodendrocytes, involving the induction of heat shock proteins and other protective molecules. The possibility of manipulating these complex glial cell functions and controlling their pathologic interactions with immune cells will illuminate how myelin damage can be contained and how the injured tissue can be repaired.

J., Hirschberg, D. L., Gelman, A., Oksenberg, J. R., Brocke, S., Mor, F., Cohen, I. R., Steinman, L. A variable region gene of the T-cell receptor, V beta 8.2, is rearranged, and its product is expressed on pathogenic T cells that induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in H-2u mice after immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP). Vaccination of these mice with naked DNA encoding V beta 8.2 protected mice from EAE. Analysis of T cells reacting to the pathogenic portion of the MBP molecule indicated that in the vaccinated mice there was a reduction in the Th1 cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gama. In parallel, there was an elevation in the production of IL-4, a Th2 cytokine associated with suppression of disease. A novel feature of DNA immunization for autoimmune disease, reversal of the autoimmune response from Th1 to Th2, may make this approach attractive for treatment of Th1-mediated diseases like multiple sclerosis, juvenile diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.

We have examined the level of surface expression and functional properties of leukocyte function associated antigen-1, very late antigen-4, and CD45 isoforms on a panel of human CD4+ T-cell clones representative of TH0, TH1, and TH2 cells. There were no qualitative differences in the expression of these antigens among the three types of CD4+ T-cell clones. However, CD45RB was the only CD45 isoform that provided a costimulatory signal in a solid-phase antibody-induced cellular proliferation assay. Additionally, the antigen-induced proliferative response of T-cell clones was inhibited by soluble anti-CD45RO and anti-CD45RB antibodies. Our results suggest that CD45 isoforms differentially provide costimulatory signals to T cells. However, the ability of each CD45 isoform to provide a costimulatory signal does not differ among the TH0, TH1, or TH2 T-cell populations. View details for Regulation of disease susceptibility: Decreased prevalence of IgE-mediated allergic disease in patients with multiple sclerosis ORO, A. S., Guarino, T. J., Driver, R., Steinman, L., Umetsu, D. T. The development of restricted cytokine profiles by subsets of CD4+ T cells is a pivotal point in the regulation of immune responses. T cells producing Th1 cytokines (IL-2 and interferon-gamma) induce cell-mediated immunity, whereas T cells producing Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) play a prominent role in the induction of humoral immunity. We examined a group of patients with multiple sclerosis, a disease caused by excess production of Th1 cytokines in myelin-reactive T cells, and control patients with noninflammatory neuroconvulsive disorders, for the presence of allergic disease, which is caused by excess production of Th2 cytokines in allergen-specific T cells. The patients with multiple sclerosis had significantly fewer allergic symptoms, a lower number of positive allergen-specific IgE test results, and lower composite allergy indexes than control subjects. These results demonstrate that the prevalence of IgE-mediated allergic disease is decreased in a group of patients with multiple sclerosis and support the hypothesis that genetic factors that promote susceptibility to Th1-mediated inflammatory disease in human beings protect against the development of Th2-mediated disease.

This article describes protocols for the establishment and characterization of autoreactive T-cell lines and clones and for the study of EAE induced by these cells. The rationale for using transferred EAE models is discussed, together with advantages and disadvantages of using in vitro cultured T cells compared with Freund's adjuvant-based immunization for the induction of EAE.

These specific cells recruit a population of nonspecific T cells and macrophages. The rare tissue-specific T cells in the infiltrate have the capacity to regulate both the influx and the efflux of cells from the tissue. Administration of an altered peptide ligand for the specific T cell which triggers autoimmunity can lead to the regression of the entire inflammatory ensemble in a few hours. Interleukin 4 is a critical cytokine involved in the regression of the inflammatory infiltrate.

J., Wraith, D. C., OGARRA, A., Fathman, C. G., Steinman, L. Following induction of experimental encephalomyelitis with a T-cell clone, L10C1, that is specific for the myelin basic protein epitope p87-99, the inflammatory infiltrate in the central nervous system contains a diverse collection of T cells with heterogeneous receptors. We show here that when clone L10C1 is tolerized in vivo with an analogue of p87-99, established paralysis is reversed, inflammatory infiltrates regress, and the heterogeneous T-cell infiltrate disappears from the brain, with only the T-cell clones that incited disease remaining in the original lesions. We found that antibody raised against interleukin-4 reversed the tolerance induced by the altered peptide ligand. Treatment with this altered peptide ligand selectively silences pathogenic T cells and actively signals for the efflux of other T cells recruited to the site of disease as a result of the production of interleukin-4 and the reduction of tumour-necrosis factor-alpha in the lesion.

A., Brocke, S., TAYLOREDWARDS, C., Ridgway, W., Dinisco, C., Steinman, L., Dalton, D., Fathman, C. G. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis, is an autoimmune disorder seen in mice and rats following immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP) or MBP-derived peptides. IFN-gamma, a cytokine produced by a variety of cells, is involved in many inflammatory and immune regulatory events. Contradictory results concerning exacerbations and the disease course were seen comparing injections of IFN-gamma in humans suffering from multiple sclerosis to studies using anti-IFN-gamma Abs in mice with EAE. To study the role of IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma-producing cells in EAE, we crossed IFN-gamma knockout mice (H-2b) (unable to produce IFN-gamma due to the disruption of the IFN-gamma gene) with an EAE-susceptible mouse strain, B10.PL (H-2u). EAE was seen in IFN-gamma knockout mice, heterozygotic (IFN-gamma +/-) mice, as well as wild-type littermates following immunization with MBP. Histologic analyses of the central nervous system of IFN-gamma knockout mice with EAE revealed massive infiltrates composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. We conclude that the presence of IFN-gamma is not crucial to the induction or the clinical course of EAE.

S., Szafer, F., HENSLEEDOWNEY, P. J., Walker, M., King, S., Godder, K., Pati, A. R., BEST, R., Steinman, L., Geier, S. S., Gee, A. P. The purpose of this study was to characterize the phenotype and clonality of the T cell population in patients who experience acute rejection (AR) following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from a partially mismatched related donor (PMRD). Phenotypic analysis was performed using flow cytometry, assignment of donor/host lineage by cytogenetics or HLA-specific flow cytometry, and analysis of the T cell receptor (TCR) by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We have previously reported the initial appearance in the blood of AR patients of host CD8+brightCD3low T cells that progressively express increasing amounts of CD3+ cells. We now report that this cell population can differentiate into either a cytotoxic T cell phenotype (CD3+CD8+HLA-DR+CD57-) usually associated with AR of grafts from matched unrelated donors or a suppressor T cell phenotype (CD3+CD8+CD57+HLA-DR-) usually associated with AR of grafts from matched sibling donors. Analysis of the TCR V beta subsets from two patients revealed sorted host CD3+CD8+ cells (purity 90-95%) from the first patient to express V beta 18 almost exclusively. In a second patient with late rejection (55 days post-BMT), the CD3+CD8+ cells were predominantly restricted to V beta 1, 5.1, 7, 9, and 18. Although CD3+CD8+ T cells are known to be associated with AR, cytotoxic and suppressor lineages in AR from the same type of BMT and clonal distribution of T cells in AR have not been reported. Preliminary results suggest that V beta expression in AR of PMRD grafts is restricted and host T cell phenotype may vary. Further studies will investigate whether specific mismatches correlate with specific V beta usage and/or host T cell phenotype.

S., Steinman, L. We previously demonstrated the local production of the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the central nervous system (CNS) in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for the human disease multiple sclerosis.To assess the role of IL-6 in autoimmune CNS inflammation, we administered neutralizing antibodies to IL-6 in the EAE model. Their effect was examined at the clinical and histopathological level. Levels of administered antibody and IL-6 bioactivity were followed in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).Systemically administered antibodies penetrated into the fluid CSF in animals in which EAE was induced. Administration of anti-IL-6 reduced the development of actively induced as well as adoptively transferred EAE and was associated with increased levels of IL-6 activity in the CSF and to a lesser extent in the serum. Anti-IL-6 was still effective when given 1 day before the onset of disease signs in adoptively transferred EAE. The disease-reducing effect of anti-IL-6 was also reflected at the pathological level by the absence of inflammatory infiltrates in the CNS.Our study indicates that IL-6 plays an important role in autoimmune CNS inflammation. However, due to the complex nature of the in vivo interactions of administered antibodies, the disease-reducing effect of the anti-IL-6 antibodies could be caused by neutralization of IL-6 activity or by enhancement of IL-6 activity via induction of higher IL-6 levels in the CNS.

Analysis of pathogen-reactive T cell clones (CD3+4+8-TCR alpha beta +), isolated from the synovial fluid of 2 HLA-B27-positive patients with Yersinia enterocolitica-triggered reactive arthritis, has provided important information about the cellular immune response to this disease-inciting pathogen. This study demonstrates that the proteins secreted by Y. enterocolitica, including a protein with tyrosine phosphatase activity (YopH), are potent immunogens stimulating CD4+ cells within the inflamed joint. The pathogen-reactive T cell clones preferentially utilized a limited set of T cell receptor variable region gene segments. A purified Yersinia superantigen triggered a proliferative response in most of the antigen-reactive T cell clones tested. These results suggest that the activity of this pathogen's superantigen influences the cellular immune response to its antigens.

In rodent models of MS, immunization to this component of MBP evokes experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). T cells found in EAE lesions show similarities in the VJ and VDJ regions of their alpha and beta chains with T cells in MS lesions, and with T cells that are specific for MBPp84-103 isolated from patients with MS. If this region of MBP is critical in the pathogenesis of MS, then therapy aimed at controlling the immune response to this immunodominant region of MBP may be beneficial in treating MS. View details for REINDUCTION OF EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS IN MICE Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Lewis rats and some strains of mice is typically a monophasic disease, and recovered animals are resistant to reinduction of disease. We demonstrate that SJL mice remain susceptible to disease after recovery, and suffer a second episode of disease when reinjected with spinal cord homogenate in complete Freund's adjuvant. Reinduced disease occurs earlier after injection than the initial disease (mean onset 7.3 days compared with 14.5 days), and has comparable severity and incidence. The susceptibility to reinduced disease is present for at least 20 weeks after the initial injection. If the initial episode of EAE is elicited using a synthetic peptide of proteolipid protein, then reinjection of the same peptide causes reinduced disease. PL/J mice and PL/J x SJL F1 mice are also susceptible to reinduced disease which occurs with an accelerated onset and higher incidence than the initial disease. We conclude that SJL and PL/J mice have a defect in immunoregulation which causes them to be susceptible to recurrent episodes of autoimmune disease.

One strategy was to sequence TCR gene rearrangements directly from MS lesions. The second strategy utilized T-cell clones with a selectable mutation that are found only in MS patients. The selection of T-cell clones with mutations in the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene was used to isolate T-cells reactive to myelin basic protein (MBP) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). These T-cell clones are activated in vivo, and are not found in healthy individuals. The third complementarity determining regions (CDR3) of the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains are the putative contact sites for peptide fragments of MBP bound in the groove of the HLA molecule. The TCR V gene usage and CDR3s of these MBP-reactive hprt- T-cell clones are homologous to TCRs from other T-cells relevant to MS, including T-cells causing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and T-cells found in brain lesions and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients.

CSF lymphocytes from patients with Coccidioides immitis meningitis exhibited a significant antigen-specific response to in vitro stimulation with C. immitis antigens. In some patients, lesser responses to control antigens (Candida and PPD) were also detected. Antigen-specific responses by CSF lymphocytes were seen early in the course of this disease as well as several years after patients had entered remission. When compared to CSF cells, the response of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells was similar but of a much smaller magnitude and at times undetectable. Fluorescence activated cell sorting revealed an increased percentage of CD3+ (T-cells), CD4+ (helper/inducer) and CD3+/HLA-DR+ (activated T-cell) cells in the CSF of C. immitis meningitis patients compared to their blood. Most of the antigen-specific proliferative response resided in the CD4+ lymphocyte subset. CSF T-cell proliferation assays may have a role in the diagnosis of C. immitis meningitis.

D., Michie, S. A., Tisch, R., Karin, N., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. To elucidate the role of cell adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and to determine the predominant lymphocytic homing pathway(s) involved in the selective lymphocytic infiltration of pancreatic islets (insulitis), nonobese diabetic mice were treated with monoclonal antibodies specific for the L-selectin and integrin alpha 4 lymphocyte adhesion molecules. Treatment of neonatal mice with either anti-L-selectin or anti-integrin alpha 4 monoclonal antibodies for the first 4 weeks of life led to a significant and long-term protection against spontaneous occurrence of insulitis and diabetes. The same treatment failed to inhibit lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary glands (sialadenitis). This tissue-specific inhibition of inflammation may be attributed to differences between the pancreas and salivary gland in their expression of endothelial ligands for L-selectin (peripheral vascular addressin) and for integrin alpha 4 (mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1). Mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 is highly expressed by vessels within the inflamed islets but was not detected in the salivary glands. In contrast, peripheral vascular addressin- and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1-expressing vessels can be found in almost every area of inflammation within the salivary glands but are seen in only 40-50% of inflamed islets. Anti-L-selectin and anti-integrin alpha 4 treatment had no demonstrable effect on anti-beta-cell autoimmunity or on the immune responses to foreign antigens. Therapeutic treatment with anti-L-selectin after the onset of insulitis from 10 to 14 weeks of age delayed the onset but failed to prevent spontaneous insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, whereas anti-integrin alpha 4 treatment resulted in a significant and long-lasting suppression of the disease. These data strongly suggest that integrin alpha 4 plays a prominent role in the spontaneous development of insulitis and diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice.

Selective homing of autoreactive lymphocytes to the pancreatic islets of Langerhans is essential for triggering the cascade of molecular and cellular interactions which culminate in the specific destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells. Based upon the sequential multistep model of lymphocyte adhesion to the endothelium, we investigated the possibility of preventing the progression of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) by selectively blocking L-selectin and alpha 4-integrin homing receptors, which function at different stages of the adhesion process. Treatment of NOD mice with mAb specific for L-selectin or alpha 4-integrin resulted in a significant inhibition of lymphocytic infiltration (insulitis). Both spontaneous development and acute transfer of IDDM were completely prevented by administration of anti-alpha 4-integrin antibody and partially inhibited by anti-L-selectin antibody. The protective effect was of long duration. Interestingly, the autoimmune T cell responses to a panel of beta cell autoantigens and the lymphocytic infiltration of salivary glands (sialadenitis) appeared unaffected by anti-L-selectin or anti-alpha 4-integrin treatment. These data suggest that prevention of lymphocyte homing to the pancreatic islets may provide a selective target for prevention/treatment of IDDM in patients.

We used experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as an animal model to evaluate the effect of a hydroxamate matrix metalloprotease inhibitor (GM 6001) on inflammatory demyelination. A single dose of the inhibitor, given intraperitoneally, provided sufficient levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of animals with EAE to induce at least a partial inhibition of the gelatinase activity in the cerebrospinal fluid. When administered daily either from the time of disease induction or from the onset of clinical signs, GM 6001 suppressed the development or reversed clinical EAE in a dose-dependent way, respectively. Animals returned to the same clinical course as the nontreated group after cessation of treatment. Animals treated from the onset of clinical signs had normal permeability of the blood-brain barrier, compared with the enhanced permeability in nontreated animals. These results indicate that matrix metalloprotease inhibition can reverse ongoing EAE. This effect appears to be mediated mainly through restoration of the damaged blood-brain barrier in the inflammatory phase of the disease, since, the degree of demyelination and inflammation did not differ between the treatment groups.

J., Brocke, S., Ling, N., Steinman, L. An immunodominant epitope of myelin basic protein (MBP), VHFFKNIVTPRTP (p87-99), is a major target of T cells in lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS) and in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). T cells found in EAE lesions bear the same amino acids in the third complementary determining region of the T cell receptor (TCR) as those found in MS lesions. We analyzed the trimolecular interactions between MBP p87-99, class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and TCR, and designed soluble inhibitors for therapy. F, N, I, and V at positions 90, 92, 93, and 94 interact with MHC, whereas K, T, and P at positions 91, 95, and 96 interact with TCR. The peptides, p87-99[95T > A] and p87-99[96P > A] could compete more effectively with p87-99 for binding to MHC and could antagonize the in vitro response to T cells to p87-99 more effectively than p87-99[91K > A]. However, only p87-99[91K > A] prevented and reversed EAE, indicating that the extent of MHC or TCR competition does not predict success in treating EAE. To elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of EAE, draining lymph node cells from rats immunized with the native peptide alone or together with each of the three TCR antagonists were challenged in vitro with p87-99. Administration of p87-99[91K > A], but not p87-99 [95T > A] or p87-99[96P > A], reduced the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- alpha and interferon (IFN) gamma. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha are two cytokines that are critical in the pathogenesis of EAE and MS.

A., Powell, M., Blau, H. M., Steinman, L. Mononuclear cells infiltrate degenerating muscles of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients. Using a quantitative PCR, we first characterized the T cells infiltrating muscle biopsies from six DMD patients. High levels of TCR V beta 2 transcripts were observed in DMD muscle tissue. TCR V beta 2 transcripts from seven DMD patients and five controls were sequenced, and the VDJ junctional region analyzed in 166 clones. One specific amino acid motif, RVSG, was found in the third complementary determining region (CDR3) of TCR V beta 2 chains in samples from five DMD patients, but not in controls. A specific immune reaction at the site of tissue degeneration may play an important role in the pathogenesis of DMD.

A., Allegretta, M., Steinman, L., Sriram, S. Characterization of T cells responding to autoantigens is central to understanding autoimmune disease. We have used somatic mutation at the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene as an index of T-cell amplification in vivo. With this strategy we previously showed that myelin basic protein-reactive T cells can be isolated only from the HPRT mutant T-cell population cultured from the peripheral blood of multiple sclerosis patients and not from normal individuals. In this study, 165 HPRT mutant and 104 wild-type clones were examined for their reactivity to myelin basic protein and overlapping peptides of myelin basic protein. Five HPRT mutant clones that recognized myelin basic protein and myelin basic protein peptides along with three clones that responded to myelin basic protein peptide alone were isolated. All but one of the eight clones recognized peptides derived from the carboxy terminus of myelin basic protein (p84-168). Sequence analysis showed heterogeneous expression of T-cell receptor V alpha and V beta genes and CDR3s. These studies showed that in vivo amplified autoimmune T cells from patients with long-standing disease use diverse T-cell receptor elements in the recognition of C-terminal myelin basic protein peptides.

View details for REPEATED TREATMENT WITH CHIMERIC ANTI-CD4 ANTIBODY IN MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS Lindsey, J. W., Hodgkinson, S., Mehta, R., Mitchell, D., ENZMANN, D., Steinman, L. We treated 21 multiple sclerosis patients with two to four doses of cM-T412, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the CD4 antigen found on helper/inducer T lymphocytes. The mean number (+/- standard error) of circulating CD4 lymphocytes decreased from 888 (+/- 81) cells/mm3 at baseline to 246 (+/- 18) after treatment. At 1 year after the last treatment, the CD4 count had recovered to only 335 (+/- 32). The antibody had no effect on CD8 lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, or other leukocytes. Side effects were minimal. Despite the prolonged depletion of CD4 lymphocytes, no opportunistic infections occurred. Only 1 patient had a possible allergic reaction. Most patients were clinically stable, but a few progressed. We conclude that repeated treatment with cM-T412 is effective in reducing the number of circulating CD4 lymphocytes and has no limiting side effects.

The selection of T cell clones with mutations in the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene has been used to isolate T cells reactive to myelin basic protein (MBP) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). These T cell clones are activated in vivo, and are not found in healthy individuals. The third complementarity determining regions (CDR3) of the T cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains are the putative contact sites for peptide fragments of MBP bound in the groove of the HLA molecule. The TCR V gene usage and CDR3s of these MBP-reactive hprt-T cell clones are homologous to TCRs from other T cells relevant to MS, including T cells causing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and T cells found in brain lesions and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients. In vivo activated MBP-reactive T cells in MS patients may be critical in the pathogenesis of MS.

Brocke, S., VEROMAA, T., Weissman, I. L., Gijbels, K., Steinman, L. The association of infection with autoimmune diseases is enigmatic, partly because cause and effect are difficult to establish in chronic diseases. Microorganisms might initiate multiple sclerosis and trigger relapses of disease. Superantigens might be involved in autoimmunity through the (re)activation of T cells, including autoreactive cells, expressing certain T cell receptor beta chain variable regions. LUPUS-PRONE MICE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ORGAN-SPECIFIC AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASE, EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGIC ENCEPHALOMYELITIS Zamvil, S. S., ALSabbagh, A., Nelson, P. A., Kaul, D., STCHARLES, M., Mitchell, D. J., Steinman, L., Weiner, H. L., Kuchroo, V. K. Immunization with the multideterminant autoantigen myelin basic protein (MBP) causes experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease that serves as a model for multiple sclerosis (MS). MBP peptides Ac1-11 and p35-47 induce potent EAE in mice of the H-2u haplotype. T cells specific for Ac1-11 predominantly utilize one T-cell receptor (TCR) V beta gene segment, V beta 8.2. All T-cell clones and hybridomas analyzed, regardless of TCR V beta usage, utilize D beta 2 and J beta 2 elements. The NZW mouse strain (H-2z), which contributes to the spontaneous 'lupus-like' illness in (NZB x NZW)F1 mice, has a genomic deletion encompassing D beta 2 and J beta 2 gene segments. The NZW strain expresses class II (I-A and I-E) genes which share identical sequences with H-2u class II. We investigated whether these strains are susceptible to EAE induced with intact MBP and known encephalitogenic MBP peptides. In vitro analysis demonstrated that NZW antigen-presenting cells (APC) can present MBP and MBP peptide Ac1-11 to an encephalitogenic T-cell clone derived from an H-2u mouse, confirming the functional identity of NZW class-II (I-A) molecules with their respective H-2u class-II gene products. In vivo results demonstrated that NZW and (NZB x NZW)F1 mice are susceptible to EAE induced with intact MBP and Ac1-11. MBP p35-47 caused EAE in (NZB x NZW)F1 mice, which express alleles for both the normal (NZB) TCR beta-gene locus, and the abnormal (NZW) TCR beta-gene locus containing the J beta 2 deletion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) View details for A HIPPOCAMPAL PROTEIN ASSOCIATED WITH PARANEOPLASTIC NEUROLOGIC SYNDROME AND SMALL-CELL LUNG-CARCINOMA BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS Sakai, K., GOFUKU, M., Kitagawa, Y., Ogasawara, T., Hirose, G., Yamazaki, M., Koh, C. S., Yanagisawa, N., Steinman, L. A hippocampal 38 kd autoantigen recognized by an autoantibody from the serum of a patient with paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) was isolated by screening a human hippocampal cDNA library. The 1,991-nucleotide ple21 clone was obtained and the deduced 350-residue protein encoded by the ple21 cDNA clone was found to be highly homologous to the neuron-specific RNA recognition motifs (RRMs)-containing proteins. The homologies were confined to the RRMs and the RRM connecting region. The presence of RRM in the antigenic protein may be important in the pathogenesis of SCLC-associated paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome.

W., Hodgkinson, S., Mehta, R., Siegel, R. C., Mitchell, D. J., Lim, M., Piercy, C., Tram, T., Dorfman, L., ENZMANN, D., Steinman, L. We conducted an open trial of cM-T412, a chimeric monoclonal anti-CD4 antibody, in 29 patients with MS. This antibody caused a prompt and long-lasting depletion of circulating CD4 (helper/inducer) lymphocytes. The mean (+/- SE) CD4 count for the group decreased from 870 (+/- 66) cells/mm3 at baseline to 76 (+/- 11) 3 hours after treatment, and then increased to 425 (+/- 38) at 1 month after treatment and 475 (+/- 39) at 6 months after treatment. Numbers of CD8 (cytotoxic/suppressor) lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, granulocytes, and monocytes changed transiently but showed no significant long-term effects. The most common side effects were headache, nausea, myalgia, fever, and tachycardia occurring in the first few hours after treatment. No serious or unexpected infections or other significant adverse effects occurred. Kurtzke EDSS scores remained stable, and MRI scans showed less contrast enhancement 1 week after treatment. We conclude that treatment of MS patients with cM-T412 chimeric anti-CD4 antibody is well tolerated at the doses tested and produces a long-lasting, selective depletion of CD4 lymphocytes.

M., Lock, C. B., Smilek, D. E., Pearson, C. I., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. The precise mechanisms of failure of immunological tolerance to self proteins are not known. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) susceptibility alleles, the target peptides, and T cells with anti-self reactivity must be present to cause autoimmune diseases. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a murine model of a human autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis. In EAE, residues 1-11 of myelin basic protein (MBP) are the dominant disease-inducing determinants in PL/J and (PL/J x SJL/J)F1 mice. Here we report that a six-residue peptide (five of them native) of MBP can induce EAE. Using peptide analogues of the MBP-(1-11) peptide, we demonstrate that only four native MBP residues are required to stimulate MBP-specific T cells. Therefore, this study demonstrates lower minimum structural requirements for effective antigen presentation by MHC class II molecules. Many viral and bacterial proteins share short runs of amino acid similarity with host self proteins, a phenomenon known as molecular mimicry. Since a six-residue peptide can sensitize MBP-specific T cells to cause EAE, these results define a minimum sequence identity for molecular mimicry in autoimmunity.

D., Karin, N., Tisch, R., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. Leukocyte adhesion to the endothelial venules in the pancreatic islets is thought to be one of the initial steps in the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. It has been suggested that leukocyte adhesion to endothelium is a sequential multistep process involving various different homing receptors. We report here that blocking different homing receptors--namely, L-selectin and very late antigen 4 (VLA-4)--which function during different stages of the adhesion process, by specific monoclonal antibodies inhibits insulitis and prevents diabetes in mice. Moreover, leukocyte attachment to the inflamed vessels within pancreatic sections could be inhibited by anti-L-selectin and anti-VLA-4 antibodies. Interestingly, anti-L-selectin or anti-VLA-4 antibody did not appear to influence the autoimmune response to a panel of pancreatic beta-cell autoantigens. These data suggest that L-selectin and VLA-4 receptors are involved in mediating leukocyte homing to the islets and that intervention of these two adhesion pathways may provide a novel approach for treatment of autoimmune diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

CD4 and CD8 were not quantifiable at baseline, became detectable at 5 days after immunization, and increased steadily to a peak during clinical disease. I-A increased after CD4 and CD8, but before onset of disease. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 did not increase until after onset of clinical disease. CD4, CD8, and I-A remained elevated long after recovery from disease. These results suggest that infiltration of CD4 and CD8 cells into the spinal cord and subsequent upregulation of I-A mRNA play an important role in the development of EAE, but reversal of these processes is not necessary for recovery. Upregulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA does not appear to be important for development of disease.

G., Steinman, L. The role of infection in the pathogenesis of clinical relapses that occur in most autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, remains to be established. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) serves as a model for multiple sclerosis, with episodes of relapsing paralysis. In certain strains of mice, T-lymphocytes expressing the V beta 8 T-cell receptor (TCR) engage the amino-terminal epitope Ac1-11 of myelin basic protein, leading to EAE. The bacterial superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) activates V beta 8-expressing T cells. Here we show that after immunization with Ac1-11, or after transfer of encephalitogenic T-cell lines or clones reactive to Ac1-11, SEB induces exacerbation or relapses of paralytic disease in mice that are in clinical remission following an initial episode of paralysis, and triggers paralysis in mice with subclinical disease. Tumour necrosis factor has a critical role in the mechanism underlying SEB-induced exacerbation of disease, because anti-tumour necrosis factor antibody given in vivo delays the onset of paralysis triggered by SEB. On reactivation of autoaggressive cells through their T-cell receptor, superantigens may induce clinical relapses of autoimmune disease.

In this study we analyzed the usage frequencies of the TCR V-gene segments by alpha beta+ T cells present in synovial fluid of 17 patients with chronic arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis. The results of this study, obtained from semiquantitative PCR analyses, showed that in all patients most of the TCR V alpha- and V beta-gene segments could be detected both in fresh PBMCs and in fresh SFMCs. The relative frequencies of use of these V-region genes were variable between the different patients. Although there was some skewing of increased usage frequencies of particular TCR V alpha and V beta genes among SFMC-derived TCRs when compared with PBMCs, we could not correlate such increased TCR V-gene usage with the inflammation in the joints as a disease-specific marker. View details for GAMMA-DELTA T-CELL RECEPTOR REPERTOIRE IN BRAIN-LESIONS OF PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS Hvas, J., Oksenberg, J. R., Fernando, R., Steinman, L., Bernard, C. C. The identification of activated T cells in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) suggests that these cells are critical in the pathogenesis of this disease. Recently we have used the PCR method to analyse rearrangements of V alpha and V beta genes of the T cell receptor (TCR) in samples of MS and control brains. The results of these studies showed that TCR V gene usage in MS brains may be restricted and in particular that V beta genes may be preferentially rearranged in certain HLA haplotypes associated with susceptibility to MS. In view of the recent evidence that T lymphocytes bearing the gamma delta chains may have autoreactive potential, we have assessed whether or not such TCR-bearing lymphocytes were also present in chronic MS lesions. TCR V gamma and V delta were analysed by the PCR method using a panel of V gamma and V delta primers paired with C gamma or C delta primers in 12 MS brains, as well as in brain samples of ten normal post-mortem cases and three neurological controls. TCR V gamma-C gamma and V delta-C delta rearrangements were confirmed using Southern blotting and hybridisation of the PCR products with specific C gamma and C delta probes. Only one to four rearranged TCR V gamma and V delta transcripts were detected in each of the 23 brain samples obtained from 12 MS patients, with the majority of gamma delta T cells expressing the V gamma 2 and V delta 2 chains. In marked contrast, V gamma and V delta transcripts could only be found in one of the ten non-neurological control brains analysed. To assess the clonality of V gamma 2 and V delta 2 T cell receptor chains in the brain samples of MS patients, we have sequenced the junctional regions of the TCR V gamma-N-J gamma-C gamma and V delta-N-D delta-N-J delta-C delta segments amplified from brain tissues, CSF and spleens of two MS patients and from the spleen of two control subjects. The sequence analysis obtained so far shows no compelling evidence of an MS specific expansion of one or more clones expressing particular types of gamma delta T cell receptors. In contrast, a clonal expansion of a different population of TCR gamma delta-bearing T cells was found in the spleen of both an MS patient and one of the control individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) View details for CLONAL ANALYSIS OF INVIVO ACTIVATED CD8+ CYTOTOXIC T-LYMPHOCYTES FROM A MELANOMA PATIENT RESPONSIVE TO ACTIVE SPECIFIC IMMUNOTHERAPY KANMITCHELL, J., Huang, X. Q., Steinman, L., Oksenberg, J. R., Harel, W., Parker, J. W., Goedegebuure, P. S., Darrow, T. L., Mitchell, M. S. To study in vivo activated cytolytic T cells, CD8+ T cells clones were isolated from a melanoma patient (HLA A2, A11) treated with active specific immunotherapy for 5 years. CD8+ T lymphocytes, purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, were cloned directly from the peripheral blood without antigen-presenting cells in the presence of irradiated autologous melanoma cells and recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-4. These conditions were inhibitory to de novo in vitro immunization. Of the 28 cytolytic CD8+ T cell clones, 21 lysed the autologous melanoma cell line (M7) but not the autologous lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL-7) nor the two melanoma cell line, M1 (HLA A28) and M2 (HLA A28, A31), used to immunize the patient. The remaining 7 clones were also melanoma-specific, although their reactivities were broader, lysing several melanoma cell lines but not HLA-matched lymphoblastoid cells. Eight clones from the first group, ostensibly self-MHC-restricted, were expanded for further analysis. All expressed cluster determinants characteristic of mature, activated T cells, but not those of thymocytes, naive T cells, B cells or natural killer (NK) cells. They also expressed CD13, a myeloid marker. Of the 8 clones, 3 expressed both CD4 and CD8, but dual expression was not correlated with specificity of lysis. Two CD8+ and 2 CD4+ CD8+ clones were specific for the autologous melanoma cells, the other 4 were also reactive against other HLA-A2-positive melanomas. Cytotoxicity for both singly and doubly positive clones was restricted by HLA class I but not class II antigens. Analysis of the RNA expression of the T cell receptor (TCR) V alpha and V beta gene segments revealed heterogeneous usage by the A2-restricted clones and, perhaps, also by the broadly melanoma-specific clones. Apparent TCR-restricted usage was noted for the self-MHC-restricted clones; 2 of the 4 expressed the V alpha 17/V beta 7 dimer. Since the T cell clones were derived from separate precursors of circulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), the V alpha 17/V beta 7 TCR was well represented in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of this patient. In summary, we show that melanoma cells presented their own antigens to stimulate the proliferation of melanoma-reactive CD8+ CTL. CTL with a range of melanoma specificities and different TCR alpha beta dimers were encountered in this patient, perhaps as a result of hyperimmunization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) View details for T-CELL RECEPTOR GENE USAGE OF ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR-SPECIFIC T-HELPER CELLS Melms, A., Oksenberg, J.

In this study of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein-induced uveitis, TCR V beta usage was studied using RNA-polymerase chain reaction amplification of transcripts derived directly from ocular tissues and from T cell lines obtained from the spleen. Specific V beta 5' primers from the major murine TCR V beta families were coupled with a common 3' primer from the V beta C region. Amplification of rearranged TCR V beta-D beta-J beta-C beta sequences was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. In ocular tissue from sensitized mice, TCR V beta expression was limited mainly to one to three V beta families, with predominant expression of V beta 2, V beta 12, and V beta 15. In most animals there was similar, albeit limited, TCR gene usage in both the recognition of autoantigen in uveitogenic T cell lines and at the site of inflammation in the eye. Identification of a limited TCR V beta repertoire in Ag-reactive T cell lines correlated with TCR usage at the target site of autoimmune expression. The gene products of the restricted TCR V beta rearrangements found in lesions and in the cell lines may serve as the target for selective immunotherapy.

P., Steinman, L. The diversity of Ag-specific receptors on T cells homing to an inflammatory infiltrate in the central nervous system has been analyzed. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a T cell-mediated inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, was induced in Lewis rats with a CD4+, CD8- T cell line specific for peptide 68-86 of myelin basic protein. Within the line a wide array of TCR V beta genes was transcribed including the V beta 8, V beta 10, V beta 15, V beta 16, and V beta 19 families. Accumulation of T cells at the site of inflammation was determined by using RNA-polymerase chain reaction amplification of rearranged TCR V beta transcripts derived from brain. By 8 to 10 h after i.p. infusion of the pathogenic T cell line, TCR V beta transcripts, including mainly V beta families that were predominantly rearranged by the line, could be identified in brains. Restricted TCR V gene transcripts with predominance of the V beta 8 family were identified in brain 48 h after injection, before onset of disease. Paralysis was apparent by 4 to 5 days after injection. At this time diverse V beta gene transcripts were detected in brain, reaching a maximum by day 9, when paralyzed rats have recovered. By day 14 a second stage of limited heterogeneity in the T cell infiltrate could be identified with predominant expression of V beta 8, V beta 9, V beta 10, and V beta 19. Interestingly, three out of these four V beta families were predominantly expressed within the encephalitogenic line. Thus, T cell migration to brain in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is characterized by a rapid penetration of T cells followed by a selective trapping of T cells before the clinical manifestations of disease. When clinical disease was present the T cell infiltrate was diverse, whereas in the post-acute phase of disease the T cells in the central nervous system had limited heterogeneity with selective accumulation of T cells transcribing the same V regions that were detected in the line that incited disease.

Transcription of V beta genes was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on RNA extracted from spinal cord, and expression of the V beta gene products was detected by immunohistochemistry with mAb specific for various V beta proteins. Multiple V beta genes were found to be transcribed and expressed in the central nervous system starting 7 days after immunization, and continuing up to 3 wk after clinical recovery. Preferential utilization of a single TCR V beta gene was not detected in the central nervous system at any time in the course of disease.

C., ALLSUP, A., SODERBERG, C., Anzola, J., Freitas, V., Turck, C., Steinman, L., Peltz, G. Forty-three CD3+4+8- TCR alpha beta+ Borrelia burgdorferi-reactive T cell clones isolated from the peripheral blood of a single patient with clinically active chronic Lyme arthritis were characterized. The spirochetal Ag recognized by 16 of these T cell clones was determined by reactivity with a panel of recombinant spirochetal Ag, which included the OspA, OspB, flagellin, Hsp60 and Hsp70 proteins. All three T cell clones reactive with heat shock proteins recognized a non-cross-reactive epitope unique to the spirochetal Ag. Analysis of the TCR V regions revealed preferential usage of V beta 5.1; 5 of 15 T cell clones that recognized an unidentified spirochetal Ag utilized this V beta gene segment. Most of the T cell clones recognized a given spirochetal Ag exclusively within the context of one HLA class II allele. However, two T cell clones, which recognized an unidentified Ag in the spirochetal lysate within the context of different HLA class II alleles, were both TCR V beta 5.1+, although each displayed a distinct alpha-chain. Moreover, in vitro incubation of this patient's PBMC with B. burgdorferi Ag resulted in a specific increase in the percentage of T cells expressing TCR V beta 5.1. These results indicate that B. burgdorferi has a V beta-selective factor influencing the cellular immune response in a patient with clinically active Lyme disease.

G., Steinman, L., Brocke, S. Superantigens have the ability to stimulate a subset of T cells based upon their expressed TCR beta-chain. It has been demonstrated that the administration of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in mice leads to unresponsiveness in V beta 8+ T cells in vivo which are the same T cells that could be stimulated in vitro by this enterotoxin. We present here data on the effect of SEB administration in DBA/2 and (PL/J x SJL)F1 mice on their T cell response to two different T cell determinants, the responses against which are dominated by the use of V beta 8+ T cells. Treatment of mice with SEB not only diminished their primary T cell proliferative response to these determinants, but also was able to effectively reduce the memory T cell response. SEB treatment, however, showed only a modest effect in preventing Ac 1-11-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in H-2u mice.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system in which a restricted cellular immune response has been observed. In order to establish whether such T cell responses are likely to be antigen-specific particularly with regard to myelin basic protein (MBP), we analysed T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements directly from MS brain plaques, using the polymerase chain reaction on reverse transcribed messenger RNA, and compared these with TCR of previously described MBP-specific T cell clones from MS and the rat model experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Rearranged V beta 5.2 genes were detected in the brains of all patients who were HLA DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602, DPB1*0401. The V beta 5.2-D beta-J beta sequences in these MS brain plaques revealed five motifs. One of the common motifs was identical to that described for the VDJ region of a V beta 5.2 T-cell clone. This clone was from an MS patient who was HLA DRB1*1501, DQB1*0602, DPB1*0401, and it was cytotoxic towards targets containing the MBP peptide 89-106 (ref. 1). The deduced amino-acid sequence of this VDJ rearrangement, Leu-Arg-Gly, has also been described in rat T cells cloned from experimental allergic encephalomyelitis lesions, which are specific for MBP peptide 87-99 (ref. 2). VDJ sequences with specificity for this MBP epitope constitute a large fraction (40%) of the TCR V beta 5.2 N(D)N rearrangements in MS lesions. The capacity of rat T cells with these VDJ sequences to cause experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and the prevalence of such sequences in demyelinated human lesions indicate that T cells with this rearranged TCR may be critical in MS.

Each episode improved after treatment with steroids. Laboratory studies revealed no evidence of multiple sclerosis or a structural spinal lesion. He had antinuclear and anti-DNA antibodies and the HLA-A1, B8, DR3 haplotype known to be associated with certain autoimmune diseases. We propose an autoimmune cause for the recurrent episodes of myelitis. View details for RECURRENT TRANSVERSE MYELITIS, MYASTHENIA-GRAVIS, AND AUTOANTIBODIES The minimum structural requirements for peptide interactions with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and with T cell receptors (TCRs) were examined. In this report we show that substituting alanines at all but five amino acids in the myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide Ac1-11 does not alter its ability to bind A alpha uA beta u (MHC class II molecules), to stimulate specific T cells and, surprisingly, to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in (PL/J x SJL/J)F1 mice. Most other amino acid side chains in the Ac1-11 peptide are essentially irrelevant for T cell stimulation and for disease induction. Further analysis revealed that binding to A alpha uA beta u occurred with a peptide that consists mainly of alanines and only three of the original residues of Ac1-11. Moreover, when used as a coimmunogen with MBP Ac1-11, this peptide inhibited EAE. The finding that a specific in vivo response can be generated by a peptide containing only five native residues provides evidence that disease-inducing TCRs recognize only a very short sequence of the MHC-bound peptide.

O. Expression of the lymphokine genes in human astroglial cell lineage was studied. Primers for 9 different human lymphokines, from IL-1 alpha to IL-8, were used to analyze RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma, one neuroblastoma cell line and 4 fresh brain specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). mRNA transcripts of neither IL-1 nor IL-3, the biological activities of which were observed in rat primary cultured astrocytes, could be detected within these cell lines. Two out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U138 and U373, expressed IL-6 genes. IL-8 gene was detected within U87, U138, U251, U373 glioma cells. After stimulation with IL-1 beta, all astrocytoma and one neuroblastoma cell line expressed IL-6 and IL-8 genes. In addition to the cultured cells, we examined IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression within human malignant astrocytoma specimens. The result shows that three out of four glioma specimens expressed IL-6 and IL-8 genes. From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived IL-6 or IL-8 may participate in local immune reactions accompanying infection, degeneration and malignancies in the central nervous system. [An analysis of lymphokine gene expression within astrocytoma]. The profile of lymphokines secreted by 14 T cell clones and 24 T cell lines reactive with Yersinia Ag isolated from the synovial fluid cells of two HLA-B27+ patients with Yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis was characterized. In response to Ag-specific or -nonspecific stimulation, all of the Yersinia-reactive T cell clones and lines had a pattern of lymphokine secretion resembling that of murine (Th1) cells. A total of 50% of T cell lines and clones randomly isolated from a reactive arthritis patient, without prior in vitro stimulation with Yersinia Ag, also exhibited a Th1-like profile of cytokine secretion upon nonspecific activation. This indicates that the selective expansion of this subset of T cells had already occurred in vivo. The possibility that the predominance of Th1-like T cells was an artefact generated by the T cell cloning procedure was excluded; 50% of the randomly isolated T cell clones and lines produced IL-4, IL-5, or both cytokines upon nonspecific activation. These results indicate that Yersinia Ag selectively activate a Th1-like subset of T cells in patients with Yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis. Accumulation of such cells in the synovial tissue of patients with reactive arthritis may play a key role in the pathogenesis of this disease.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory neurologic disease initiated by myelin basic protein-reactive CD4+ T cells, which are restricted by a particular MHC class II molecule. Recent studies have utilized inhibitor peptides that bind to restricting MHC class II molecules in order to inhibit EAE, presumably by means of competing with encephalitogenic epitopes. However, these studies leave open the possibility of alternative explanations, such as Ag-specific nonresponsiveness and immunodominance. In order to demonstrate that competition for MHC binding alone can inhibit EAE, the inhibitor peptide should ideally be structurally unrelated and nonimmunogenic yet physically associate with the MHC class II molecule. In this study, we show that the OVA-323-339 peptide, which is unrelated to the disease-inducing peptide, binds to A alpha uA beta u. However, although OVA-323-339 is extremely immunogenic in A alpha dA beta d-expressing BALB/c mice, it is nonimmunogenic in (PL/J x SJL)F1 and PL/J mice expressing A alpha uA beta u. When administered as a coimmunogen with Ac1-11, OVA-323-339 inhibited induction of EAE in (PL/J x SJL)F1 mice. Myelin basic protein-89-101, which does not bind A alpha uA beta u, had no effect on the disease process. This study provides evidence that MHC class II binding alone can modulate the induction of EAE. The use of a nonimmunogenic non-self peptide to modulate an autoimmune disease minimizes the potential complications of immunodominance or alternative regulatory mechanisms associated with immunogenic peptide therapies and further confirms the MHC-blocking model of immunosuppression.

Applications of PCR have revolutionized the field of immunogenetics particularly in studies of human leukocyte antigen class II polymorphism and more recently in the analysis of T cell receptor usage. The diversity of the variable region of the T cell receptor, however, has made it difficult to amplify the complete repertoire of T cell receptor transcripts. We have chosen to address this problem through the design of oligonucleotide primers specific for each of the known V alpha- and V beta-region T cell receptor families in order to characterize the T cell receptor repertoire. Using nonradioactive probes labeled with horse radish peroxidase, the system presented here allows for the rapid elucidation of the T cell receptor repertoire expressed in cells or tissue samples, such as those derived from autoimmune lesions. The identification of the T cell receptor repertoire involved in a pathogenic process can have therapeutic implications given the success of reversing experimental autoimmune disorders by directing specific forms of immunotherapy against V region gene products.

Primers for 18 different human TCR V alpha and 21 V beta families were used to analyze TCRV-(D)-J-C gene rearrangements in TILs in 8 human malignant glioma specimens obtained at surgery. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, we detected limited TCR variable region, V alpha gene expression in malignant glial tumors and also V alpha 7 and V alpha 12 TCR genes were preferentially expressed. Usage of TCR V beta gene was not as restricted as in TCR V alpha. These TILs expressing a limited repertoire of TCRs might be isolated, expanded, and used therapeutically for treatment of malignant brain tumors.

Gene delivery by transplantation of normal myoblasts has been proposed as a treatment of the primary defect, lack of the muscle protein dystrophin, that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a lethal human muscle degenerative disorder. To test this possibility, we transplanted normal myoblasts from a father or an unaffected sibling into the muscle of eight boys with DMD, and assessed their production of dystrophin. Three patients with deletions in the dystrophin gene expressed normal dystrophin transcripts in muscle biopsy specimens taken from the transplant site one month after myoblast injection. Using the polymerase chain reaction we established that the dystrophin in these biopsies derived from donor myoblast DNA. These results show that transplanted myoblasts persist and produce dystrophin in muscle fibres of DMD patients.

Applications of the polymerase chain reaction have revolutionized the field of immunogenetics, particularly in studies of human leukocyte antigen class II polymorphism, and more recently in the analysis of T-cell receptor usage. However, the enormous diversity and variability of the T-cell receptor complex have made the amplification of the complete repertoire difficult. Several methods have been devised to address this problem. Each system is described with recent examples of its use and an assessment of its advantages and disadvantages. The use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction in T-cell receptor analysis is also discussed. The elucidation of the T-cell repertoire involved in a pathogenic process can have therapeutic implications, given the success of reversing experimental autoimmune disorders by directing specific forms of immunotherapy against V region gene products. View details for THE POLYMERASE CHAIN-REACTION FOR DETECTION OF T-CELL ANTIGEN RECEPTOR EXPRESSION The interaction of the immunodominant pertussis toxin peptide containing residues 30-42 (p30-42) with soluble DR1 molecules and the T-cell receptor (TCR) of 12 DR1-restricted human T-cell clones has been analyzed. Peptide analogues of p30-42 containing single alanine substitutions were used in DR1-binding and T-cell proliferation assays to identify the major histocompatibility complex and TCR contact residues. Each T-cell clone was found to recognize p30-42 with a different fine specificity. However, a common core comprising amino acids 33-39 was found to be important for stimulation of all T-cell clones. Within this core two residues, Leu33 and Leu36, interact with the DR1 molecule, whereas Asp34, His35, Thr37, and Arg39 are important for TCR recognition in most of the clones. Computer modeling of the structure of p30-42 showed that an alpha-helical conformation is compatible with the experimental data. The analysis of TCR rearrangement revealed that the peptide was recognized by T-cell clones expressing different variable region alpha (V alpha) and variable region beta (V beta) chains, although a preferential use of V alpha 8-V beta 13 and V alpha 11-V beta 18 combinations was found in clones from the same donor. Understanding the details of the interaction of antigenic peptides with the major histocompatibility complex and TCR molecules should provide the theoretical basis to design T-cell epitopes and obtain more immunogenic vaccines.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory condition of the central nervous system with similarities to multiple sclerosis. In both diseases, circulating leukocytes penetrate the blood-brain barrier and damage myelin, resulting in impaired nerve conduction and paralysis. We sought to identify the adhesion receptors that mediate the attachment of circulating leukocytes to inflamed brain endothelium in EAE, because this interaction is the first step in leukocyte entry into the central nervous system. Using an in vitro adhesion assay on tissue sections, we found that lymphocytes and monocytes bound selectively to inflamed EAE brain vessels. Binding was inhibited by antibodies against the integrin molecule alpha 4 beta 1, but not by antibodies against numerous other adhesion receptors. When tested in vivo, anti-alpha 4 integrin effectively prevented the accumulation of leukocytes in the central nervous system and the development of EAE. Thus, therapies designed to interfere with alpha 4 beta 1 integrin may be useful in treating inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis.

C., SANCHEZMADRID, F., Steinman, L., Karin, N. Anti-I-A antibodies, administered in vivo at the time of S-antigen injection, suppress development of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in Lewis rats. While the effects of anti-I-A are profound, the exact mechanism for this suppression is unknown. We attempted adoptive transfer of this form of suppression by injecting lymphocytes from anti-I-A-treated animals into syngeneic recipients which were later injected with S-antigen. Histologically, globes of 75% of the anti-I-A-treated animals showed no inflammation while 25% of these animals developed mild uveitis. In the group of animals which were injected with S-antigen and also received spleen cells from anti-I-A-treated rats, only 1 showed mild uveitis while the remaining 7 had no inflammation. The animals undergoing adoptive transfer of spleen cells and which were primed with an irrelevant antigen, readily developed uveitis. Suppression of S-antigen-induced EAU was abrogated by pretreatment of donor animals with cyclophosphamide. In vitro studies revealed that spleen cells of S-antigen-primed, anti-I-A-treated donors specifically suppressed lymphocyte responses to S-antigen. These in vivo and in vitro results suggest that generation of antigen-specific suppressor cells play a role in the anti-I-A immunotherapy of EAU.

View details for ASSOCIATION OF SUSCEPTIBILITY TO MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS WITH TCR GENES With the aim of investigating the distribution of T cells expressing different T-cell receptors (TCR) in the inflamed synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis patients, we have used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify TCR V alpha and V beta transcripts from synovial biopsies obtained by arthroscopy from patients with arthritis of variable duration. From each of nine patients a single biopsy was taken. Southern hybridization analysis of amplified products revealed extensive heterogeneity of TCR V beta in most patients. On the other hand, restriction in V alpha gene expression was seen in several patients. A highly restricted V alpha repertoire was observed in all cases with arthritis of short duration. In addition, two of three samples of short duration yielded a more limited number of V beta transcripts than the others. No conformity was, however, seen in usage of individual V alpha and V beta transcripts among the investigated patients. The present data thus demonstrate variability in synovial TCR expression between rheumatoid arthritis patients, but they also indicate a development towards greater diversity with increasing disease duration, implicating the necessity for careful choice of cases, preferentially selecting for early stages of disease, when further analysing rheumatoid synovial T cells for TCR usage as well as for antigen specificity.

Expression of granulocyte (G) and granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony stimulating factor (CSF) genes in human cells of astroglial lineage was studied. Primers for CSFs were used to analyze RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma cell lines and 8 fresh brain specimens by polymerase chain reaction. Constitutive expression of mRNA transcripts of GM-CSF could be detected in all astrocytoma and one neuroblastoma cell lines, and two out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U87MG and U138 MG, expressed G-CSF genes. After stimulation with interleukin (IL)-1 beta + tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, all cell lines expressed G-CSF. In addition to the cultured cells, we examined gene expression within human malignant astrocytoma, peritumoral brain and autopsied normal brains. The results show that some of the tumor and its surrounding reactive lesions express G- and GM-CSF genes but normal brains do not. The concentration of G- and GM-CSF in supernatants of cultured cells was assessed at the protein level by ELISA. A low level of GM-CSF activity was constitutively present in all astrocytomas. G-CSF was detected in unstimulated U87MG and U138MG and other cell lines could synthesize G-CSF after the stimulation of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha at the level of mRNA. Furthermore, the concentration of CSFs increased markedly upon stimulation with IL-1 beta and/or TNF-alpha in both a time- and dose-dependent fashion. From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived CSFs may participate in local immune reactions accompanying infection, degeneration and malignancies in the brain.

This study has led to novel immunotherapeutic approaches, many of which are based on the administration of synthetic peptides. Since short peptides are understood to be the minimal antigenic units bound by MHC molecules for recognition by T cells, they are attractive experimental tools for finely modulating specific immune responses. It is clear that a large number of defined peptides can dramatically influence the course of EAE. Table IV lists a number of potential mechanisms which may mediate disease prevention. Increasing evidence supports the idea that prevention of autoimmune disease can result from MHC-blockade by peptides which competitively bind to class II molecules. However, for some peptides such as the perplexing partial agonist Ac1-11[4A], the mechanism by which these precisely defined units act is not yet fully understood. Numerous hurdles hinder immediate clinical application of peptide-based immunotherapy. Nevertheless, the knowledge gained by probing experimental autoimmunity with defined peptides promises to inspire original and practical approaches to treating human autoimmune disease. EAE: a model for immune intervention with synthetic peptides. Smilek, D. E., Gautam, A. M., Pearson, C., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. Expression of lymphokine genes in the human astroglial cell lineage was studied. Primers for 9 different human lymphokines, from IL-1 alpha to IL-8, were used to analyze RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma cell lines and fresh brain specimens by PCR. mRNA transcripts for IL-8 were detected in all neuroglial cells. In addition to the cultured cells, we examined IL-8 gene expression within human malignant astrocytoma, peritumoral brain and autopsied normal brains. The result shows that tumor and cells of the surrounding reactive lesion express IL-8 genes, but it is not expressed in normal brains. Next, the concentration of IL-8 in supernatants of cultured cells was measured quantitatively by a solid phase ELISA assay. IL-8 activity was produced constitutively in all astrocytomas and increased markedly upon stimulation with IL-1 beta or TNF alpha, in both a time- and dose-dependent fashion. From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived IL-8 may take part in neutrophil-mediated inflammation which accompanies infection, degeneration and malignancy in the brain.

Primers for 5 different human cytokine, TNF-alpha, -beta, IFN-gamma, G-CSF and GM-CSF, were used to analyze messenger RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma, one neuroblastoma cell lines and fresh brain specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Three out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U138, U251, U373 MG and IMR32 neuroblastoma cells expressed TNF-alpha genes. After stimulation with IL-1 beta (1000 U/ml) all these cell lines expressed TNF-alpha genes. TNF-beta genes could not be detected in these cell lines even in the presence of any cytokine stimuli. We were able to detect expression of IFN-gamma genes within 2 astrocytoma cell lines (U87MG and A172), which interestingly did not show TNF-alpha activity. Constitutive expression of mRNA transcripts of GM -CSF could be detected in all astrocytoma and two out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U87MG and U138MG, expressed G-CSF genes. After stimulation with IL-1 beta, all cell lines expressed G-CSF. In addition, we also examined gene expression of these cytokines within 4 human malignant astrocytoma specimens, 2 peritumoral brain and 2 autopsied normal brains. The results show that tumor and surrounding lesions express TNF-alpha (4 of 6), TNF-beta (1/6), IFN-gamma (4/6), G-CSF (3/6) and GM-CSF (5/6) but not normal brains. One tumor specimen also expresses TNF-beta as well as TNF-alpha genes (case 2). From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived cytokines may participate in local immune reactions accompanying glioma in the brain. PROSPECTS FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY DIRECTED TO THE T-CELL RECEPTOR IN HUMAN AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASE Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an experimental demyelinating disease of rodents. In (PL/J x SJL) F1 mice, it is induced by immunization with the myelin basic protein peptide Ac1-11. Ac1-11 [4A], a myelin basic protein peptide analog with a single amino acid substitution, (i) binds to class II major histocompatibility complex molecules and stimulates encephalitogenic T cells in vitro better than Ac1-11, (ii) is nonimmunogenic and nonencephalitogenic in vivo in (PL/J x SJL)F1 mice, (iii) prevents EAE when administered before or at the time of immunization with Ac1-11, and (iv) prevents EAE when administered later, near the time of disease onset. Initial studies suggest that Ac1-11 [4A] does not prevent EAE by competitive inhibition or by activation of regulatory cells. Thus, substitution of a single amino acid in a myelin basic protein peptide confers the capacity to prevent rather than induce EAE, even after peptide-specific encephalitogenic T cells have been activated. View details for [Expression of cytokine genes within astrocytoma cell lines and brain specimens]. Expression of T-cell-receptor (TCR) V alpha and V beta genes in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) of 29 patients, 15 melanomas and 14 malignant glial tumors (glioma and medulloblastoma), was investigated. The identification and propagation of T cells with anti-tumor reactivity is crucial to the understanding of the human immune response to tumors, which may possibly be useful in the successful implementation of adoptive immunotherapy against cancer. Despite clinical evidence that a more favorable prognosis is associated with the degree of lymphocyte infiltration within a tumor, the actual role of TIL remains uncertain. In order to address this question, we examined the diversity of the RNA transcripts of TCR genes in TILs within 29 specimens obtained at surgery. Using the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) method and primers for 18 different human TCR V alpha and 21 V beta families to analyze TCR V-(D)-J-C gene rearrangements, we detected a limited expression of TCR variable-region V alpha genes of TILs. TCR V beta gene rearrangements were more diverse than those for V alpha. In addition to restricted usage of TCR V alpha genes, preferential expression of V alpha 7 genes was found in 20 out of 29 cases (69%). Predominant usage of V alpha 7 genes was more remarkable in melanoma TILs (14/15) than in glial tumor TILs (6/14). These findings were also confirmed by Southern blot analysis with oligonucleotide probes for the constant (C) region of TCR alpha and beta chains. We suspect that some specific T-cell populations may be directed to antigenic determinants in melanoma cells.

E., Wraith, D. C., Hodgkinson, S., Dwivedy, S., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. Expression of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within primary and metastatic melanoma specimens was studied. In order to analyze TCR gene transcription in TILs within these tissues, we analyzed reverse transcribed complementary DNA from mRNA directly from tissues using the polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction-amplified products were confirmed by dot or Southern blot hybridization with C alpha or C beta oligoprobes. First, we investigated the diversity of TCR V alpha and V beta gene usage in human malignant melanoma patients with multiple metastasis. We found in one patient, bearing multiple skin lesions, that the patterns of TCR V alpha and V beta repertoires in different sites of the skin (leg and chest wall) were almost the same. However, in another patient with skin and brain melanomas, different TCR repertoires were presented. Next, we examined the usage of murine TCR V beta genes in TILs within the primary and metastatic sites (liver, lung, and brain) of C57BL/6 mice bearing B16-F10 murine melanoma. The population of TILs in each primary and metastatic site expressed from one to four TCR V beta genes. In each metastatic site, the profile of TCR V beta gene expression was different. A different TCR V beta usage in TILs distributed within metastases of various organs may reflect differences in tumor antigenicity at these sites or may be due to differential homing patterns to these tumors. View details for AN ANALYSIS OF T-CELL-RECEPTOR VARIABLE-REGION GENES IN TUMOR-INFILTRATING LYMPHOCYTES WITHIN MALIGNANT-TUMORS The pace of research on the pathogenesis and treatment of multiple sclerosis, the principal human demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, has intensified in the past 3 years, due in part, to the application of advances in molecular and cellular immunology. Many lessons that have been learned in an animal model of central nervous system demyelinating disease, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, also apply to multiple sclerosis and certain successful approaches for the treatment of this disease are now being attempted in humans. T-CELL RECEPTOR V-BETA GENE-EXPRESSION DIFFERS IN TUMOR-INFILTRATING LYMPHOCYTES WITHIN PRIMARY AND METASTATIC MELANOMA NITTA, T., Bell, R., Okumura, K., Sato, K., Steinman, L. Some investigators have proposed myoblast transfer as a potential therapy for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Little is known about the immunobiology of myoblast transplantation. Transplantation rejection is mediated to a large extent by CD8+ T cells, which recognize alloantigens encoded by class I HLA genes, and by CD4+ T cells, which recognize alloantigens encoded by class II HLA genes. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is a potent inducer of HLA class II molecules as well as beta 2-microglobulin, which is co-expressed with HLA class I. IFN-gamma may be a critical cytokine involved in graft rejection. We purified human myoblasts by flow cytometry and incubated them in vitro for varying time periods with recombinant human IFN-gamma. The inducibility of HLA-DR and -DP molecules raises a note of caution concerning possible rejection phenomenon which might occur following myoblast transplantation.

To study antitumor immunity in patients with choroidal melanoma, T cells were generated from the peripheral blood of choroidal melanoma patients by mixed lymphocyte/tumor cell culture (MLTC). Because autologous tumors are generally unavailable, an allogeneic choroidal melanoma cell line, OCM-1, was used as the specific stimulus. Lymphocyte cultures from 27 patients were characterized by cell-surface phenotypes, patterns of reactivity towards cells of the melanocytic origin and T-cell-receptor gene usage. Antimelanoma reactivity was found in cell-sorter-purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. To analyze this reactivity, sorter-purified CD4+ and CD8+ cells from a MLTC were cloned by limiting dilution in the presence of exogenous interleukin-2 and interleukin-4 as well as irradiated OCM-1. Under these conditions, CD4+ T cells did not proliferate, perhaps because of the absence of antigen-presenting cells. However, CD8+ grew vigorously and 29 cytolytic CD8+ T cell clones were isolated. On the basis of their pattern of lysis of OCM-1, a skin melanoma cell line M-7 and its autologous lymphoblastoid cell line LCL-7, the clones were categorized into three groups. Group 1, representing 52% of the clones, lysed all three target cells, and are alloreactive. However, since OCM-1 and M-7 did not share class I antigens, these clones recognized cross-reactive epitope(s) of the histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) molecule. Group 2, constituting 28% of the clones, lysed both the ocular and skin melanoma cell lines but not LCL-7, and were apparently melanoma-specific. Unlike classical HLA-restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes, these T cells might mediate the lysis of melanoma cells via other ligands or a more degenerate type of HLA restriction. For the latter, the HLA-A2 and -A28 alleles would have to act interchangeably as the restriction element for shared melanoma-associated antigen(s). Group 3, representing only 10% of the T cell clones, was cytotoxic only to OCM-1, but not to M-7 or LCL-7. These clones may recognize antigens unique to ocular melanoma cells. Our data suggest that choroidal melanoma patients can recognize melanoma-associated antigens common to both ocular and cutaneous melanoma cells, and presumbly their autologous tumor. Thus, choroidal melanoma, like its skin counterpart, may be responsive to immunotherapeutic regimens such as active specific or adoptive cellular immunotherapy.

Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a T cell mediated model of demyelinating disease that develops as a result of an autoimmune response to the myelin structural antigen, myelin basic protein (MBP). Much information has accumulated on the nature of trimolecular interactions which lead to the activation of self-reactive T lymphocytes in this disorder. Many parallels exist in the etiopathogenesis of EAE and multiple sclerosis (MS). Based upon these similarities selective immunotherapy that targets either class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex or T cell receptor variable region genes will be described for EAE with consideration given to application of these principles in MS.

R., Posner, M. R., Mitchell, M. S. Oligonucleotide probes were used to investigate the role of DQ beta molecules in susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. Although shared amino acid and nucleotide sequences in DQ beta 1 have been suggested to be critical in disease development, we find that the distribution of sequences corresponding to residues 71-77 is not greater in patients versus controls.

View details for THE DEVELOPMENT OF RATIONAL STRATEGIES FOR SELECTIVE IMMUNOTHERAPY AGAINST AUTOIMMUNE DEMYELINATING DISEASE Chimeric (murine/human) anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody was infused into seven patients with mycosis fungoides. Successive patients received doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg of antibody twice a week for 3 consecutive weeks. All patients had some clinical improvement, but responses were of relatively short duration. Serum levels of chimeric antibody varied as a function of dose. At the 80-mg dose level, antibody was readily observed in biopsied skin lesions. Although there was coating by antibody of most CD4 positive cells in the blood, there was no significant depletion of CD4 positive cells. Low-level antibody responses against the mouse Ig variable region and human Ig allotypic constant region determinants were observed in several patients, but none were of clinical significance. All but two patients made primary antibody and T-cell proliferative responses to a simultaneously administered foreign protein test antigen. However, there was marked suppression of the mixed lymphocyte reaction. We conclude that at the dose levels studied, a chimeric anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (1) had some clinical efficacy against mycosis fungoides; (2) was well tolerated; (3) had a low level of immunogenicity; (4) had immediate immunosuppressive effects; and (5) did not induce tolerance to a co-injected antigen.

We isolated a complementary DNA clone encoding a 52-kd protein recognized by an anti-neuronal cell antibody in serum from a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration associated with uterine carcinoma. The recombinant protein expressed in prokaryotic cells was specifically recognized by the anti-neuronal cell antibody from the patient, and its molecular weight was identical to that of antigenic proteins in the cerebellum. The deduced protein consisted of 450 amino acids dominated by hydrophilic residues, the calculated relative molecular mass was 51,238, and the predicted value of the isoelectric point was 4.99. This complementary DNA sequence and the deduced protein sequence have not been reported previously, and the sequences showed no homologies with the complimentary DNA or the amino acid sequences in the GenBank, EMBL, or NBRF databases, including the complementary DNA for a 34-kd cerebellar protein (CDR34) that is recognized by an anti-Purkinje cell antibody. Unexpectedly, the transcript of this gene was detected not only in the cerebellum and the brain stem but also in an extraneural tissue, the intestine.

S., Hoppe, R., Abel, E. A., Steinman, L., Berger, R. G., Gaiser, C., Young, G., Bindl, J., Hanham, A., Reichert, T. Over the past decade monoclonal antibodies have been successfully employed in a number of animal models of autoimmune disease. We have used antibodies to the class II gene products of the major histocompatibility complex, the CD4 molecule on helper T cells, and the T-cell receptor. Monoclonal anti-class II antibodies have been administered to treat paralytic disease in the animal model of multiple sclerosis--experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These antibodies not only reverse acute paralytic disease but also decrease the number of relapses in a model of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis when given after the first attack. The advantage of this form of therapy is that it is haplotype specific. In other words, in a heterozygous individual it is possible to block the major histocompatibility gene associated with disease susceptibility while leaving other major histocompatibility gene products free for antigen presentation. Thus, animals given this form of immunotherapy are not significantly immunosuppressed. Antibodies to the CD4 molecule have been equally effective in treating animal models of autoimmunity. We and others have reversed ongoing paralysis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Relapses have been diminished after the administration of anti-CD4. Antibodies to CD4 have been used successfully to treat animal models of systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia gravis. Recent trials with anti-CD4 have been successful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The latter trial employed a chimeric human/mouse antibody. Antibodies to the variable region of the T-cell receptor have been employed to treat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ISOLATION OF A COMPLEMENTARY-DNA CLONE ENCODING AN AUTOANTIGEN RECOGNIZED BY AN ANTINEURONAL CELL ANTIBODY FROM A PATIENT WITH PARANEOPLASTIC CEREBELLAR DEGENERATION Sakai, K., Mitchell, D.

Genomic DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes and brain plaques of patients with MS was analyzed for the presence of sequences homologous to the HTLV-I pol gene using the polymerase chain reaction and dot blot techniques. Comparison of DNA amplification patterns between patients with MS, and with control subjects who have other autoimmune conditions, with those in healthy control subjects and with an HTLV-I-infected cell line indicates that HTLV-I pol sequence is not present in the peripheral blood of patients with MS, and that the virus is not active in MS brain plaques.

Stages tell the size of the tumor and how far the cancer has spread. But chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is different. It rarely causes tumors. And because it's in your bone marrow and blood, the leukemia cells are always traveling around the body.  Instead of stages, CML is described in phases. The phases note how many immature white blood cells (blasts) are in the blood or bone marrow. The phase of CML is one of the most important things to know when deciding how to treat this type of leukemia.  During this phase, you have fewer than 10% immature white blood cells (blasts) in your blood or bone marrow. Symptoms are mild and get better with standard treatments. Most people diagnosed with CML are in this phase. During this phase, you have more than 10% but fewer than 20% blasts. Or you have more than 20% of another type of white blood cell called basophils. Or you have a very abnormal platelet count. You may have symptoms such as a fever, low appetite, enlarged spleen, and weight loss. Symptoms and blood counts may not respond as well to treatment. The leukemia cells may have abnormal changes in their chromosomes. During this phase, you have more than 20% of the blasts in your blood or bone marrow. These blast cells often spread outside the bone marrow. Blood counts are not normal. You may have symptoms such as tiredness, fever, loss of appetite, bleeding, shortness of breath, and an enlarged spleen. This phase is considered aggressive. This means the cancer is growing quickly.

OBJECTIVE: To discuss the pathogenic and diagnostic relevance of cellular and humoral immune responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) and pertinent observations made in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).METHODS: Review of pertinent literature. RESULTS: There is at least 1 precedent for an antibody response against a viral pathogen that fails to provide host protection in the absence of immune-competent CD4+ T cells. PML is an infection of the CNS caused by JC virus (JCV), which commonly occurs during treatment with the therapeutic monoclonal antibody natalizumab. In this context, the humoral immune response fails to prevent JCV reactivation, and elevated anti-JCV serum indices are associated with a higher PML incidence. The more relevant immune-competent cells in host defense against JCV appear to be T cells. T cell-mediated responses are also detectable in convalescing patients with SARS-COV-2 irrespective of the humoral immune response.CONCLUSION: Based on pathogenic lessons learned from PML under natalizumab therapy, we suggest the incorporation of functional assays that determine neutralizing properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. In addition, we outline the potential role of T-cell detection assays in determining herd immunity in a given population or in studying therapeutic responses to vaccines. Reduced development of COVID-19 in children reveals molecular checkpoints gating pathogenesis illuminating potential therapeutics. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Steinman, J. B., Lum, F. M., Ho, P. P., Kaminski, N., Steinman, L. The reduced development of COVID-19 for children compared to adults provides some tantalizing clues on the pathogenesis and transmissibility of this pandemic virus. First, ACE2, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor, is reduced in the respiratory tract in children. Second, coronavirus associated with common colds in children may offer some protection, due to cross-reactive humoral immunity and T cell immunity between common coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2. Third, T helper 2 immune responses are protective in children. Fourth, surprisingly, eosinophilia, associated with T helper 2, may be protective. Fifth, children generally produce lower levels of inflammatory cytokines. Finally, the influence of the downturn in the global economy, the impact of living in quarters among families who are the most at risk, and factors including the openings of some schools, are considered. Those most disadvantaged socioeconomically may suffer disproportionately with COVID-19. A sugar-coated strategy to treat a rare neurologic disease provides a blueprint for a decoy glycan therapeutic and a potential vaccine for CoViD-19: An Editorial Highlight for ""Selective inhibition of anti-MAG IgM autoantibody binding to myelin by an antigen specific glycopolymer""on https://doi.org/10.1111/jnc.15021. In a rare neurologic disease known as IgM monoclonal gammopathy the immune system targets a sulfated trisaccharide known as the Human Natural Killer-1 (HNK-1) epitope that comprises a constituent of the myelin sheath known as MAG (myelin-associated glycoprotein). This Editorial highlights a study by Aliu and colleagues in the current issue of the Journal of Neurochemistry, in which the investigators constructed a biodegradable poly-l-lysine backbone withmultiple copies of this sulfated HNK-1trisaccharide.This decoy, poly(phenyl disodium 3-O-sulfo--d-glucopyranuronate)-(13)--d-galactopyranoside, known as PPSGG, removedanti-MAG IgM autoantibodies from the blood, while not activating the immune system. These findings provide a path for the selective removal of a pathogenic set of antibodies that target the myelin sheath resulting in neuropathy. These findings are applicable to a parallel strategy for the generation of polysaccharides similar to those present in the receptor-binding domain of CoViD-19, which might inhibit viral adhesion to its receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein, thereby impairing cellular uptake of the virus itself. The deployment of complex polysaccharides that mimic actual COVID19 polysaccharides on the spike protein may also provide a feasible structural basis for a vaccine. Carbohydrate mimics, if conjugated to a carrier or backbone, might provoke an immune response to the spike protein. A vaccine that targets critical carbohydrates on COVID19, and then neutralizes the virus would recapitulate a successful strategy employed in other microbial vaccines, like the pneumococcal vaccines and the meningococcal vaccines. These vaccines direct an immune response to complex carbohydrates and successfully prevent life-threatening disease. This paper provides lessons from a rare neurologic disease that may teach us strategies applicable to a global pandemic. Autoantibodies against central nervous system antigens in a subset of B cell-dominant multiple sclerosis patients. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Kuerten, S., Lanz, T. V., Lingampalli, N., Lahey, L. J., Kleinschnitz, C., Murer, M., Schroeter, M., Braune, S., Ziemssen, T., Ho, P. P., Robinson, W. H., Steinman, L. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), with characteristic inflammatory lesions and demyelination. The clinical benefit of cell-depleting therapies targeting CD20 has emphasized the role of B cells and autoantibodies in MS pathogenesis. We previously introduced an enzyme-linked immunospot spot (ELISpot)-based assay to measure CNS antigen-specific B cells in the blood of MS patients and demonstrated its usefulness as a predictive biomarker for disease activity in measuring the successful outcome of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Here we used a planar protein array to investigate CNS-reactive antibodies in the serum of MS patients as well as in B cell culture supernatants after polyclonal stimulation. Anti-CNS antibody reactivity was evident in the sera of the MS cohort, and the antibodies bound a heterogeneous set of molecules, including myelin, axonal cytoskeleton, and ion channel antigens, in individual patients. Immunoglobulin reactivity in supernatants of stimulated B cells was directed against a broad range of CNS antigens. A group of MS patients with a highly active B cell component was identified by the ELISpot assay. Those antibody reactivities remained stable over time. These assays with protein arrays identify MS patients with a highly active B cell population with antibodies directed against a swathe of CNS proteins. Epstein-Barr Virus in Multiple Sclerosis: Theory and Emerging Immunotherapies. Bar-Or, A., Pender, M. P., Khanna, R., Steinman, L., Hartung, H., Maniar, T., Croze, E., Aftab, B. T., Giovannoni, G., Joshi, M. J. New treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) focused on B cells have created an atmosphere of excitement in the MS community. B cells are now known to play a major role in disease, demonstrated by the highly impactful effect of a B cell-depleting antibody on controlling MS. The idea that a virus may play a role in the development of MS has a long history and is supported mostly by studies demonstrating a link between B cell-tropic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and disease onset. Efforts to develop antiviral strategies for treating MS are underway. Although gaps remain in our understanding of the etiology of MS, the role, if any, of viruses in propagating pathogenic immune responses deserves attention. Antigen-specific tolerance to self-antigens in protein replacement therapy, gene therapy and autoimmunity. Steinman, L., Ho, P. P., Robinson, W. H., Utz, P. J., Villoslada, P. Trials of antigen-specific tolerance have been undertaken in the clinic for over fifty years and the results of these antigen-specific clinical trials are described in this review. Antigen-specific tolerization of the immune system in protein replacement therapy for hemophilia A is an accepted treatment. Clinical trials are ongoing for autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and rheumatoid arthritis with various antigen-specific strategies. Trials for tolerization in celiac disease aim for antigen specific tolerance to gluten, an environmental trigger, which may then halt the progression to autoimmunity targeting a self-antigen, tissue transglutaminase. Although many promising approaches have been demonstrated in pre-clinical models, this review will focus primarily on clinical trials of antigen-specific tolerance that have been taken to the clinic and with initial results reported in the peer reviewed literature. A separate article on approaches with CAR-T cells appears in this volume.

There are adaptive T-cell and antibody autoimmune responses to myelin-derived peptides in multiple sclerosis (MS) and to aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSDs). Strategies aimed at antigen-specific tolerance to these autoantigens are thus indicated for these diseases. One approach involves induction of tolerance with engineered dendritic cells (tolDCs) loaded with specific antigens. We conducted an in-human phase 1b clinical trial testing increasing concentrations of autologous tolDCs loaded with peptides from various myelin proteins and from AQP4. We tested this approach in 12 patients, 8 with MS and 4 with NMOSD. The primary end point was the safety and tolerability, while secondary end points were clinical outcomes (relapses and disability), imaging (MRI and optical coherence tomography), and immunological responses. Therapy with tolDCs was well tolerated, without serious adverse events and with no therapy-related reactions. Patients remained stable clinically in terms of relapse, disability, and in various measurements using imaging. We observed a significant increase in the production of IL-10 levels in PBMCs stimulated with the peptides as well as an increase in the frequency of a regulatory T cell, known as Tr1, by week 12 of follow-up. In this phase 1b trial, we concluded that the i.v. administration of peptide-loaded dendritic cells is safe and feasible. Elicitation of specific IL-10 production by peptide-specific T cells in MS and NMOSD patients indicates that a key element in antigen specific tolerance is activated with this approach. The results warrant further clinical testing in larger trials. Small Heat Shock Proteins, Amyloid Fibrils, and Nicotine Stimulate a Common Immune Suppressive Pathway with Implications for Future Therapies. Rothbard, J. B., Kurnellas, M. P., Ousman, S. S., Brownell, S., Rothbard, J. J., Steinman, L. The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) is central to the anti-inflammatory function of the vagus nerve in a physiological mechanism termed the inflammatory reflex. Studies on the inflammatory reflex have been instrumental for the current development of the field of bioelectronic medicine. An independent investigation of the biological role of alphaB-crystallin (HspB5), the most abundant gene transcript present in active multiple sclerosis lesions in human brains, also led to alpha7nAChR. Induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in HspB5-/- mice results in greater paralytic signs, increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and T-lymphocyte activation relative to wild-type animals. Administration of HspB5 was therapeutic in animal models of multiple sclerosis, retinal and cardiac ischemia, and stroke. Structure-activity studies established that residues 73-92 were as potent as the parent protein, but only when it formed amyloid fibrils. Amyloid fibrils and small heat shock proteins (sHsps) selectively bound alpha7nAChR on peritoneal macrophages (MPhis) and B lymphocytes, converting the MPhis to an immune suppressive phenotype and mobilizing the migration of both cell types from the peritoneum to secondary lymph organs. Here, we review multiple aspects of this work, which may be of interest for developing future therapeutic approaches for multiple sclerosis and other disorders. Engineered DNA plasmid reduces immunity to dystrophin while improving muscle force in a model of gene therapy of Duchenne dystrophy. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Ho, P. P., Lahey, L. J., Mourkioti, F., Kraft, P. E., Filareto, A., Brandt, M., Magnusson, K. E., Finn, E. E., Chamberlain, J. S., Robinson, W. H., Blau, H. M., Steinman, L. In gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy there are two potential immunological obstacles. An individual with Duchenne muscular dystrophy has a genetic mutation in dystrophin, and therefore the wild-type protein is ""foreign,"" and thus potentially immunogenic. The adeno-associated virus serotype-6 (AAV6) vector for delivery of dystrophin is a viral-derived vector with its own inherent immunogenicity. We have developed a technology where an engineered plasmid DNA is delivered to reduce autoimmunity. We have taken this approach into humans, tolerizing to myelin proteins in multiple sclerosis and to proinsulin in type 1 diabetes. Here, we extend this technology to a model of gene therapy to reduce the immunogenicity of the AAV vector and of the wild-type protein product that is missing in the genetic disease. Following gene therapy with systemic administration of recombinant AAV6-microdystrophin to mdx/mTRG2 mice, we demonstrated the development of antibodies targeting dystrophin and AAV6 capsid in control mice. Treatment with the engineered DNA construct encoding microdystrophin markedly reduced antibody responses to dystrophin and to AAV6. Muscle force in the treated mice was also improved compared with control mice. These data highlight the potential benefits of administration of an engineered DNA plasmid encoding the delivered protein to overcome critical barriers in gene therapy to achieve optimal functional gene expression. An amyloidogenic hexapeptide derived from amylin attenuates inflammation and acute lung injury in murine sepsis Mahapatra, S., Ying, L., Ho, P., Kurnellas, M., Rothbard, J., Steinman, L., Cornfield, D. N. Although the accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins in neuroinflammatory conditions is generally considered pathologic, in a murine model of multiple sclerosis, amyloid-forming fibrils, comprised of hexapeptides, are anti-inflammatory. Whether these molecules modulate systemic inflammatory conditions remains unknown. We hypothesized that an amylin hexapeptide that forms fibrils can attenuate the systemic inflammatory response in a murine model of sepsis. To test this hypothesis, mice were pre-treated with either vehicle or amylin hexapeptide (20 g) at 12 hours and 6 hours prior to intraperitoneal (i.p.) lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 20 mg/kg) administration. Illness severity and survival were monitored every 6 hours for 3 days. Levels of pro- (IL-6, TNF-, IFN-) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines were measured via ELISA at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after LPS (i.p.). As a metric of lung injury, pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) barrier function was tested 24 hours after LPS administration by comparing lung wet-to-dry ratios, Evan's blue dye (EBD) extravasation, lung histology and caspase-3 activity. Compared to controls, pretreatment with amylin hexapeptide significantly reduced mortality (p<0.05 at 72 h), illness severity (p<0.05), and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, while IL-10 levels were elevated (p<0.05). Amylin pretreatment attenuated LPS-induced lung injury, as demonstrated by decreased lung water and caspase-3 activity (p<0.05, versus PBS). Hence, in a murine model of systemic inflammation, pretreatment with amylin hexapeptide reduced mortality, disease severity, and preserved lung barrier function. Amylin hexapeptide may represent a novel therapeutic tool to mitigate sepsis severity and lung injury. Molecular signature of Epstein-Barr virus infection in MS brain lesions. Moreno, M.

Objective: We sought to confirm the presence and frequency of B cells and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (latent and lytic phase) antigens in archived MS and non-MS brain tissue by immunohistochemistry.Methods: We quantified the type and location of B-cell subsets within active and chronic MS brain lesions in relation to viral antigen expression. The presence of EBV-infected cells was further confirmed by in situ hybridization to detect the EBV RNA transcript, EBV-encoded RNA-1 (EBER-1).Results: We report the presence of EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) in 93% of MS and 78% of control brains, with a greater percentage of MS brains containing CD138+ plasma cells and LMP-1-rich populations. Notably, 78% of chronic MS lesions and 33.3% of non-MS brains contained parenchymal CD138+ plasma cells. EBV early lytic protein, EBV immediate-early lytic gene (BZLF1), was also observed in 46% of MS, primarily in association with chronic lesions and 44% of non-MS brain tissue. Furthermore, 85% of MS brains revealed frequent EBER-positive cells, whereas non-MS brains seldom contained EBER-positive cells. EBV infection was detectable, by immunohistochemistry and by in situ hybridization, in both MS and non-MS brains, although latent virus was more prevalent in MS brains, while lytic virus was restricted to chronic MS lesions.Conclusions: Together, our observations suggest an uncharacterized link between the EBV virus life cycle and MS pathogenesis. Identification of a common immune regulatory pathway induced by small heat shock proteins, amyloid fibrils, and nicotine. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Rothbard, J. B., Rothbard, J. J., Soares, L., Fathman, C. G., Steinman, L. Although certain dogma portrays amyloid fibrils as drivers of neurodegenerative disease and neuroinflammation, we have found, paradoxically, that amyloid fibrils and small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). They reduce clinical paralysis and induce immunosuppressive pathways, diminishing inflammation. A key question was the identification of the target for these molecules. When sHsps and amyloid fibrils were chemically cross-linked to immune cells, a limited number of proteins were precipitated, including the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 NAChR). The alpha7 NAChR is noteworthy among the over 20 known receptors for amyloid fibrils, because it plays a central role in a well-defined immune-suppressive pathway. Competitive binding between amyloid fibrils and alpha-bungarotoxin to peritoneal macrophages (MPhis) confirmed the involvement of alpha7 NAChR. The mechanism of immune suppression was explored, and, similar to nicotine, amyloid fibrils inhibited LPS induction of a common set of inflammatory cytokines while inducing Stat3 signaling and autophagy. Consistent with this, previous studies have established that nicotine, sHsps, and amyloid fibrils all were effective therapeutics in EAE. Interestingly, B lymphocytes were needed for the therapeutic effect. These results suggest that agonists of alpha7 NAChR might have therapeutic benefit for a variety of inflammatory diseases. Blocking immune intrusion into the brain suppresses epilepsy in Rasmussen's encephalitis model Rasmussen's encephalitis (RE) is a neuroinflammatory disease that typically affects only one hemisphere of the brain, resulting in severe seizures. Sixty years after the disease was first described, the preferred and best treatment option for RE is grotesque and involves removing a hemisphere of the brain (hemispherectomy); therefore, a better understanding of this seizure disorder may provide additional, less invasive therapeutic options. In this issue of the JCI, Carmant and colleagues have developed an animal model of this focal seizure disorder. The model provides experimental insights into the pathogenesis of RE and potential new treatments for this disease.

P., Crotti, A., Bjornson, Z., Prinz, M., Fantl, W. J., Nolan, G. P., Steinman, L. Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration may represent two poles of brain pathology. Brain myeloid cells, particularly microglia, play key roles in these conditions. We employed single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to compare myeloid cell populations in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis, the R6/2 model of Huntington's disease (HD) and the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (mSOD1) model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We identified three myeloid cell populations exclusive to the CNS and present in each disease model. Blood-derived monocytes comprised five populations and migrated to the brain in EAE, but not in HD and ALS models. Single-cell analysis resolved differences in signaling and cytokine production within similar myeloid populations in EAE compared to HD and ALS models. Moreover, these analyses highlighted alpha5 integrin on myeloid cells as a potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammation. Together, these findings illustrate how neuropathology may differ between inflammatory and degenerative brain disease. Narcolepsy and influenza vaccination-induced autoimmunity A Journey in Science: The Privilege of Exploring the Brain and the Immune System. Real innovations in medicine and science are historic and singular; the stories behind each occurrence are precious. At Molecular Medicine we have established the Anthony Cerami Award in Translational Medicine to document and preserve these histories. The monographs recount the seminal events as told in the voice of the original investigators who provided the crucial early insight. These essays capture the essence of discovery, chronicling the birth of ideas that created new fields of research; and launched trajectories that persisted and ultimately influenced how disease is prevented, diagnosed, and treated. In this volume, the Cerami Award Monograph is by Lawrence Steinman, MD, of Stanford University in California. A visionary in the field of neurology, this is the story of Dr. Steinman's scientific journey. View details for Obeticholic acid, a synthetic bile acid agonist of the farnesoid X receptor, attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Bile acids are ligands for the nuclear hormone receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR). The bile acid-FXR interaction regulates bile acid synthesis, transport, and cholesterol metabolism. Recently, bile acid-FXR regulation has been reported to play an integral role in both hepatic and intestinal inflammation, and in atherosclerosis. In this study, we found that FXR knockout mice had more disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Obeticholic acid (6-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid, 6-ECDCA), a synthetic FXR agonist, is an orally available drug that is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. When we treated mice exhibiting established EAE with 6-ECDCA, or the natural FXR ligand chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), clinical disease was ameliorated by (i) suppressing lymphocyte activation and proinflammatory cytokine production; (ii) reducing CD4(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cell populations and their expression of negative checkpoint regulators programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA); (iii) increasing CD8(+) T cells and PD1, PDl-1, and BTLA expression; and (iv) reducing VLA-4 expression in both the T- and B-cell populations. Moreover, adoptive transfer of 6-ECDCA- or CDCA-treated donor cells failed to transfer disease in naive recipients. Thus, we show that FXR functions as a negative regulator in neuroinflammation and we highlight that FXR agonists represent a potential previously unidentified therapy for MS. View details for Amyloid fibrils activate B-1a lymphocytes to ameliorate inflammatory brain disease PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Kurnellas, M. P., Ghosn, E. E., Schartner, J. M., Baker, J., Rothbard, J. J., Negrin, R. S., Herzenberg, L. A., Fathman, C. G., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. Amyloid fibrils composed of peptides as short as six amino acids are therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), reducing paralysis and inflammation, while inducing several pathways of immune suppression. Intraperitoneal injection of fibrils selectively activates B-1a lymphocytes and two populations of resident macrophages (Ms), increasing IL-10 production, and triggering their exodus from the peritoneum. The importance of IL-10-producing B-1a cells in this effective therapy was established in loss-of-function experiments where neither B-cell-deficient (MT) nor IL10(-/-) mice with EAE responded to the fibrils. In gain-of-function experiments, B-1a cells, adoptively transferred to MT mice with EAE, restored their therapeutic efficacy when Amylin 28-33 was administered. Stimulation of adoptively transferred bioluminescent Ms and B-1a cells by amyloid fibrils resulted in rapid (within 60 min of injection) trafficking of both cell types to draining lymph nodes. Analysis of gene expression indicated that the fibrils activated the CD40/B-cell receptor pathway in B-1a cells and induced a set of immune-suppressive cell-surface proteins, including BTLA, IRF4, and Siglec G. Collectively, these data indicate that the fibrils activate B-1a cells and F4/80(+) Ms, resulting in their migration to the lymph nodes, where IL-10 and cell-surface receptors associated with immune-suppression limit antigen presentation and T-cell activation. These mechanisms culminate in reduction of paralytic signs of EAE. Antibodies to influenza nucleoprotein cross-react with human hypocretin receptor 2 Ahmed, S. S., Volkmuth, W., Duca, J., Corti, L., Pallaoro, M., Pezzicoli, A., Karle, A., Rigat, F., Rappuoli, R., Narasimhan, V., Julkunen, I., Vuorela, A., Vaarala, O., Nohynek, H., Pasini, F. L., Montomoli, E., Trombetta, C., Adams, C. M., Rothbard, J., Steinman, L. The sleep disorder narcolepsy is linked to the HLA-DQB1*0602 haplotype and dysregulation of the hypocretin ligand-hypocretin receptor pathway. Narcolepsy was associated with Pandemrix vaccination (an adjuvanted, influenza pandemic vaccine) and also with infection by influenza virus during the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza pandemic. In contrast, very few cases were reported after Focetria vaccination (a differently manufactured adjuvanted influenza pandemic vaccine). We hypothesized that differences between these vaccines (which are derived from inactivated influenza viral proteins) explain the association of narcolepsy with Pandemrix-vaccinated subjects. A mimic peptide was identified from a surface-exposed region of influenza nucleoprotein A that shared protein residues in common with a fragment of the first extracellular domain of hypocretin receptor 2. A significant proportion of sera from HLA-DQB1*0602 haplotype-positive narcoleptic Finnish patients with a history of Pandemrix vaccination (vaccine-associated narcolepsy) contained antibodies to hypocretin receptor 2 compared to sera from nonnarcoleptic individuals with either 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic influenza infection or history of Focetria vaccination. Antibodies from vaccine-associated narcolepsy sera cross-reacted with both influenza nucleoprotein and hypocretin receptor 2, which was demonstrated by competitive binding using 21-mer peptide (containing the identified nucleoprotein mimic) and 55-mer recombinant peptide (first extracellular domain of hypocretin receptor 2) on cell lines expressing human hypocretin receptor 2. Mass spectrometry indicated that relative to Pandemrix, Focetria contained 72.7% less influenza nucleoprotein. In accord, no durable antibody responses to nucleoprotein were detected in sera from Focetria-vaccinated nonnarcoleptic subjects. Thus, differences in vaccine nucleoprotein content and respective immune response may explain the narcolepsy association with Pandemrix. View details for No quiet surrender: molecular guardians in multiple sclerosis brain The brain under immunological attack does not surrender quietly. Investigation of brain lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) reveals a coordinated molecular response involving various proteins and small molecules ranging from heat shock proteins to small lipids, neurotransmitters, and even gases, which provide protection and foster repair. Reduction of inflammation serves as a necessary prerequisite for effective recovery and regeneration. Remarkably, many lesion-resident molecules activate pathways leading to both suppression of inflammation and promotion of repair mechanisms. These guardian molecules and their corresponding physiologic pathways could potentially be exploited to silence inflammation and repair the injured and degenerating brain and spinal cord in both relapsing-remitting and progressive forms of MS and may be beneficial in other neurologic and psychiatric conditions. View details for Mechanisms of action of therapeutic amyloidogenic hexapeptides in amelioration of inflammatory brain disease. Kurnellas, M. P., Schartner, J. M., Fathman, C. G., Jagger, A., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. Amyloid fibrils composed of peptides as short as six amino acids are effective therapeutics for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Immunosuppression arises from at least two pathways: (1) expression of type 1 IFN by pDCs, which were induced by neutrophil extracellular traps arising from the endocytosis of the fibrils; and (2) the reduced expression of IFN-, TNF, and IL-6. The two independent pathways stimulated by the fibrils can act in concert to be immunosuppressive in Th1 indications, or in opposition, resulting in inflammation when Th17 T lymphocytes are predominant. The generation of type 1 IFN can be minimized by using polar, nonionizable, amyloidogenic peptides, which are effective in both Th1 and Th17 polarized EAE. Immunology of Relapse and Remission in Multiple Sclerosis Eighty percent of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) initially develop a clinical pattern with periodic relapses followed by remissions, called relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). This period of fluctuating disease may last for a decade or more. Clinical relapses reflect acute inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), composed of the brain and spinal cord. Often, different anatomic areas in the CNS are involved each time a relapse occurs, resulting in varied clinical manifestations in each instance. Relapses are nearly always followed by some degree of remission, though recovery to baseline status before the flare is often incomplete. There are nine approved drugs for treatment of RRMS. The most potent drug for inhibiting relapses, the humanized anti-4 integrin antibody known as Natalizumab, blocks homing of mononuclear cells to the CNS. The mechanisms of action of the approved drugs for RRMS provide a strong foundation for understanding the pathobiology of the relapse. Despite substantial progress in controlling relapses with the current armamentarium of medications, there is much to learn and ever more effective and safe therapies to develop.

S., Wu, L., Acharya, S., Arac, A., Blaho, V. A., Huang, Y., Moon, B. S., Axtell, R. C., Ho, P. P., Steinberg, G. K., Lewis, D. B., Sobel, R. A., Han, D. K., Steinman, L., Snyder, M. P., Hla, T., Han, M. H. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling regulates lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs into systemic circulation. The sphingosine phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) agonist FTY-720 (Gilenya) arrests immune trafficking and prevents multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses. However, alternative mechanisms of S1P-S1P1 signaling have been reported. Phosphoproteomic analysis of MS brain lesions revealed S1P1 phosphorylation on S351, a residue crucial for receptor internalization. Mutant mice harboring an S1pr1 gene encoding phosphorylation-deficient receptors (S1P1(S5A)) developed severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) due to autoimmunity mediated by interleukin 17 (IL-17)-producing helper T cells (TH17 cells) in the peripheral immune and nervous system. S1P1 directly activated the Jak-STAT3 signal-transduction pathway via IL-6. Impaired S1P1 phosphorylation enhances TH17 polarization and exacerbates autoimmune neuroinflammation. These mechanisms may be pathogenic in MS. Plasmid-Encoded Proinsulin Preserves C-Peptide While Specifically Reducing Proinsulin-Specific CD8+ T Cells in Type 1 Diabetes. Roep, B. O., Solvason, N., Gottlieb, P. A., Abreu, J. R., Harrison, L. C., Eisenbarth, G. S., Yu, L., Leviten, M., Hagopian, W. A., Buse, J. B., von Herrath, M., Quan, J., King, R. S., Robinson, W. H., Utz, P. J., Garren, H., Steinman, L. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), there is an intense inflammatory response that destroys the cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, the site where insulin is produced and released. A therapy for T1D that targets the specific autoimmune response in this disease while leaving the remainder of the immune system intact, has long been sought. Proinsulin is a major target of the adaptive immune response in T1D. We hypothesized that an engineered DNA plasmid encoding proinsulin (BHT-3021) would preserve cell function in T1D patients through reduction of insulin-specific CD8(+) T cells. We studied 80 subjects over 18 years of age who were diagnosed with T1D within the past 5 years. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive intramuscular injections of BHT-3021 or BHT-placebo, weekly for 12 weeks, and then monitored for safety and immune responses in a blinded fashion. Four dose levels of BHT-3021 were evaluated: 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 mg. C-peptide was used both as an exploratory efficacy measure and as a safety measure. Islet-specific CD8(+) T cell frequencies were assessed with multimers of monomeric human leukocyte antigen class I molecules loaded with peptides from pancreatic and unrelated antigens. No serious adverse events related to BHT-3021 were observed. C-peptide levels improved relative to placebo at all doses, at 1 mg at the 15-week time point (+19.5% BHT-3021 versus -8.8% BHT-placebo, P < 0.026). Proinsulin-reactive CD8(+) T cells, but not T cells against unrelated islet or foreign molecules, declined in the BHT-3021 arm (P < 0.006). No significant changes were noted in interferon-, interleukin-4 (IL-4), or IL-10 production in CD4 T cells. Thus, we demonstrate that a plasmid encoding proinsulin reduces the frequency of CD8(+) T cells reactive to proinsulin while preserving C-peptide over the course of dosing. Expansion of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells following SIRT1 inactivation in the adult brain. Rafalski, V. A., Ho, P. P., Brett, J. O., Ucar, D., Dugas, J. C., Pollina, E. A., Chow, L. M., Ibrahim, A., Baker, S. J., Barres, B. A., Steinman, L., Brunet, A. Oligodendrocytes-the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system-can be regenerated during adulthood. In adults, new oligodendrocytes originate from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), but also from neural stem cells (NSCs). Although several factors supporting oligodendrocyte production have been characterized, the mechanisms underlying the generation of adult oligodendrocytes are largely unknown. Here we show that genetic inactivation of SIRT1, a protein deacetylase implicated in energy metabolism, increases the production of new OPCs in the adult mouse brain, in part by acting in NSCs. New OPCs produced following SIRT1 inactivation differentiate normally, generating fully myelinating oligodendrocytes. Remarkably, SIRT1 inactivation ameliorates remyelination and delays paralysis in mouse models of demyelinating injuries. SIRT1 inactivation leads to the upregulation of genes involved in cell metabolism and growth factor signalling, in particular PDGF receptor (PDGFR). Oligodendrocyte expansion following SIRT1 inactivation is mediated at least in part by AKT and p38 MAPK-signalling molecules downstream of PDGFR. The identification of drug-targetable enzymes that regulate oligodendrocyte regeneration in adults could facilitate the development of therapies for demyelinating injuries and diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Amyloid Fibrils Composed of Hexameric Peptides Attenuate Neuroinflammation Kurnellas, M. P., Adams, C. M., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. The amyloid-forming proteins tau, B crystallin, and amyloid P protein are all found in lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS). Our previous work established that amyloidogenic peptides from the small heat shock protein B crystallin (HspB5) and from amyloid fibrils, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, were therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), reflecting aspects of the pathology of MS. To understand the molecular basis for the therapeutic effect, we showed a set of amyloidogenic peptides composed of six amino acids, including those from tau, amyloid A4, major prion protein (PrP), HspB5, amylin, serum amyloid P, and insulin B chain, to be anti-inflammatory and capable of reducing serological levels of interleukin-6 and attenuating paralysis in EAE. The chaperone function of the fibrils correlates with the therapeutic outcome. Fibrils composed of tau 623-628 precipitated 49 plasma proteins, including apolipoprotein B-100, clusterin, transthyretin, and complement C3, supporting the hypothesis that the fibrils are active biological agents. Amyloid fibrils thus may provide benefit in MS and other neuroinflammatory disorders. View details for A writing-intensive course improves biology undergraduates' perception and confidence of their abilities to read scientific literature and communicate science Most scientists agree that comprehension of primary scientific papers and communication of scientific concepts are two of the most important skills that we can teach, but few undergraduate biology courses make these explicit course goals. We designed an undergraduate neuroimmunology course that uses a writing-intensive format. Using a mixture of primary literature, writing assignments directed toward a layperson and scientist audience, and in-class discussions, we aimed to improve the ability of students to 1) comprehend primary scientific papers, 2) communicate science to a scientific audience, and 3) communicate science to a layperson audience. We offered the course for three consecutive years and evaluated its impact on student perception and confidence using a combination of pre- and postcourse survey questions and coded open-ended responses. Students showed gains in both the perception of their understanding of primary scientific papers and of their abilities to communicate science to scientific and layperson audiences. These results indicate that this unique format can teach both communication skills and basic science to undergraduate biology students. We urge others to adopt a similar format for undergraduate biology courses to teach process skills in addition to content, thus broadening and strengthening the impact of undergraduate courses.

Inflammatory Cytokines at the Summits of Pathological Signal Cascades in Brain Diseases When considering the hierarchical organization of pathological signaling cascades in immunological disorders of the brain, certain cytokines might be considered pinnacles of pathophysiological importance, with their presence determining the appearance or the course of a particular disease. Interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor are critical for the pathogenesis of inflammation in specific brain disorders. Targeting these cytokines or their receptors can alter the course of several neurological diseases, but the effects may be beneficial or harmful.

Neuronal and Glial Protection: Are there guardian molecules that protect the nervous system in MS? 3. Predictive Medicine: With all the approved drugs, how can we rationally decide which one to use? 4. The Precise Scalpel vs. the Big Hammer for Therapy: Is antigen-specific therapy for demyelinating disease possible?

Journal of undergraduate neuroscience education : JUNE : a publication of FUN, Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience The discovery of natalizumab, a potent therapeutic for multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the major inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. There is strong evidence that an immune response in the brain is a critical component of the disease. In 1992, in a collaboration between academia and biotechnology, my colleagues and I showed that 4 integrin was the critical molecule involved in the homing of immune cells into the inflamed brain. Was it sheer luck that these results led to the development of a drug for MS?

V., Rajadas, J., Dolganov, G., Chopra, S., Schoolnik, G. K., Sobel, R. A., Webster, J., Ousman, S. S., Becker, R. A., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. To determine whether the therapeutic activity of B crystallin, small heat shock protein B5 (HspB5), was shared with other human sHsps, a set of seven human family members, a mutant of HspB5 G120 known to exhibit reduced chaperone activity, and a mycobacterial sHsp were expressed and purified from bacteria. Each of the recombinant proteins was shown to be a functional chaperone, capable of inhibiting aggregation of denatured insulin with varying efficiency. When injected into mice at the peak of disease, they were all effective in reducing the paralysis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Additional structure activity correlations between chaperone activity and therapeutic function were established when linear regions within HspB5 were examined. A single region, corresponding to residues 73-92 of HspB5, forms amyloid fibrils, exhibited chaperone activity, and was an effective therapeutic for encephalomyelitis. The linkage of the three activities was further established by demonstrating individual substitutions of critical hydrophobic amino acids in the peptide resulted in the loss of all of the functions. Reversal of Paralysis and Reduced Inflammation from Peripheral Administration of beta-Amyloid in T(H)1 and T(H)17 Versions of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis Grant, J. L., Ghosn, E. E., Axtell, R. C., Herges, K., Kuipers, H. F., Woodling, N. S., Andreasson, K., Herzenberg, L. A., Herzenberg, L. A., Steinman, L. -Amyloid 42 (A42) and -amyloid 40 (A40), major components of senile plaque deposits in Alzheimer's disease, are considered neurotoxic and proinflammatory. In multiple sclerosis, A42 is up-regulated in brain lesions and damaged axons. We found, unexpectedly, that treatment with either A42 or A40 peptides reduced motor paralysis and brain inflammation in four different models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) with attenuation of motor paralysis, reduction of inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), and suppression of lymphocyte activation. A42 and A40 treatments were effective in reducing ongoing paralysis induced with adoptive transfer of either autoreactive T helper 1 (T(H)1) or T(H)17 cells. High-dimensional 14-parameter flow cytometry of peripheral immune cell populations after in vivo A42 and A40 treatment revealed substantial modulations in the percentage of lymphoid and myeloid subsets during EAE. Major proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were reduced in the blood after A peptide treatment. Protection conferred by A treatment did not require its delivery to the brain: Adoptive transfer with lymphocytes from donors treated with A42 attenuated EAE in wild-type recipient mice, and A deposition in the brain was not detected in treated EAE mice by immunohistochemical analysis. In contrast to the improvement in EAE with A treatment, EAE was worse in mice with genetic deletion of the amyloid precursor protein. Therefore, in the absence of A, there is exacerbated clinical EAE disease progression. Because A42 and A40 ameliorate experimental autoimmune inflammation targeting the CNS, we might now consider its potential anti-inflammatory role in other neuropathological conditions.

Comparison of transcriptomic and proteomic data from pathologically similar multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions reveals down-regulation of CD47 at the messenger RNA level and low abundance at the protein level. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that CD47 is expressed in normal myelin and in foamy macrophages and reactive astrocytes within active MS lesions. We demonstrate that CD47(-/-) mice are refractory to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), primarily as the result of failure of immune cell activation after immunization with myelin antigen. In contrast, blocking with a monoclonal antibody against CD47 in mice at the peak of paralysis worsens EAE severity and enhances immune activation in the peripheral immune system. In vitro assays demonstrate that blocking CD47 also promotes phagocytosis of myelin and that this effect is dependent on signal regulatory protein (SIRP-). Immune regulation and phagocytosis are mechanisms for CD47 signaling in autoimmune neuroinflammation. Depending on the cell type, location, and disease stage, CD47 has Janus-like roles, with opposing effects on EAE pathogenesis.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Zhang, M. A., Rego, D., Moshkova, M., Kebir, H., Chruscinski, A., Nguyen, H., Akkermann, R., Stanczyk, F. Z., Prat, A., Steinman, L., Dunn, S. E. Women develop certain autoimmune diseases more often than men. It has been hypothesized that this may relate to the development of more robust T-helper (Th)1 responses in women. To test whether women exhibit a Th1 bias, we isolated nave cluster of differentiation (CD)4(+) T cells from peripheral blood of healthy women and men and measured the proliferation and cytokine production by these cells in response to submaximal amounts of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. We observed that CD4(+) T cells from women produced higher levels of IFN as well as tended to proliferate more than male CD4(+) T cells. Intriguingly, male CD4(+) T cells instead had a predilection toward IL-17A production. This sex dichotomy in Th cytokine production was found to be even more striking in the Swiss/Jackson Laboratory (SJL) mouse. Studies in mice and humans indicated that the sexual dimorphism in Th1 and Th17 cytokine production was dependent on the androgen status and the T-cell expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) and PPAR. Androgens increased PPAR and decreased PPAR expression by human CD4(+) T cells. PPAR siRNA-mediated knockdown had the effect of increasing IFN by male CD4(+) T cells, while transfection of CD4(+) T cells with PPAR siRNAs increased IL-17A production uniquely by female T cells. Together, our observations indicate that human T cells exhibit a sex difference in the production of IFN and IL-17A that may be driven by expressions of PPAR and PPAR.

Together, our observations indicate that human T cells exhibit a sex difference in the production of IFN and IL-17A that may be driven by expressions of PPAR and PPAR.

M., Van Haren, K., Wikoff, W. R., Kind, T., Khademi, M., Matloff, L. Y., Narayana, S., Hur, E. M., Lindstrom, T. M., He, Z., Fiehn, O., Olsson, T., Han, X., Han, M. H., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Lipids constitute 70% of the myelin sheath, and autoantibodies against lipids may contribute to the demyelination that characterizes multiple sclerosis (MS). We used lipid antigen microarrays and lipid mass spectrometry to identify bona fide lipid targets of the autoimmune response in MS brain, and an animal model of MS to explore the role of the identified lipids in autoimmune demyelination. We found that autoantibodies in MS target a phosphate group in phosphatidylserine and oxidized phosphatidylcholine derivatives. Administration of these lipids ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by suppressing activation and inducing apoptosis of autoreactive T cells, effects mediated by the lipids' saturated fatty acid side chains. Thus, phospholipids represent a natural anti-inflammatory class of compounds that have potential as therapeutics for MS. Protective effect of an elastase inhibitor in a neuromyelitis optica-like disease driven by a peptide of myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein Herges, K., de Jong, B. A., Kolkowitz, I., Dunn, C., Mandelbaum, G., Ko, R. M., Maini, A., Han, M. H., Killestein, J., Polman, C., Goodyear, A. L., Dunn, J., Steinman, L., Axtell, R. C. The pathology of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), in contrast to multiple sclerosis, comprises granulocyte infiltrates along extensive lengths of spinal cord, as well as optic nerve. Furthermore, IFN- treatment worsens NMO. We recently found that experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced with Th17 cells is exacerbated by IFN-, in contrast to disease induced with Th1 where treatment attenuated symptoms.This study demonstrates the similarities between NMO and Th17 EAE and how neutrophils mediate pathology in Th17 disease.Levels of blood biomarkers in NMO were assessed by Luminex and ELISA. Effects of IFN- on neutrophils were assessed by culture assays and immunofluorescence. EAE was induced by transfer of myelin-specific Th1 or Th17 cells and treated with Sivelestat sodium hydrate, a neutrophil elastase inhibitor.We show Th17 cytokines, granulocyte chemokines, type 1 interferon and neutrophil elastase are elevated in patients with definitive NMO. In culture, we find that IFN- stimulates neutrophils to release neutrophil elastase. In Th17 EAE, we demonstrate neutrophilic infiltration in the optic nerve and spinal cord which was not present in Th1 EAE. Blockade of neutrophil elastase with Sivelestat had efficacy in Th17 EAE but not Th1 EAE.The similarities between Th17 EAE and NMO indicate that this model represents several aspects of NMO. Neutrophils are critical in the pathologies of both Th17-EAE and NMO, and therefore blockade of neutrophil elastase is a promising target in treating NMO.

P., Brownell, S., Adams, C. M., Su, L., Axtell, R. C., Chen, R., Fathman, C. G., Robinson, W. H., Steinman, L. The therapeutic benefit of the small heat shock protein B-crystallin (HspB5) in animal models of multiple sclerosis and ischemia is proposed to arise from its increased capacity to bind proinflammatory proteins at the elevated temperatures within inflammatory foci. By mass spectral analysis, a common set of 70 ligands was precipitated by HspB5 from plasma from patients with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and amyloidosis and mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These proteins were distinguished from other precipitated molecules because they were enriched in the precipitate as compared with their plasma concentrations, and they exhibited temperature-dependent binding. More than half of these ligands were acute phase proteins or members of the complement or coagulation cascades. Consistent with this proposal, plasma levels of HspB5 were increased in patients with multiple sclerosis as compared with normal individuals. The combination of the thermal sensitivity of the HspB5 combined with the high local concentration of these ligands at the site of inflammation is proposed to explain the paradox of how a protein believed to exhibit nonspecific binding can bind with some relative apparent selectivity to proinflammatory proteins and thereby modulate inflammation.

E., Rothbard, J. B., Chen, C., Ko, R. M., Pereira, M. P., Albers, G. W., Steinman, L., Steinberg, G. K. Tissue plasminogen activator is the only treatment option for stroke victims; however, it has to be administered within 4.5 h after symptom onset, making its use very limited. This report describes a unique target for effective treatment of stroke, even 12 h after onset, by the administration of B-crystallin (Cryab), an endogenous immunomodulatory neuroprotectant. In Cryab(-/-) mice, there was increased lesion size and diminished neurologic function after stroke compared with wild-type mice. Increased plasma Cryab was detected after experimental stroke in mice and after stroke in human patients. Administration of Cryab even 12 h after experimental stroke reduced both stroke volume and inflammatory cytokines associated with stroke pathology. Cryab is an endogenous anti-inflammatory and neuroprotectant molecule produced after stroke, whose beneficial properties can be augmented when administered therapeutically after stroke. View details for Functional rescue of experimental ischemic optic neuropathy with alpha B-crystallin Pangratz-Fuehrer, S., Kaur, K., Ousman, S. S., Steinman, L., Liao, Y. J. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) is an important cause of acute vision loss in adults, and there is no effective treatment. We studied early changes following experimental AION and tested the benefit of a potential treatment.Materials andWe induced experimental AION in adult mice and tested the effects of short-term (daily for 3 days) and long-term (every other day for 3 weeks) B-crystallin (BC) treatment using histological and serial intracranial flash visual evoked potential recordings.One day after experimental AION, there was swelling at the optic nerve (ON) head and increased expression of BC, a small heat shock protein important in ischemia and inflammation. This upregulation coincided with microglial and astrocytic activation. Our hypothesis was that BC may be part of the endogenous protective mechanism against injury, thus we tested the effects of BC on experimental AION. Daily intraveneous or intravitreal BC injections did not improve visual evoked potential amplitude or latency at days 1-2. However, BC treatment decreased swelling and dampened the microglial and astrocytic activation on day 3. Longer treatment with intravenous BC led to acceleration of visual evoked potential latency over 3 weeks, without improving amplitude. This latency acceleration did not correlate with increased retinal ganglion cell survival but did correlate with complete rescue of the ON oligodendrocytes, which are important for myelination.We identified BC as an early marker following experimental AION. Treatment with BC enhanced this endogenous, post-ischemic response by decreasing microglial activation and promoting ON oligodendrocyte survival. View details for Interferon-beta exacerbates Th17-mediated inflammatory disease Interferon (IFN)- is the treatment most often prescribed for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). 30-50% of MS patients, however, do not respond to IFN-. In some cases, IFN- exacerbates MS, and it consistently worsens neuromyelitis optica (NMO). To eliminate unnecessary treatment for patients who are non-responsive to IFN-, and to avoid possible harm, researchers are identifying biomarkers that predict treatment outcome before treatment is initiated. These biomarkers reveal insights into the mechanisms of disease. Recent discoveries on human samples from patients with RRMS, NMO, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and ulcerative colitis, indicate that IFN- is ineffective and might worsen clinical status in diverse diseases when a Th17 immune response is prominent. View details for Chaperone Activity of alpha B-Crystallin Is Responsible for Its Incorrect Assignment as an Autoantigen in Multiple Sclerosis Rothbard, J. B., Zhao, X., Sharpe, O., Strohman, M. J., Kurnellas, M., Mellins, E. D., Robinson, W. H., Steinman, L. For 15 y, B-crystallin (heat shock protein [Hsp] B5) has been labeled an autoantigen in multiple sclerosis (MS) based on humoral and cellular responses found in humans and animal models. However, there have been several scientific inconsistencies with this assignment, ranging from studies demonstrating small differences in anticrystallin responses between patients and healthy individuals to the inability of crystallin-specific T cells to induce symptoms of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in animal models. Experiments in this article demonstrate that the putative anti-HspB5 Abs from 23 MS patients cross-react with 7 other members of the human small Hsp family and were equally present in normal plasma. Biolayer interferometry demonstrates that the binding was temperature dependent, and that the calculated K(a) increased as the concentration of the sHsp decreased. These two patterns are characteristic of multiple binding sites with varying affinities, the composition of which changes with temperature, supporting the hypothesis that HspB5 bound the Ab and not the reverse. HspB5 also precipitated Ig heavy and L chains from sera from patients with MS. These results establish that small Hsps bind Igs with high affinity and refute much of the serological data used to assign B-crystallin as an autoantigen.

E., Bhat, R., Straus, D. S., Sobel, R. A., Axtell, R., Johnson, A., Nguyen, K., Mukundan, L., Moshkova, M., Dugas, J. C., Chawla, A., Steinman, L. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs; PPAR-alpha, PPAR-delta, and PPAR-gamma) comprise a family of nuclear receptors that sense fatty acid levels and translate this information into altered gene transcription. Previously, it was reported that treatment of mice with a synthetic ligand activator of PPAR-delta, GW0742, ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), indicating a possible role for this nuclear receptor in the control of central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune inflammation. We show that mice deficient in PPAR-delta (PPAR-delta(-/-)) develop a severe inflammatory response during EAE characterized by a striking accumulation of IFN-gamma(+)IL-17A(-) and IFN-gamma(+)IL-17A(+) CD4(+) cells in the spinal cord. The preferential expansion of these T helper subsets in the CNS of PPAR-delta(-/-) mice occurred as a result of a constellation of immune system aberrations that included higher CD4(+) cell proliferation, cytokine production, and T-bet expression and enhanced expression of IL-12 family cytokines by myeloid cells. We also show that the effect of PPAR-delta in inhibiting the production of IFN-gamma and IL-12 family cytokines is ligand dependent and is observed in both mouse and human immune cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that PPAR-delta serves as an important molecular brake for the control of autoimmune inflammation. View details for Inverse vaccination, the opposite of Jenner's concept, for therapy of autoimmunity DNA-based vaccines to induce antigen-specific inhibition of immune responses in human autoimmune diseases represent the inverse of what Jenner intended when he invented vaccination. Jenner's vaccine induced antigen-specific immunity to small pox. DNA vaccines for autoimmunity have been developed in preclinical settings, and now tested in human trials. The first two clinical trials, one in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, and the other in type 1 diabetes indicate that specific inhibition of antigen-specific antibody and T-cell responses is attainable in humans. Further development of this approach is ongoing. This new version of immunization termed 'inverse vaccination' when applied to autoimmune diseases, may allow targeted reduction of unwanted antibody and T-cell responses to autoantigens, while leaving the remainder of the immune system intact. The method of specifically reducing a pathological adaptive autoimmune response is termed inverse vaccination.

H., Malefyt, R. d., Steinman, L., Raman, C. Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) is the major treatment for multiple sclerosis. However, this treatment is not always effective. Here we have found congruence in outcome between responses to IFN-beta in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). IFN-beta was effective in reducing EAE symptoms induced by T helper type 1 (T(H)1) cells but exacerbated disease induced by T(H)17 cells. Effective treatment in T(H)1-induced EAE correlated with increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) production by splenocytes. In T(H)17-induced disease, the amount of IL-10 was unaltered by treatment, although, unexpectedly, IFN-beta treatment still reduced IL-17 production without benefit. Both inhibition of IL-17 and induction of IL-10 depended on IFN-gamma. In the absence of IFN-gamma signaling, IFN-beta therapy was ineffective in EAE. In RRMS patients, IFN-beta nonresponders had higher IL-17F concentrations in serum compared to responders. Nonresponders had worse disease with more steroid usage and more relapses than did responders. Hence, IFN-beta is proinflammatory in T(H)17-induced EAE. Moreover, a high IL-17F concentration in the serum of people with RRMS is associated with nonresponsiveness to therapy with IFN-beta. View details for Inhibitory role for GABA in autoimmune inflammation PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Bhat, R., Axtell, R., Mitra, A., Miranda, M., Lock, C., Tsien, R. W., Steinman, L. GABA, the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, has a parallel inhibitory role in the immune system. We demonstrate that immune cells synthesize GABA and have the machinery for GABA catabolism. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) express functional GABA receptors and respond electrophysiologically to GABA. Thus, the immune system harbors all of the necessary constituents for GABA signaling, and GABA itself may function as a paracrine or autocrine factor. These observations led us to ask further whether manipulation of the GABA pathway influences an animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Increasing GABAergic activity ameliorates ongoing paralysis in EAE via inhibition of inflammation. GABAergic agents act directly on APCs, decreasing MAPK signals and diminishing subsequent adaptive inflammatory responses to myelin proteins. View details for Innate and Adaptive Autoimmunity Directed to the Central Nervous System The immune system has two major components, an innate arm and an adaptive arm. Certain autoimmune diseases of the brain represent examples of disorders where one of these constituents plays a major role. Some rare autoimmune diseases involve activation of the innate arm and include chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular (CINCA) syndrome. In contrast, adaptive immunity is prominent in multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and the paraneoplastic syndromes where highly specific T cell responses and antibodies mediate these diseases. Studies of autoimmune brain disorders have aided in the elucidation of distinct neuronal roles played by key molecules already well known to immunologists (e.g., complement and components of the major histocompatibility complex). In parallel, molecules known to neurobiology and sensory physiology, including toll-like receptors, gamma amino butyric acid and the lens protein alpha B crystallin, have intriguing and distinct functions in the immune system, where they modulate autoimmunity directed to the brain.

M., Ho, P. P., Han, M. H., Lanz, T. V., Phillips, L. K., Goldstein, M. J., Bhat, R., Raine, C. S., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a major regulator of blood pressure. The octapeptide angiotensin II (AII) is proteolytically processed from the decapeptide AI by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and then acts via angiotensin type 1 and type 2 receptors (AT1R and AT2R). Inhibitors of ACE and antagonists of the AT1R are used in the treatment of hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke. We now show that the RAAS also plays a major role in autoimmunity, exemplified by multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Using proteomics, we observed that RAAS is up-regulated in brain lesions of MS. AT1R was induced in myelin-specific CD4+ T cells and monocytes during autoimmune neuroinflammation. Blocking AII production with ACE inhibitors or inhibiting AII signaling with AT1R blockers suppressed autoreactive TH1 and TH17 cells and promoted antigen-specific CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) with inhibition of the canonical NF-kappaB1 transcription factor complex and activation of the alternative NF-kappaB2 pathway. Treatment with ACE inhibitors induces abundant CD4+FoxP3+ T cells with sufficient potency to reverse paralytic EAE. Modulation of the RAAS with inexpensive, safe pharmaceuticals used by millions worldwide is an attractive therapeutic strategy for application to human autoimmune diseases. View details for A molecular trio in relapse and remission in multiple sclerosis Two thirds of patients with multiple sclerosis have the relapsing-remitting form, which often progresses to more debilitating disease. Striking clinical recovery, termed remission, often follows these periodic neurological defects, termed relapses. Recent work has revealed the role of three key molecules in relapse and remission: alpha4beta1 integrin (also known as VLA4) is an adhesion molecule that mediates T cell migration from the blood into the brain; osteopontin binds to alpha4beta1 integrin, stimulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting apoptosis; and alphaB crystallin inhibits inflammation in the brain. This Review discusses how this molecular trio interacts to initiate relapses (in the case of osteopontin and alpha4beta1 integrin) and then to terminate them as remissions in multiple sclerosis (in the case of alphaB crystallin).

Insulin is a major target for the autoimmune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells during the pathogenesis of type I diabetes. A plasmid DNA vaccine encoding mouse proinsulin II reduced the incidence of diabetes in a mouse model of type I diabetes when administered to hyperglycemic (therapeutic mode) or normoglycemic (prophylactic mode) NOD mice. Therapeutic administration of proinsulin DNA was accompanied by a rapid decrease in the number of insulin-specific IFN-gamma-producing T cells, whereas prophylactic treatment was accompanied by enhanced IFN-gamma-secreting cells and a decrease in insulin autoantibodies. Adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that the protection was not mediated by induction of CD25(+)/CD4(+) T regulatory cells. The efficacy of the DNA vaccine was enhanced by increasing the level of expression of the encoded Ag, more frequent dosing, increasing dose level, and localization of the protein product to the intracellular compartment. The efficacy data presented in this study demonstrate that Ag-specific plasmid DNA therapy is a viable strategy for preventing progression of type I diabetes and defines critical parameters of the dosing regime that influences tolerance induction. View details for Nuanced roles of cytokines in three major human brain disorders The three most prevalent human disorders of the CNS in which immunity and inflammation are likely to have vital roles (excluding infection of the CNS) are fever, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Alzheimer disease (AD). As reviewed here, cytokines are critical in the induction of fever, the pathogenesis of MS, and the pathobiology of AD. Indeed, antibodies targeting cytokines have been used as a therapy for individuals with unusual and persistent febrile reactions not responsive to common antipyretics, while a recombinant cytokine is the most popular treatment for the relapsing-remitting form of MS. Although cytokine-modulating therapies are not currently in clinical use for the treatment of AD, cytokines can ameliorate disease pathology in certain experimental models of AD, suggesting a potential for future therapeutic opportunities.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of BHT-3009 in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and to confirm that BHT-3009 causes immune tolerance.BHT-3009 is a tolerizing DNA vaccine for MS, encoding full-length human myelin basic protein. Relapsing-remitting MS patients were randomized 1:1:1 into three groups: placebo, 0.5 mg BHT-3009, or 1.5 mg BHT-3009, given intramuscularly at weeks 0, 2, 4, and every 4 weeks thereafter until week 44. The primary end point was the 4-week rate of occurrence of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions on brain magnetic resonance images from weeks 28 to 48. Protein microarrays were used to measure levels of anti-myelin autoantibodies.Compared with placebo, in the 267 patient analysis population the median 4-week rate of new enhancing lesions during weeks 28 to 48 was 50% lower with 0.5 mg BHT-3009 (p = 0.07) and during weeks 8 to 48 was 61% lower with 0.5 mg BHT-3009 (p = 0.05). The mean volume of enhancing lesions at week 48 was 51% lower on 0.5 mg BHT-3009 compared with placebo (p = 0.02). No significant improvement in magnetic resonance imaging lesion parameters was observed with 1.5 mg BHT-3009. Dramatic reductions in 23 myelin-specific autoantibodies in the 0.5 mg BHT-3009 arm were observed, but not with placebo or 1.5 mg BHT-3009.In relapsing-remitting MS patients, treatment with the lower dose (0.5 mg) of BHT-3009 for 44 weeks nearly attained the primary end point for reduction of the rate of new enhancing magnetic resonance imaging lesions (p = 0.07) and achieved several secondary end points including a reduction of the rate of enhancing magnetic resonance imaging lesions from weeks 8 to 48 (p = 0.05). Immunological data in a preselected subgroup of patients also indicated that treatment with 0.5 mg induced antigen-specific immune tolerance. The greater dose was ineffective.

H., Gerlitz, B., Robinson, W. H., Baranzini, S. E., Grinnell, B. W., Raine, C. S., Sobel, R. A., Han, D. K., Steinman, L. Understanding the neuropathology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is essential for improved therapies. Therefore, identification of targets specific to pathological types of MS may have therapeutic benefits. Here we identify, by laser-capture microdissection and proteomics, proteins unique to three major types of MS lesions: acute plaque, chronic active plaque and chronic plaque. Comparative proteomic profiles identified tissue factor and protein C inhibitor within chronic active plaque samples, suggesting dysregulation of molecules associated with coagulation. In vivo administration of hirudin or recombinant activated protein C reduced disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and suppressed Th1 and Th17 cytokines in astrocytes and immune cells. Administration of mutant forms of recombinant activated protein C showed that both its anticoagulant and its signalling functions were essential for optimal amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. A proteomic approach illuminated potential therapeutic targets selective for specific pathological stages of MS and implicated participation of the coagulation cascade.

To assess safety and immune modulation by BHT-3009, a tolerizing DNA vaccine encoding full-length human myelin basic protein, in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects receiving placebo were crossed over into an active arm after treatment unblinding.The trial was conducted at 4 academic institutions within North America. Patients Thirty patients with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS who were not taking any other disease-modifying drugs were enrolled in the trial. Further, the patients were required to have either 1 to 5 gadolinium-enhancing lesions on screening brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a relapse in the previous 2 years, or disease worsening in the previous 2 years.BHT-3009 was administered as intramuscular injections at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 9 after randomization into the trial, with or without 80 mg of daily oral atorvastatin calcium in combination. Three dose levels of BHT-3009 were tested (0.5 mg, 1.5 mg, and 3 mg).The primary outcome measures were safety and tolerability of BHT-3009. Secondary outcome measures included the number and volume of gadolinium-enhanced lesions on MRI, relapses, and analysis of antigen-specific immune responses.BHT-3009 was safe and well tolerated, provided favorable trends on brain MRI, and produced beneficial antigen-specific immune changes. These immune changes consisted of a marked decrease in proliferation of interferon-gamma-producing, myelin-reactive CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood and a reduction in titers of myelin-specific autoantibodies from cerebral spinal fluid as assessed by protein microarrays. We did not observe a substantial benefit of the atorvastatin combination compared with BHT-3009 alone.In patients with MS, BHT-3009 is safe and induces antigen-specific immune tolerance with concordant reduction of inflammatory lesions on brain MRI.

A., Sobel, R. A., Robinson, W. H., Steinman, L. alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) is the most abundant gene transcript present in early active multiple sclerosis lesions, whereas such transcripts are absent in normal brain tissue. This crystallin has anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective functions. CRYAB is the major target of CD4+ T-cell immunity to the myelin sheath from multiple sclerosis brain. The pathophysiological implications of this immune response were investigated here. We demonstrate that CRYAB is a potent negative regulator acting as a brake on several inflammatory pathways in both the immune system and central nervous system (CNS). Cryab-/- mice showed worse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) at the acute and progressive phases, with higher Th1 and Th17 cytokine secretion from T cells and macrophages, and more intense CNS inflammation, compared with their wild-type counterparts. Furthermore, Cryab-/- astrocytes showed more cleaved caspase-3 and more TUNEL staining, indicating an anti-apoptotic function of Cryab. Antibody to CRYAB was detected in cerebrospinal fluid from multiple sclerosis patients and in sera from mice with EAE. Administration of recombinant CRYAB ameliorated EAE. Thus, the immune response against a negative regulator of inflammation, CRYAB, in multiple sclerosis, would exacerbate inflammation and demyelination. This can be countered by giving CRYAB itself for therapy of ongoing disease. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha expression in T cells mediates gender differences in development of T cell-mediated autoimmunity Dunn, S. E., Ousman, S. S., Sobel, R. A., Zuniga, L., Baranzini, S. E., Youssef, S., Crowell, A., Loh, J., Oksenberg, J., Steinman, L. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha is a nuclear receptor that mediates gender differences in lipid metabolism. PPARalpha also functions to control inflammatory responses by repressing the activity of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and c-jun in immune cells. Because PPARalpha is situated at the crossroads of gender and immune regulation, we hypothesized that this gene may mediate sex differences in the development of T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. We show that PPARalpha is more abundant in male as compared with female CD4(+) cells and that its expression is sensitive to androgen levels. Genetic ablation of this gene selectively removed the brake on NF-kappaB and c-jun activity in male T lymphocytes, resulting in higher production of interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor (but not interleukin 17), and lower production of T helper (Th)2 cytokines. Upon induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, male but not female PPARalpha(-/-) mice developed more severe clinical signs that were restricted to the acute phase of disease. These results suggest that males are less prone to develop Th1-mediated autoimmunity because they have higher T cell expression of PPARalpha. View details for A brief history of T(H)17, the first major revision in the T(H)1/T(H)2 hypothesis of T cell-mediated tissue damage For over 35 years, immunologists have divided T-helper (T(H)) cells into functional subsets. T-helper type 1 (T(H)1) cells-long thought to mediate tissue damage-might be involved in the initiation of damage, but they do not sustain or play a decisive role in many commonly studied models of autoimmunity, allergy and microbial immunity. A major role for the cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) has now been described in various models of immune-mediated tissue injury, including organ-specific autoimmunity in the brain, heart, synovium and intestines, allergic disorders of the lung and skin, and microbial infections of the intestines and the nervous system. A pathway named T(H)17 is now credited for causing and sustaining tissue damage in these diverse situations. The T(H)1 pathway antagonizes the T(H)17 pathway in an intricate fashion. The evolution of our understanding of the T(H)17 pathway illuminates a shift in immunologists' perspectives regarding the basis of tissue damage, where for over 20 years the role of T(H)1 cells was considered paramount.

A., Steinman, L. Relapses and disease exacerbations are vexing features of multiple sclerosis. Osteopontin (Opn), which is expressed in multiple sclerosis lesions, is increased in patients' plasma during relapses. Here, in models of multiple sclerosis including relapsing, progressive and multifocal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), Opn triggered recurrent relapses, promoted worsening paralysis and induced neurological deficits, including optic neuritis. Increased inflammation followed Opn administration, whereas its absence resulted in more cell death of brain-infiltrating lymphocytes. Opn promoted the survival of activated T cells by inhibiting the transcription factor Foxo3a, by activating the transcription factor NF-kappaB through induction of phosphorylation of the kinase IKKbeta and by altering expression of the proapoptotic proteins Bim, Bak and Bax. Those mechanisms collectively suppressed the death of myelin-reactive T cells, linking Opn to the relapses and insidious progression characterizing multiple sclerosis.

Blockade of this enzyme by atorvastatin (AT) inhibits the destructive proinflammatory T helper cell (Th)1 response during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. Here we present evidence linking specific isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway to signaling pathways that regulate T cell autoimmunity. We demonstrate that the isoprenoid geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP) mediates proliferation, whereas both GGPP and its precursor, farnesyl-PP, regulate the Th1 differentiation of myelin-reactive T cells. Depletion of these isoprenoid intermediates in vivo via oral AT administration hindered these T cell responses by decreasing geranylgeranylated RhoA and farnesylated Ras at the plasma membrane. This was associated with reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 phosphorylation and DNA binding of their cotarget c-fos in response to T cell receptor activation. Inhibition of ERK and p38 mimicked the effects of AT and induced a Th2 cytokine shift. Thus, by connecting isoprenoid availability to regulation of Th1/Th2 fate, we have elucidated a mechanism by which AT may suppress Th1-mediated central nervous system autoimmune disease.

Recent studies suggest that increased T-cell and autoantibody reactivity to lipids may be present in the autoimmune demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. To perform large-scale multiplex analysis of antibody responses to lipids in multiple sclerosis, we developed microarrays composed of lipids present in the myelin sheath, including ganglioside, sulfatide, cerebroside, sphingomyelin and total brain lipid fractions. Lipid-array analysis showed lipid-specific antibodies against sulfatide, sphingomyelin and oxidized lipids in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) derived from individuals with multiple sclerosis. Sulfatide-specific antibodies were also detected in SJL/J mice with acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Immunization of mice with sulfatide plus myelin peptide resulted in a more severe disease course of EAE, and administration of sulfatide-specific antibody exacerbated EAE. Thus, autoimmune responses to sulfatide and other lipids are present in individuals with multiple sclerosis and in EAE, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune demyelination. Treatment of autoimmune neuroinflammation with a synthetic tryptophan metabolite Platten, M., Ho, P. P., Youssef, S., Fontoura, P., Garren, H., Hur, E. M., Gupta, R., Lee, L. Y., Kidd, B. A., Robinson, W. H., Sobel, R. A., Selley, M. L., Steinman, L. Local catabolism of the amino acid tryptophan (Trp) by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is considered an important mechanism of regulating T cell immunity. We show that IDO transcription was increased when myelin-specific T cells were stimulated with tolerogenic altered self-peptides. Catabolites of Trp suppressed proliferation of myelin-specific T cells and inhibited production of proinflammatory T helper-1 (T(H)1) cytokines. N-(3,4,-Dimethoxycinnamoyl) anthranilic acid (3,4-DAA), an orally active synthetic derivative of the Trp metabolite anthranilic acid, reversed paralysis in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Trp catabolites and their derivatives offer a new strategy for treating T(H)1-mediated autoimmune diseases such as MS. Design of effective immunotherapy for human autoimmunity A better understanding of the molecules involved in immune responses has identified many potential targets for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. But although successful therapies have been found for immune disorders in animal studies, few have passed the much harder test of treating human diseases. So far, non-antigen-specific approaches, such as the blocking of tumour-necrosis factor, are achieving some success but the same is not true for antigen-specific approaches. Future therapies will probably include both non-antigen-specific strategies that target cytokines (cell-cell signalling molecules) or block the molecules that stimulate immune responses, and antigen-specific therapies that induce tolerance to self antigens. View details for Blocking adhesion molecules as therapy for multiple sclerosis: Natalizumab Immunologists have long hypothesized that particular 'molecular addresses' govern lymphocyte entry to a given organ. In 1992, alpha4beta1 integrin was identified as the key molecule involved in homing to inflamed regions of the brain. An antibody to alpha4beta1integrin blocked paralysis in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, and the humanized monoclonal antibody natalizumab, which binds alpha4beta1 integrin, reduced relapses 66% in clinical trials in multiple sclerosis. Three months after its expedited approval by the FDA, natalizumab was removed from the market after two cases of deadly progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy were reported among the few thousand patients who had taken this drug in those clinical trials. View details for Our increasing understanding of the pathophysiology of autoimmune disease has revealed a number of checkpoints that can be targeted with immune therapy, including key mediators of lymphocyte adhesion and migration, destructive cytokines involved in tissue damage, and the complex of molecules critical in the presentation of self-antigen and the activation of autoaggressive T lymphocytes. In many organ-specific autoimmune diseases, the identity of the molecules attacked by T cells and autoantibodies is known and attempts are under way to tolerize the immune system with a high level of specificity to these targets.

A., Lanier, L., Lim, M., Steinman, L. Administration of a monoclonal antibody (GK1.5) that recognizes the L3T4 marker present on helper T cells prevented the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. Furthermore, treatment with GK1.5 reversed EAE when the antibody was given to paralyzed animals. In vivo injection of GK1.5 selectively reduced the number of L3T4+ cells in the spleen and the lymph nodes. These results suggest that manipulation of the human equivalent of the murine L3T4+ T-cell subset with monoclonal antibodies may provide effective therapy for certain autoimmune diseases.

K., Hardy, R. R., Hayakawa, K., Steinman, L., Herzenberg, L. A., Herzenberg, L. A. Previous studies have shown that treatment with antibodies to the murine I-A antigen encoded in the major histocompatibility complex attenuates experimental allergic encephalitis and experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. These studies were conducted with SJL mice, an inbred strain that is highly susceptible to the induction of these diseases. Here we show that injection of monoclonal anti-I-A antibody in the amounts used for the above studies rapidly depletes B cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) multiparameter analysis of the B-cell subpopulations in treated animals shows that maximum depletion occurs around 5 days after treatment and that recovery of some subpopulations i still incomplete 1 month later. SJL mice are more sensitive to this B-cell depletion and recover more slowly than putatively normal C3H.Ighb (CKB) mice. Some components of the primary, secondary and tertiary IgG antibody responses are reduced in anti-I-A-treated SJL animals immunized after the first and second anti-I-A injections. The persistence of some antibody response impairment well beyond the time when anti-I-A disappears raises a note of caution concerning human therapy protocols based on the injection of anti-Ia antibodies.

A monoclonal antibody to I-A gene products of the immune response gene complex attenuates both humoral and cellular responses to acetylcholine receptor and appears to suppress clinical manifestations of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. This demonstrates that use of antibodies against immune response gene products that are associated with susceptibility to disease may be feasible for therapy in autoimmune conditions such as myasthenia gravis. View details for Mitigating alemtuzumab-associated autoimmunity in MS: A ""whack-a-mole"" B-cell depletion strategy. Meltzer, E., Campbell, S., Ehrenfeld, B., Cruz, R. A., Steinman, L., Parsons, M. S., Zamvil, S. S., Frohman, E. M., Frohman, T. C. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the punctuated administration of low-dose rituximab, temporally linked to B-cell hyperrepopulation (defined when the return of CD19+ B cells approximates 40%-50% of baseline levels as measured before alemtuzumab treatment inception), can mitigate alemtuzumab-associated secondary autoimmunity.METHODS: In this hypothesis-driven pilot study, 10 patients received low-dose rituximab (50-150 mg/m2), a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, after either their first or second cycles of alemtuzumab. These patients were then routinely assessed for the development of autoimmune disorders and safety signals related to the use of dual monoclonal antibody therapy.RESULTS: Five patients received at least 1 IV infusion of low-dose rituximab, following alemtuzumab therapy, with a mean follow-up of 41 months. None of the 5 patients developed secondary autoimmune disorders. An additional 5 patients with follow-up over less than 24 months received at least 1 infusion of low-dose rituximab treatment following alemtuzumab treatment. No secondary autoimmune diseases were observed.CONCLUSIONS: An anti-CD20 ""whack-a-mole"" B-cell depletion strategy may serve to mitigate alemtuzumab-associated secondary autoimmunity in MS by reducing the imbalance in B- and T-cell regulatory networks during immune reconstitution. We believe that these observations warrant further investigation.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that for people with MS, low-dose rituximab following alemtuzumab treatment decreases the risk of alemtuzumab-associated secondary autoimmune diseases.

SARS-CoV-2 triggered 'PANIC' attack in severe COVID-19. Frohman, E. M., Villemarette-Pittman, N. R., Melamed, E., Cruz, R. A., Longmuir, R., Varkey, T. C., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S., Frohman, T. C. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has produced a world-wide collapse of social and economic infrastructure, as well as constrained our freedom of movement. This respiratory tract infection is nefarious in how it targets the most distal and highly vulnerable aspect of the human bronchopulmonary tree, specifically, the delicate yet irreplaceable alveoli that are responsible for the loading of oxygen upon red cell hemoglobin for use by all of the body's tissues. In most symptomatic individuals, the disease is a mild immune-mediated syndrome, with limited damage to the lung tissues. About 20% of those affected experience a disease course characterized by a cataclysmic set of immune activation responses that can culminate in the diffuse and irreversible obliteration of the distal alveoli, leading to a virtual collapse of the gas-exchange apparatus. Here, in Part I of a duology on the characterization and potential treatment for COVID-19, we define severe COVID-19 as a consequence of the ability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to trigger what we now designate for the first time as a 'Prolific Activation of a Network-Immune-Inflammatory Crisis', or 'PANIC' Attack, in the alveolar tree. In Part II we describe an immunotherapeutic hypothesis worthy of the organization of a randomized clinical trial in order to ascertain whether a repurposed, generic, inexpensive, and widely available agent is capable of abolishing 'PANIC'; thereby preventing or mitigating severe COVID-19, with monumental ramifications for world health, and the global pandemic that continues to threaten it.

View details for New targets and therapeutics for neuroprotection, remyelination and repair in multiple sclerosis. Introduction: Immunotherapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) significantly decrease the risk of new relapses. However, the chronic compartmentalized inflammation and neurodegeneration that define progressive MS are not prevented by these therapies and so significant damage to the brain and spinal cord and resulting disability ensues. Hence, the possibility of combining current immunotherapies with neuroprotective, remyelinating or regenerative therapies should be pursued.Areas Covered: This article sheds light on neuroprotective, remyelination and neurorepair strategies for MS, the numerous mechanisms for therapeutic targeting and the new candidates for combination therapies. We searched PubMed for articles with the terms, 'neuroprotection', remyelination' or 'regeneration' and 'therapies' or 'drugs' and 'Multiple Sclerosis'.Expert Opinion: An enriched understanding of the neurobiology and molecular changes that are activated by inflammatory CNS damage will provide new opportunities for the identification of neuroprotective, remyelinating and regenerative therapies. Success will depend on the improvement of CNS drug delivery, the identification of new predictive biomarkers, the optimization of clinical trials by assessment of the damage to the visual pathway and the testing of novel therapies in acute optic neuritis.

M., Villemarette-Pittman, N. R., Cruz, R. A., Longmuir, R., Rowe, V., Rowe, E. S., Varkey, T. C., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S., Frohman, T. C. Here, in Part II of a duology on the characterization and potential treatment for COVID-19, we characterize the application of an innovative treatment regimen for the prevention of the transition from mild to severe COVID-19, as well as detail an intensive immunotherapy intervention hypothesis. We propose as a putative randomized controlled trial that high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin (HDMTX-LR) rescue can abolish 'PANIC', thereby 'left-shifting' severe COVID-19 patients to the group majority of those infected with SARS-CoV-2, who are designated as having mild, even asymptomatic, disease. HDMTX-LR is endowed with broadly pleiotropic properties and is a repurposed, generic, inexpensive, and widely available agent which can be administered early in the course of severe COVID-19 thus rescuing the critical and irreplaceable gas-exchange alveoli. Further, we describe a preventative treatment intervention regimen for those designated as having mild to moderate COVID-19 disease, but who exhibit features which herald the transition to the severe variant of this disease. Both of our proposed hypothesis-driven questions should be urgently subjected to rigorous assessment in the context of randomized controlled trials, in order to confirm or refute the contention that the approaches characterized herein, are in fact capable of exerting mitigating, if not abolishing, effects upon SARS-CoV-2 triggered 'PANIC Attack'. Confirmation of our immunotherapy hypothesis would have far-reaching ramifications for the current pandemic, along with yielding invaluable lessons which could be leveraged to more effectively prepare for the next challenge to global health.

P., Pedotti, R., Sangaletti, S. The extrusion of DNA traps contributes to a key mechanism in which innate immune cells clear pathogens or induce sterile inflammation. Here we provide evidence that CD4+ T cells, a critical regulator of adaptive immunity, release extracellular threads of DNA on activation. These DNA extrusions convey autocrine costimulatory signals to T lymphocytes and can be detected in lymph nodes isolated during the priming phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a CD4+ T cell-driven mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) abolishes the extrusion of DNA by CD4+ T cells, reducing cytokine production in vitro and T cell priming against myelin in vivo. Moreover, mtROS blockade during established EAE markedly ameliorates disease severity, dampening autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system. Taken together, these experimental results elucidate a mechanism of intrinsic immune costimulation mediated by DNA threads released by activated T helper cells, and identify a potential therapeutic target for such disorders as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and CD4+ T cell-mediated disorders.

The development of neuroprotective therapies is a sought-after goal. By screening combinatorial chemical libraries using in vitro assays, we identified the small molecule BN201 that promotes the survival of cultured neural cells when subjected to oxidative stress or when deprived of trophic factors. Moreover, BN201 promotes neuronal differentiation, the differentiation of precursor cells to mature oligodendrocytes in vitro, and the myelination of new axons. BN201 modulates several kinases participating in the insulin growth factor 1 pathway including serum-glucocorticoid kinase and midkine, inducing the phosphorylation of NDRG1 and the translocation of the transcription factor Foxo3 to the cytoplasm. In vivo, BN201 prevents axonal and neuronal loss, and it promotes remyelination in models of multiple sclerosis, chemically induced demyelination, and glaucoma. In summary, we provide a new promising strategy to promote neuroaxonal survival and remyelination, potentially preventing disability in brain diseases. Safety and efficacy of ozanimod versus interferon beta-1a in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RADIANCE): a multicentre, randomised, 24-month, phase 3 trial. Cohen, J. A., Comi, G., Selmaj, K. W., Bar-Or, A., Arnold, D. L., Steinman, L., Hartung, H. P., Montalban, X., Kubala Havrdov, E., Cree, B. A., Sheffield, J. K., Minton, N., Raghupathi, K., Huang, V., Kappos, L. Ozanimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, which selectively binds to sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtypes 1 and 5 with high affinity. In the RADIANCE phase 2 study in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis, ozanimod was associated with better efficacy than placebo on MRI measures and was well tolerated. The RADIANCE phase 3 study aimed to confirm the safety and efficacy of ozanimod versus interferon beta-1a in individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis.We did a 24-month, multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy phase 3 trial in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis at 147 medical centres and clinical practices in 21 countries. Participants were aged 18-55 years, had multiple sclerosis according to 2010 McDonald criteria, a relapsing clinical course, brain MRI lesions consistent with multiple sclerosis, an expanded disability status scale score of 00-50, and either at least one relapse within 12 months before screening or at least one relapse within 24 months before screening plus at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion within the 12 months before randomisation. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via an interactive voice response system to daily oral ozanimod 10 mg or 05 mg or weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a 30 g. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was annualised relapse rate (ARR) over 24 months. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population of all participants who received study drug and safety was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received study drug, grouped by highest dose of ozanimod received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02047734, and EudraCT, 2012-002714-40.Between Dec 27, 2013, and March 31, 2015, we screened 1695 participants, of which 375 did not meet inclusion criteria. 1320 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to a group, of whom 1313 received study drug (433 assigned to ozanimod 10 mg, 439 assigned to ozanimod 05 mg, and 441 assigned to interferon beta-1a) and 1138 (867%) completed 24 months of treatment. Adjusted ARRs were 017 (95% CI 014-021) with ozanimod 10 mg, 022 (018-026) with ozanimod 05 mg, and 028 (023-032) with interferon beta-1a, with rate ratios versus interferon beta-1a of 062 (95% CI 051-077; p<00001) for ozanimod 10 mg and 079 (065 to 096; p=00167) for ozanimod 05 mg. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was higher in the interferon beta-1a group (365 [830%] of 440 participants) than in the ozanimod 10 mg group (324 [747%] of 434) or the ozanimod 05 mg group (326 [743%] of 439). More participants in the interferon beta-1a group had treatment-emergent adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation than in the ozanimod groups. Incidences of infections and serious treatment-emergent adverse events were similar across treatment groups. No cases of ozanimod-related symptomatic reduction in heart rate and no second-degree or third-degree cases of atrioventricular block were reported.In this 24-month phase 3 study in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis, ozanimod was well tolerated and associated with a significantly lower rate of clinical relapses than intramuscular interferon beta-1a. These findings show the potential of ozanimod as an effective oral therapy for individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis.Celgene International II.

The RADIANCE phase 2 study showed that ozanimod had better efficacy than placebo on MRI measures, with a favourable safety profile, in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis. The SUNBEAM study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ozanimod versus intramuscular interferon beta-1a in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis.SUNBEAM was a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled phase 3 trial done at 152 academic medical centres and clinical practices in 20 countries. We enrolled participants aged 18-55 years with relapsing multiple sclerosis, baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score of 00-50, and either at least one relapse within the 12 months before screening or at least one relapse within 24 months plus at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion within 12 months before screening. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 by a blocked algorithm stratified by country and baseline EDSS score to at least 12 months treatment of either once-daily oral ozanimod 10 mg or 05 mg or weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a 30 g. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was annualised relapse rate (ARR) during the treatment period and was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all participants according to the highest dose of ozanimod received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02294058 and EudraCT, number 2014-002320-27.Between Dec 18, 2014, and Nov 12, 2015, 1346 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to ozanimod 10 mg (n=447), ozanimod 05 mg (n=451), or interferon beta-1a (n=448). 91 (68%) participants discontinued the study drug (29 in the ozanimod 10 mg group; 26 in the ozanimod 05 mg group; and 36 in the interferon beta-1a group). Adjusted ARRs were 035 (028-044) for interferon beta-1a, 018 (95% CI 014-024) for ozanimod 10 mg (rate ratio [RR] of 052 [041-066] vs interferon beta-1a; p<00001), and 024 (019-031) for ozanimod 05 mg (RR 069 [055-086] vs interferon beta-1a; p=00013). Few ozanimod-treated participants discontinued treatment because of adverse events (13 [29%] who received ozanimod 10 mg; seven [15%] who received ozanimod 05 mg; and 16 [36%] who received interferon beta-1a). No first-dose, clinically significant bradycardia or second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block was reported. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and similar across treatment groups (13 [29%] participants who received ozanimod 10 mg; 16 [35%] who received ozanimod 05 mg; and 11 [25%] who received interferon beta-1a). No serious opportunistic infections occurred in ozanimod-treated participants.In participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis treated for at least 12 months, ozanimod was well tolerated and demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate than interferon beta-1a. These findings provide support for ozanimod as an oral therapy for individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis.Celgene International II.

To evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine profiles in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein IgG-positive (MOG-IgG+) disease in adult and paediatric patients.In this cross-sectional study, we measured 27 cytokines in the CSF of MOG-IgG+ disease in acute phase before treatment (n=29). The data were directly compared with those in aquaporin-4 antibody-positive (AQP4-IgG+) neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) (n=20), multiple sclerosis (MS) (n=20) and non-inflammatory controls (n=14).In MOG-IgG+ disease, there was no female preponderance and the ages were younger (mean 18 years, range 3-68; 15 were below 18 years) relative to AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD (41, 15-77) and MS (34, 17-48). CSF cell counts were higher and oligoclonal IgG bands were mostly negative in MOG-IgG+ diseaseand AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD compared with MS. MOG-IgG+ disease had significantly elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, interferon-, IL-10, IL-1 receptor antagonist, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 as compared with MS. No cytokine in MOG-IgG+ disease was significantly different from AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD. Moreover many elevated cytokines were correlated with each other in MOG-IgG+ diseaseand AQP4-IgG+ NMOSDbut not in MS. No difference in the data was seen between adult and paediatric MOG-IgG+ cases.The CSF cytokine profile in the acute phase of MOG-IgG+ disease is characterised by coordinated upregulation of T helper 17 (Th17) and other cytokines including some Th1-related and regulatory T cells-related ones in adults and children, which is similar to AQP4-IgG+ NMOSDbut clearly different from MS. The results suggest that as with AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD, some disease-modifying drugs for MS may be ineffective in MOG-IgG+ disease while they may provide potential therapeutic targets.

M., Glanville, J., Volkmuth, W., Emerling, D. E., Robinson, W. H. There is significant debate regarding whether B cells and their antibodies contribute to effective anti-cancer immune responses. Here we show that patients with metastatic but non-progressing melanoma, lung adenocarcinoma, or renal cell carcinoma exhibited increased levels of blood plasmablasts. We used a cell-barcoding technology to sequence their plasmablast antibody repertoires, revealing clonal families of affinity matured B cells that exhibit progressive class switching and persistence over time. Anti-CTLA4 and other treatments were associated with further increases in somatic hypermutation and clonal family size. Recombinant antibodies from clonal families bound non-autologous tumor tissue and cell lines, and families possessing immunoglobulin paratope sequence motifs shared across patients exhibited increased rates of binding. We identified antibodies that caused regression of, and durable immunity toward, heterologous syngeneic tumors in mice. Our findings demonstrate convergent functional anti-tumor antibody responses targeting public tumor antigens, and provide an approach to identify antibodies with diagnostic or therapeutic utility.

Ozanimod, an oral immunomodulator, selectively targets sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 1 and 5.Evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis.In the RADIANCE Part A phase II study (NCT01628393), participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis were randomized (1:1:1) to once-daily ozanimod hydrochloride (0.5 or 1mg) or placebo. After 24weeks, participants could enter a 2-year, dose-blinded extension. Ozanimod-treated participants continued their assigned dose; placebo participants were re-randomized (1:1) to ozanimod hydrochloride 0.5 or 1mg (equivalent to ozanimod 0.46 and 0.92mg).A total of 223 (89.6%) of the 249 participants completed the blinded extension. At 2years of the extension, the percentage of participants who were gadolinium-enhancing lesion-free ranged from 86.5% to 94.6%. Unadjusted annualized relapse rate during the blinded extension (week 24-end of treatment) was 0.32 for ozanimod hydrochloride 0.5mg ozanimod hydrochloride 0.5mg, 0.18 for ozanimod hydrochloride 1mg ozanimod hydrochloride 1mg, 0.30 for placebo ozanimod hydrochloride 0.5 mg, and 0.18 for placebo ozanimod hydrochloride 1mg. No second-degree or higher atrioventricular block or serious opportunistic infection was reported.Ozanimod demonstrated sustained efficacy in participants continuing treatment up to 2years and reached similar efficacy in participants who switched from placebo; no unexpected safety signals emerged. Amelioration of ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with fluoxetine Bhat, R., Mahapatra, S., Axtell, R. C., Steinman, L. In patients with multiple sclerosis, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, resulted in less acute disease activity. We tested the immune modulating effects of fluoxetine in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, i.e. experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We show that fluoxetine delayed the onset of disease and reduced clinical paralysis in mice with established disease. Fluoxetine had abrogating effects on proliferation of immune cells and inflammatory cytokine production by both antigen-presenting cells and T cells. Specifically, in CD4 T cells, fluoxetine increased Fas-induced apoptosis. We conclude that fluoxetine possesses immune-modulating effects resulting in the amelioration of symptoms in EAE.

Demyelinated brain lesions, a hallmark of autoimmune neuroinflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis, result from oligodendroglial cell damage. Activated microglia are considered a major source of nitric oxide and subsequent peroxynitrite-mediated damage of myelin. Here, we provide biochemical and biophysical evidence that the oxidoreductase glutaredoxin 2 inhibits peroxynitrite formation by transforming nitric oxide into dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron-complexes. Glutaredoxin 2 levels influence both survival rates of primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and preservation of myelin structure in cerebellar organotypic slice cultures challenged with activated microglia or nitric oxide donors. Of note, glutaredoxin 2-mediated protection is not linked to its enzymatic activity as oxidoreductase, but to the disassembly of its uniquely coordinated iron-sulfur cluster using glutathione as non-protein ligand. The protective effect of glutaredoxin 2 is connected to decreased protein carbonylation and nitration. In line, brain lesions of mice suffering from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis, show decreased glutaredoxin 2 expression and increased nitrotyrosine formation indicating that this type of protection is missing in the inflamed central nervous system. Our findings link inorganic biochemistry to neuroinflammation and identify glutaredoxin 2 as a protective factor against neuroinflammation-mediated myelin damage. Thus, improved availability of glutathione-coordinated iron-sulfur clusters emerges as a potential therapeutic approach in inflammatory demyelination.

L., Fontana, E., Cominelli, M., Abolafio, G., Steinman, L., Pedotti, R. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of targeting the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (FcepsilonRI), that plays a central role in allergic responses and is constitutively expressed on mast cells and basophils, in clinical disease and autoimmune T-cell response in experimental MS.METHODS: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in C57BL/6 mice by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55. Anti-FcepsilonRI alpha-chain antibody was administered intraperitoneally. CNS immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry analysis of immune cell populations, IgE and histamine serum concentration, immune cell proliferation, and cytokine measurement were performed. In BALB/c mice, EAE was induced by immunization with myelin proteolipid protein 185-206.RESULTS: Treatment with anti-FcepsilonRIalpha antibody resulted in exacerbation of EAE and increased CNS inflammation in C57BL/6 mice. Treated mice displayed long-lasting complete depletion of basophils in the blood stream and peripheral lymphoid organs and increased antigen-induced immune cell proliferation and production of interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-17, IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In BALB/c mice, which are T-helper (Th) 2 prone and resistant to EAE, treatment with anti-FcepsilonRIalpha antibody restored susceptibility to EAE.CONCLUSION: Our observations that anti-FcepsilonRIalpha antibody increases Th1 and Th17 responses against myelin antigen and exacerbates EAE suggest that FcepsilonRI, basophils, and possibly other FcepsilonRI-bearing cells that might be affected by this antibody play important roles in influencing the severity of CNS autoimmunity.

View details for Time correlation between mononucleosis and initial symptoms of MS To determine the average age of MS onset vs the age at which Epstein-Barr infection has previously occurred and stratify this analysis by sex and the blood level of Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) antibody.Using infectious mononucleosis (IM) as a temporal marker in data from the Swedish epidemiologic investigation of MS, 259 adult IM/MS cases were identified and then augmented to account for ""missing"" childhood data so that the average age of MS onset could be determined for cases binned by age of IM (as stratified by sex and EBNA1 titer level).Mean age of IM vs mean age of MS reveals a positive time correlation for all IM ages (from 5 to 30 years), with IM-to-MS delay decreasing with increased age. When bifurcated by sex or EBNA1 blood titer levels, males and high-titer subpopulations show even stronger positive time correlation, while females and low-titer populations show negative time correlation in early childhood (long IM/MS delay). The correlation becomes positive in females beyond puberty.IM/MS time correlation implies causality if IM is time random. Alternative confounding models seem implausible, in light of constraints imposed by time-invariant delay observed here. Childhood infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in females and/or those genetically prone to low EBNA1 blood titers will develop MS slowly. Males and/or high EBNA1-prone develop MS more rapidly following IM infection at all ages. For all, postpubescent EBV infection is critical for the initiation and rapid development of MS.

Expression of Spam1/PH20 and its modulation of high/low molecular weight hyaluronan substrate have been proposed to play an important role in murine oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) maturation in vitro and in normal and demyelinated central nervous system (CNS). We reexamined this using highly purified PH20.Steady-state expression of mRNA in OPCs was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction; the role of PH20 in bovine testicular hyaluronidase (BTH) inhibition of OPC differentiation was explored by comparing BTH to a purified recombinant human PH20 (rHuPH20). Contaminants in commercial BTH were identified and their impact on OPC differentiation characterized. Spam1/PH20 expression in normal and demyelinated mouse CNS tissue was investigated using deep RNA sequencing and immunohistological methods with two antibodies directed against recombinant murine PH20.BTH, but not rHuPH20, inhibited OPC differentiation in vitro. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was identified as a significant contaminant in BTH, and bFGF immunodepletion reversed the inhibitory effects of BTH on OPC differentiation. Spam1 mRNA was undetected in OPCs in vitro and in vivo; PH20 immunolabeling was undetected in normal and demyelinated CNS.We were unable to detect Spam1/PH20 expression in OPCs or in normal or demyelinated CNS using the most sensitive methods currently available. Further, ""BTH"" effects on OPC differentiation are not due to PH20, but may be attributable to contaminating bFGF. Our data suggest that caution be exercised when using some commercially available hyaluronidases, and reports of Spam1/PH20 morphogenic activity in the CNS may be due to contaminants in reagents.

F., Yoon, J., van Horssen, J., Han, M. H., Bollyky, P. L., Palmer, T. D., Steinman, L. The small heat shock protein B-crystallin (CRYAB) has been implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. Earlier studies have indicated that CRYAB inhibits inflammation and attenuates clinical disease when administered in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of MS. In this study, we evaluated the role of CRYAB in primary demyelinating events. Using the cuprizone model of demyelination, a noninflammatory model that allows the analysis of glial responses in MS, we show that endogenous CRYAB expression is associated with increased severity of demyelination. Moreover, we demonstrate a strong correlation between the expression of CRYAB and the extent of reactive astrogliosis in demyelinating areas and in in vitro assays. In addition, we reveal that CRYAB is differentially phosphorylated in astrocytes in active demyelinating MS lesions, as well as in cuprizone-induced lesions, and that this phosphorylation is required for the reactive astrocyte response associated with demyelination. Furthermore, taking a proteomics approach to identify proteins that are bound by the phosphorylated forms of CRYAB in primary cultured astrocytes, we show that there is clear differential binding of protein targets due to the specific phosphorylation of CRYAB. Subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of these targets reveals implications for intracellular pathways and biological processes that could be affected by these modifications. Together, these findings demonstrate that astrocytes play a pivotal role in demyelination, making them a potential target for therapeutic intervention, and that phosphorylation of CRYAB is a key factor supporting the pathogenic response of astrocytes to oligodendrocyte injury.

C., Cen, S. Y., Tauhid, S., Neema, M., Steinman, L. The objective of this study was to evaluate monthly intramuscular adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) gel versus intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) add-on therapy to interferon for breakthrough disease in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.This was a prospective, open-label, examiner-blinded, 15-month pilot study evaluating patients with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 3.0-6.5 and at least one clinical relapse or new T2 or gadolinium-enhanced lesion in the previous year. Twenty-three patients were randomized to ACTH (n = 12) or IVMP (n = 11) and completed the study. The primary outcome measure was the cumulative number of relapses. Secondary outcomes included EDSS, Mental Health Inventory (MHI), plasma cytokines, MS Functional Composite (MSFC), Quality-of-Life (MS-QOL) score, bone mineral density (BMD), and new or worsened psychiatric symptoms per month. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was analyzed post hoc. This was a preliminary and small-scale study.Relapse rates differed significantly [ACTH 0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01-0.54 versus IVMP 0.80, 95% CI 0.36-1.75; rate ratio, IVMP versus ACTH: 9.56, 95% CI 1.23-74.6; p = 0.03]. ACTH improved (p = 0.03) MHI (slope 0.95 0.38 points/month; p = 0.02 versus slope -0.38 0.43 points/month; p = 0.39). On-study decreases (all p < 0.05) in eight cytokine levels occurred only in the ACTH group. However, on-study EDSS, MSFC, MS-QOL, BMD, and MRI lesion changes were not significant between groups. Psychiatric symptoms per patient were greater with IVMP than ACTH (0.55, 95% CI 0.12-2.6 versus 0; p < 0.0001). Other common adverse events were insomnia and urinary tract infections (IVMP, seven events each) and fatigue or flu symptoms (ACTH, five events each).This study provided class II evidence that ACTH produced better examiner-assessed cumulative rates of relapses per patient than IVMP in the adjunctive treatment of breakthrough disease in multiple sclerosis. Regulator of oligodendrocyte maturation, miR-219, a potential biomarker for MS. Bruinsma, I. B., van Dijk, M., Bridel, C., van de Lisdonk, T., Haverkort, S. Q., Runia, T. F., Steinman, L., Hintzen, R. Q., Killestein, J., Verbeek, M. M., Teunissen, C. E., de Jong, B. A. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and degenerative disease of the central nervous system. Normally, demyelination is followed by remyelination, which requires repopulation of a demyelinated area by oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Although large numbers of precursor cells are present in MS lesions, remyelination often fails, in part by the inability of precursor cells to differentiate into mature myelin-forming cells. In mouse and rat, miR-219 is required for this differentiation. Previously, we identified decreased miR-219 expression in tissue of MS patients compared to controls. Cell-free miRNAs have been detected in many different body fluids including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and may reflect disease processes going on in the central nervous system. This prompted us to investigate the biomarker performance of CSF miR-219 for MS diagnosis.Quantitative PCR was performed measuring miR-219 levels in CSF of MS patients and controls in three independent cohorts.All three cohorts of MS patients and controls revealed that absence of miR-219 detection in CSF is consistently associated with MS.We have been able to identify and validate absence of miR-219 detection in CSF of MS patients compared to controls, suggesting that it may emerge as a candidate biomarker for MS diagnosis. Induction of Paralysis and Visual System Injury in Mice by T Cells Specific for Neuromyelitis Optica Autoantigen Aquaporin-4. Sagan, S. A., Cruz-Herranz, A., Spencer, C. M., Ho, P. P., Steinman, L., Green, A. J., Sobel, R. A., Zamvil, S. S. While it is recognized that aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-specific T cells and antibodies participate in the pathogenesis of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), a human central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune demyelinating disease, creation of an AQP4-targeted model with both clinical and histologic manifestations of CNS autoimmunity has proven challenging. Immunization of wild-type (WT) mice with AQP4 peptides elicited T cell proliferation, although those T cells could not transfer disease to nave recipient mice. Recently, two novel AQP4 T cell epitopes, peptide (p) 135-153 and p201-220, were identified when studying immune responses to AQP4 in AQP4-deficient (AQP4-/-) mice, suggesting T cell reactivity to these epitopes is normally controlled by thymic negative selection. AQP4-/- Th17 polarized T cells primed to either p135-153 or p201-220 induced paralysis in recipient WT mice, that was associated with predominantly leptomeningeal inflammation of the spinal cord and optic nerves. Inflammation surrounding optic nerves and involvement of the inner retinal layers (IRL) were manifested by changes in serial optical coherence tomography (OCT). Here, we illustrate the approaches used to create this new in vivo model of AQP4-targeted CNS autoimmunity (ATCA), which can now be employed to study mechanisms that permit development of pathogenic AQP4-specific T cells and how they may cooperate with B cells in NMO pathogenesis. Tolerance checkpoint bypass permits emergence of pathogenic T cells to neuromyelitis optica autoantigen aquaporin-4 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Sagan, S.

J., Anderson, M. S., Sobel, R. A., Zamvil, S. S. Aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-specific T cells are expanded in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients and exhibit Th17 polarization. However, their pathogenic role in CNS autoimmune inflammatory disease is unclear. Although multiple AQP4 T-cell epitopes have been identified in WT C57BL/6 mice, we observed that neither immunization with those determinants nor transfer of donor T cells targeting them caused CNS autoimmune disease in recipient mice. In contrast, robust proliferation was observed following immunization of AQP4-deficient (AQP4(-/-)) mice with AQP4 peptide (p) 135-153 or p201-220, peptides predicted to contain I-A(b)-restricted T-cell epitopes but not identified in WT mice. In comparison with WT mice, AQP4(-/-) mice used unique T-cell receptor repertoires for recognition of these two AQP4 epitopes. Donor T cells specific for either determinant from AQP4(-/-), but not WT, mice induced paralysis in recipient WT and B-cell-deficient mice. AQP4-specific Th17-polarized cells induced more severe disease than Th1-polarized cells. Clinical signs were associated with opticospinal infiltrates of T cells and monocytes. Fluorescent-labeled donor T cells were detected in CNS lesions. Visual system involvement was evident by changes in optical coherence tomography. Fine mapping of AQP4 p201-220 and p135-153 epitopes identified peptides within p201-220 but not p135-153, which induced clinical disease in 40% of WT mice by direct immunization. Our results provide a foundation to evaluate how AQP4-specific T cells contribute to AQP4-targeted CNS autoimmunity (ATCA) and suggest that pathogenic AQP4-specific T-cell responses are normally restrained by central tolerance, which may be relevant to understanding development of AQP4-reactive T cells in NMO.

G., Benners, E., Shinohara, M. L. Inflammation induced by innate immunity influences the development of T cell-mediated autoimmunity in multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found that strong activation of innate immunity induced Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-independent and interferon- (IFN)-resistant EAE (termed type B EAE), whereas EAE induced by weak activation of innate immunity requires the NLRP3 inflammasome and is sensitive to IFN treatment. Instead, an alternative inflammatory mechanism, including membrane-bound lymphotoxin- receptor (LTR) and CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), is involved in type B EAE development, and type B EAE is ameliorated by antagonizing these receptors. Relative expression of Ltbr and Cxcr2 genes was indeed enhanced in patients with IFN-resistant multiple sclerosis. Remission was minimal in type B EAE due to neuronal damages induced by semaphorin 6B upregulation on CD4(+) T cells.

Restoring immune tolerance in neuromyelitis optica: Part II. Bar-Or, A., Steinman, L., Behne, J. M., Benitez-Ribas, D., Chin, P. S., Clare-Salzler, M., Healey, D., Kim, J. I., Kranz, D. M., Lutterotti, A., Martin, R., Schippling, S., Villoslada, P., Wei, C., Weiner, H. L., Zamvil, S. S., Smith, T. J., Yeaman, M. R. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMO/SD) and its clinical variants have at their core the loss of immune tolerance to aquaporin-4 and perhaps other autoantigens. The characteristic phenotype is disruption of astrocyte function and demyelination of spinal cord, optic nerves, and particular brain regions. In this second of a 2-part article, we present further perspectives regarding the pathogenesis of NMO/SD and how this disease might be amenable to emerging technologies aimed at restoring immune tolerance to disease-implicated self-antigens. NMO/SD appears to be particularly well-suited for these strategies since aquaporin-4 has already been identified as the dominant autoantigen. The recent technical advances in reintroducing immune tolerance in experimental models of disease as well as in humans should encourage quantum leaps in this area that may prove productive for novel therapy. In this part of the article series, the potential for regulatory T and B cells is brought into focus, as are new approaches to oral tolerization. Finally, a roadmap is provided to help identify potential issues in clinical development and guide applications in tolerization therapy to solving NMO/SD through the use of emerging technologies. Each of these perspectives is intended to shine new light on potential cures for NMO/SD and other autoimmune diseases, while sparing normal host defense mechanisms. Restoring immune tolerance in neuromyelitis optica Part I Steinman, L., Bar-Or, A., Behne, J. M., Benitez-Ribas, D., Chin, P. S., Clare-Salzler, M., Healey, D., Kim, J. I., Kranz, D. M., Lutterotti, A., Martin, R., Schippling, S., Villoslada, P., Wei, C., Weiner, H. L., Zamvil, S. S., Yeaman, M. R., Smith, T. J., Guthy-Jackson Charitable Fdn Int Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and spectrum disorder (NMO/SD) represent a vexing process and its clinical variants appear to have at their pathogenic core the loss of immune tolerance to the aquaporin-4 water channel protein. This process results in a characteristic pattern of astrocyte dysfunction, loss, and demyelination that predominantly affects the spinal cord and optic nerves. Although several empirical therapies are currently used in the treatment of NMO/SD, none has been proven effective in prospective, adequately powered, randomized trials. Furthermore, most of the current therapies subject patients to long-term immunologic suppression that can cause serious infections and development of cancers. The following is the first of a 2-part description of several key immune mechanisms in NMO/SD that might be amenable to therapeutic restoration of immune tolerance. It is intended to provide a roadmap for how potential immune tolerance restorative techniques might be applied to patients with NMO/SD. This initial installment provides a background rationale underlying attempts at immune tolerization. It provides specific examples of innovative approaches that have emerged recently as a consequence of technical advances. In several autoimmune diseases, these strategies have been reduced to practice. Therefore, in theory, the identification of aquaporin-4 as the dominant autoantigen makes NMO/SD an ideal candidate for the development of tolerizing therapies or cures for this increasingly recognized disease. Genetic background modulates outcome of therapeutic amyloid peptides in treatment of neuroinflammation Kraus, A., Race, B., Phillips, K., Winkler, C., Saturday, G., Kurnellas, M., Rothbard, J. B., Groveman, B. R., Steinman, L., Caughey, B. Amyloid hexapeptide molecules are effective in the treatment of the murine model of neuroinflammation, known as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Efficacy however differs between two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J (B6) and C57BL/10SnJ (B10). Amyloid hexapeptide treatments improved the clinical outcomes of B6, but not B10 mice, indicating that genetic background influences therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, although previous studies indicated that prion protein deficiency results in more severe EAE in B6 mice, we observed no such effect in B10 mice. In addition, we found that amyloid hexapeptide treatments of B10 and B6 mice elicited differential IL4 responses. Thus, the modulatory potential of prion protein and related treatments with other amyloid hexapeptides in EAE depends on mouse strain.

G., Marshall, P. L., Gebe, J. A., Ishak, H. D., Keswani, S. G., Bollyky, J., Frymoyer, A. R., Wight, T. N., Steinman, L., Bollyky, P. L. Recently, there has been considerable interest in using 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) to inhibit hyaluronan synthesis in mouse models of cancer, autoimmunity, and a variety of other inflammatory disorders where hyaluronan (HA) has been implicated in disease pathogenesis. In order to facilitate future studies in this area, we have examined the dosing, treatment route, treatment duration, and metabolism of 4-MU in both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. Mice fed chow containing 5% 4-MU, a dose calculated to deliver 250 mg/mouse/day, initially lose substantial weight but typically resume normal weight gain after one week. It also takes up to a week to see a reduction in serum HA in these animals, indicating that at least a one-week loading period on the drug is required for most protocols. At steady state, over 90% of the drug is present in plasma as the glucuronidated metabolite 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide (4-MUG), with the sulfated metabolite, 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate (4-MUS) comprising most of the remainder. Chow containing 5% but not 0.65% 4-MU was effective at preventing disease in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis as well as in the DORmO mouse model of autoimmune diabetes. While oral 4-MU was effective at preventing EAE, daily intraperitoneal injections of 4-MU were not. Factors potentially affecting 4-MU uptake and plasma concentrations in mice include its taste, short half-life and low bioavailability. These studies provide a practical resource for implementing oral 4-MU treatment protocols in mice. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

View details for CEACAM1 mediates B cell aggregation in central nervous system autoimmunity Rovituso, D. M., Scheffler, L., Wunsch, M., Kleinschnitz, C., Doerck, S., Ulzheimer, J., Bayas, A., Steinman, L., Erguen, S., Kuerten, S. B cell aggregates in the central nervous system (CNS) have been associated with rapid disease progression in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we demonstrate a key role of carcinoembryogenic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule1 (CEACAM1) in B cell aggregate formation in MS patients and a B cell-dependent mouse model of MS. CEACAM1 expression was increased on peripheral blood B cells and CEACAM1(+) B cells were present in brain infiltrates of MS patients. Administration of the anti-CEACAM1 antibody T84.1 was efficient in blocking aggregation of B cells derived from MS patients. Along these lines, application of the monoclonal anti-CEACAM1 antibody mCC1 was able to inhibit CNS B cell aggregate formation and significantly attenuated established MS-like disease in mice in the absence of any adverse effects. CEACAM1 was co-expressed with the regulator molecule T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain -3 (TIM-3) on B cells, a novel molecule that has recently been described to induce anergy in T cells. Interestingly, elevated coexpression on B cells coincided with an autoreactive T helper cell phenotype in MS patients. Overall, these data identify CEACAM1 as a clinically highly interesting target in MS pathogenesis and open new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of the disease. Beginning of the end of two-stage theory purporting that inflammation then degeneration explains pathogenesis of progressive multiple sclerosis The review discusses future directions in research on multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica, as long-held beliefs about these diseases are undermined with data from recent clinical trials.Results of clinical trials for registration (phase 3) were reported in the last year. Anti-inflammatory approaches, such as daclizumab high-yield process targeting IL-2 receptor, and ocrelizumab targeting CD20 B cells, confirmed a beneficial role of immune suppression in relapsing-remitting disease. And now for the first time achieving the primary end point in primary progressive multiple sclerosis was attained with ocrelizumab.The results in the past year challenge the long-held belief that relapsing-remitting disease is inflammatory, whereas progressive forms of the disease are 'less inflammatory' and more 'degenerative.'

D., Tangsombatvisit, S., Haynes, W. A., Diep, V., Steinman, L., Faix, J., Utz, P. J. Type I interferon (IFN) signaling is a central pathogenic pathway in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and therapeutics targeting type I IFN signaling are in development. Multiple proteins with overlapping functions play a role in IFN signaling, but the signaling events downstream of receptor engagement are unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate the roles of the type I and type II IFN signaling components IFN-// receptor 2 (IFNAR-2), IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF-9), and STAT-1 in a mouse model of SLE.We used immunohistochemical staining and highly multiplexed assays to characterize pathologic changes in histology, autoantibody production, cytokine/chemokine profiles, and STAT phosphorylation in order to investigate the individual roles of IFNAR-2, IRF-9, and STAT-1 in MRL/lpr mice.We found that STAT-1(-/-) mice, but not IRF-9(-/-) or IFNAR-2(-/-) mice, developed interstitial nephritis characterized by infiltration with retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor t-positive lymphocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils. Despite pronounced interstitial kidney disease and abnormal kidney function, STAT-1(-/-) mice had decreased proteinuria, glomerulonephritis, and autoantibody production. Phosphospecific flow cytometry revealed shunting of STAT phosphorylation from STAT-1 to STAT-3/4.We describe unique contributions of STAT-1 to pathology in different kidney compartments in a mouse model, and provide potentially novel insight into tubulointerstitial nephritis, a poorly understood complication that predicts end-stage kidney disease in SLE patients.

To evaluate serum cytokine profiles for their utility to determine the heterogeneous responses to interferon (IFN)- treatment in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).Patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or clinically isolated syndrome receiving de novo IFN- treatment were included in this prospective, observational study. Number of relapses and changes in disability were assessed 2 years prior to and 2 years after initiation of treatment. Sera were collected at baseline and after 3 months on therapy. Cytokine levels in sera were assessed by Luminex multiplex assays. Baseline cytokine profiles were grouped by hierarchical clustering analysis. Demographic features, changes in cytokines, and clinical outcome were then assessed in the clustered patient groups.A total of 157 patients were included in the study and clustered into 6 distinct subsets by baseline cytokine profiles. These subsets differed significantly in their clinical and biological response to IFN- therapy. Two subsets were associated with patients who responded poorly to therapy. Two other subsets, associated with a good response to therapy, showed a significant reduction in relapse rates and no worsening of disability. Each subset also had differential changes in cytokine levels after 3 months of IFN- treatment.There is heterogeneity in the immunologic pathways of the RRMS population, which correlates with IFN- response. Anti-Insulin Immune Responses Are Detectable in Dogs with Spontaneous Diabetes Kim, J., Furrow, E., Ritt, M. G., Utz, P. J., Robinson, W. H., Yu, L., Eckert, A., Stuebner, K., O'Brien, T. D., Steinman, L., Modiano, J. F. Diabetes mellitus occurs spontaneously in dogs. Although canine diabetes shares many features with human type-1 diabetes, there are differences that have cast doubt on the immunologic origin of the canine disease. In this study, we examined whether peripheral immune responses directed against islet antigens were present in dogs with diabetes. Routine diagnostics were used to confirm diabetic status, and serum samples from dogs with (N = 15) and without (N = 15) diabetes were analyzed for the presence of antibodies against islet antigens (insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, insulinoma-associated protein tyrosine phosphatase, and islet beta-cell zinc cation efflux transporter) using standard radioassays. Interferon- production from peripheral blood T cells stimulated by porcine insulin and by human insulin was tested using Elispot assays. Anti-insulin antibodies were detectable in a subset of diabetic dogs receiving insulin therapy. Pre-activated T cells and incipient insulin-reactive T cells in response to porcine or human insulin were identified in non-diabetic dogs and in dogs with diabetes. The data show that humoral and cellular anti-insulin immune responses are detectable in dogs with diabetes. This in turn provides support for the potential to ethically use dogs with diabetes to study the therapeutic potential of antigen-specific tolerance. The Safety of Adjuvanted Vaccines Revisited: Vaccine-Induced Narcolepsy Ahmed, S. S., Montomoli, E., Pasini, F. L., Steinman, L. Despite the very high benefit-to-risk ratio of vaccines, the fear of negative side effects has discouraged many people from getting vaccinated, resulting in the reemergence of previously controlled diseases such as measles, pertussis and diphtheria. This fear has been amplified more recently by multiple epidemiologic studies that confirmed the link of an AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine (Pandemrix, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Germany) used in Europe during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [A(H1N1) pdm09] with the development of narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder, in children and adolescents. However, public misperceptions of what adjuvants are and why they are used in vaccines has created in some individuals a closed ""black box"" attitude towards all vaccines. The focus of this review article is to revisit this ""black box"" using the example of narcolepsy associated with the European AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine. View details for Multiplexed autoantigen microarrays identify HLA as a key driver of anti-desmoglein and -non-desmoglein reactivities in pemphigus PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Sajda, T., Hazelton, J., Patel, M., Seiffert-Sinha, K., Steinman, L., Robinson, W., Haab, B. B., Sinha, A. A. Patients with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) harbor antibodies reactive against self-antigens expressed at the surface of keratinocytes, primarily desmoglein (Dsg) 3 and, to a lesser extent, Dsg1. Conventionally, only antibodies targeting these molecules have been thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis. This notion has been challenged by a growing pool of evidence that suggests that antibodies toward additional targets may play a role in disease. The aims of this study were to (i) establish high-throughput protein microarray technology as a method to investigate traditional and putative autoantibodies (autoAbs) in PV and (ii) use multiplexed protein array technology to define the scope and specificity of the autoAb response in PV. Our analysis demonstrated significant IgG reactivity in patients with PV toward the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes 3, 4, and 5 as well as thyroid peroxidase. Furthermore, we found that healthy first- and second-degree relatives of patients with PV express autoAbs toward desmoglein and non-Dsg targets. Our analysis also identified genetic elements, particularly HLA, as key drivers of autoAb expression. Finally, we show that patients with PV exhibit significantly reduced IgM reactivity toward disease-associated antigens relative to controls. The use of protein microarrays to profile the autoAb response in PV advanced the current understanding of disease and provided insight into the complex relationship between genetics and disease development. Hyaluronan synthesis is necessary for autoreactive T-cell trafficking, activation, and Th1 polarization. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Kuipers, H. F., Rieck, M., Gurevich, I., Nagy, N., Butte, M. J., Negrin, R. S., Wight, T. N., Steinman, L., Bollyky, P. L. The extracellular matrix polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) accumulates at sites of autoimmune inflammation, including white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS), but its functional importance in pathogenesis is unclear. We have evaluated the impact of 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), an oral inhibitor of HA synthesis, on disease progression in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. Treatment with 4-MU decreases the incidence of EAE, delays its onset, and reduces the severity of established disease. 4-MU inhibits the activation of autoreactive T cells and prevents their polarization toward a Th1 phenotype. Instead, 4-MU promotes polarization toward a Th2 phenotpye and induction of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. Further, 4-MU hastens trafficking of T cells through secondary lymphoid organs, impairs the infiltration of T cells into the CNS parenchyma, and limits astrogliosis. Together, these data suggest that HA synthesis is necessary for disease progression in EAE and that treatment with 4-MU may be a potential therapeutic strategy in CNS autoimmunity. Considering that 4-MU is already a therapeutic, called hymecromone, that is approved to treat biliary spasm in humans, we propose that it could be repurposed to treat MS.

To study the safety profile and characterize the immunologic effects of high- vs low-dose cholecalciferol supplementation in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).In this double-blind, single-center randomized pilot study, 40 patients with relapsing-remitting MS were randomized to receive 10,400 IU or 800 IU cholecalciferol daily for 6 months. Assessments were performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months.Mean increase of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels from baseline to final visit was larger in the high-dose group (34.9 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] 25.0-44.7 ng/mL) than in the low-dose group (6.9 ng/mL; 95% CI 1.0-13.7 ng/mL). Adverse events were minor and did not differ between the 2 groups. Two relapses occurred, one in each treatment arm. In the high-dose group, we found a reduction in the proportion of interleukin-17(+)CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.016), CD161(+)CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.03), and effector memory CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.021) with a concomitant increase in the proportion of central memory CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.018) and naive CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.04). These effects were not observed in the low-dose group.Cholecalciferol supplementation with 10,400 IU daily is safe and tolerable in patients with MS and exhibits in vivo pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects in MS, which include reduction of interleukin-17 production by CD4(+) T cells and decreased proportion of effector memory CD4(+) T cells with concomitant increase in central memory CD4(+) T cells and naive CD4(+) T cells.This study provides Class I evidence that cholecalciferol supplementation with 10,400 IU daily is safe and well-tolerated in patients with MS and exhibits in vivo pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects. Identification of Candidate Tolerogenic CD8(+) T Cell Epitopes for Therapy of Type 1 Diabetes in the NOD Mouse Model. Yu, C., Burns, J. C., Robinson, W. H., Utz, P. J., Ho, P. P., Steinman, L., Frey, A. B. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells are the target of self-reactive B and T cells. T cells reactive with epitopes derived from insulin and/or IGRP are critical for the initiation and maintenance of disease, but T cells reactive with other islet antigens likely have an essential role in disease progression. We sought to identify candidate CD8(+) T cell epitopes that are pathogenic in type 1 diabetes. Proteins that elicit autoantibodies in human type 1 diabetes were analyzed by predictive algorithms for candidate epitopes. Using several different tolerizing regimes using synthetic peptides, two new predicted tolerogenic CD8(+) T cell epitopes were identified in the murine homolog of the major human islet autoantigen zinc transporter ZnT8 (aa 158-166 and 282-290) and one in a non- cell protein, dopamine -hydroxylase (aa 233-241). Tolerizing vaccination of NOD mice with a cDNA plasmid expressing full-length proinsulin prevented diabetes, whereas plasmids encoding ZnT8 and DH did not. However, tolerizing vaccination of NOD mice with the proinsulin plasmid in combination with plasmids expressing ZnT8 and DH decreased insulitis and enhanced prevention of disease compared to vaccination with the plasmid encoding proinsulin alone.

Tissue Transglutaminase contributes to experimental multiple sclerosis pathogenesis and clinical outcome by promoting macrophage migration van Strien, M. E., de Vries, H. E., Chrobok, N. L., Bol, J. G., Breve, J. J., van der Pol, S. M., Kooij, G., van Buul, J. D., Karpuj, M., Steinman, L., Wilhelmus, M. M., Sestito, C., Drukarch, B., Van Dam, A. Multiple sclerosis is a serious neurological disorder, resulting in e.g., sensory, motor and cognitive deficits. A critical pathological aspect of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the influx of immunomodulatory cells into the central nervous system (CNS). Identification of key players that regulate cellular trafficking into the CNS may lead to the development of more selective treatment to halt this process. The multifunctional enzyme tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) can participate in various inflammation-related processes, and is known to be expressed in the CNS. In the present study, we question whether TG2 activity contributes to the pathogenesis of experimental MS, and could be a novel therapeutic target. In human post-mortem material, we showed the appearance of TG2 immunoreactivity in leukocytes in MS lesions, and particular in macrophages in rat chronic-relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (cr-EAE), an experimental MS model. Clinical deficits as observed in mouse EAE were reduced in TG2 knock-out mice compared to littermate wild-type mice, supporting a role of TG2 in EAE pathogenesis. To establish if the enzyme TG2 represents an attractive therapeutic target, cr-EAE rats were treated with TG2 activity inhibitors during ongoing disease. Reduction of TG2 activity in cr-EAE animals dramatically attenuated clinical deficits and demyelination. The mechanism underlying these beneficial effects pointed toward a reduction in macrophage migration into the CNS due to attenuated cytoskeletal flexibility and RhoA GTPase activity. Moreover, iNOS and TNF levels were selectively reduced in the CNS of cr-EAE rats treated with a TG2 activity inhibitor, whereas other relevant inflammatory mediators were not affected in CNS or spleen by reducing TG2 activity. We conclude that modulating TG2 activity opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention in MS which does not affect peripheral levels of inflammatory mediators.

This region of EPO has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Use of a peptide sequence from this region provides the potential for an effective therapeutic without effects on erythropoiesis. The re-emergence of antigen-specific tolerance as a potential therapy for MS Ideal therapy for inflammatory disease in the nervous system would preserve normal immune function, while suppressing only the pathologic immune responses that damage tissue and allowing for repair. In principle, antigen-specific therapy would eradicate unwanted adaptive immune responses-antibody and T-cell mediated--while preserving the integrity of other adaptive responses to infectious agents and retaining the ability to fight malignancy. However, at this time, for multiple sclerosis (MS) we do not have compelling evidence that would support any particular dominant immune response to any specific antigen or even a limited group of antigens. In fact, there are adaptive immune responses to a wide swathe of proteins and lipids found on neurons and myelin in MS. Unless controlling a few of the known immune responses is sufficient, antigen-specific therapy in MS may not have enough of an impact to modulate clinical outcome. However, in other neuroinflammatory conditions, such as neuromyelitis optica, the adaptive immune response is highly focused. Trials of antigen-specific therapy for neuroinflammatory disease might first be tested in diseases with a more limited adaptive immune response like neuromyelitis optica. The likelihood of a significant success for this therapeutic strategy might then ensue.

View details for mir-181a-1/b-1 Modulates Tolerance through Opposing Activities in Selection and Peripheral T Cell Function Schaffert, S. A., Loh, C., Wang, S., Arnold, C. P., Axtell, R. C., Newell, E. W., Nolan, G., Ansel, K. M., Davis, M. M., Steinman, L., Chen, C. Understanding the consequences of tuning TCR signaling on selection, peripheral T cell function, and tolerance in the context of native TCR repertoires may provide insight into the physiological control of tolerance. In this study, we show that genetic ablation of a natural tuner of TCR signaling, mir-181a-1/b-1, in double-positive thymocytes dampened TCR and Erk signaling and increased the threshold of positive selection. Whereas mir-181a-1/b-1 deletion in mice resulted in an increase in the intrinsic reactivity of naive T cells to self-antigens, it did not cause spontaneous autoimmunity. Loss of mir-181a-1/b-1 dampened the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and reduced basal TCR signaling in peripheral T cells and their migration from lymph nodes to pathogenic sites. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tolerance can be modulated by microRNA gene products through the control of opposing activities in T cell selection and peripheral T cell function. View details for HDL-bound sphingosine-1-phosphate restrains lymphopoiesis and neuroinflammation. Blaho, V. A., Galvani, S., Engelbrecht, E., Liu, C., Swendeman, S. L., Kono, M., Proia, R. L., Steinman, L., Han, M. H., Hla, T. Lipid mediators influence immunity in myriad ways. For example, circulating sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a key regulator of lymphocyte egress. Although the majority of plasma S1P is bound to apolipoprotein M (ApoM) in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle, the immunological functions of the ApoM-S1P complex are unknown. Here we show that ApoM-S1P is dispensable for lymphocyte trafficking yet restrains lymphopoiesis by activating the S1P1 receptor on bone marrow lymphocyte progenitors. Mice that lacked ApoM (Apom(-/-)) had increased proliferation of Lin(-) Sca-1(+) cKit(+) haematopoietic progenitor cells (LSKs) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) in bone marrow. Pharmacological activation or genetic overexpression of S1P1 suppressed LSK and CLP cell proliferation in vivo. ApoM was stably associated with bone marrow CLPs, which showed active S1P1 signalling in vivo. Moreover, ApoM-bound S1P, but not albumin-bound S1P, inhibited lymphopoiesis in vitro. Upon immune stimulation, Apom(-/-) mice developed more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, characterized by increased lymphocytes in the central nervous system and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Thus, the ApoM-S1P-S1P1 signalling axis restrains the lymphocyte compartment and, subsequently, adaptive immune responses. Unique biological functions imparted by specific S1P chaperones could be exploited for novel therapeutic opportunities. Gaps in knowledge and prospects for research of adjuvanted vaccines Seder, R., Reed, S. G., O'Hagan, D., Malyala, P., D'Oro, U., Laera, D., Abrignani, S., Cerundolo, V., Steinman, L., Bertholet, S. A panel of researchers working in different areas of adjuvanted vaccines deliberated over the topic, ""Gaps in knowledge and prospects for research of adjuvanted vaccines"" at, ""Enhancing Vaccine Immunity and Value"" conference held in July 2014.

Abou-Hamdan, M., Costanza, M., Fontana, E., Di Dario, M., Musio, S., Congiu, C., Onnis, V., Lattanzi, R., Radaelli, M., Martinelli, V., Salvadori, S., Negri, L., Poliani, P. L., Farina, C., Balboni, G., Steinman, L., Pedotti, R. To investigate the potential role of prokineticin 2 (PK2), a bioactive peptide involved in multiple biological functions including immune modulation, in CNS autoimmune demyelinating disease.We investigated the expression of PK2 in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), and in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. We evaluated the biological effects of PK2 on expression of EAE and on development of T-cell response against myelin by blocking PK2 in vivo with PK2 receptor antagonists. We treated with PK2 immune cells activated against myelin antigen to explore the immune-modulating effects of this peptide in vitro.Pk2 messenger RNA was upregulated in spinal cord and lymph node cells (LNCs) of mice with EAE. PK2 protein was expressed in EAE inflammatory infiltrates and was increased in sera during EAE. In patients with relapsing-remitting MS, transcripts for PK2 were significantly increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with healthy controls, and PK2 serum concentrations were significantly higher. A PK2 receptor antagonist prevented or attenuated established EAE in chronic and relapsing-remitting models, reduced CNS inflammation and demyelination, and decreased the production of interferon (IFN)- and interleukin (IL)-17A cytokines in LNCs while increasing IL-10. PK2 in vitro increased IFN- and IL-17A and reduced IL-10 in splenocytes activated against myelin antigen.These data suggest that PK2 is a critical immune regulator in CNS autoimmune demyelination and may represent a new target for therapy.

Y., Steinman, L. Natalizumab treatment alters peripheral CD4 cells counts in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, providing a way to monitor the pharmacodynamic effects of the drug. The study was undertaken to assess whether CD4 cell counts correlate with different phases of natalizumab treatment of relapsing MS patients, including during a 12-week planned treatment interruption, and whether that might provide insights on lymphocyte trafficking. Clinical outcomes, MRI data, and CD4 cell counts were assessed at baseline prior to initiating natalizumab, while on regular dosing, at the end of the 12-week extended dosing interval, and at the time of reinitiation of natalizumab. The 12-week interruption was well tolerated and not associated with return of MS activity, disability progression, or new or worsened MRI data. Observed significant shifts in CD4 counts - dramatically increasing from the baseline while on treatment and decreasing back to the baseline level off treatment, then rising in a similar manner on natalizumab reinitiation, suggest that these measurements may aid in monitoring modulation of lymphocyte trafficking and cell redistribution. IFN- Treatment Requires B Cells for Efficacy in Neuroautoimmunity. Schubert, R. D., Hu, Y., Kumar, G., Szeto, S., Abraham, P., Winderl, J., Guthridge, J. M., Pardo, G., Dunn, J., Steinman, L., Axtell, R. C. IFN- remains the most widely prescribed treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Despite widespread use of IFN-, the therapeutic mechanism is still partially understood. Particularly, the clinical relevance of increased B cell activity during IFN- treatment is unclear. In this article, we show that IFN- pushes some B cells into a transitional, regulatory population that is a critical mechanism for therapy. IFN- treatment increases the absolute number of regulatory CD19(+)CD24(++)CD38(++) transitional B cells in peripheral blood relative to treatment-naive and Copaxone-treated patients. In addition, we found that transitional B cells from both healthy controls and IFN--treated MS patients are potent producers of IL-10, and that the capability of IFN- to induce IL-10 is amplified when B cells are stimulated. Similar changes are seen in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. IFN- treatment increases transitional and regulatory B cell populations, as well as IL-10 secretion in the spleen. Furthermore, we found that IFN- increases autoantibody production, implicating humoral immune activation in B cell regulatory responses. Finally, we demonstrate that IFN- therapy requires immune-regulatory B cells by showing that B cell-deficient mice do not benefit clinically or histopathologically from IFN- treatment. These results have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Prolactin: A versatile regulator of inflammation and autoimmune pathology Costanza, M., Binart, N., Steinman, L., Pedotti, R. Prolactin (PRL) has long been proposed as an immune-stimulating and detrimental factor in autoimmune disorders. However, recent findings have challenged this common view, showing that PRL does not play a crucial role in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, animal model for multiple sclerosis (MS), and even protects against adjuvant-induced model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this review we provide a critical overview of data supporting a role for PRL in the regulation of immune responses. In addition, we focus on studies exploring the involvement of PRL in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, MS and RA, in light of the recently-outlined regenerative properties of this hormone. View details for B-Lymphocyte-Mediated Delayed Cognitive Impairment following Stroke. Doyle, K. P., Quach, L. N., Sol, M., Axtell, R. C., Nguyen, T. V., Soler-Llavina, G. J., Jurado, S., Han, J., Steinman, L., Longo, F. M., Schneider, J. A., Malenka, R. C., Buckwalter, M. S. Each year, 10 million people worldwide survive the neurologic injury associated with a stroke. Importantly, stroke survivors have more than twice the risk of subsequently developing dementia compared with people who have never had a stroke. The link between stroke and the later development of dementia is not understood. There are reports of oligoclonal bands in the CSF of stroke patients, suggesting that in some people a B-lymphocyte response to stroke may occur in the CNS. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that a B-lymphocyte response to stroke could contribute to the onset of dementia. We discovered that, in mouse models, activated B-lymphocytes infiltrate infarcted tissue in the weeks after stroke. B-lymphocytes undergo isotype switching, and IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies are found in the neuropil adjacent to the lesion. Concurrently, mice develop delayed deficits in LTP and cognition. Genetic deficiency, and the pharmacologic ablation of B-lymphocytes using an anti-CD20 antibody, prevents the appearance of delayed cognitive deficits. Furthermore, immunostaining of human postmortem tissue revealed that a B-lymphocyte response to stroke also occurs in the brain of some people with stroke and dementia. These data suggest that some stroke patients may develop a B-lymphocyte response to stroke that contributes to dementia, and is potentially treatable with FDA-approved drugs that target B cells. View details for Role reversal: infiltrating T cells protect the brain Inflammatory conditions intensify and then resolve, often sparing and recovering some of the injured tissue. While the ebb and flow of inflammation can be followed in many tissues, there is not a great deal of information on how inflammation regresses in the brain. In this issue of the JCI, Walsh, Hendrix, and colleagues illuminate a cellular mechanism whereby T cells that infiltrate the brain after nerve crush or contusion actually protect neurons from injury. These infiltrating T cells produce IL-4 and do so independently of a classic adaptive T cell immune response. The T cells respond to mediators produced by damaged neurons, without the classic three-way interaction among antigen, the major histocompatibility complex, and the T cell receptor. After brain injury, these protective T cells produce IL-4, which attenuates damage via IL-4 receptors on neurons.

Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England) Ideal therapy for inflammatory disease in the nervous system would preserve normal immune function, while suppressing only the pathologic immune responses that damage tissue and allowing for repair. In principle, antigen-specific therapy would eradicate unwanted adaptive immune responses-antibody and T-cell mediated--while preserving the integrity of other adaptive responses to infectious agents and retaining the ability to fight malignancy. However, at this time, for multiple sclerosis (MS) we do not have compelling evidence that would support any particular dominant immune response to any specific antigen or even a limited group of antigens. In fact, there are adaptive immune responses to a wide swathe of proteins and lipids found on neurons and myelin in MS. Unless controlling a few of the known immune responses is sufficient, antigen-specific therapy in MS may not have enough of an impact to modulate clinical outcome. However, in other neuroinflammatory conditions, such as neuromyelitis optica, the adaptive immune response is highly focused. Trials of antigen-specific therapy for neuroinflammatory disease might first be tested in diseases with a more limited adaptive immune response like neuromyelitis optica. The likelihood of a significant success for this therapeutic strategy might then ensue.

View details for Self-Assembling Peptides Form Immune Suppressive Amyloid Fibrils Effective in Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis. Amyloidogenic proteins have long been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. However, amyloid fibrils composed of six amino acids are protective in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, decrease in the number of inflammatory foci in the parenchyma and meninges of the brain and spinal cord, and amelioration of the neurological signs of EAE when amyloid fibril-forming hexapeptides are administered reveal that some fibrils provide benefit. The therapeutic activity of the amyloid fibrils arise from diverse pathways that include binding of pro-inflammatory mediators in the plasma, reduction of IL-6, TNF-, and IFN- levels, and induction of type 1 interferon (IFN). Type 1 IFN has been used widely as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of MS and has been shown to be therapeutic in EAE with adoptive transfer of Th1 lymphocytes. However, type 1 IFN is known to exacerbate EAE with adoptive transfer of Th17 lymphocytes. Indeed, the amyloid fibril-forming peptide Tau 623-628 was therapeutic in Th1 adoptively transferred EAE, but ineffective in Th17 adoptively transferred EAE. However, the therapeutic effect of Tau 623-628 was restored in IFN-/ receptor (IFNAR) knockout mice, indicating that other immune pathways independent of type 1 IFN induction play a role in the amelioration of EAE. Moreover, Amylin 28-33, a polar, non-ionizable peptide that does not form fibrils as rapidly as Tau 623-628, induces a small fraction of type 1 IFN compared to Tau 623-628 and is therapeutic in Th17 EAE. The diverse immunological pathways modulated by the self-assembling hexapeptides are under investigation with a goal to develop novel, safe, and potent therapeutics for neuroinflammation. Gene expression analysis of histamine receptors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with clinically-isolated syndrome and different stages of multiple sclerosis Costanza, M., Di Dario, M., Steinman, L., Farina, C., Pedotti, R. Along with their established role in allergic reactions, histamine and its receptors have been implicated in the pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. In this study we analyzed the gene expression of histamine receptor 1 (HRH1), HRH2 and HRH4 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting (RR) MS, secondary-progressive (SP) MS, primary-progressive (PP) MS, and healthy controls (HC). We found that HRH1 transcript was significantly down-modulated in SP-MS compared with HC, and HRH4 was increased in this group compared to HC, CIS and RR-MS. No other differences in the expression of histamine receptors were observed between HC, CIS and other clinical forms of definite MS.

Their application of the animal model, known as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), for the discovery of Copaxone, opened a new path for testing of drug candidates in MS. By measuring clinical, pathologic, and immunologic outcomes, the biological implications of new drugs could be elucidated. Using EAE they established the efficacy of Copaxone as a therapy for preventing and reducing paralysis and inflammation in the central nervous system without massive immune suppression. This had a huge impact on the field of drug discovery for MS. Much like the use of parabiosis to discover soluble factors associated with obesity, or the replica plating system to probe antibiotic resistance in bacteria, the pioneering research on Copaxone using the EAE model, paved the way for the discovery of other therapeutics in MS, including Natalizumab and Fingolimod. Future applications of this approach may well elucidate novel therapies for the neurodegenerative phase of multiple sclerosis associated with disease progression. View details for Conflicting consequences of immunity to cancer versus autoimmunity to neurons: Insights from paraneoplastic disease Immunologists are well aware that cancer regression and increased patient survival with the use of checkpoint inhibitors, such as ipilimumab, an antibody directed against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, CTLA-4 (CD152), is accompanied by concomitant autoimmunity. For over 30 years, a small group of investigators have shown that the rare paraneoplastic syndromes are caused by immunity to shared antigens found on both tumors and on components of the nervous system. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, Blachre et al. [Eur. J. Immunol. 2014. 44: 3240-3251] elucidate some of the molecular mechanisms underlying the tolerance to neuronal antigens which share epitopes with oncologic antigens, observed in the context of paraneoplastic syndromes in mice. The presence of the shared tumor antigen on a nonhematopoietic cell underlies the basis for a certain level of tolerance in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, preventing these cells from attacking the brain, but allowing them to lyse the tumor upon transfer into tumor-bearing recipient mice. Comparisons between the paraneoplastic syndromes and the new autoimmune conditions seen with antibodies to immune checkpoints at CD152 or at CD279 are likely to illuminate shared mechanisms and solutions to these vexing diseases.

The most significant developments in neuroimmunology will involve explorations of the roles for the immune system in neurodegenerative conditions often associated with the presence of amyloid deposits. Here I present my personal perspectives on four of the most intriguing challenges that we face in the future of neuroimmunology: (1) Why are the traditional hallmarks of innate and adaptive inflammation conspicuously absent from brains of individuals with prion disease and amyloid pathology? (2) What is the role of adaptive and innate immunity in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis? (3) Is molecular mimicry an adequate explanation for the initiation of neuroinflammatory disease and for exacerbations in conditions like multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, and neuromyelitis optica?

M., Mausberg, A. K., Cordes, S., El-Haddad, H., Partke, H., Leussink, V. I., Roden, M., Martin, S., Steinman, L., Hartung, H., Kieseier, B. C. The NOD mouse strain spontaneously develops autoimmune diabetes. A deficiency in costimulatory molecules, such as B7-2, on the NOD genetic background prevents diabetes but instead triggers an inflammatory peripheral neuropathy. This constitutes a shift in the target of autoimmunity, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that NOD mice deficient for isoforms of ICAM-1, which comediate costimulatory functions, spontaneously develop a chronic autoimmune peripheral neuritis instead of diabetes. The disease is transferred by CD4(+) T cells, which infiltrate peripheral nerves together with macrophages and B cells and are autoreactive against peripheral myelin protein zero. These Icam1(tm1Jcgr)NOD mice exhibit unaltered numbers of regulatory T cells, but increased IL-17-producing T cells, which determine the severity, but not the target specificity, of autoimmunity. Ab-mediated ICAM-1 blockade triggers neuritis only in young NOD mice. Thymic epithelium from Icam1(tm1Jcgr)NOD mice features an altered expression of costimulatory molecules and induces neuritis and myelin autoreactivity after transplantation into nude mice in vivo. Icam1(tm1Jcgr)NOD mice exhibit a specifically altered TCR repertoire. Our findings introduce a novel animal model of chronic inflammatory neuropathies and indicate that altered expression of ICAM-1 on thymic epithelium shifts autoimmunity specifically toward peripheral nerves. This improves our understanding of autoimmunity in the peripheral nervous system with potential relevance for human diseases.

The CSF aquaporin-4 antibody levels during attacks (but not in sera) closely correlated with pleocytosis, inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 that can regulate antibody-producing plasmablasts, and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels in the CSF. The amount of aquaporin-4 antibodies present in the central nervous system may have therapeutic implications, as it is associated with astrocyte injury and inflammatory responses during NMOSD attacks.

We have been exploring the brains of multiple sclerosis patients to identify molecules that are associated with protection from inflammation and degeneration. In 2001 we noted that aB crystallin (cryab) was the most abundant transcript found in MS lesions, but not in healthy brains. Cryab can reverse paralysis and attenuate inflammation in several models of inflammation including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and various models of ischemia. Cryab is an amyloid forming molecule. We have identified a core structure common to many amyloids including amyloid protein A A4, tau, amylin, prion protein, serum amyloid protein P, and cryab. The core hexapeptide structure is highly immune suppressive and can reverse paralysis in EAE when administered systemically. Administration of this amyloid forming hexapeptide quickly lowers inflammatory cytokines in plasma like IL-6 and IL-2.

The beneficial properties of amyloid forming hexapeptides provide a potential new therapeutic direction.

Uncovering Cryptic Glycan Markers in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) Wang, D., Bhat, R., Sobel, R. A., Huang, W., Wang, L., Olsson, T., Steinman, L. Using an integrated antigen microarray approach, we observed epitope-spreading of autoantibody responses to a variety of antigenic structures in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and in the serum of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These included previously described protein- and lipid-based antigenic targets and newly discovered autoimmunogenic sugar moieties, notably, autoantibodies specific for the oligomannoses in both MS patient CSF and the sera of mice with EAE. These glycans are often masked by other sugar moieties and belong to a class of cryptic autoantigens. We further determined that these targets are highly expressed on multiple cell types in MS and EAE lesions. Co-immunization of SJL/J mice with a Man9-KLH conjugate at the time of EAE induction elicited highly significant levels of anti-Man9-cluster autoantibodies. Nevertheless, this anti-glycan autoantibody response was associated with a significantly reduced clinical severity of EAE. The potential of these cryptic glycan markers and targeting antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions of neurological disorders has yet to be explored.

View details for Development of therapies for autoimmune disease at Stanford: a tale of multiple shots and one goal The title of this contribution on Immunology at Stanford is purposely ambiguous. One goal is the development of safe and effective therapy for autoimmune diseases. Another definition of goal is to score, and this would ultimately mean the development of an approved drug. Indeed, the efforts in my four decades at Stanford, have included the discovery and subsequent development of a monoclonal antibody to block homing to the inflamed brain, leading to natalizumab, an approved therapeutic for two autoimmune diseases: relapsing-remitting MS and for inflammatory bowel disease. Multiple attempts to develop new therapies for autoimmune disease are described here: The trimolecular complex and the immune synapse serve as one major set of targets, with attempts to inhibit particular major histocompatibility molecules, the variable regions of the T cell receptor, and CD4. Other approaches focusing on antigen-specific tolerance include ongoing attempts with tolerizing DNA vaccines in type 1 diabetes. Finally, the repurposing of popular drugs approved for other indications, including statins and inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme is under development and showing promise in the clinic, particularly for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The milieu within Stanford Immunology has helped to nurture these efforts to translate discoveries in immunology and to take them from bench to bedside. View details for Narcolepsy, 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic influenza, and pandemic influenza vaccinations: What is known and unknown about the neurological disorder, the role for autoimmunity, and vaccine adjuvants Ahmed, S. S., Schur, P. H., MacDonald, N. E., Steinman, L. The vaccine safety surveillance system effectively detected a very rare adverse event, narcolepsy, in subjects receiving AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine made using the European inactivation/purification protocol. The reports of increased cases of narcolepsy in non-vaccinated subjects infected with wild A(H1N1) pandemic influenza virus suggest a role for the viral antigen(s) in disease development. However, additional investigations are needed to better understand what factor(s) in wild influenza infection trigger(s) narcolepsy in susceptible hosts. An estimated 31 million doses of European AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine were used in more than 47 countries. The Canadian AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine was used with high coverage in Canada where an estimated 12 million doses were administered. As no similar narcolepsy association has been reported to date with the AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine made using the Canadian inactivation/purification protocol, this suggests that the AS03 adjuvant alone may not be responsible for the narcolepsy association. To date, no narcolepsy association has been reported with the MF59-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine. This review article provides a brief background on narcolepsy, outlines the different types of vaccine preparations including the ones for influenza, reviews the accumulated evidence for the safety of adjuvants, and explores the association between autoimmune diseases and natural infections. It concludes by assimilating the historical observations and recent clinical studies to formulate a feasible hypothesis on why vaccine-associated narcolepsy may not be solely linked to the AS03 adjuvant but more likely be linked to how the specific influenza antigen component of the European AS03-adjuvanted pandemic vaccine was prepared. Careful and long-term epidemiological studies of subjects who developed narcolepsy in association with AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine prepared with the European inactivation/purification protocol are needed. View details for Antiviral drug ganciclovir is a potent inhibitor of microglial proliferation and neuroinflammation. Ding, Z., Mathur, V., Ho, P. P., James, M. L., Lucin, K. M., Hoehne, A., Alabsi, H., Gambhir, S. S., Steinman, L., Luo, J., Wyss-Coray, T. Aberrant microglial responses contribute to neuroinflammation in many neurodegenerative diseases, but no current therapies target pathogenic microglia. We discovered unexpectedly that the antiviral drug ganciclovir (GCV) inhibits the proliferation of microglia in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as in kainic acid-induced excitotoxicity. In EAE, GCV largely prevented infiltration of T lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS) and drastically reduced disease incidence and severity when delivered before the onset of disease. In contrast, GCV treatment had minimal effects on peripheral leukocyte distribution in EAE and did not inhibit generation of antibodies after immunization with ovalbumin. Additionally, a radiolabeled analogue of penciclovir, [(18)F]FHBG, which is similar in structure to GCV, was retained in areas of CNS inflammation in EAE, but not in naive control mice, consistent with the observed therapeutic effects. Our experiments suggest GCV may have beneficial effects in the CNS beyond its antiviral properties. Neither T-helper type 2 nor Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells are necessary for therapeutic benefit of atorvastatin in treatment of central nervous system autoimmunity Weber, M. S., Prod'homme, T., Youssef, S., Dunn, S. E., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Oral atorvastatin has prevented or reversed paralysis in the multiple sclerosis (MS) model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and reduced development of new MS lesions in clinical trials. Besides inhibiting development of encephalitogenic T cells, atorvastatin treatment of EAE has been associated with an induction of anti-inflammatory myelin-reactive T-helper type (Th)-2 cells. To investigate the clinical significance of atorvastatin-mediated Th2 differentiation, we first evaluated atorvastatin treatment in interleukin (IL)-4 green fluorescent protein-enhanced transcript (4-GET) reporter mice. Atorvastatin treatment failed to induce IL-4-producing Th2 cells in vivo; however, when T cells from atorvastatin-treated 4-GET mice were reactivated in vitro, T cells preferentially differentiated into Th2 cells, while antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (interferon gamma, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor and IL-12) were reduced. Oral atorvastatin also prevented or reversed EAE in signal transducer and activator of transcription 6-deficient (STAT6-/-) mice, which cannot generate IL-4-producing Th2 cells. Further, atorvastatin treatment did not induce or expand Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in either wild-type or STAT6-/- mice. In vivo proliferation of T cells, as measured by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine, was inhibited in atorvastatin-treated wild-type and STAT6-/- mice. These data imply that atorvastatin ameliorates central nervous system autoimmune disease primarily by inhibiting proliferation of proinflammatory encephalitogenic T cells, and not simply through induction of anti-inflammatory Th2 cells. This cytostatic effect may be a relevant mechanism of action when considering use of statins in MS and other inflammatory conditions.

J., Lazovic, J., Housman, C., Antonetti, D. A., Koeller, D. M., Connor, J. R., Steinman, L. Metabolic stroke is the rapid onset of lasting central neurological deficit associated with decompensation of an underlying metabolic disorder. Glutaric aciduria type I (GA1) is an inherited disorder of lysine and tryptophan metabolism presenting with metabolic stroke in infancy. The clinical presentation includes bilateral striatal necrosis and spontaneous subdural and retinal hemorrhages, which has been frequently misdiagnosed as non-accidental head trauma. The mechanisms underlying metabolic stroke and spontaneous hemorrhage are poorly understood.Using a mouse model of GA1, we show that metabolic stroke progresses in the opposite sequence of ischemic stroke, with initial neuronal swelling and vacuole formation leading to cerebral capillary occlusion. Focal regions of cortical followed by striatal capillaries are occluded with shunting to larger non-exchange vessels leading to early filling and dilation of deep cerebral veins. Blood-brain barrier breakdown was associated with displacement of tight-junction protein Occludin.Together the current findings illuminate the pathophysiology of metabolic stroke and vascular compromise in GA1, which may translate to other neurometabolic disorders presenting with stroke.

CRYAB modulates the activation of CD4(+) T cells from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients Que Lan Quach, Q. L., Metz, L. M., Thomas, J. C., Rothbard, J. B., Steinman, L., Ousman, S. S. BACKGROUND: Suppression of activation of pathogenic CD4(+) T cells is a potential therapeutic intervention in multiple sclerosis (MS). We previously showed that a small heat shock protein, CRYAB, reduced T cell proliferation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and clinical signs of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, a model of MS. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether the ability of CRYAB to reduce the activation of T cells translated to the human disease. METHODS: CD4(+) T cells from healthy controls and volunteers with MS were activated in vitro in the presence or absence of a CRYAB peptide (residues 73-92). Parameters of activation (proliferation rate, cytokine secretion) and tolerance (anergy, activation-induced cell death, microRNAs) were evaluated. RESULTS: The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by CD4(+) T cells was decreased in the presence of CRYAB in a subset of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) participants with mild disease severity while no changes were observed in healthy controls. Further, there was a correlation for higher levels of miR181a microRNA, a marker upregulated in tolerant CD8(+) T cells, in CD4(+) T cells of MS patients that displayed suppressed cytokine production (responders). CONCLUSION: CRYAB may be capable of suppressing the activation of CD4(+) T cells from a subset of RRMS patients who appear to have less disability but similar age and disease duration. View details for Clinical optimization of antigen specific modulation of type 1 diabetes with the plasmid DNA platform Gottlieb, P., Utz, P. J., Robinson, W., Steinman, L. Some clinical trials in humans have aimed at modulation of type 1 diabetes (T1D) via alteration of the immune response to putative islet cell antigens, particularly proinsulin and insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase and the peptide, DiaPep 277, derived from heat shock protein 60. The focus here is on development of a specially engineered DNA plasmid encoding proinsulin to treat T1D. The plasmid is engineered to turn off adaptive immunity to proinsulin. This approach yielded exciting results in a randomized placebo controlled trial in 80 adult patients with T1D. The implications of this trial are explored in regards to the potential for sparing inflammation in islets and thus allowing the functioning beta cells to recover and produce more insulin. Strategies to further strengthen the effects seen thus far with the tolerizing DNA plasmid to proinsulin will be elucidated. The DNA platform affords an opportunity for easy modifications. In addition standard exploration of dose levels, route of administration and frequency of dose are practical. Optimization of the effects seen to date on C-peptide and on depletion of proinsulin specific CD8 T cells are feasible, with expected concomitant improvement in other parameters like hemoglobin A1c and reduction in insulin usage. T1D is one of the few autoimmune conditions where antigen specific therapy can be achieved, provided the approach is tested intelligently. Tolerizing DNA vaccines to proinsulin and other islet cell autoantigens is a worthy pursuit to potentially treat, prevent and to perhaps even 'cure' or 'prevent' type 1 diabetes. View details for Serum autoantibodies to myelin peptides distinguish acute disseminated encephalomyelitis from relapsing- remitting multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England) Van Haren, K., Tomooka, B. H., Kidd, B. A., Banwell, B., Bar-Or, A., Chitnis, T., Tenembaum, S. N., Pohl, D., Rostasy, K., Dale, R. C., O'Connor, K. C., Hafler, D. A., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) share overlapping clinical, radiologic and laboratory features at onset. Because autoantibodies may contribute to the pathogenesis of both diseases, we sought to identify autoantibody biomarkers that are capable of distinguishing them. METHODS: We used custom antigen arrays to profile anti-myelin-peptide autoantibodies in sera derived from individuals with pediatric ADEM (n = 15), pediatric multiple sclerosis (Ped MS; n = 11) and adult MS (n = 15). Using isotype-specific secondary antibodies, we profiled both IgG and IgM reactivities. We used Statistical Analysis of Microarrays software to confirm the differences in autoantibody reactivity profiles between ADEM and MS samples. We used Prediction Analysis of Microarrays software to generate and validate prediction algorithms, based on the autoantibody reactivity profiles. RESULTS: ADEM was characterized by IgG autoantibodies targeting epitopes derived from myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic glycoprotein, and alpha-B-crystallin. In contrast, MS was characterized by IgM autoantibodies targeting myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic glycoprotein and oligodendrocyte-specific protein. We generated and validated prediction algorithms that distinguish ADEM serum (sensitivity 62-86%; specificity 56-79%) from MS serum (sensitivity 40-87%; specificity 62-86%) on the basis of combined IgG and IgM anti-myelin autoantibody reactivity to a small number of myelin peptides. CONCLUSIONS: Combined profiles of serum IgG and IgM autoantibodies identified myelin antigens that may be useful for distinguishing MS from ADEM. Further studies are required to establish clinical utility. Further biological assays are required to delineate the pathogenic potential of these antibodies.

The Interdependent, Overlapping, and Differential Roles of Type I and II IFNs in the Pathogenesis of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis Naves, R., Singh, S. P., Cashman, K. S., Rowse, A. L., Axtell, R. C., Steinman, L., Mountz, J. D., Steele, C., De Sarno, P., Raman, C. Type I IFNs (IFN- and IFN-) and type II IFN (IFN-) mediate both regulation and inflammation in multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the underlying mechanism for these Janus-like activities of type I and II IFNs in neuroinflammation remains unclear. Although endogenous type I IFN signaling provides a protective response in neuroinflammation, we find that when IFN- signaling is ablated, type I IFNs drive inflammation, resulting in exacerbated EAE. IFN- has a disease stage-specific opposing function in EAE. Treatment of mice with IFN- during the initiation phase of EAE leads to enhanced severity of disease. In contrast, IFN- treatment during the effector phase attenuated disease. This immunosuppressive activity of IFN- required functional type I IFN signaling. In IFN-/ receptor-deficient mice, IFN- treatment during effector phase of EAE exacerbated disease. Using an adoptive transfer EAE model, we found that T cell-intrinsic type I and II IFN signals are simultaneously required to establish chronic EAE by encephalitogenic Th1 cells. However, in Th17 cells loss of either IFN signals leads to the development of a severe chronic disease. The data imply that type I and II IFN signals have independent but nonredundant roles in restraining encephalitogenic Th17 cells in vivo. Collectively, our data show that type I and II IFNs function in an integrated manner to regulate pathogenesis in EAE.

IMPORTANCE High serum levels of interleukin 17F (IL-17F) at baseline have been associated with suboptimal response to interferon beta in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. OBJECTIVE To further investigate the role of IL-17F in predicting treatment response to interferon beta-1b in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis using the Singulex Erenna IL-17F immunoassay. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Serum samples were analyzed from 239 randomly selected patients treated with interferon beta-1b, 250 g, for at least 2 years in the Betaferon Efficacy Yielding Outcomes of a New Dose Study. EXPOSURE Treatment with interferon beta-1b, 250 g, for at least 2 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Levels of IL-17F at baseline and month 6 as well as the difference between the IL-17F levels at month 6 and baseline were compared between the following: (1) patients with less disease activity vs more disease activity; (2) patients with no disease activity vs some disease activity; and (3) responders vs nonresponders. RESULTS Levels of IL-17F measured at baseline and month 6 did not correlate with lack of response to treatment after 2 years using clinical and magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Relapses and new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging were not associated with pretreatment serum IL-17F levels. When patients with neutralizing antibodies were excluded, the results did not change. All patients with levels of IL-17F greater than 200 pg/mL were associated with poor response with some clinical or radiological activity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE An increase of IL-17F before and early after treatment with interferon beta-1b was not associated with poor response. These data do not support the value of IL-17F as a treatment response indicator for therapy of patients with multiple sclerosis with interferon beta, although high levels of IL-17F greater than 200 pg/mL may predict nonresponsiveness. View details for Th17 cells induce Th1-polarizing monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Davidson, M. G., Alonso, M. N., Yuan, R., Axtell, R. C., Kenkel, J. A., Suhoski, M. M., Gonzlez, J. C., Steinman, L., Engleman, E. G. In chronically inflamed tissues, such as those affected by autoimmune disease, activated Th cells often colocalize with monocytes. We investigate in this study how murine Th cells influence the phenotype and function of monocytes. The data demonstrate that Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets promote the differentiation of autologous monocytes into MHC class II(+), CD11b(+), CD11c(+) DC that we call DCTh. Although all Th subsets induce the formation of DCTh, activated Th17 cells uniquely promote the formation of IL-12/IL-23-producing DCTh (DCTh17) that can polarize both naive and Th17 cells to a Th1 phenotype. In the inflamed CNS of mice with Th17-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, Th cells colocalize with DC, as well as monocytes, and the Th cells obtained from these lesions drive the formation of DCTh that are phenotypically indistinguishable from DCTh17 and polarize naive T cells toward a Th1 phenotype. These results suggest that DCTh17 are critical in the interplay of Th17- and Th1-mediated responses and may explain the previous finding that IL-17-secreting Th cells become IFN--secreting Th1 cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and other autoimmune disorders.

A., Chow, L. M., Ibrahim, A., Baker, S. J., Barres, B. A., Steinman, L., Brunet, A. Oligodendrocytes-the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system-can be regenerated during adulthood. In adults, new oligodendrocytes originate from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), but also from neural stem cells (NSCs). Although several factors supporting oligodendrocyte production have been characterized, the mechanisms underlying the generation of adult oligodendrocytes are largely unknown. Here we show that genetic inactivation of SIRT1, a protein deacetylase implicated in energy metabolism, increases the production of new OPCs in the adult mouse brain, in part by acting in NSCs. New OPCs produced following SIRT1 inactivation differentiate normally, generating fully myelinating oligodendrocytes. Remarkably, SIRT1 inactivation ameliorates remyelination and delays paralysis in mouse models of demyelinating injuries. SIRT1 inactivation leads to the upregulation of genes involved in cell metabolism and growth factor signalling, in particular PDGF receptor (PDGFR). Oligodendrocyte expansion following SIRT1 inactivation is mediated at least in part by AKT and p38 MAPK-signalling molecules downstream of PDGFR. The identification of drug-targetable enzymes that regulate oligodendrocyte regeneration in adults could facilitate the development of therapies for demyelinating injuries and diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. The gender gap in multiple sclerosis: intersection of science and society. Type I Interferons: Beneficial in Th1 and Detrimental in Th17 Autoimmunity In relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), type I interferon (IFN) is considered immuno-modulatory, and recombinant forms of IFN- are the most prescribed treatment for this disease. However, within the RRMS population, 30-50% of MS patients are nonresponsive to this treatment, and it consistently worsens neuromyelitis optica (NMO), a disease once considered to be a form of RRMS. In contrast to RRMS, type I IFNs have been shown to have properties that drive the inflammatory pathologies in many other autoimmune diseases. These diseases include Sjgren's syndrome, system lupus erythematosus (SLE), neuromyelitis optica (NMO), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis. Historically, autoimmune diseases were thought to be driven by a TH1 response to auto-antigens. However, since the discovery of the TH17 in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), it is now generally thought that TH17 plays an important role in MS and all other autoimmune diseases. In this article, we will discuss recent clinical and basic research advances in the field of autoimmunity and argue that IFN- and other type I IFNs are immuno-modulatory in diseases driven predominantly by TH1 but in contrast are inflammatory in diseases that have a predominant Th17 response.

A recent type 1 diabetes (T1D) clinical trial of rituximab (a B cell-depleting anti-CD20 antibody) achieved some therapeutic benefit in preserving C-peptide for a period of approximately nine months in patients with recently diagnosed diabetes. Our previous data in the NOD mouse demonstrated that co-administration of antigen (insulin) with anti-CD3 antibody (a T cell-directed immunomodulator) offers better protection than either entity alone, indicating that novel combination therapies that include a T1D-related autoantigen are possible. To accelerate the identification and development of novel combination therapies that can be advanced into the clinic, we have evaluated the combination of a mouse anti-CD20 antibody with either oral insulin or a proinsulin-expressing DNA vaccine. Anti-CD20 alone, given once or on 4 consecutive days, produced transient B cell depletion but did not prevent or reverse T1D in the NOD mouse. Oral insulin alone (twice weekly for 6 weeks) was also ineffective, while proinsulin DNA (weekly for up to 12 weeks) showed a trend toward modest efficacy. Combination of anti-CD20 with oral insulin was ineffective in reversing diabetes in NOD mice whose glycemia was controlled with SC insulin pellets; these experiments were performed in three independent labs. Combination of anti-CD20 with proinsulin DNA was also ineffective in diabetes reversal, but did show modest efficacy in diabetes prevention (p = 0.04). In the prevention studies, anti-CD20 plus proinsulin resulted in modest increases in Tregs in pancreatic lymph nodes and elevated levels of proinsulin-specific CD4+ T-cells that produced IL-4. Thus, combination therapy with anti-CD20 and either oral insulin or proinsulin does not protect hyperglycemic NOD mice, but the combination with proinsulin offers limited efficacy in T1D prevention, potentially by augmentation of proinsulin-specific IL-4 production.

Natalizumab was granted approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2004, only 12 years after its molecular target was cloned. Shortly after initial approval, natalizumab use was suspended pending a safety review when several natalizumab recipients were diagnosed as having progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. After the safety review, natalizumab was reintroduced to the market in 2006. Since then, more than 92,000 patients have been treated with the drug. Risk stratification algorithms and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy management strategies have been developed, which facilitate more personalized decision making and safer natalizumab use. This review article summarizes the evolution of natalizumab from target molecule discovery through regulatory approval, voluntary suspension, reapproval, and clinical use. The natalizumab story highlights both the opportunities and risks inherent in a novel biological therapy for a progressive neurologic disease.

There is a significant unmet need for serum biomarkers in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) that are predictive of therapeutic response to disease-modifying therapies. Following a recent Stanford study which reported that pretreatment levels of serum interleukin (IL)-17F could predict poor response to interferon- (IFN) therapy, we sought to validate the finding using samples from a large clinical trial.The validation cohort included 54 good responders (GR) and 64 poor responders (PR) selected from 762 subjects with RRMS from the IM IFN-1a dose comparison study (Avonex study C94-805). Subjects were classified as GR and PR based on the number of relapses, Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and new and enlarging T2 lesions on MRI. Serum samples were assayed for IL-17F using a multiplexed Luminex assay and for IL-17F/F using an ELISA. Replicate aliquots from the Stanford study were also assayed to assure reproducibility of methods.Median pretreatment and post-treatment serum IL-17F levels were not statistically significantly different between GR and PR, and serum IL-7/IL-17F ratios were also not predictive of response status. Replicate aliquots from the Stanford study showed good correlation to their original cohort (r = 0.77).We were unable to validate the finding that serum IL-17F is a predictor of PR in a large independent cohort of subjects with RRMS. Differences in patient populations and methodology might explain the failure to validate the results from the Stanford study.

Not only are the linguistic concepts expressed in the words ""synapse"" and ""memory"" shared between the fields, but the actual molecules of physiologic importance in one system play parallel roles in the other: complement, the major histocompatibility molecules, and even ""neuro""-transmitters all have major impacts on health and on disease in both the brain and the immune system. Not only are the same molecules found in diverse roles in each system, but we have learned that there is real ""hard-wired"" crosstalk between nerves and lymphoid organs. This issue of the JCI highlights some of the lessons learned from experts who are working at this scintillating intersection between immunology and neuroscience.

Historically, small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) have been extensively studied in the context of being intracellular molecular chaperones. However, recent studies looking at the role of sHSPs in neurological diseases have demonstrated a near universal upregulation of certain sHSPs in damaged and diseased brains. Initially, it was thought that sHSPs are pathological in these disease states because they are found in the areas of damage. However, transgenic overexpression and exogenous administration of sHSPs in various experimental disease paradigms have shown just the contrary - that sHSPs are protective, not pathological. This review examines sHSPs in neurological diseases and highlights the potential for using these neuroprotective sHSPs as novel therapeutics. It first addresses the endogenous expression of sHSPs in a variety of neurological disorders. Although many studies have examined the expression of sHSPs in neurological diseases, there are no review articles summarizing these data. Furthermore, it focuses on recent studies that have investigated the therapeutic potential of sHSPs for neurological diseases.

A., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system characterized by neuroinflammation and demyelination. Although considered a T cell-mediated disease, multiple sclerosis involves the activation of both adaptive and innate immune cells, as well as resident cells of the central nervous system, which synergize in inducing inflammation and thereby demyelination. Differentiation, survival, and inflammatory functions of innate immune cells and of astrocytes of the central nervous system are regulated by tyrosine kinases. Here, we show that imatinib, sorafenib, and GW2580-small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors-can each prevent the development of disease and treat established disease in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. In vitro, imatinib and sorafenib inhibited astrocyte proliferation mediated by the tyrosine kinase platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), whereas GW2580 and sorafenib inhibited macrophage tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production mediated by the tyrosine kinases c-Fms and PDGFR, respectively. In vivo, amelioration of disease by GW2580 was associated with a reduction in the proportion of macrophages and T cells in the CNS infiltrate, as well as a reduction in the levels of circulating TNF. Our findings suggest that GW2580 and the FDA-approved drugs imatinib and sorafenib have potential as novel therapeutics for the treatment of autoimmune demyelinating disease.

Interleukin-17 (IL-17), which is predominantly produced by T helper 17 cells distinct from T helper 1 or T helper 2 cells, participates in the pathogenesis of infectious, autoimmune, and allergic disorders. However, the precise role in allograft rejection remains uncertain. In the present study, we investigated the role of IL-17 in acute allograft rejection using IL-17-deficient mice.Donor hearts from FVB mice were heterotopically transplanted into either C57BL/6J-IL-17-deficient (IL-17(-/-)) or -wild-type mice. Allograft survival was significantly prolonged in IL-17(-/-) recipient mice due to reduced local inflammation accompanied by decreased inflammatory cell recruitment and cytokine/chemokine expression. IL-17(-/-) recipient mice exhibited decreased IL-6 production and reciprocally enhanced regulatory T cell expansion, suggesting a contribution of regulatory T cells to prolonged allograft survival. Indeed, allografts transplanted into anti-CD25 mAb-treated IL-17(-/-) recipient mice (regulatory T cell-depleted) developed acute rejection similar to wild-type recipient mice. Surprisingly, we found that gamma delta T cells rather than CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were key IL-17 producers in the allografts. In support, equivalent allograft rejection was observed in Rag-2(-/-) recipient mice engrafted with either wild-type or IL-17(-/-) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Finally, hearts transplanted into gamma delta T cell-deficient mice resulted in decreased allograft rejection compared with wild-type controls.During heart transplantation, (1) IL-17 is crucial for acceleration of acute rejection; (2) IL-17-deficiency enhances regulatory T cell expansion; and (3) gamma delta T cells rather than CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are a potential source of IL-17. IL-17 neutralization may provide a potential target for novel therapeutic treatment for cardiac allograft rejection.

L., Liu, H., Rohowsky-Kochan, C., Ichiyama, K., Yoshimura, A., Steinman, L., Christakos, S., Youssef, S. A new class of inflammatory CD4(+) T cells that produce interleukin-17 (IL-17) (termed Th17) has been identified, which plays a critical role in numerous inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], has a direct repressive effect on the expression of IL-17A in both human and mouse T cells. In vivo treatment of mice with ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a mouse model of multiple sclerosis) diminishes paralysis and progression of the disease and reduces IL-17A-secreting CD4(+) T cells in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS). The mechanism of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) repression of IL-17A expression was found to be transcriptional repression, mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Transcription assays, gel shifting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicate that the negative effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on IL-17A involves blocking of nuclear factor for activated T cells (NFAT), recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC), sequestration of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)/VDR, and a direct effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on induction of Foxp3. Our results describe novel mechanisms and new concepts with regard to vitamin D and the immune system and suggest therapeutic targets for the control of autoimmune diseases.

The interleukin-7 receptor chain (IL-7R) gene was identified as a top non-major histocompatibility complex-linked risk locus for multiple sclerosis (MS). Recently, we showed that a T helper 1 (T(H)1)-driven, but not a T(H)17-driven, form of MS exhibited a good clinical response to interferon- (IFN-) therapy. We now demonstrate that high serum levels of IL-7, particularly when paired with low levels of IL-17F, predict responsiveness to IFN- and hence a T(H)1-driven subtype of MS. We also show that although IL-7 signaling is neither necessary nor sufficient for the induction or expansion of T(H)17 cells, IL-7 can greatly enhance both human and mouse T(H)1 cell differentiation. IL-7 alone is sufficient to induce human T(H)1 differentiation in the absence of IL-12 or other cytokines. Furthermore, targeting IL-7/IL-7R is beneficial in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. Mice treated with IL-7R-blocking antibodies before or after onset of paralysis exhibited reduced clinical signs of EAE, with reduction in peripheral nave and activated T cells, whereas central memory T, regulatory T, B, and natural killer cell populations were largely spared. IL-7R antibody treatment markedly reduced lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system in mice with EAE. Thus, a serum profile of high IL-7 may signify a T(H)1-driven form of MS and may predict outcome in MS patients undergoing IFN- therapy. Blockade of IL-7 and the IL-7R pathway may have therapeutic potential in MS and other autoimmune diseases.

H., Chung, J., Itoh, S., Rothbard, J., Yang, P. C., Steinman, L., Robbins, R. C., Fischbein, M. P. This study investigates the protective effect of exogenous B-crystallin (CryAB) on myocardial function after ischemia-reperfusion injury.Mice underwent temporary left anterior descending artery occlusion for 30 minutes. Either CryAB (50 g) or phosphate-buffered saline (100 L [n=6, each group]) were injected in the intramyocardial medial and lateral perinfarct zone 15 minutes before reperfusion. Intraperitoneal injections were administered every other day. Left ventricular ejection fraction was evaluated on postoperative day 40 with magnetic resonance imaging. To investigate the effect of CryAB on apoptosis after hypoxia/reoxygenation in vitro, murine atrial cardiomyocytes (HL-1 cells) or human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were incubated with either 50 g CryAB (500 g /10 mL) or phosphate-buffered saline in a hypoxia chamber for 6, 12, and 24 hours, followed by 30 minutes of reoxygenation at room air. Apoptosis was then assessed by western blot (Bcl-2, free bax, cleaved caspases-3, 9, PARP) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses (cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments and caspase-3 activity).On postoperative day 40, CryAB-treated mice had a 1.8-fold increase in left ventricular ejection fraction versus control mice (27%6% versus 15%4% SD, p<0.005). In vitro, (1) the HL-1 cells showed no significant difference in apoptotic protein expression, cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments, or caspase-3 activity; (2) the HMEC-1 cells had increased but not significant apoptotic protein expression with, however, a significant decrease in cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (1.5-fold, p<0.01) and caspase-3 activity (2.7-fold, p<0.005).Exogenous CryAB administration significantly improves cardiac function after ischemia-reperfusion injury, in vivo. The protective anti-apoptotic affects of CryAB may target the endothelial cell.

Total serum 25(OH)D levels were measured using the DiaSorin Liaison Assay during the third trimester and 2, 4, and 6 months after giving birth. The data were analyzed using longitudinal multivariable methods.Levels of 25(OH)D and relapse rate.Fourteen (50%) women breastfed exclusively, and 12 women (43%) relapsed within 6 months after giving birth. During pregnancy, the average 25(OH)D levels were 25.4 ng/mL (range, 13.7-42.6) and were affected only by season (P=.009). In contrast, in the postpartum period, 25(OH)D levels were significantly affected by breastfeeding and relapse status. Levels of 25(OH)D remained low in the exclusive breastfeeding group, yet rose significantly in the nonexclusive breastfeeding group regardless of season (P=.007, unadjusted; P=.02, adjusted for season). By 4 and 6 months after childbirth, 25(OH)D levels were, on average, 5 ng/mL lower in the women who breastfed exclusively compared with the nonbreastfeeding group (P=.001).Pregnancy and exclusive breastfeeding are strongly associated with low 25(OH)D levels in women with MS. However, these lower vitamin D levels were not associated with an increased risk of postpartum MS relapses. These data suggest that low vitamin D in isolation is not an important risk factor for postpartum MS relapses. View details for Common variants in P2RY11 are associated with narcolepsy Kornum, B.

Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that narcolepsy with cataplexy is an autoimmune disease. We here report genome-wide association analyses for narcolepsy with replication and fine mapping across three ethnic groups (3,406 individuals of European ancestry, 2,414 Asians and 302 African Americans). We identify a SNP in the 3' untranslated region of P2RY11, the purinergic receptor subtype P2Y gene, which is associated with narcolepsy (rs2305795, combined P = 6.1 10, odds ratio = 1.28, 95% CI 1.19-1.39, n = 5689). The disease-associated allele is correlated with reduced expression of P2RY11 in CD8(+) T lymphocytes (339% reduced, P = 0.003) and natural killer (NK) cells (P = 0.031), but not in other peripheral blood mononuclear cell types. The low expression variant is also associated with reduced P2RY11-mediated resistance to ATP-induced cell death in T lymphocytes (P = 0.0007) and natural killer cells (P = 0.001). These results identify P2RY11 as an important regulator of immune-cell survival, with possible implications in narcolepsy and other autoimmune diseases.

N., Srinagesh, H., Axtell, R., Zhang, H., Platten, M., Wyss-Coray, T., Steinman, L. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a key hormonal system regulating blood pressure. However, expression of RAAS components has recently been detected in immune cells, and the RAAS has been implicated in several mouse models of autoimmune disease. Here, we have identified Ang II as a paracrine mediator, sustaining inflammation in the CNS in the EAE mouse model of MS via TGF-beta. Ang II type 1 receptors (AT1Rs) were found to be primarily expressed in CNS-resident cells during EAE. In vitro, astrocytes and microglia responded to Ang II treatment by inducing TGF-beta expression via a pathway involving the TGF-beta-activating protease thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). TGF-beta upregulation in astrocytes and microglia during EAE was blocked with candesartan (CA), an inhibitor of AT1R. Treatment of EAE with CA ameliorated paralysis and blunted lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS, outcomes that were also seen with genetic ablation of AT1Ra and treatment with an inhibitor of TSP-1. These data suggest that AT1R antagonists, frequently prescribed as antihypertensives, may be useful to interrupt this proinflammatory, CNS-specific pathway in individuals with MS.

M., Bsibsi, M., Gerritsen, W. H., van der Valk, P., Bajramovic, J. J., Steinman, L., Amor, S. We present the first comparative analysis of serum immunoglobulin G reactivity profiles against the full spectrum of human myelin-associated proteins in multiple sclerosis patients and healthy control subjects. In both groups, serum antibodies display a consistent and prominent reaction to alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) versus other myelin proteins. As an apparently major target for the adaptive immune system in humans, CRYAB selectively accumulates in oligodendrocytes, but not in astrocytes, or axons in so-called preactive multiple sclerosis lesions. These are clusters of activated HLA-DR-expressing microglia in myelinated normal-appearing white matter with no obvious leukocyte infiltration. They are found in most multiple sclerosis patients at all stages of disease. In these lesion areas, CRYAB in oligodendrocytes may come directly in contact with activated HLA-DR+ microglia. We demonstrate that CRYAB activates innate responses by microglia by stimulating the secretion of leukocyte-recruiting factors, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 17, CCL5, and CCL1, and immune-regulatory cytokines such as interleukin 10, transforming growth factor-beta, and interleukin 13. Together, these data suggest that CRYAB accumulation in preactive lesions may be part of a reversible reparative local response that involves both oligodendrocytes and microglia. At the same time, however, accumulated CRYAB may represent a major target for adaptive immune responses that could contribute to progression of preactive lesions to a stage of demyelination.

Although interleukin-17 (IL-17) has been reported to participate in the pathogenesis of infectious, autoimmune and allergic disorders, the precise role in allograft rejection remains uncertain. This study illustrates that IL-17 contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic allograft rejection.Utilizing a murine heterotopic heart transplant model system, IL-17-deficient recipient mice had decreased allograft inflammatory cell recruitment, decreased IL-6, MCP-1, and KC production, and reduced graft coronary artery disease (GCAD). Intragraft gamma delta (gammadelta) T cells appear to be the predominant source of IL-17 production.Therefore, IL-17 neutralization may provide a potential target for novel therapeutic treatment for cardiac allograft rejection.

P., Steinman, L., Utz, P. J., Ho, P. P. Activation of the innate immune system by DNA containing hypomethylated CpG motifs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here, we examined the consequences of immunostimulatory CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) and inhibitory GpG-ODN treatment in the NZB x NZW F1 (NZB/W) murine model of SLE. Beginning at 5 months of age, we administered CpG-ODN or GpG-ODN at regular intervals to female NZB/W animals. We also determined the effects of ODN administration on NZB/W mouse lymphocyte function, and the specificity of ODN binding to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) other than TLR-9. While CpG-ODN treatment did not appear to have a major impact on disease severity, GpG-ODN treatment significantly delayed the onset of proteinuria in NZB/W mice. Interestingly, short-term GpG-ODN treatment promoted Th2-type T and B cell responses, and inhibited B lymphocyte proliferation in vitro. On the other hand, extended GpG-ODN treatment did not result in sustained Th2 responses or significantly reduced renal disease. Moreover, the binding of CpG-ODN and GpG-ODN was not restricted to TLR-9 as both ODNs also interacted with TLR-3, TLR-7, and TLR-8. Taken together, the data indicate that the protective mechanism of GpG-ODN treatment in the NZB/W model of lupus nephritis involves modulating T cell cytokine profiles and B lymphocyte activation through the inhibition of several TLRs, including TLR-7 and TLR-9.

Intervention We prospectively followed up the pregnant women with MS and the age-matched, pregnant controls; conducted structured interviews; and collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells during each trimester and 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months post partum.Sixteen functional cell types, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)- and tumor necrosis factor-producing T-cell subsets, were measured using multicolor flow cytometry. Since these cell types may also fluctuate with pregnancy, lactational amenorrhea, or MS treatment, the data were analyzed taking into account these factors.Fifteen women with MS (58%) had relapses during the postpartum year. CD4(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells fluctuated with MS relapses, declining during pregnancy in women with MS (P < .001) and continuing to decline after parturition in women with relapses (P = .001), yet rising or remaining stable in women with nonrelapsing MS or healthy pregnant women. Lactational amenorrhea was associated with a rise in CD4(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells in women with MS (P = .009). In contrast, CD4(+) tumor necrosis factor-producing cells decreased during lactational amenorrhea in all groups of women and, once this was taken into account, obscured any relationship to MS relapses. CD8(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells were elevated in women with MS throughout the study (P < .001) but did not fluctuate with relapses.Our findings suggest that a decline in circulating CD4(+)IFN-gamma-producing cells leads to postpartum MS relapses. Our findings also suggest that the decline in these cells may begin during late pregnancy and that lactational amenorrhea induced by exclusive breastfeeding may be able to interrupt this process.

Little is known about the acute hospitalization costs and characteristics. We examined the trends in MS hospitalizations from 1993 to 2006.The Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project was searched using the ICD-9 code 340 (MS). Diagnostic, treatment and administrative data were analyzed using basic statistical software.A total of 288,454 hospital admissions with the primary diagnosis of MS occurred between 1993 and 2006, an average of 20,604 admissions annually. The percentage admitted from the emergency department (ED) increased from 19.4 to 60.0% during 1993-2006. The mean cost for each inpatient increased from USD 7,965 to 20,076. The percentage of discharges to home health care increased from 8.6 to 14.9%, and the percentage of discharges to nursing homes and rehabilitation services increased from 8.3 to 22.6%. In 2006, Medicaid patients were significantly more likely to be admitted from the ED (p < 0.001). Medicare payers were significantly more likely to be discharged to a nursing home/rehabilitation (p < 0.0001).National health insurance policies have made measurable effects on MS disease management. MS is becoming more expensive to treat acutely, and improved treatment modalities geared toward decreasing acute flare-ups may provide substantial cost savings by reducing ED visits, inpatient hospitalizations and the need for rehabilitation.

To determine whether autoimmunity against fibrinogen can mediate inflammatory arthritis, we immunized a variety of common mouse strains with fibrinogen and found that DBA/1 and SJL mice developed an inflammatory and erosive arthritis. Mice with fibrinogen-induced arthritis (FIA) possess fibrinogen-reactive T cells that produce the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma. FIA can be adoptively transferred with either plasma or fibrinogen-specific T cells from diseased mice. Mice with FIA possess rheumatoid factor, circulating immune complexes, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide Abs, all of which are characteristic of human RA. These observations demonstrate that fibrinogen is arthritogenic in mice and that the pathogenesis of FIA is mediated by both autoantibodies and fibrinogen-reactive T cells. Mixed results with modulation of T-H-17 cells in human autoimmune diseases The outcomes of clinical trials provide the most convincing data to clarify the role of particular cytokines in the pathogenesis of human diseases. The immunology community, for a variety of practical reasons, spends most of its research time and funds on studies in model systems, mainly mice. In this perspective I discuss results of clinical trials assessing the effect of blocking the differentiation and/or function of interleukin-17-producing CD4(+) T cells on human autoimmune disease, and devote more limited attention to corroborating preclinical studies from animal models. Thus far, these outcomes in human trials have been mixed, with notable success in psoriasis and Crohn's disease but a negative result in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

V., Youssef, S., Sun, A., Xiong, A., Prugpichailers, T., Veeravagu, A., Hou, L. C., Steinman, L., Tse, V. Statins are thought to have tumorolytic properties, reducing angiogenesis by inhibiting pro-angiogenic factors and inducing apoptosis of mural pericytes within the tumor vascular tree.An orthotopic mouse glioblastoma (GL-26) model was used to investigate the effect of simvastatin on glioblastoma vasculature in vivo. GL-26 cells were implanted into the striatum of C5LKa mice treated with either control, low- or high-dose simvastatin. Brains were analyzed for necrotic volume, apoptosis, morphology and pericytic cells within the vascular tree.Low-dose simvastatin increased necrosis and apoptosis compared to both control and high-dose simvastatin groups. High-dose simvastatin increased vessel caliber by reducing pericytic cells along the tumor vessel wall compared to both control and low-dose simvastatin groups.Simvastatin has a dual effect on tumorigenesis. At high doses, it may worsen instead of 'normalizing' tumor angio-architecture, albeit low doses affect tumor cell survival by promoting necrosis and apoptosis.

R., Goh, Y. P., Eagle, A. R., Dunn, S. E., Awakuni, J. U., Nguyen, K. D., Steinman, L., Michie, S. A., Chawla, A. Macrophages rapidly engulf apoptotic cells to limit the release of noxious cellular contents and to restrict autoimmune responses against self antigens. Although factors participating in recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells have been identified, the transcriptional basis for the sensing and the silent disposal of apoptotic cells is unknown. Here we show that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR-delta) is induced when macrophages engulf apoptotic cells and functions as a transcriptional sensor of dying cells. Genetic deletion of PPAR-delta decreases expression of opsonins such as complement component-1qb (C1qb), resulting in impairment of apoptotic cell clearance and reduction in anti-inflammatory cytokine production. This increases autoantibody production and predisposes global and macrophage-specific Ppard(-/-) mice to autoimmune kidney disease, a phenotype resembling the human disease systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, PPAR-delta has a pivotal role in orchestrating the timely disposal of apoptotic cells by macrophages, ensuring that tolerance to self is maintained. Shifting therapeutic attention in MS to osteopontin, type 1 and type 2 IFN It is widely debated whether MS is mediated solely by Th1, or solely by Th17, whether it might be mediated by both pathways, or perhaps by neither pathway. We must integrate the following four facts: first, MS lesions have a signature of IL-6-, IL-17-, osteopontin- and IFN-driven transcriptional activity. Second, MS is worsened with administration of IFN-gamma, the quintessential type 2 IFN and Th1 cytokine. Third, blockade of TNF-alpha worsened MS in clinical trials. Fourth, inhibiting the main driver of Th17, IL-23, failed to modulate relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Against this backdrop, standing outside the framework of the Th1 and Th17 pathways are the type 1 IFN, notably IFN-beta, the most widely used approved therapy for RRMS. A paper in this issue of the European Journal of Immunology demonstrates that IFN-beta suppresses production in CD4(+) T cells of both osteopontin and IL-17. In this commentary, the roles of these two molecules, i.e. osteopontin and IL-17, are discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of MS. Osteopontin may be more important than Th1 or Th17 in the pathogenesis of RRMS. Trials targeting this small integrin-binding protein ought to be pursued in RRMS.

J., Pedotti, R. Induction of T helper 1 (Th1) to Th2 deviation through administration of self- or altered self-peptides holds promise for treatment of autoimmunity. However, administration of self-peptides in models of autoimmunity can result in anaphylactic reactions. Although both IgE and IgG1 antibodies might be involved in the development of anaphylaxis to myelin peptides in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice, the effector cells and molecules involved are not fully understood. Here we show that systemic anaphylaxis to the self-antigen myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55 can occur in mice lacking mast cells (Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) mice) or histamine (histidine decarboxylase-deficient mice), but is prevented in mice lacking IL-4. Treatment of mice with CV6209, a platelet-activating factor antagonist, slightly reduced the incidence of anaphylaxis to self-MOG35-55 in this model, but more effectively protected mice against anaphylaxis to this peptide when self-MOG35-55 was administered in a different immunization protocol that omitted the use of Bordetella pertussis toxin as an adjuvant at the time of immunization. Thus, anaphylactic reactions to self-MOG can occur in the absence of mast cells or histamine, key elements of the classical IgE-, mast cell-, and histamine-dependent pathway of anaphylaxis. View details for Enhanced Immune Recognition of Cryptic Glycan Markers in Human Tumors Newsom-Davis, T. E., Wang, D., Steinman, L., Chen, P. F., Wang, L., Simon, A. K., Screaton, G. R. Abnormal glycosylation is one of the hallmarks of the cancer cell and is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. The development of tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen (TACA) vaccines has been problematic due to poor immunogenicity. However, when appropriate targets can be identified, passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against TACAs has been shown to have antitumor activity. Fas ligand (FasL) is a transmembrane protein that induces apoptosis in cells expressing its receptor, Fas. When grafted into mice, FasL-expressing tumor cells break immunologic tolerance to self-antigens and induce antibody-mediated tumor immunity. Here, five IgM mAbs were produced from mice vaccinated with FasL-expressing B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. They recognize various syngeneic and allogeneic murine tumor cell lines. One mAb, TM10, recognizes a range of human tumor cell lines, including melanoma, prostate, and ovarian cancer. It does not bind to untransformed cells. The epitopes recognized by all the mAbs were carbohydrates expressed on proteins. Using carbohydrate microarrays, the antigenic targets of TM10 were found to be high-mannose core structures of N-linked glycans. In normal cells, high-mannose clusters are hidden by extensive saccharide branching but they become exposed in cancer cells as a result of abnormal glycosylation pathways. Vaccination with FasL-expressing tumors therefore enables the immune system to break tolerance to self-antigens, allowing identification of novel TACAs that can form the basis of future humoral anticancer therapy.

W., Wang, P., Kattah, M. G., Youssef, S., Steinman, L., DeFea, K., Straus, D. S. The IL-23/IL-17 pathway plays an important role in chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. In inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal epithelial cells are an important source of chemokines that recruit inflammatory cells. We examined the effect of IL-17 on chemokine expression of HT-29 colonic epithelial cells. IL-17 strongly repressed TNF-alpha-stimulated expression of CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCL5, but synergized with TNF-alpha for induction of CXCL8, CXCL1, and CCL20 mRNAs. For CXCL10, IL-17 strongly inhibited promoter activity but had no effect on mRNA stability. In contrast, for CXCL8, IL-17 slightly decreased promoter activity but stabilized its normally unstable mRNA, leading to a net increase in steady-state mRNA abundance. IL-17 synergized with TNF-alpha in transactivating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and in activating ERK and p38 MAPK. The p38 and ERK pathway inhibitors SB203580 and U0126 reversed the repressive effect of IL-17 on CXCL10 mRNA abundance and promoter activity and also reversed the inductive effect of IL-17 on CXCL8 mRNA, indicating that MAPK signaling mediates both the transcriptional repression of CXCL10 and the stabilization of CXCL8 mRNA by IL-17. The EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 partially reversed the effects of IL-17 on CXCL8 and CXCL10 mRNA, demonstrating a role for EGFR in downstream IL-17 signaling. The overall results indicate a positive effect of IL-17 on chemokines that recruit neutrophils (CXCL8 and CXCL1), and Th17 cells (CCL20). In contrast, IL-17 represses expression of CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCR5, three chemokines that selectively recruit Th1 but not other effector T cells.

M., Baumgarth, N., Chien, Y. gammadelta T cells uniquely contribute to host immune defense, but how this is accomplished remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the nonclassical major histocompatibility complex class I T10 and T22-specific gammadelta T cells in mice and found that encountering antigen in the thymus was neither required nor inhibitory for their development. But when triggered through the T cell receptor, ligand-naive lymphoid-gammadelta T cells produced IL-17, whereas ligand-experienced cells made IFN-gamma. Immediately after immunization, a large fraction of IL-17(+) gammadelta T cells were found in the draining lymph nodes days before the appearance of antigen-specific IL-17(+) *beta T cells. Thus, thymic selection determines the effector fate of gammadelta T cells rather than constrains their antigen specificities. The swift IL-17 response mounted by antigen-naive gammadelta T cells suggests a critical role for these cells at the onset of an acute inflammatory response to novel antigens.

Inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase enzyme (statins) are cholesterol-lowering drugs that have shown promise as therapeutic agents in various animal models of autoimmune disease. The results of initial clinical trials with statins in multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis have also been encouraging. In this study, we attempted to treat a widely studied murine model of spontaneous systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with atorvastatin.(NZB x NZW)F1 (NZB/NZW) mice received daily oral doses of atorvastatin for 20 weeks. The mice were monitored weekly for survival and proteinuria. Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels in sera were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). T lymphocyte cytokine production in vitro, as well as cytokine levels in vivo, were measured by ELISA. T cell proliferation was assessed by thymidine incorporation assay. Serum cholesterol levels were determined using a standard fluorometric assay. Kidney tissue was harvested and evaluated for pathologic changes.In NZB/NZW mice, oral atorvastatin had significant effects on T cell proliferation and cytokine production in vitro. Atorvastatin also induced significant increases in serum levels of interleukin-4. However, atorvastatin treatment in NZB/NZW mice had no significant impact on proteinuria, survival, serum anti-dsDNA antibody and cholesterol levels, or extent of renal disease.Monotherapy with oral atorvastatin has no protective effects in a murine model of spontaneous SLE. The efficacy of atorvastatin in human SLE remains to be determined.

Y., Steinman, L., Rossi, F. M., Blau, H. M. Transplanted bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) have been reported to fuse with cells of diverse tissues, but the extremely low frequency of fusion has led to the view that such events are biologically insignificant. Nonetheless, in mice with a lethal recessive liver disease (tyrosinaemia), transplantation of wild-type BMDCs restored liver function by cell fusion and prevented death, indicating that cell fusion can have beneficial effects. Here we report that chronic inflammation resulting from severe dermatitis or autoimmune encephalitis leads to robust fusion of BMDCs with Purkinje neurons and formation of hundreds of binucleate heterokaryons per cerebellum, a 10-100-fold higher frequency than previously reported. Single haematopoietic stem-cell transplants showed that the fusogenic cell is from the haematopoietic lineage and parabiosis experiments revealed that fusion can occur without irradiation. Transplantation of rat bone marrow into mice led to activation of dormant rat Purkinje neuron-specific genes in BMDC nuclei after fusion with mouse Purkinje neurons, consistent with nuclear reprogramming. The precise neurological role of these heterokaryons awaits elucidation, but their frequency in brain after inflammation is clearly much higher than previously appreciated. View details for CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells specific for a thymus-expressed antigen prevent the development of anaphylaxis to self Scabeni, S., Lapilla, M., Musio, S., Gallo, B., Ciusani, E., Steinman, L., Mantegazza, R., Pedotti, R. A role for CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the control of allergic diseases has been postulated. We developed a mouse model in which anaphylaxis is induced in SJL mice by immunization and challenge with the fragment of self myelin proteolipid protein (PLP)(139-151), that is not expressed in the thymus, but not with fragment 178-191 of the same protein, that is expressed in the thymus. In this study, we show that resistance to anaphylaxis is associated with naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs specific for the self peptide expressed in the thymus. These cells increase Foxp3 expression upon Ag stimulation and suppress peptide-induced proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-) effector T cells. Depletion of Tregs with anti-CD25 in vivo significantly diminished resistance to anaphylaxis to PLP(178-191), suggesting an important role for CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs in preventing the development of allergic responses to this thymus-expressed peptide. These data indicate that naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs specific for a peptide expressed under physiological conditions in the thymus are able to suppress the development of a systemic allergic reaction to self. View details for Bioluminescence in vivo imaging of autoimmune encephalomyelitis predicts disease Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is a widely used animal model to understand not only multiple sclerosis but also basic principles of immunity. The disease is scored typically by observing signs of paralysis, which do not always correspond with pathological changes.Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was induced in transgenic mice expressing an injury responsive luciferase reporter in astrocytes (GFAP-luc). Bioluminescence in the brain and spinal cord was measured non-invasively in living mice. Mice were sacrificed at different time points to evaluate clinical and pathological changes. The correlation between bioluminescence and clinical and pathological EAE was statistically analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis.Bioluminescence from the brain and spinal cord correlates strongly with severity of clinical disease and a number of pathological changes in the brain in EAE. Bioluminescence at early time points also predicts severity of disease.These results highlight the potential use of bioluminescence imaging to monitor neuroinflammation for rapid drug screening and immunological studies in EAE and suggest that similar approaches could be applied to other animal models of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.

L., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies have a diagnostic role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, little is known about their origins and contribution to pathogenesis. Citrullination is the post-translational conversion of arginine to citrulline by peptidyl arginine deiminase, and increased citrullination of proteins is observed in the joint tissue in RA and in brain tissue in multiple sclerosis (MS).We applied synovial and myelin protein arrays to examine epitope spreading of B cell responses to citrullinated epitopes in both the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model for RA and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model for MS. Synovial and myelin protein arrays contain a spectrum of proteins and peptides, including native and citrullinated forms, representing candidate autoantigens in RA and MS, respectively. We applied these arrays to characterise the specificity of autoantibodies in serial serum samples derived from mice with acute and chronic stages of CIA and EAE.In samples from pre-disease CIA and acute-disease EAE, we observed autoantibody targeting of the immunising antigen and responses to a limited set of citrullinated epitopes. Over the course of diseases, the autoantibody responses expanded to target multiple citrullinated epitopes in both CIA and EAE. Using immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified citrullination of multiple polypeptides in CIA joint and EAE brain tissue that have not previously been described as citrullinated.Our results suggest that anti-citrulline antibody responses develop in the early stages of CIA and EAE, and that autoimmune inflammation results in citrullination of joint proteins in CIA and brain proteins in EAE, thereby creating neoantigens that become additional targets in epitope spreading of autoimmune responses.

View details for Preemptive HMG-CoA reductase inhibition provides graft-versus-host disease protection by Th-2 polarization while sparing graft-versus-leukemia activity Zeiser, R., Youssef, S., Baker, J., Kambham, N., Steinman, L., Negrin, R. S. We investigated whether atorvastatin (AT) was capable of protecting animals from acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) across major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mismatch barriers. AT treatment of the donor induced a Th-2 cytokine profile in the adoptively transferred T cells and reduced their in vivo expansion, which translated into significantly reduced aGVHD lethality. Host treatment down-regulated costimulatory molecules and MHC class II expression on recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and enhanced the protective statin effect, without impacting graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity. The AT effect was partially reversed in STAT6(-/-) donors and abrogated by L-mevalonate, indicating the relevance of STAT6 signaling and the L-mevalonate pathway for AT-mediated aGVHD protection. AT reduced prenylation levels of GTPases, abolished T-bet expression, and increased c-MAF and GATA-3 protein in vivo. Thus, AT has significant protective impact on aGVHD lethality by Th-2 polarization and inhibition of an uncontrolled Th-1 response while maintaining GVL activity, which is of great clinical relevance given the modest toxicity profile of AT. Glia-dependent TGF-beta signaling, acting independently of the TH17 pathway, is critical for initiation of murine autoimmune encephalomyelitis Luo, J., Ho, P. P., Buckwalter, M. S., Hsu, T., Lee, L. Y., Zhang, H., Kim, D., Kim, S., Gambhir, S. S., Steinman, L., Wyss-Coray, T. Autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model for multiple sclerosis, is characterized by the activation of immune cells, demyelination of axons in the CNS, and paralysis. We found that TGF-beta1 synthesis in glial cells and TGF-beta-induced signaling in the CNS were activated several days before the onset of paralysis in mice with autoimmune encephalomyelitis. While early production of TGF-beta1 was observed in glial cells TGF-beta signaling was activated in neurons and later in infiltrating T cells in inflammatory lesions. Systemic treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling ameliorated the paralytic disease and reduced the accumulation of pathogenic T cells and expression of IL-6 in the CNS. Priming of peripheral T cells was not altered, nor was the generation of TH17 cells, indicating that this effect was directed within the brain, yet affected the immune system. These results suggest that early production of TGF-beta1 in the CNS creates a permissive and dangerous environment for the initiation of autoimmune inflammation, providing a rare example of the brain modulating the immune system. Importantly, inhibition of TGF-beta signaling may have benefits in the treatment of the acute phase of autoimmune CNS inflammation. Recent evidence points to tryptophan (Trp) degradation as a potent immunosuppressive mechanism involved in the maintenance of immunological tolerance. Both Trp depletion and downstream Trp catabolites (TCs) appear to synergistically confer protection against excessive inflammation. In this review, we give an overview of the immunosuppressive properties of Trp degradation with special focus on TCs. Constitutive and inducible Trp degradation in different cell types and tissues of human and murine origin is summarized. We address the influence of Trp degradation on different aspects of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Possible therapeutic approaches for autoimmune disorders targeting Trp degradation are presented, and key issues relevant for the development of such therapeutic strategies are discussed. View details for Nanosensor detection of an immunoregulatory tryptophan influx/kynurenine efflux cycle Kaper, T., Looger, L. L., Takanaga, H., Platten, M., Steinman, L., Frommer, W. B. Mammalian cells rely on cellular uptake of the essential amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan sequestration by up-regulation of the key enzyme for tryptophan degradation, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), e.g., in cancer and inflammation, is thought to suppress the immune response via T cell starvation. Additionally, the excreted tryptophan catabolites (kynurenines) induce apoptosis of lymphocytes. Whereas tryptophan transport systems have been identified, the molecular nature of kynurenine export remains unknown. To measure cytosolic tryptophan steady-state levels and flux in real time, we developed genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer nanosensors (FLIPW). The transport properties detected by FLIPW in KB cells, a human oral cancer cell line, and COS-7 cells implicate LAT1, a transporter that is present in proliferative tissues like cancer, in tryptophan uptake. Importantly, we found that this transport system mediates tryptophan/kynurenine exchange. The tryptophan influx/kynurenine efflux cycle couples tryptophan starvation to elevation of kynurenine serum levels, providing a two-pronged induction of apoptosis in neighboring cells. The strict coupling protects cells that overproduce IDO from kynurenine accumulation. Consequently, this mechanism may contribute to immunosuppression involved in autoimmunity and tumor immune escape. View details for Inhibition of HMGcoA reductase by atorvastatin prevents and reverses MYC-induced lymphomagenesis Shachaf, C. M., Perez, O. D., Youssef, S., Fan, A. C., Elchuri, S., Goldstein, M. J., Shirer, A. E., Sharpe, O., Chen, J., Mitchell, D. J., Chang, M., Nolan, G. P., Steinman, L., Felsher, D. W. Statins are a class of drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMGcoA) reductase, a critical enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Several reports document that statins may prevent different human cancers. However, whether or not statins can prevent cancer is controversial due to discordant results. One possible explanation for these conflicting conclusions is that only some tumors or specific statins may be effective. Here, we demonstrate in an in vivo transgenic model in which atorvastatin reverses and prevents the onset of MYC-induced lymphomagenesis, but fails to reverse or prevent tumorigenesis in the presence of constitutively activated K-Ras (G12D). Using phosphoprotein fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, atorvastatin treatment was found to result in the inactivation of the Ras and ERK1/2 signaling pathways associated with the dephosphorylation and inactivation of MYC. Correspondingly, tumors with a constitutively activated K-Ras (G12D) did not exhibit dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and MYC. Atorvastatin's effects on MYC were specific to the inhibition of HMGcoA reductase, as treatment with mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase activity, abrogated these effects and inhibited the ability of atorvastatin to reverse or suppress tumorigenesis. Also, RNAi directed at HMGcoA reductase was sufficient to abrogate the neoplastic properties of MYC-induced tumors. Thus, atorvastatin, by inhibiting HMGcoA reductase, induces changes in phosphoprotein signaling that in turn prevent MYC-induced lymphomagenesis. Antigen-specific therapy of multiple sclerosis: The long-sought magic bullet The adaptive immune response in multiple sclerosis (MS) targets various myelin proteins and even some inducible heat shock proteins. A few attempts have been made to tolerize relapsing-remitting patients with MS to either full-length myelin basic protein or to a key peptide epitope between residues 83-99. These trials have demonstrated that this approach may potentially provide benefit to patients with relapsing- remitting MS. However, manipulation of responses to myelin proteins can have deleterious effects. The immune response to myelin components is positioned at a key tipping point in the pathophysiology of the disease. Clarification of the key target antigens in MS, and better understanding of practical methods to attain tolerance to a wide variety of myelin and neuronal molecules will provide the basis for the ultimately successful antigen specific therapy. View details for Statins-treatment option for central nervous system autoimmune disease? Statins, inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, are well-established agents to lower cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular morbidity. Independent of their lipid-lowering properties, statins have been shown to exert pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects in various animal models of human autoimmune disease. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a murine model for multiple sclerosis, statins prevented disease onset and even reversed paralysis when treatment was initiated after experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was fully established. Furthermore, well-tolerated oral statins were recently shown to exert synergistic benefit in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in combination with existing agents for multiple sclerosis therapy. Based primarily on these encouraging results, statins are now being tested in clinical trials as a monotherapy for multiple sclerosis, as well as in combination with approved disease-modifying therapies.

C., Stuve, O., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Treatment with glatiramer acetate (GA, copolymer-1, Copaxone), a drug approved for multiple sclerosis (MS), in a mouse model promoted development of anti-inflammatory type II monocytes, characterized by increased secretion of interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and decreased production of IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). This anti-inflammatory cytokine shift was associated with reduced STAT-1 signaling. Type II monocytes directed differentiation of T(H)2 cells and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (T(reg)) independent of antigen specificity. Type II monocyte-induced regulatory T cells specific for a foreign antigen ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), indicating that neither GA specificity nor recognition of self-antigen was required for their therapeutic effect. Adoptive transfer of type II monocytes reversed EAE, suppressed T(H)17 cell development and promoted both T(H)2 differentiation and expansion of T(reg) cells in recipient mice. This demonstration of adoptive immunotherapy by type II monocytes identifies a central role for these cells in T cell immune modulation of autoimmunity.

P., Idrissova, Z., Viglietta, V., Rostasy, K., Pohl, D., Dale, R. C., Freedman, M., Steinman, L., Kuchroo, V. K., Hafler, D. A., Wucherpfennig, K. W. The role of autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating diseases is controversial, in part because widely used western blotting and ELISA methods either do not permit the detection of conformation-sensitive antibodies or do not distinguish them from conformation-independent antibodies. We developed a sensitive assay based on self-assembling radiolabeled tetramers that allows discrimination of antibodies against folded or denatured myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) by selective unfolding of the antigen domain. The tetramer radioimmunoassay (RIA) was more sensitive for MOG autoantibody detection than other methodologies, including monomer-based RIA, ELISA or fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS). Autoantibodies from individuals with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) selectively bound the folded MOG tetramer, whereas sera from mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis induced with MOG peptide immunoprecipitated only the unfolded tetramer. MOG-specific autoantibodies were identified in a subset of ADEM but only rarely in adult-onset MS cases, indicating that MOG is a more prominent target antigen in ADEM than MS.

A., Steinman, L., Soares, M. P. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1, encoded by HMOX1) dampens inflammatory reactions via the catabolism of heme into CO, Fe, and biliverdin. We report that expression of HO-1 dictates the pathologic outcome of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Induction of EAE in Hmox1(-/- )C57BL/6 mice led to enhanced CNS demyelination, paralysis, and mortality, as compared with Hmox1(+/+) mice. Induction of HO-1 by cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX) administration after EAE onset reversed paralysis in C57BL/6 and SJL/J mice and disease relapse in SJL/J mice. These effects were not observed using zinc protoporphyrin IX, which does not induce HO-1. CoPPIX protection was abrogated in Hmox1(-/-) C57BL/6 mice, indicating that CoPPIX acts via HO-1 to suppress EAE progression. The protective effect of HO-1 was associated with inhibition of MHC class II expression by APCs and inhibition of Th and CD8 T cell accumulation, proliferation, and effector function within the CNS. Exogenous CO mimicked these effects, suggesting that CO contributes to the protective action of HO-1. In conclusion, HO-1 or exposure to its end product CO counters autoimmune neuroinflammation and thus might be used therapeutically to treat MS.

Current therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune diseases non-specifically suppress immune function, and there is great need for fundamental approaches such as antigen-specific tolerizing therapy. In this paper we describe development of antigen-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines to treat collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice, and use of protein microarrays to monitor response to therapy and to identify potential additional autoimmune targets for next generation vaccines. We demonstrate that tolerizing DNA vaccines encoding type II collagen (CII) reduced the incidence and severity of CIA. Atorvastatin, a statin drug found to reduce the severity of autoimmunity, potentiated the effect of DNA vaccines encoding CII. Analysis of cytokines produced by collagen-reactive T cells derived from mice receiving tolerizing DNA encoding CII, as compared to control vaccines, revealed reduced production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Arthritis microarray analysis demonstrated reduced spreading of autoantibody responses in mice treated with DNA encoding CII. The development of tolerizing DNA vaccines, and the use of antibody profiling to guide design of and to monitor therapeutic responses to such vaccines, represents a promising approach for the treatment of RA and other autoimmune diseases. Type IIHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (Statins) provide acute-graft-versus-host disease protection by Th-2 cytokine induction while sparing graft-versus-leukemia activity. 48th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Hematology Zeiser, R., Youssef, S., Baker, J., Steinman, L., Negrin, R.

P., Tomooka, B. H., Thomas, F. M., Song, J. J., Goodman, S. B., Lee, D. M., Genovese, M. C., Utz, P. J., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Tyrosine kinases play a central role in the activation of signal transduction pathways and cellular responses that mediate the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Imatinib mesylate (imatinib) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed to treat Bcr/Abl-expressing leukemias and subsequently found to treat c-Kit-expressing gastrointestinal stromal tumors. We demonstrate that imatinib potently prevents and treats murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). We further show that micromolar concentrations of imatinib abrogate multiple signal transduction pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis, including mast cell c-Kit signaling and TNF-alpha release, macrophage c-Fms activation and cytokine production, and fibroblast PDGFR signaling and proliferation. In our studies, imatinib attenuated PDGFR signaling in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) and TNF-alpha production in synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMCs) derived from human RA patients. Imatinib-mediated inhibition of a spectrum of signal transduction pathways and the downstream pathogenic cellular responses may provide a powerful approach to treat RA and other inflammatory diseases.

S., Youssef, S., Dunn, S. E., Prod'homme, T., Neuhaus, O., Stuve, O., Greenwood, J., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, are widely prescribed for their cholesterol-lowering properties to reduce atherogenesis and cardiovascular morbidity. Over recent years, statins have also been shown to exert pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects that might be of therapeutic benefit in autoimmune disorders. The primary mechanism by which statins alter immune function appears to be mediated through the inhibition of post-translational protein prenylation of small GTP-binding proteins and is largely independent of lipid-lowering. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), statins prevent or reverse paralysis and were recently shown to exert synergistic benefit when combined with agents approved for MS therapy. Based primarily upon the beneficial effects in EAE, statins are now being tested in patients in MS clinical trials.

Four easy pieces: interconnections between tissue injury, intermediary metabolism, autoimmunity, and chronic degeneration. Four questions are posed: (1) Can tissue damage itself provoke autoimmunity? (2) Can genetic mutations of key structures produce tissue pathology and thus provoke autoimmunity? (3) Can acute immune damage produce tissue degeneration without further hallmarks of an immune response? (4) Can intermediary metabolism modulate immune damage to tissues? Four answers are given: (1) Tissue injury itself may lead to autoimmunity. Both innate and adaptive immunity may arise as a response to tissue injury, and the immune attack can further damage tissue. (2) Genetic mutations can lead to an immune response indistinguishable from autoimmunity, exemplified from Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. (3) Chronic immune damage may lead to tissue degeneration, with or without further hallmarks of an immune response. Variations on this theme, including inverse scenarios, are also possible: Inborn errors of metabolism may lead to tissue damage that may provoke an adaptive and or innate immune response. The immune response might further damage tissue. (4) Finally, perturbations of intermediary metabolism may modulate the immune response, controlling the extent of immune-mediated damage. Examples are taken from perturbations in the cholesterol pathway that influence the characteristics of the immune response, and with tryptophan metabolites that modulate autoimmunity and graft rejection. Inflammatory, degenerative, and autoimmune neurological disease will be discussed in terms of their implications for pathogenic mechanisms underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. How to successfully apply animal studies in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis to research on multiple sclerosis In their Point of View entitled ""Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis: A Misleading Model of Multiple Sclerosis,"" Sriram and Steiner(1) wrote, ""The most disappointing aspect of EAE [experimental allergic encephalomyelitis] as a potential model for MS is its almost total inability to point toward a meaningful therapy or therapeutic approach for MS."" Actually, EAE has led directly to the development of three therapies approved for use in multiple sclerosis (MS): glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, and natalizumab. Several new approaches to MS are in clinical trials based on positive indications in preclinical work relying on EAE. New clues to the pathogenesis of MS and new potential surrogate markers for MS are shown from research involving EAE when it is critically coupled with actual findings in MS. There are pitfalls in overreliance on the EAE model, or on any animal model for any human disease. Nevertheless, over the past 73 years, the EAE model has proved itself remarkably useful for aiding research on MS. View details for Nogo in multiple sclerosis: Growing roles of a growth inhibitor Symposium on Cognitive Decline in Multiple Sclerosis In recent years, knowledge about the physiological functions of the Nogo-A protein has grown considerably, and this molecule has evolved from being one of the most important axonal regrowth inhibitors present in central nervous system (CNS) myelin, to several other potentially important roles in different areas such as nervous system development, epilepsy, vascular physiology, muscle pathology and CNS tumors. Therapeutically, targeting the Nogo-A protein by means of the immune response has been tried in an attempt to block neurite growth inhibition and promote regeneration in spinal cord injury models; the immune response to Nogo-A, however, has not been extensively studied. We propose to review recent evidence that Nogo-A may also play an important role in autoimmune demyelinating diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis, including that Nogo-66 derived epitopes are encephalitogenic antigens in susceptible mouse strains, and that the immune response to Nogo-66 antigens includes both strong T cell and B cell activation, with epitope spreading of the antibody response to other myelin molecules. In CNS immunotherapy, careful targeting of neural self-antigens is a prerequisite in order to avoid unexpected deleterious effects, and increasing knowledge about the immune response to Nogo-A may provide a safe basis for the development of relevant therapeutic alternatives for several neurological conditions. View details for Emerging therapeutic targets in multiple sclerosis The aim of this review is to describe the recent findings regarding the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and their translation to new therapies.Basic research is providing new insights into the immune elements involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, both in the periphery as well as in the central nervous system. Unveiling the complex interplay of the molecules involved in the immunological cascade of the disease supplies new targets for the development of new immunotherapeutic strategies. Similarly, clinical studies and identification of distinct subgroups of patients based on their responsiveness to immunotherapies provides support for the existence of immunopathological disease subtypes that seem to require different therapeutic approaches. These studies extend the theoretical basis that facilitates development of neuroprotective and repair-promoting therapeutic strategies.The application of novel and cutting-edge technologies in the fields of genomics and proteomics is providing a better understanding of the genetic and environmental factors involved in multiple sclerosis susceptibility and progression, as well as the detection of biomarkers for disease activity and response to therapy. Implementation of these facilitates identification of new targets for therapy towards tailoring treatment to the individual patient with multiple sclerosis. View details for Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and multiple sclerosis: Lessons from natalizumab Three patients have developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy while being treated with natalizumab for their autoimmune diseases. One patient had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), one had Crohn's disease, and one (who had been enrolled in an RRMS phase III trial) had no evidence of multiple sclerosis on autopsy. The patient with RRMS now has severe, permanent neurologic damage and the other two patients died. In this article, we recommend revised entry and diagnostic criteria to prevent enrollment of RRMS patients with a favorable prognosis or questionable diagnosis into trials of drugs with unknown safety profiles. In light of the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, we strongly recommend that RRMS patients who are at low risk of disability not be treated with natalizumab. Finally, we discuss what additional natalizumab efficacy data need to be presented before any decisions should be made about treating RRMS patients with a high risk of developing long-term disability.

View details for Statin therapy and autoimmune disease: from protein prenylation to immunomodulation Statins have been prescribed extensively for their cholesterol-lowering properties and efficacy in cardiovascular disease. However, compelling evidence now exists that statins also have extensive immunomodulatory properties that operate independently of lipid lowering. Consequently, much attention has been directed towards their potential as therapeutic agents for the treatment of autoimmune disease. Modulation of post-translational protein prenylation seems to be a key mechanism by which statins alter immune function. In this Review, the effect of statin therapy on immune function, and how this relates to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, is reviewed alongside current opinion of what the key biological targets of statins are. View details for A neuropeptide in immune-mediated inflammation, Y? Prod'homme, T., Weber, M. S., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Disturbances in crosstalk between the immune system and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) can contribute to the pathogenesis of Th1-mediated autoimmunity. Recent studies indicate that neuropeptide Y (NPY) has a major role in the regulation of Th1 responses. The precise role of NPY has been an enigma, but a recent study provides a breakthrough, demonstrating that NPY has a bimodal role as a negative regulator of T cells and an activator of antigen-presenting cell function.

C., Hemmer, B., Prod'homme, T., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. One approach to improving efficacy in MS therapy is to identify medications that provide additive or synergistic benefit in combination. Orally administered cholesterol-lowering HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (known as statins), which exhibit immunomodulatory properties and are effective in treatment of the MS model EAE, are being tested in MS. As atorvastatin can enhance protective Th2 responses and has a different mechanism of action than glatiramer acetate (GA), a parenterally administered immunomodulatory agent approved for MS treatment, we tested whether the combination of these agents could be beneficial in EAE. Combination therapy using suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and GA prevented or reversed clinical and histologic EAE. Secretion of proinflammatory Th1 cytokines was reduced--and conversely Th2 cytokine secretion was increased--in these mice, but not in mice treated with each drug alone at the same doses. Monocytes treated with the combination of suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and GA secreted an antiinflammatory type II cytokine pattern and, when used as APCs, promoted Th2 differentiation of naive myelin-specific T cells. Our results demonstrate that agents with different mechanisms of immune modulation can combine in a synergistic manner for the treatment of CNS autoimmunity and provide rationale for testing the combination of atorvastatin and GA in MS.

L., Matarese, G., Ohtsu, H., GALLI, S. J., Mantegazza, R., Steinman, L., Pedotti, R. Histamine can modulate the cytokine network and influence Th1 and Th2 balance and Ab-isotype switching. Thus, pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of specific histamine receptors has been shown to reduce the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a prototypic Th1-mediated disease with similarities to human multiple sclerosis. To study the comprehensive contribution of endogenous histamine to the expression of EAE, we attempted to induce EAE in histidine decarboxylase-deficient mice, which are genetically unable to make histamine. In this study, we show that EAE is significantly more severe in HDC-/-, histamine-deficient mice, with diffuse inflammatory infiltrates, including a prevalent granulocytic component, in the brain and cerebellum. Unlike splenocytes from wild-type mice, splenocytes from HDC-/- mice do not produce histamine in response to the myelin Ag, whereas production of IFN-gamma, TNF, and leptin are increased in HDC-/- splenocytes in comparison to those from wild-type mice. Endogenous histamine thus appears to regulate importantly the autoimmune response against myelin and the expression of EAE, in this model, and to limit immune damage to the CNS. Understanding which receptor(s) for histamine is/are involved in regulating autoimmunity against the CNS might help in the development of new strategies of treatment for EAE and multiple sclerosis.

H., Steinman, L. Targeting pathogenic T cells with Ag-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines encoding autoantigens is a powerful and feasible therapeutic strategy for Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. However, plasmid DNA contains abundant unmethylated CpG motifs, which induce a strong Th1 immune response. We describe here a novel approach to counteract this undesired side effect of plasmid DNA used for vaccination in Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. In chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), combining a myelin cocktail plus IL-4-tolerizing DNA vaccine with a suppressive GpG oligodeoxynucleotide (GpG-ODN) induced a shift of the autoreactive T cell response toward a protective Th2 cytokine pattern. Myelin microarrays demonstrate that tolerizing DNA vaccination plus GpG-ODN further decreased anti-myelin autoantibody epitope spreading and shifted the autoreactive B cell response to a protective IgG1 isotype. Moreover, the addition of GpG-ODN to tolerizing DNA vaccination therapy effectively reduced overall mean disease severity in both the chronic relapsing EAE and chronic progressive EAE mouse models. In conclusion, suppressive GpG-ODN effectively counteracted the undesired CpG-induced inflammatory effect of a tolerizing DNA vaccine in a Th1-mediated autoimmune disease by skewing both the autoaggressive T cell and B cell responses toward a protective Th2 phenotype. These results demonstrate that suppressive GpG-ODN is a simple and highly effective novel therapeutic adjuvant that will boost the efficacy of Ag-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines used for treating Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. Virtues and pitfalls of EAE for the development of therapies for multiple sclerosis Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a useful model for aiding the development of new treatments for MS. All therapies approved for MS ameliorate EAE. Two approved medications, glatiramer acetate and Natalizumab, were developed directly from studies in EAE. Several trials are ongoing in MS after success in EAE, including altered peptide ligands of myelin, DNA vaccines and statins. However, EAE has failed to predict the outcome of certain approaches. The reasons underlying such failures are discussed here.

In the management of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), providers are all faced with the highly formidable challenge of ascertaining whether, and to what degree, disease-modifying therapy is effective in the individual patient. While much has been learned in randomized, controlled clinical trials, we cannot simply extrapolate the outcomes of these initiatives and apply them to the care of a single patient. In the future, the application of pharmacogenetic techniques, proteomics, and microarray analysis will yield novel profiling information on individual patients that will substantially refine the specific therapeutic questions of relevance: (1) What is the best treatment for an individual patient? (2) Which patients require intensive therapeutic combination regimens to optimize control of the disease process? (3) What are the appropriate drug dosing targets for an individual patient? and (4) Which patients will be predisposed to the development of drug-related adverse events? Such data may provide a novel variable of drug responsiveness that will mandate its inclusion into the process of covariate analyses for clinical trials. View details for Antigen-specific therapies in multiple sclerosis: Going beyond proteins and peptides Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex immune-mediated disease resulting largely from an autoimmune attack against components of central nervous system myelin, including several proteins and lipids. Knowledge about the details of this anomalous immune response has come mostly from studies in the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this model, it has been possible to prevent and effectively treat established disease through several antigen-specific therapeutic strategies, which have included administration of whole myelin or myelin proteins by various routes, random copolymers consisting of the main major histocompatability complex (MHC) and T-cell receptor (TCR) contact amino acid residues, altered peptide ligands of dominant myelin epitopes in which one or more residues are selectively substituted, and lately DNA vaccination encoding self-myelin antigens. However, there have been difficulties in making successful transitions from animal models to human clinical trials, due either to lack of efficacy or unforeseen complications. Despite these problems, antigen-specific therapies have retained their attraction for clinicians and scientists alike, and hopefully the upcoming generation of agents--including altered peptide ligands and DNA vaccines--will benefit from the increasing knowledge about this disease and surmount existing difficulties to make an impact in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

Major advancements have been achieved in our ability to diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS) and to commence treatment intervention with agents that can favorably affect the disease course. Although MS exacerbations and the emergence of disability constitute the more conspicuous aspects of the disease process, evidence has confirmed that most of the disease occurs on a constitutive and occult basis. Disease-modifying therapies appear to be modest in the magnitude of their treatment effects, particularly in the progressive stage of the disease. Therapeutic strategies currently used for MS primarily target the inflammatory cascade. Several potential mechanisms appear to be involved in the progression of MS. Characterizing these mechanisms will result in a better understanding of the various forms of the disorder and how to effectively treat its clinical manifestations. It is our objective within this 2-part series on progression in MS to offer both evidence-based observations and hypothesis-driven expert perspectives on what constitutes the cause of progression in MS. We have chosen areas of inquiry that appear to have been most productive in helping us to better conceptualize the landscape of what MS looks like pathologically, immunologically, neuroscientifically, radiographically, and genetically. We have attempted to advance hypotheses focused on a deeper understanding of what contributes to the progression of this illness and to illustrate new technical capabilities that are catalyzing novel research initiatives targeted at achieving a more complete understanding of progression in MS.

Nogo-66, the extracellular 66 aa loop of the Nogo-A protein found in CNS myelin, interacts with the Nogo receptor and has been proposed to mediate inhibition of axonal regrowth. It has been shown that immunization with Nogo-A promotes recovery in animal models of spinal cord injury through induction of Ab production. In this report, studies were performed to characterize the immune response to Nogo-66 and to determine the role of Nogo in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Immunization of EAE-susceptible mouse strains with peptides derived from Nogo-66 induced a CNS immune response with clinical and pathological similarities to EAE. The Nogo-66 peptides elicited strong T cell responses that were not cross-reactive to other encephalitogenic myelin Ags. Using a large scale spotted microarray containing proteins and peptides derived from a wide spectrum of myelin components, we demonstrated that Nogo-66 peptides also generated a specific Ab response that spreads to several other encephalitogenic myelin Ags following immunization. Nogo-66-specific T cell lines ameliorated established EAE, via Nogo-66-specific Th2 cells that entered the CNS. These results indicate that some T cell and B cell immune responses to Nogo-66 are associated with suppression of ongoing EAE, whereas other Nogo-66 epitopes can be encephalitogenic. The multifaceted role of transglutaminase in neurodegeneration: Review article 8th International Congress on Amino Acids and Proteins A critical role for transglutaminase [TGase] has been hypothesized in the pathogenesis of the CAG trinucleotide repeat diseases, characterized by proteins with abnormal expansions of a polyglutamine domain. In the last few years the involvement of TGase in neurodegenerative diseases [NDS], including its role in aggregate formation, has been broadened to include Alzheimer's [AD] and Parkinson's Disease [PD]. It is clear that reduction of TGase activity is beneficial for prolonged survival in mouse models of NDS. The pathological progression of these diseases might reflect in part increases of TGase induced aggregates, or changes in other pathways influenced by increases in TGase activity. Neurodegeneration may be influenced by increased TGase activity affecting apoptosis, modulation of GTPase activity and signal transduction. This review will focus on the leading hypotheses in relation to both old and new experimental results.

Numerous groups have now validated high-throughput approaches to autoantibody profiling in a variety of systems. Recently, we have used autoantigen microarray technology to identify distinct autoantibody profiles in H-2 congenic MRL/lpr mice (Sekine et al., manuscript in preparation), and we are expanding this platform to study human and mouse models of IDDM and RA. We are also developing protein arrays for multiplex analysis of serum antibody isotypes. Multiplexed methods for autoantibody profiling will undoubtedly continue to uncover novel aspects of autoimmunity and B cell biology. It is now time to move these technologies beyond the proof-of-concept phase, and start addressing the next series of important questions. These include, but certainly are not limited to: identifying ""autoantibody signatures"" associated with disease state or outcome; profiling autoantibodies during the natural course of murine and human disease; and monitoring changes in autoantibody profiles of patients in response to therapeutic intervention. However, the next set of challenges is just right around the corner. As data and statistical analysis tools become more robust, it will be possible to generate and approach new hypotheses at an unprecedented pace. View details for Elaborate interactions between the immune and nervous systems The immune system and the nervous system maintain extensive communication, including 'hardwiring' of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves to lymphoid organs. Neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and histamine modulate immune activity. Neuroendocrine hormones such as corticotropin-releasing factor, leptin and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone regulate cytokine balance. The immune system modulates brain activity, including body temperature, sleep and feeding behavior. Molecules such as the major histocompatibility complex not only direct T cells to immunogenic molecules held in its cleft but also modulate development of neuronal connections. Neurobiologists and immunologists are exploring common ideas like the synapse to understand properties such as memory that are shared in these two systems. View details for Statins as potential therapeutic agents in multiple sclerosis. Stve, O., Prod'homme, T., Youssef, S., Dunn, S., Neuhaus, O., Weber, M., Hartung, H., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (ie, statins) are oral cholesterol-lowering drugs. Statins are well tolerated and have an excellent safety record. These agents competitively inhibit HMG CoA reductase, which is the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to L-mevalonate. Although L-mevalonate is a key intermediate in cholesterol synthesis, several of its metabolites are involved in post-translational modification of specific proteins involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Thus, independent of their cholesterol-reducing properties, statins have important pleiotropic biologic effects. Recent reports indicate that statins have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Whether statins will be of clinical benefit for patients with multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system will only be known after they are evaluated in prospective randomized clinical trials.

View details for Genomic and proteomic analysis of multiple sclerosis - Opinion Multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune diseases result from the dysregulation of genetic and proteomic programs. In MS, the loss of immune homeostasis leads to aberrant targeting and destruction of the myelin sheath, which manifests as the clinical syndrome of MS. The advent of technologies to perform large-scale analysis of mRNA transcript and protein expression will transform our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of MS, and will yield new targets for therapeutic intervention. An immunomodulatory GpG oligonucleotide for the treatment of autoimmunity via the innate and adaptive immune systems Ho, P. P., Fontoura, P., Ruiz, P. J., Steinman, L., Garren, H. Bacterial DNA and immunostimulatory CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) activate the innate immune system to produce proinflammatory cytokines. Shown to be potent Th1-like adjuvants, stimulatory CpG motifs are currently used as effective therapeutic vaccines for various animal models of infectious diseases, tumors, allergies, and autoimmune diseases. In this study, we show that the application of an immunomodulatory GpG ODN, with a single base switch from CpG to GpG, can effectively inhibit the activation of Th1 T cells associated with autoimmune disease. Moreover, this immunomodulatory GpG ODN suppresses the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice, a prototypic Th1-mediated animal disease model for multiple sclerosis.

S. 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, 'statins' are widely used oral cholesterol-lowering drugs. Statins competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of HMG-CoA to L-mevalonate, a key intermediate in cholesterol synthesis. Certain metabolites of mevalonate are also involved in posttranslational modification of specific proteins involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Thus, statins have important biologic effects that may be independent of their cholesterol-reducing properties. Recent studies indicate that statins have antiinflammatory and neuroprotective properties which may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis as well as other central nervous system (CNS) neurodegenerative diseases. This article will outline current experimental evidence that may suggest potential clinical benefits for patients with CNS autoimmune disorders. Ultimately, clinical trials will have to determine the safety and efficacy of statins in this patient population. View details for Protein arrays for autoantibody profiling and fine-specificity mapping Protein arrays provide a powerful approach to study autoimmune disease. Autoimmune responses activate B cells to produce autoantibodies that recognize self-molecules termed autoantigens, many of which are proteins or protein complexes. Protein arrays enable profiling of the specificity of autoantibody responses against panels of peptides and proteins representing known autoantigens as well as candidate autoantigens. In addition to identifying autoantigens and mapping immunodominant epitopes, proteomic analysis of autoantibody responses will further enable diagnosis, prognosis, and tailoring of antigen-specific tolerizing therapy. Statins and their potential targets in multiple sclerosis therapy Stuve, O., Prod'homme, T., Slavin, A., Youssef, S., Dunn, S., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a CNS-demyelinating disease characterised by relapsing and chronic neurological impairment. While traditionally CNS autoantigen-specific CD4(+) T cells have been considered the culprits in the initial phase of the disease, recent observations have altered this concept. It is now recognised that other T lymphocyte subclasses can initiate CNS demyelination. In addition, other cell types and molecules may play an important role in MS pathogenesis. There is overwhelming evidence that MS is a dynamic process, in which recurrent episodes of blood-brain barrier disruption and CNS inflammation play a crucial role in early disease stages, leading eventually to the largely irreversible changes of demyelination, gliosis and axonal degeneration. These observations may have important therapeutic implications. Within the last ten years, several medications have been approved for MS treatment. These agents, all of which are given parenterally, are only partially effective and are often associated with adverse effects and potential toxicities. The number and different types of medications used for MS are likely to increase in the near future, as several novel therapies are currently tested in clinical trials. 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, 'statins', are cholesterol-lowering drugs that are given orally, are safe and have biological effects independent of their cholesterol-reducing properties. Recent reports have shown that statins have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties that may be beneficial in the treatment of MS. This article will outline experimental evidence that suggests potential clinical benefits of statins for MS patients.

E., Amara, R. R., Steinman, L., Utz, P. J., Robinson, H. L., Robinson, W. H. We developed antigen microarrays to profile the breadth, strength, and kinetics of epitope-specific antiviral antibody responses in vaccine trials with a simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. These arrays contained 430 distinct proteins and overlapping peptides spanning the SHIV proteome. In macaques vaccinated with three different DNA and/or recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA) vaccines encoding Gag-Pol or Gag-Pol-Env, these arrays distinguished vaccinated from challenged macaques, identified three novel viral epitopes, and predicted survival. Following viral challenge, anti-SHIV antibody responses ultimately converged to target eight immunodominant B-cell regions in Env regardless of vaccine regimen, host histocompatibility type, and divergent T-cell specificities. After challenge, responses to nonimmunodominant epitopes were transient, while responses to dominant epitopes were gained. These data suggest that the functional diversity of anti-SHIV B-cell responses is highly limited in the presence of persisting antigen.

P., Amor, S., Olsson, T., Utz, P. J., Garren, H., Steinman, L. The diversity of autoimmune responses poses a formidable challenge to the development of antigen-specific tolerizing therapy. We developed 'myelin proteome' microarrays to profile the evolution of autoantibody responses in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis (MS). Increased diversity of autoantibody responses in acute EAE predicted a more severe clinical course. Chronic EAE was associated with previously undescribed extensive intra- and intermolecular epitope spreading of autoreactive B-cell responses. Array analysis of autoantigens targeted in acute EAE was used to guide the choice of autoantigen cDNAs to be incorporated into expression plasmids so as to generate tolerizing vaccines. Tolerizing DNA vaccines encoding a greater number of array-determined myelin targets proved superior in treating established EAE and reduced epitope spreading of autoreactive B-cell responses. Proteomic monitoring of autoantibody responses provides a useful approach to monitor autoimmune disease and to develop and tailor disease- and patient-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines. Diverse targets for intervention during inflammatory and neurodegenerative phases of multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease that causes relapsing and chronic neurologic impairment. Recent observations have altered certain traditional concepts regarding MS pathogenesis. A greater diversity of cell types and molecules involved in MS is now evident. While remyelination can occur during the early inflammatory phase when damage may be reversible, it is impaired in the later stages, which involve axonal death. These observations have important therapeutic implications. View details for Osteopontin polymorphisms and disease course in multiple sclerosis Caillier, S., Barcellos, L. F., Baranzini, S. E., Swerdlin, A., Lincoln, R. R., Steinman, L., Martin, E., Haines, J. L., Pericak-Vance, M., Hauser, S. L., Oksenberg, J. R. Osteopontin (OPN), also known as early T-cell activating gene (Eta-1), has been recently shown to be a critical factor in the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and perhaps multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we investigated whether the 327T/C, 795C/T, 1128A/G or 1284A/C single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the OPN gene were correlated with susceptibility or any of the several clinical end points in a cohort of 821 MS patients. Overall, we observed no evidence of genetic association between the OPN polymorphisms and MS. Although not reaching statistical significance, a modest trend for association with disease course was detected in patients carrying at least one wild-type 1284A allele, suggesting an effect on disease course. Patients with this genotype were less likely to have a mild disease course and were at increased risk for a secondary-progressive clinical type. View details for Statins as potential therapeutic agents in neuroinflammatory disorders Stuve, O., Youssef, S., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Multiple sclerosis is a central nervous system inflammatory demyelinating disease that is thought to have an autoimmune pathogenesis. Recent results indicate that 'statins', 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, which are the most commonly used oral cholesterol-lowering drugs, have immunomodulatory properties. In this article we will review those findings that indicate that statins may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative disease, and ischemic stroke.It was reported that statin treatment could either inhibit or reverse chronic and relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model of multiple sclerosis. Several immunomodulatory properties of statins may account for their beneficial clinical effect: Statins decreased the migration of leukocytes into the central nervous system, inhibited MHC class II and costimulatory signals required for activation of proinflammatory T cells, induced a T(H)2 phenotype in T cells, and decreased the expression of inflammatory mediators in the central nervous system, including nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor alpha. It was also demonstrated that statin use significantly reduced beta-amyloid secretion in the cerebrospinal fluid of experimental animals. Clinically, there is emerging evidence that statins have beneficial effects in patients with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and ischemic stroke.In-vitro studies have indicated that statins may have anti-inflammatory properties. Results from in-vivo animal models suggest that statins may be beneficial in treatment of different central nervous system conditions. Larger scale, randomized, double-blind trials are needed to validate the role of statins as a treatment of inflammatory central nervous system diseases.

Pedotti, R., Sanna, M., Tsai, M., DeVoss, J., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H., Galli, S. J. Insulin dependent (i.e., ""type 1"") diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is considered to be a T cell mediated disease in which TH1 and Tc autoreactive cells attack the pancreatic islets. Among the beta-cell antigens implicated in T1DM, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 appears to play a key role in the development of T1DM in humans as well as in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, the experimental model for this disease. It has been shown that shifting the immune response to this antigen from TH1 towards TH2, via the administration of GAD65 peptides to young NOD mice, can suppress the progression to overt T1DM. Accordingly, various protocols of ""peptide immunotherapy"" of T1DM are under investigation. However, in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), another autoimmune TH1 mediated disease that mimics human multiple sclerosis, anaphylactic shock can occur when the mice are challenged with certain myelin self peptides that initially were administered with adjuvant to induce the disease.Here we show that NOD mice, that spontaneously develop T1DM, can develop fatal anaphylactic reactions upon challenge with preparations of immunodominant GAD65 self peptides after immunization with these peptides to modify the development of T1DM.These findings document severe anaphylaxis to self peptide preparations used in an attempt to devise immunotherapy for a spontaneous autoimmune disease. Taken together with the findings in EAE, these results suggest that peptide therapies designed to induce a TH1 to TH2 shift carry a risk for the development of anaphylactic reactivity to the therapeutic peptides. Multiple elements of the allergic arm of the immune response modulate autoimmune demyelination PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Pedotti, R., DeVoss, J. J., Youssef, S., Mitchell, D., Wedemeyer, J., Madanat, R., Garren, H., Fontoura, P., Tsai, M., GALLI, S. J., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L. Analysis of mRNA from multiple sclerosis lesions revealed increased amounts of transcripts for several genes encoding molecules traditionally associated with allergic responses, including prostaglandin D synthase, histamine receptor type 1 (H1R), platelet activating factor receptor, Ig Fc epsilon receptor 1 (Fc epsilon RI), and tryptase. We now demonstrate that, in the animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), mediated by T helper 1 (Th1) T cells, histamine receptor 1 and 2 (H1R and H2R) are present on inflammatory cells in brain lesions. Th1 cells reactive to myelin proteolipid protein expressed more H1R and less H2R than Th2 cells. Pyrilamine, an H1R antagonist, blocked EAE, and the platelet activating factor receptor antagonist CV6209 reduced the severity of EAE. EAE severity was also decreased in mice with disruption of the genes encoding Ig Fc gamma RIII or both Fc gamma RIII and Fc epsilon RI. Prostaglandin D synthase and tryptase transcripts were elevated in EAE brain. Taken together, these data reveal extensive involvement of elements of the immune response associated with allergy in autoimmune demyelination. The pathogenesis of demyelination must now be viewed as encompassing elements of both Th1 responses and ""allergic"" responses.

View details for Protein and peptide array analysis of autoimmune disease Molecular cloning, sequencing of the human genome, and other major advances in biomedical research have contributed substantially to our understanding of autoimmune disease. Nevertheless, to date, such advances have failed to reveal the etiology of or yield curative therapies for autoimmune disease. New approaches are needed. Proteomics, the large-scale study of expression and function of proteins that compose our tissues and mediate disease, represents a powerful and promising strategy. We developed protein and peptide arrays to profile autoantibody responses in autoimmune disease. Protein and peptide array analysis of autoimmune samples is revealing human and pathogen proteins involved in initiation and perpetuation of autoimmunity. Proteomic determination of autoantibody profiles can be utilized for diagnosis, prognostication, and guiding tolerizing therapy for autoimmune disease. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, promotes a Th2 bias and reverses paralysis in central nervous system autoimmune disease Youssef, S., Stuve, O., Patarroyo, J. C., Ruiz, P. J., Radosevich, J. L., Hur, E. M., Bravo, M., Mitchell, D. J., Sobel, R. A., Steinman, L., Zamvil, S. S. Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, which are approved for cholesterol reduction, may also be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Atorvastatin (Lipitor) was tested in chronic and relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a CD4(+) Th1-mediated central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease model of multiple sclerosis. Here we show that oral atorvastatin prevented or reversed chronic and relapsing paralysis. Atorvastatin induced STAT6 phosphorylation and secretion of Th2 cytokines (interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-10) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Conversely, STAT4 phosphorylation was inhibited and secretion of Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) was suppressed. Atorvastatin promoted differentiation of Th0 cells into Th2 cells. In adoptive transfer, these Th2 cells protected recipient mice from EAE induction. Atorvastatin reduced CNS infiltration and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression. Treatment of microglia inhibited IFN-gamma-inducible transcription at multiple MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) promoters and suppressed class II upregulation. Atorvastatin suppressed IFN-gamma-inducible expression of CD40, CD80 and CD86 co-stimulatory molecules. l-Mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase, reversed atorvastatin's effects on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and T cells. Atorvastatin treatment of either APC or T cells suppressed antigen-specific T-cell activation. Thus, atorvastatin has pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects involving both APC and T-cell compartments.

Pharmacotherapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) advanced with the demonstration that interferon beta and glatiramer acetate improve the clinical course of this disease. Mitoxantrone is the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of secondary progressive MS. Despite this progress, the agents presently available are only partially effective, are difficult to administer, and may have significant side effects. Several orally administered immunomodulatory agents are presently being evaluated for treatment of MS. One class of drugs, HMG CoA inhibitors (statins), is safe and well-tolerated and could become another mainstay of MS therapy.This article reviews the clinical evidence for approved MS therapies and discusses their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, the clinical and laboratory data suggesting a potential role for statins in MS therapy are discussed.Although treatment with interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, and mitoxantrone, the approved therapies, provide important treatment options for patients with relapsing-remitting MS and secondary progressive MS, the potential benefits of other medications, including statins, should be explored in controlled clinical trials.

J., Steinman, L. Women with multiple sclerosis have significantly diminished disease activity during pregnancy. The purpose of our study was to identify the underlying mechanism for the diminished disease activity. We found that during the period of late pregnancy there is protection against paralysis, during both the induction and effector phases of relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. We did not find any changes in the cytokine secretion profiles or the proliferative activity of autoreactive T cells from mice induced during late pregnancy compared with virgin controls. In mice mated after disease onset, the inflammatory histologic lesions did not clear, despite marked clinical improvement during pregnancy. We found evidence for a serum factor present in late pregnancy that suppresses T cell activation. In the presence of sera taken from mice late in pregnancy, the proliferative response and IL-2 production of proteolipid protein p139-151-specific T cells were significantly diminished as compared with stimulation in the presence of normal mouse sera. In conclusion, serum from late pregnancy has the capacity to down-regulate T cell responses and might be associated with the amelioration of disease activity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

The development of vaccines is arguably the most significant achievement in medicine to date. The practice of innoculation with the fluid from a sore to protect from a disease actually dates back to ancient China; however, with the introduction of Jenner's smallpox vaccine, and greater understanding of the immune system, vaccines have become specific and systematic. Traditional vaccines have used killed pathogens (hepatitis A and the Salk polio vaccines), immunogenic subunits of a given pathogen (hepatitis B subunit vaccine), or live attenuated pathogens (measles, mumps, rubella, Sabin polio vaccines) to generate protective immunity. Currently, a new generation of vaccines that use the genetic material of a pathogen to elicit protective immunity are being developed. Although the most widespread and successful use of vaccines today remains in the arena of infectious diseases, manipulations of immune responses to protect against cancers, neurologic diseases, and autoimmunity are being explored rigorously.

J., Oksenberg, J. R., Raine, C. S., Heller, R., Steinman, L. Microarray analysis of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions obtained at autopsy revealed increased transcripts of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 and -17, interferon-gamma and associated downstream pathways. Comparison of two poles of MS pathology--acute lesions with inflammation versus 'silent' lesions without inflammation--revealed differentially transcribed genes. Some products of these genes were chosen as targets for therapy of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is upregulated in acute, but not in chronic, MS lesions, and the effect on ameliorating EAE is more pronounced in the acute phase, in contrast to knocking out the immunoglobulin Fc receptor common gamma chain where the effect is greatest on chronic disease. These results in EAE corroborate the microarray studies on MS lesions. Large-scale analysis of transcripts in MS lesions elucidates new aspects of pathology and opens possibilities for therapy.

We constructed miniaturized autoantigen arrays to perform large-scale multiplex characterization of autoantibody responses directed against structurally diverse autoantigens, using submicroliter quantities of clinical samples. Autoantigen microarrays were produced by attaching hundreds of proteins, peptides and other biomolecules to the surface of derivatized glass slides using a robotic arrayer. Arrays were incubated with patient serum, and spectrally resolvable fluorescent labels were used to detect autoantibody binding to specific autoantigens on the array. We describe and characterize arrays containing the major autoantigens in eight distinct human autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. This represents the first report of application of such technology to multiple human disease sera, and will enable validated detection of antibodies recognizing autoantigens including proteins, peptides, enzyme complexes, ribonucleoprotein complexes, DNA and post-translationally modified antigens. Autoantigen microarrays represent a powerful tool to study the specificity and pathogenesis of autoantibody responses, and to identify and define relevant autoantigens in human autoimmune diseases.

V., Becher, M. W., Springer, J. E., Chabas, D., Youssef, S., Pedotti, R., Mitchell, D., Steinman, L. An expanded polyglutamine domain in huntingtin underlies the pathogenic events in Huntington disease (HD), characterized by chorea, dementia and severe weight loss, culminating in death. Transglutaminase (TGase) may be critical in the pathogenesis, via cross-linking huntingtin. Administration of the TGase competitive inhibitor, cystamine, to transgenic mice expressing exon 1 of huntingtin containing an expanded polyglutamine repeat, altered the course of their HD-like disease. Cystamine given intraperitoneally entered brain where it inhibited TGase activity. When treatment began after the appearance of abnormal movements, cystamine extended survival, reduced associated tremor and abnormal movements and ameliorated weight loss. Treatment did not influence the appearance or frequency of neuronal nuclear inclusions. Unexpectedly, cystamine treatment increased transcription of one of the two genes shown to be neuroprotective for polyglutamine toxicity in Drosophila, dnaj (also known as HDJ1 and Hsp40 in humans and mice, respectively). Inhibition of TGase provides a new treatment strategy for HD and other polyglutamine diseases. View details for Evidence for a role for transglutaminase in Huntington's disease and the potential therapeutic implications Transglutaminase (TGase) activity is increased in affected regions of brains from patients with Huntington's disease (HD).

Gamma-glutaminyl-lysyl cross-links have been detected in nuclear inclusions in HD brain, indicating that TGase may play a prominent role in the aggregation of huntingtin (htt). Attempts to ameliorate experimental disease, via inhibition of TGase in transgenic models of HD in mice, are under investigation. View details for Autoantibody profiling for the study and treatment of autoimmune disease Hueber, W., Utz, P. J., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Proteomics technologies enable profiling of autoantibody responses using biological fluids derived from patients with autoimmune disease. They provide a powerful tool to characterize autoreactive B-cell responses in diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune diabetes, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Autoantibody profiling may serve purposes including classification of individual patients and subsets of patients based on their 'autoantibody fingerprint', examination of epitope spreading and antibody isotype usage, discovery and characterization of candidate autoantigens, and tailoring antigen-specific therapy. In the coming decades, proteomics technologies will broaden our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of and will further our ability to diagnose, prognosticate and treat autoimmune disease. Multiple sclerosis: Deeper understanding of its pathogenesis reveals new targets for therapy Steinman, L., Martin, R., Bernard, C., Conlon, P., Oksenberg, J. R. Recent technological breakthroughs allowing for large-scale analysis of gene transcripts and large-scale monitoring of the immune response with protein chips are revealing new participants in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Some of these participants may be useful targets for therapy.

R., Daikhin, Y., Yudkoff, M., Folk, J. E., Steinman, L., Browne, S. E., Beal, M. F., BLASS, J. P., Cooper, A. J. Pathological-length polyglutamine (Q(n)) expansions, such as those that occur in the huntingtin protein (htt) in Huntington's disease (HD), are excellent substrates for tissue transglutaminase in vitro, and transglutaminase activity is increased in post-mortem HD brain. However, direct evidence for the participation of tissue transglutaminase (or other transglutaminases) in HD patients in vivo is scarce. We now report that levels of N(epsilon)-(gamma-L-glutamyl)-L-lysine (GGEL)--a 'marker' isodipeptide produced by the transglutaminase reaction--are elevated in the CSF of HD patients (708 +/- 41 pmol/mL, SEM, n = 36) vs. control CSF (228 +/- 36, n = 27); p < 0.0001. These data support the hypothesis that transglutaminase activity is increased in HD brain in vivo.

R., Denhardt, D. T., Sobel, R. A., Lock, C., Karpuj, M., Pedotti, R., Heller, R., Oksenberg, J. R., Steinman, L. Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease, characterized by inflammation in the brain and spinal cord, possibly due to autoimmunity. Large-scale sequencing of cDNA libraries, derived from plaques dissected from brains of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), indicated an abundance of transcripts for osteopontin (OPN). Microarray analysis of spinal cords from rats paralyzed by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS, also revealed increased OPN transcripts. Osteopontin-deficient mice were resistant to progressive EAE and had frequent remissions, and myelin-reactive T cells in OPN-/- mice produced more interleukin 10 and less interferon-gamma than in OPN+/+ mice. Osteopontin thus appears to regulate T helper cell-1 (TH1)-mediated demyelinating disease, and it may offer a potential target in blocking development of progressive MS.

J., DeVoss, J. J., Nguyen, L. V., Fontoura, P. P., Hirschberg, D. L., Mitchell, D. J., Garcia, K. C., Steinman, L. T cell-mediated destruction of the myelin sheath causes inflammatory damage of the CNS in multiple sclerosis (MS). The major T and B cell responses in MS patients who are HLA-DR2 (about two-thirds of MS patients) react to a region between residues 84 and 103 of myelin basic protein (1 ). The crystal structure of HLA-DR2 complexed with myelin basic protein(84-102) confirmed that Lys(91) is the major TCR contact site, whereas Phe(90) is a major anchor to MHC and binds the hydrophobic P4 pocket (2 ). We have tested peptides containing repetitive 4-aa sequences designed to bind critical MHC pockets and to interfere with T cell activation. One such sequence, EYYKEYYKEYYK, ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats, an animal model of MS.

Spinal cord injury results in a massive loss of neurons, and thus of function. We recently reported that passive transfer of autoimmune T cells directed against myelin-associated antigens provides acutely damaged spinal cords with effective neuroprotection. The therapeutic time window for the passive transfer of T cells was found to be at least 1 week. Here we show that posttraumatic T cell-based active vaccination is also neuroprotective. Immunization with myelin-associated antigens such as myelin basic protein (MBP) significantly promoted recovery after spinal cord contusion injury in the rat model. To reduce the risk of autoimmune disease while retaining the benefit of the immunization, we vaccinated the rats immediately after severe incomplete spinal cord injury with MBP-derived altered peptide ligands. Immunization with these peptides resulted in significant protection from neuronal loss and thus in a reduced extent of paralysis, assessed by an open-field behavioral test. Retrograde labeling of the rubrospinal tracts and magnetic resonance imaging supported the behavioral results. Further optimization of nonpathogenic myelin-derived peptides can be expected to lead the way to the development of an effective therapeutic vaccination protocol as a strategy for the prevention of total paralysis after incomplete spinal cord injury. View details for Immunization with DNA encoding an immunodominant peptide of insulin prevents diabetes in NOD mice Urbanek-Ruiz, I., Ruiz, P. J., Paragas, V., Garren, H., Steinman, L., Fathman, C. G. DNA vaccination is an effective means of protecting experimental animals against infectious pathogens and cancer and has more recently been used to prevent autoimmune disease. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an autoimmune disease characterized by T-cell-mediated destruction of the insulin-secreting beta cells in the pancreas. The NOD mouse is an animal model of IDDM in which several autoantigens, including insulin, have been identified. In this study we demonstrate that vaccination of NOD mice with DNA encoding an immunodominant peptide of insulin (residues 9-23 of the B chain) protects the animals from developing diabetes. Animals injected intramuscularly with a bacterial plasmid encoding the insulin B chain peptide show significantly lower disease incidence and delayed onset of disease when compared to controls. Protection appears to be mediated by insulin B (9-23)-specific down-regulation of IFN-gamma. Our results confirm that DNA vaccination has a protective effect on autoimmunity, the understanding of which will reveal new insights into the immune system and open doors for novel therapies.

A., Fontoura, P., Nguyen, L. V., Estline, E. R., Hirschberg, D. L., Steinman, L. Using a combination of local gene delivery and tolerizing DNA vaccination, we demonstrate that codelivery of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) gene and a DNA vaccine encoding the self-peptide proteolipid protein 139-151 (PLP139-151) provides protective immunity against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We provide evidence for a mechanism whereby IL-4 expressed from the naked DNA is secreted and acts locally on autoreactive T cells via activation of STAT6 to shift their cytokine profile to T helper 2. We also show that DNA vaccines can be used to reverse established EAE by covaccination with the genes for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and IL-4. This treatment strategy combines the antigen-specific effects of DNA vaccination and the beneficial effects of local gene delivery.

View details for Antigen specific immunotherapy of multiple sclerosis The development of antigen specific therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS) involves specifically suppressing undesired immune responses targeting the myelin sheath and underlying axon. We have recently reported some success with altered peptide ligands for a major target of the autoimmune response in MS. Antigen specific therapy has the potential to suppress undesirable autoimmunity, while leaving the rest of the immune system intact. Induction of an antigen specific Th1-to-Th2 shift could achieve this aim, once side effects, such as allergic responses, are minimized with optimal dosing.

J., Steinman, L. EAE can refer either to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis or experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Although EAE is classically a prototypic T helper 1 (TH1) cell-mediated autoimmune disease, it can also be induced by TH2 cells. Characteristically, the most severe manifestation of allergy, anaphylaxis, is associated with exposure to a foreign antigen that is often derived from medication, insect venom or food. We report here that, after self-tolerance to myelin is destroyed, anaphylaxis may be triggered by a self-antigen, in this case a myelin peptide. ""Horror autotoxicus"", which was initially described by Ehrlich, may not only include autoimmunity to self, it may also encompass immediate hypersensitivity to self, which leads to shock and rapid death.

A., Mitchell, D. J., Pattabiraman, K., Pelkey, E. T., Steinman, L., Rothbard, J. B. Certain proteins contain subunits that enable their active translocation across the plasma membrane into cells. In the specific case of HIV-1, this subunit is the basic domain Tat(49-57) (RKKRRQRRR). To establish the optimal structural requirements for this translocation process, and thereby to develop improved molecular transporters that could deliver agents into cells, a series of analogues of Tat(49-57) were prepared and their cellular uptake into Jurkat cells was determined by flow cytometry. All truncated and alanine-substituted analogues exhibited diminished cellular uptake, suggesting that the cationic residues of Tat(49-57) play a principal role in its uptake. Charge alone, however, is insufficient for transport as oligomers of several cationic amino acids (histidine, lysine, and ornithine) are less effective than Tat(49-57) in cellular uptake. In contrast, a 9-mer of l-arginine (R9) was 20-fold more efficient than Tat(49-57) at cellular uptake as determined by Michaelis-Menton kinetic analysis. The d-arginine oligomer (r9) exhibited an even greater uptake rate enhancement (>100-fold). Collectively, these studies suggest that the guanidinium groups of Tat(49-57) play a greater role in facilitating cellular uptake than either charge or backbone structure. Based on this analysis, we designed and synthesized a class of polyguanidine peptoid derivatives. Remarkably, the subset of peptoid analogues containing a six-methylene spacer between the guanidine head group and backbone (N-hxg), exhibited significantly enhanced cellular uptake compared to Tat(49-57) and even to r9. Overall, a transporter has been developed that is superior to Tat(49-57), protease resistant, and more readily and economically prepared. View details for Polyarginine enters cells more efficiently than other polycationic homopolymers Mitchell, D. J., Kim, D. T., Steinman, L., Fathman, C. G., Rothbard, J. B. Homopolymers or peptides containing a high percentage of cationic amino acids have been shown to have a unique ability to cross the plasma membrane of cells, and consequently have been used to facilitate the uptake of a variety of biopolymers and small molecules. To investigate whether the polycationic character of these molecules, or some other structural feature, was the molecular basis for the effect, the ability of a variety of homopolymers to enter cells was assayed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Polymers of L- or D-arginine containing six or more amino acids entered cells far more effectively than polymers of equal length composed of lysine, ornithine and histidine. Peptides of fewer than six amino acids were ineffective. The length of the arginine side-chain could be varied without significant loss of activity. These data combined with the inability of polymers of citrulline to enter cells demonstrated that the guanidine headgroup of arginine was the critical structural component responsible for the biological activity. Cellular uptake could be inhibited by preincubation of the cells with sodium azide, but not by low temperature (3 degrees C), indicating that the process was energy dependent, but did not involve endocytosis.

In this 'double-blind', randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial, we compared an altered peptide ligand of myelin basic protein with placebo, evaluating their safety and influence on magnetic resonance imaging in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. A safety board suspended the trial because of hypersensitivity reactions in 9% of the patients. There were no increases in either clinical relapses or in new enhancing lesions in any patient, even those with hypersensitivity reactions. Secondary analysis of those patients completing the study showed that the volume and number of enhancing lesions were reduced at a dose of 5 mg. There was also a regulatory type 2 T helper-cell response to altered peptide ligand that cross-reacted with the native peptide.

A., Gijbels, K., Tropper, F. D., Bednarski, M., Li, K. C., Steinman, L. The expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules in the intact brains of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) was visualized by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) through the use of a new, target-specific MR contrast agent. Antibody-conjugated paramagnetic liposomes (ACPLs) were designed to achieve in vivo targeting of molecules expressed on vascular endothelium, while providing sufficient signal enhancement at these sites for detection by MRI. ACPLs targeted to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), an endothelial leukocyte receptor upregulated on cerebral microvasculature during EAE, were administered to diseased mice. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that fluorescently-tagged ACPLs were localized to central nervous system (CNS) microvasculature in a pattern consistent with ICAM-1 upregulation described immunohistochemically. High resolution MRI of mouse brains ex vivo demonstrated that ACPL binding conferred significant enhancement of signal intensity (SI) as compared to control images. These results suggest that ACPLs can be used as MRI contrast agents to visualize specific molecules expressed on vascular endothelium during disease.

W., Hirschberg, D. L., Xiao, J., Lu, Q., Roederer, M., Lock, C. B., Herzenberg, L. A., Steinman, L., Herzenberg, L. A. Multigenic programs controlling susceptibility to apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation have not yet been defined. Here, using DNA microarrays, we show gene expression patterns in an apoptosis-sensitive and apoptosis-resistant murine B cell lymphoma model system both before and after irradiation. From the 11,000 genes interrogated by the arrays, two major patterns emerged. First, before radiation exposure the radioresistant LYar cells expressed significantly greater levels of message for several genes involved in regulating intracellular redox potential. Compared with LYas cells, LYar cells express 20- to 50-fold more mRNA for the tetraspanin CD53 and for fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Expression of both of these genes can lead to the increase of total cellular glutathione, which is the principle intracellular antioxidant and has been shown to inhibit many forms of apoptosis. A second pattern emerged after radiation, when the apoptosis-sensitive LYas cells induced rapid expression of a unique cluster of genes characterized by their involvement in mitochondrial electron transport. Some of these genes have been previously recognized as proapoptotic; however others, such as uncoupling protein 2, were not previously known to be apoptotic regulatory proteins. From these observations we propose that a multigenic program for sensitivity to apoptosis involves induction of transcripts for genes participating in mitochondrial uncoupling and loss of membrane potential. This program triggers mitochondrial release of apoptogenic factors and induces the ""caspase cascade."" Conversely, cells resistant to apoptosis down-regulate these biochemical pathways, while activating pathways for establishment and maintenance of high intracellular redox potential by means of elevated glutathione.

A., Gussoni, E., Begovich, A. B., MURRAY, R. S., Zang, Y. Q., Appel, S. H., Steinman, L., Zhang, J. W. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disorder whose etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated the presence of inflammatory infiltrates within ALS spinal cord and suggested the possibility of an immune-mediated process in motor neuron degeneration. We have analyzed the diversity of T-cells in the spinal cord in ALS. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with variable (V) region sequence specific oligonucleotide primers was used to amplify T-cell receptor (TCR)BV transcripts from spinal cords obtained at autopsy from patients with ALS, patients who died without inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, brains from patients with ALS, and brains from patients who died with inflammatory CNS disease. Sequencing was then performed on the amplified transcripts. An overall increase in the level of TCRBV 2 transcripts was detected in ALS specimens when compared to controls. This result was independent of the HLA genotype of the individual. Furthermore, enrichment of TCRBV2-positive T cells could be demonstrated in cerebrospinal fluid derived from patients with ALS, using PCR analysis and a T cell stimulation assay with toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), a Vbeta2-specific superantigen. Our results suggest that an immunological process involving the specific expansion of Vbeta2 TCR-positive T-cells may be important in the pathogenesis of ALS.

V., Garren, H., Slunt, H., Price, D. L., Gusella, J., Becher, M. W., Steinman, L. The protein huntingtin (htt), aggregated in neuronal nuclear inclusions, is pathognomonic of Huntington's disease (HD). Constructs, translated in vitro from the N terminus of htt, containing either polyQ23 from a normal individual, or polyQ41 or polyQ67 from an HD patient, were all soluble. Transglutaminase (TGase) crosslinked these proteins, and the aggregations did not have the staining properties of amyloid. More TGase-catalyzed aggregates formed when the polyglutamine domain of htt exceeded the pathologic threshold of polyQ36. Furthermore, shorter htt constructs, containing 135 aa or fewer, formed more aggregates than did larger htt constructs. TGase activity in the HD brain was increased compared with the control, with notable increases in cell nuclei. The increased TGase activity was brain specific. In lymphoblastoid cells from HD patients, TGase activity was decreased. TGase-mediated crosslinking of htt may be involved in the formation of the nonamyloidogenic nuclear inclusions found in the HD brain. The staining properties of nuclear inclusions in the HD brain revealed that they were not amyloid.

L., VEROMAA, T. The role of various adhesion molecules in lymphocyte homing to the brain and in inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) was examined in mice. Activated T cell lines and clones expressed CD44 and integrin alpha4, but not L-selectin, and entered the CNS independent of their antigen specificity. mAbs directed against CD44 and integrin alpha4 prevented the transfer of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by myelin basic protein-specific T cells. T cells preincubated with anti-CD44 or antiintegrin alpha4 were blocked only partially from entering the brain parenchyma. However, both antibodies efficiently prevented CNS inflammation and clinical expression of EAE when injected in vivo. This effect lasted as long as antibodies were administered. Antibodies specific for L-selectin had no effect on homing of encephalitogenic T cells to the brain or development of EAE. Antiintegrin alpha4 and anti-CD44 did not impair the activation and function of encephalitogenic T cells in vitro and did not deplete integrin alpha4- or CD44-positive cells in vivo. These data suggest that, in the absence of leukocyte recruitment, the entry of a reduced number of activated myelin basic protein-reactive T cells in the CNS is not sufficient for the development and expression of EAE. We propose that antibodies to integrin alpha4 and CD44 prevent clinical disease by partially targeting the primary influx of encephalitogenic T cells and by preventing the secondary influx of leukocytes to lesions initiated by the transferred T cells.

M., Levite, M., Karpuj, M. V., Southwood, S., Sette, A., Conlon, P., Steinman, L. Molecular mimicry refers to structural homologies between a self-protein and a microbial protein. A major epitope of myelin basic protein (MBP), p87-99 (VHFFKNIVTPRTP), induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). VHFFK contains the major residues for binding of this self-molecule to T cell receptor (TCR) and to the major histocompatibility complex. Peptides from papilloma virus strains containing the motif VHFFK induce EAE. A peptide from human papilloma virus type 40 (HPV 40) containing VHFFR, and one from HPV 32 containing VHFFH, prevented EAE. A sequence from Bacillus subtilis (RKVVTDFFKNIPQRI) also prevented EAE. T cell lines, producing IL-4 and specific for these microbial peptides, suppressed EAE. Thus, microbial peptides, differing from the core motif of the self-antigen, MBPp87-99, function as altered peptide ligands, and behave as TCR antagonists, in the modulation of autoimmune disease.

J., Garren, H., Ruiz, I. U., Hirschberg, D. L., Nguyen, L. V., Karpuj, M. V., Cooper, M. T., Mitchell, D. J., Fathman, C. G., Steinman, L. Usually we rely on vaccination to promote an immune response to a pathogenic microbe. In this study, we demonstrate a suppressive from of vaccination, with DNA encoding a minigene for residues 139-151 of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP139-151), a pathogenic self-Ag. This suppressive vaccination attenuates a prototypic autoimmune disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which presents clinically with paralysis. Proliferative responses and production of the Th1 cytokines, IL-2 and IFN-gamma, were reduced in T cells responsive to PLP139-151. In the brains of mice that were successfully vaccinated, mRNA for IL-2, IL-15, and IFN-gamma were reduced. A mechanism underlying the reduction in severity and incidence of paralytic autoimmune disease and the reduction in Th1 cytokines involves altered costimulation of T cells; loading of APCs with DNA encoding PLP139-151 reduced the capacity of a T cell line reactive to PLP139-151 to proliferate even in the presence of exogenous CD28 costimulation. DNA immunization with the myelin minigene for PLP-altered expression of B7.1 (CD80), and B7.2 (CD86) on APCs in the spleen.

T cells with somatically acquired mutations in the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene were isolated from patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) as representatives of populations potentially enriched for in vivo activated T cells. TCRB gene V region usage among mutant isolates from individual IDDM patients, but not from normal controls, showed a pronounced preference for BV14 and, to a lesser extent, BV6. Wild-type (nonmutant) isolates did not show such preferences. Extensive in vivo clonal expansions of the BV14 expressing mutant T cells from IDDM patients were revealed by sequence identity of TCRB chain junctional regions. These data support restricted TCRB gene usage in T cell populations enriched for in vivo activated clones in patients with IDDM.

P., Steinman, L., Fathman, C. G. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that serves as a model for the human disease multiple sclerosis. Paralysis is ""induced"" by CD4+ T cells of the Th1 phenotype. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a Th1 type cytokine, has been shown to be upregulated in the CNS during the onset of EAE, and systemic manipulations of TNF have had substantial effects on disease progression. However, the precise role of TNF in EAE has been called into question by recent experiments utilizing TNF and lymphotoxin knockout mice. We demonstrate here that the local delivery of TNF by myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cells, retrovirally transduced to express TNF, exacerbated MBP-induced disease following adoptive transfer into syngeneic mice.

M., Liblau, R., Chelvanayagam, G., Steinman, L., Boston, T. Molecular mimicry has been suggested as a mode of autoreactive T cell stimulation in autoimmune diseases. Myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide 1-11 induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in susceptible strains of mice. Here we show that a herpesvirus Saimiri (HVS) peptide, AAQRRPSRPFA, with a limited homology to MBP1-11 peptide, ASQKRPSQRHG (underlined letters showing homology), can stimulate a panel of MBP-11-specific T cell hybridomas and more importantly cause EAE in mice. We demonstrate that this is due to cross-recognition of these two peptides by TCRs. Results presented in this communication are the first demonstration that a viral peptide with homology at just 5 amino acids with a self peptide can induce clinical signs of EAE in mice. These findings have important implications in understanding the breakdown of T cell tolerance to self Ags in autoimmune diseases by means of cross-reactivity with unrelated peptides.

L., Carmi, P., Erez, N., Garren, H., Herkel, J., Karpuj, M., Steinman, L., Rotter, V., Cohen, I. R. The p53 molecule might serve as a common tumor-associated antigen, as the tumor suppressor gene p53 is mutated and the p53 protein is often over-expressed in tumor cells. We report that effective immunity to p53 can be induced through an idiotypic network by immunization of mice with a monoclonal antibody (PAb-240) specific for mutated p53, or with a peptide derived from the complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 of the variable domain of the light chain (VL) of this antibody. The immunized mice produced IgG antibodies to p53 and mounted a cytotoxic reaction to a tumor line bearing mutated p53. The idiotypically immunized mice were resistant to challenge with the tumor cells. Thus antibodies to p53 might serve as immunogens for activating resistance to some tumors. At the basic level, these findings indicate that a network of p53 immunity may be organized naturally within the immune system.

An immunodominant epitope of myelin basic protein (MBP), VHFFKNIVTPRTP (p87-99), is a major target of T cells in brain lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS), and this peptide can trigger experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We designed truncated peptides based on this pathogenic 13-mer that are not antigenic. These short peptides reduced production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in vivo. Moreover, paraplegic rats given the 7-mer FKNIVTP in soluble form showed total reversal of paralysis in 24 h. Truncated peptides that are too small to stimulate antigenic responses to pathogenic regions of myelin basic protein are nevertheless effective tolerogens and are able to anergize autoreactive T cells. Short peptide-based tolerogens, devoid of immunogenic and pathogenic potential, may be attractive for therapy of autoimmune diseases. View details for Dal Canto, R. A., Shaw, M.

A model will be proposed that includes the initial activation of naive T lymphocytes through T cell receptor-mediated recognition of microbial antigens presented by MHC class II molecules. This event might be followed by re-activation of autoreactive T cells by bacterial and viral superantigens. Both mechanisms could lead to acute and relapsing autoimmune disease. View details for Neuropeptides, via specific receptors, regulate T cell adhesion to fibronectin Levite, M., Cahalon, L., HERSHKOVIZ, R., Steinman, L., Lider, O. The ability of T cells to adhere to and interact with components of the blood vessel walls and the extracellular matrix is essential for their extravasation and migration into inflamed sites. We have found that the beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion of resting human T cells to fibronectin, a major glycoprotein component of the extracellular matrix, is induced by physiologic concentrations of three neuropeptides: calcitonin gene-related protein (CGRP), neuropeptide Y, and somatostatin; each acts via its own specific receptor on the T cell membrane. In contrast, substance P (SP), which coexists with CGRP in the majority of peripheral endings of sensory nerves, including those innervating the lymphoid organs, blocks T cell adhesion to fibronectin when induced by CGRP, neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta, and PMA. Inhibition of T cell adhesion was obtained both by the intact SP peptide and by its 1-4 N-terminal and its 4-11, 5-11, and 6-11 C-terminal fragments, used at similar nanomolar concentrations. The inhibitory effects of the parent SP peptide and its fragments were abrogated by an SP NK-1 receptor antagonist, suggesting they all act through the same SP NK-1 receptor. These findings suggest that neuropeptides, by activating their specific T cell-expressed receptors, can provide the T cells with both positive (proadhesive) and negative (antiadhesive) signals and thereby regulate their function. Thus, neuropeptides may influence diverse physiologic processes involving integrins, including leukocyte-mediated migration and inflammation.

Th1 cells, important for cell-mediated immunity by their production of IL-2, IFN-gamma and lymphotoxin, have been implicated in the immunopathology of certain organ-specific autoimmune diseases whereas a role as regulators has been suggested for IL-4 and IL-10 producing Th2 cells. Recent findings, however, beg re-evaluation of the direct role of Th2 cells in the induction or maintenance of tolerance, whereas evidence for the role of a distinct subset of regulatory T cells producing TGF-beta to suppress cell-mediated immunopathology is compelling.

W., Catz, I., Hausmann, S., STROMINGER, J. L., Steinman, L., Warren, K. G. Myelin basic protein (MBP) may be an important autoantigen in multiple sclerosis (MS), with the MBP(82-100) region being immunodominant for T cells and autoantibodies. The structural requirements for autoantibody recognition were compared to those previously defined for MBP-specific T cell clones. MBP autoantibodies were affinity-purified from central nervous system lesions of 11/12 postmortem cases studied. The MBP(83-97) peptide was immunodominant in all 11 cases since it inhibited autoantibody binding to MBP > 95%. Residues contributing to autoantibody binding were located in a 10-amino acid segment (V86-T95) that also contained the MHC/T cell receptor contact residues of the T cell epitope. In the epitope center, the same residues were important for antibody binding and T cell recognition. Based on the antibody-binding motif, microbial peptides were identified that were bound by purified autoantibodies. Autoantibody binding of microbial peptides required sequence identity at four or five contiguous residues in the epitope center. Microbial peptides previously found to activate T cell clones did not have such obvious homology to MBP since sequence identity was not required at MHC contacts. The similar fine specificity of B cells and T cells may be useful for tolerance induction to MBP in MS. View details for Perivascular T cells express the pro-inflammatory chemokine RANTES mRNA in multiple sclerosis lesions Hvas, J., McLean, C., Justesen, J., Kannourakis, G., Steinman, L., Oksenberg, J. R., Bernard, C. C. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by accumulation of mononuclear cells. The pathogenesis of MS is complex and probably involves soluble immune mediators, particularly cytokines, and activated memory T cells, that are thought to migrate into the CNS. During lesion formation in MS, cytokines regulate cell functions, such as cell recruitment and migration. Because the chemokine RANTES play a role in both activating and recruiting leucocytes, particularly memory T cells into inflammatory sites, the authors have assessed RANTES mRNA levels at the site of lesions. Expression levels were analysed in brain samples and compared with neurological, infectious and other controls. RANTES was expressed by activated perivascular memory T cells, predominantly located at the edge of active plaques. While RANTES mRNA was detected in all 17 MS brains analysed, it was only found in six of the 14 control patients and generally at a lower expression level. In view of the regulatory and chemotactic properties of RANTES, these results imply that RANTES in MS lesions may play an important role in the activation and/or selective accumulation of memory T cells and, thereby, in the pathogenic events associated with MS.

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) exerts a major role in the stress response. Both CRF and urocortin, a newly discovered neuropeptide homologous to CRF, suppressed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Suppression of paralysis with CRF involved stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and inhibitory effects on an encephalitogenic T cell line. While CRF increased glucocorticoid production, which is known to block EAE, it also suppressed EAE in adrenalectomized rats, where glucocorticoid stimulation via CRF plays no role. Moreover, the encephalitogenicity of a T cell line exposed to CRF in vitro was reduced. Stress may influence autoimmune disease through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and directly via the immune system.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system which serves as a model for the human disease multiple sclerosis. We demonstrate here that encephalitogenic T cells, transduced with a retroviral gene, construct to express interleukin 4, and can delay the onset and reduce the severity of EAE when adoptively transferred to myelin basic protein-immunized mice. Thus, T lymphocytes transduced with retroviral vectors can deliver ""regulatory cytokines"" in a site-specific manner and may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of autoimmune disease. View details for Multiple sclerosis: a polygenic disease involving epistatic interactions, germline rearrangements and environmental effects Several regions of the human genome are associated with susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS). We review studies of linkage of MS to germline genes using microsatellites. A modest effect on susceptibility was seen with markers in the vicinity of 6p21 (HLA) and 17q22. The influence of epistatic interactions between these genes is considered. The impact of genetic rearrangements of certain germline genes on susceptibility to MS is described. Analysis of TCR gene rearrangements has established some of the target antigens of the immune response in MS. Environmental influences on MS are described with particular attention given to how microbes might trigger demyelinating disease. View details for Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in IL-4-deficient mice Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in an inflammatory demyelinating disease which usually follows a monophasic course. Autoreactive Th1 CD4+ T cells are responsible for the lesions, whereas autoreactive Th2 CD4+ T cells can, upon adoptive transfer, suppress the disease process. However, the role of IL-4 and Th2 cells in the spontaneous remission of EAE and in the prevention of relapses is not known. We have addressed these issues using IL-4-deficient mice in which the differentiation of Th2 CD4+ T cells is severely compromised. The clinical course of actively induced EAE was compared in IL-4+/+, IL-4+ /- and IL-4-/- mice on the PL/J genetic background. No significant differences were noted between groups for the frequency, severity and duration of EAE, and the frequency of relapses. Our results indicate that IL-4, despite its well-documented regulatory role in EAE, is not necessary for the spontaneous remission of disease or for the prevention of relapses. Therefore, in the absence of IL-4, overlapping or compensatory immunoregulatory mechanisms can restrict an inflammatory response within the central nervous system.

A., Chalmers, D., Crowe, P. D., Pahuja, A., Ling, N., Brocke, S., Steinman, L., Conlon, P. J. T-cells specific for a region of human myelin basic protein, amino acids 87-99 (hMBP87-99), have been implicated in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS) a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Administration of soluble altered peptide ligand (APL), made by substituting native residues with alanine at either positions 91(91K > A or A91) or 97 (97R > A or A97) in the hMBP87-99 peptide, blocked the development of chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (R-EAE), in the SJL mouse. The non-encephalitogenic APL A91, appears to induce cytokine shifts from Th1 to Th2 in the target T-cells, whereas the encephalitogenic superagonist APL A97 causes deletion of the MBP87-99 responsive cells. Thus, single amino acid changes at different positions in the same peptide epitope can lead to APL capable of controlling auto-immune disease by different mechanisms.

M., Steinman, L., Blau, H. M. We evaluated myoblast implantation in 10 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and absent dystrophin (age 5-10 years) who were implanted with 100 million myoblasts in the anterior tibial muscle of one leg and placebo in the other. Cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day) was administered for 7 months. Pre- and postimplantation (after 1 and 6 months) muscle biopsies were analyzed. Force generation (tetanic tension and maximum voluntary contraction) was measured monthly in a double-blind design. There was increased force generation in both legs of all boys, probably due to cyclosporine. Using the polymerase chain reaction, evidence of myoblast survival and dystrophin mRNA expression was obtained in 3 patients after 1 month and in 1 patient after 6 months. These studies suggest a salutary effect of cyclosporine upon muscular force generation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy; however, myoblast implantation was not effective in replacing clinically significant amounts of dystrophin in DMD muscle.

H., Steinman, L. Aminoguanidine (AG), a selective inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase, prevented the clinical development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) with a reduction in inflammation and demyelination. Administration of AG reduced the expression of nitrosotyrosine in inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system. Cytokine expression, determined by semiquantitative PCR, revealed increased expression of IFN-gamma, IL-10, and TGF-beta, which was associated with protection from EAE, and reduced TNF-alpha, associated with the development of EAE. Furthermore, AG blocked the secretion of nitric oxide, TNF-alpha, and PGE2 in astrocyte cultures. AG did not influence the proliferation response of T cells to a pathogenic epitope of myelin basic protein. Down-regulation of nitric oxide by AG has widespread consequences for cytokine production in central nervous system inflammation and prevents EAE.

View details for IL-2 and TNF receptors as targets of regulatory T-T interactions - Isolation and characterization of cytokine receptor-reactive T cell lines in the Lewis rat T cells are considered to be of prime importance in immune regulation of both B and T cell functions. The targets of recognition in T-T cell interactions are not clear. Most recent experimental work has focused on the idiotypic regulatory interactions mediated by TCR peptides. There is experimental evidence that regulatory cells exist that do not recognize the TCR. This type of regulation is selectively induced by activated T cells. Therefore, we designed this study to examine the possible role of cytokine receptors as targets of immune regulation. We tested two peptides of IL-2R alpha-chain, 2 of IL-2R beta-chain, and one of TNFR (p60). All peptides were found to be immunogenic at inducing T cell proliferation and four induced Abs in Lewis rats. We generated T cell lines to these five peptides, and tested them both in vitro and in vivo. We found that the T cells exhibited a proliferative response when cultured with activated, irradiated stimulator cells that were augmented upon addition of the cytokine receptor peptide. The cytokine profile of the lines was characterized as well as the Vbeta gene composition. One of the lines significantly protected against active encephalomyelitis. These results point at cytokine receptors as possible targets of immune regulation and T-T cell interactions.

F., Martin, R. We have examined the functional consequences induced by interaction of DR2a-restricted myelin basic protein (MBP) (87-99)-specific T cell clones (TCC) with altered peptide ligands (APL) derived from MBP peptide (87-99). The immunodominant MBP peptide (87-99) has been implicated as a candidate antigen in multiple sclerosis (MS) by several lines of evidence. In the present study, we have defined the T cell receptor (TCR) contact residues for DR2a-restricted, (87-99)-specific T helper type 1 T cells to design APL suitable to modify the functions of such T cells potentially relevant for the pathogenesis of MS. We show that neutral (L-alanine substitutions) or conservative exchanges of the primary and secondary TCR contact residues lead to various alterations of T cell function, ranging from differences in interleukin-2 receptor up-regulation to anergy induction and TCR antagonism. The potential usefulness of APL as an immunomodulating therapy for DR2+ MS patients is discussed. View details for The right stuff: Breaking through the xenotransplant barrier View details for Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease during which an autoimmune reaction is directed against oligodendrocytes. Alterations of normal myelin structure or oligodendrocyte metabolism may be primary events that influence the susceptibility to MS. Once triggered, the immune system attacks and destroys myelin and the myelin forming cell. Evidence is presented that the oligodendrocyte responds to the attack by immune cells and their secreted products through modulation of its metabolism and gene expression. Cytokines, immunoglobulins, and complement complexes may elicit a survival response in the oligodendrocytes, involving the induction of heat shock proteins and other protective molecules. The possibility of manipulating these complex glial cell functions and controlling their pathologic interactions with immune cells will illuminate how myelin damage can be contained and how the injured tissue can be repaired.

A variable region gene of the T-cell receptor, V beta 8.2, is rearranged, and its product is expressed on pathogenic T cells that induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in H-2u mice after immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP). Vaccination of these mice with naked DNA encoding V beta 8.2 protected mice from EAE. Analysis of T cells reacting to the pathogenic portion of the MBP molecule indicated that in the vaccinated mice there was a reduction in the Th1 cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gama. In parallel, there was an elevation in the production of IL-4, a Th2 cytokine associated with suppression of disease. A novel feature of DNA immunization for autoimmune disease, reversal of the autoimmune response from Th1 to Th2, may make this approach attractive for treatment of Th1-mediated diseases like multiple sclerosis, juvenile diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.

We have examined the level of surface expression and functional properties of leukocyte function associated antigen-1, very late antigen-4, and CD45 isoforms on a panel of human CD4+ T-cell clones representative of TH0, TH1, and TH2 cells. There were no qualitative differences in the expression of these antigens among the three types of CD4+ T-cell clones. However, CD45RB was the only CD45 isoform that provided a costimulatory signal in a solid-phase antibody-induced cellular proliferation assay. Additionally, the antigen-induced proliferative response of T-cell clones was inhibited by soluble anti-CD45RO and anti-CD45RB antibodies. Our results suggest that CD45 isoforms differentially provide costimulatory signals to T cells. However, the ability of each CD45 isoform to provide a costimulatory signal does not differ among the TH0, TH1, or TH2 T-cell populations.

J., Driver, R., Steinman, L., Umetsu, D. T. The development of restricted cytokine profiles by subsets of CD4+ T cells is a pivotal point in the regulation of immune responses. T cells producing Th1 cytokines (IL-2 and interferon-gamma) induce cell-mediated immunity, whereas T cells producing Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) play a prominent role in the induction of humoral immunity. We examined a group of patients with multiple sclerosis, a disease caused by excess production of Th1 cytokines in myelin-reactive T cells, and control patients with noninflammatory neuroconvulsive disorders, for the presence of allergic disease, which is caused by excess production of Th2 cytokines in allergen-specific T cells. The patients with multiple sclerosis had significantly fewer allergic symptoms, a lower number of positive allergen-specific IgE test results, and lower composite allergy indexes than control subjects. These results demonstrate that the prevalence of IgE-mediated allergic disease is decreased in a group of patients with multiple sclerosis and support the hypothesis that genetic factors that promote susceptibility to Th1-mediated inflammatory disease in human beings protect against the development of Th2-mediated disease.

These specific cells recruit a population of nonspecific T cells and macrophages. The rare tissue-specific T cells in the infiltrate have the capacity to regulate both the influx and the efflux of cells from the tissue.

J., Wraith, D. C., OGARRA, A., Fathman, C. G., Steinman, L. Following induction of experimental encephalomyelitis with a T-cell clone, L10C1, that is specific for the myelin basic protein epitope p87-99, the inflammatory infiltrate in the central nervous system contains a diverse collection of T cells with heterogeneous receptors. We show here that when clone L10C1 is tolerized in vivo with an analogue of p87-99, established paralysis is reversed, inflammatory infiltrates regress, and the heterogeneous T-cell infiltrate disappears from the brain, with only the T-cell clones that incited disease remaining in the original lesions. We found that antibody raised against interleukin-4 reversed the tolerance induced by the altered peptide ligand. Treatment with this altered peptide ligand selectively silences pathogenic T cells and actively signals for the efflux of other T cells recruited to the site of disease as a result of the production of interleukin-4 and the reduction of tumour-necrosis factor-alpha in the lesion.

A., Brocke, S., TAYLOREDWARDS, C., Ridgway, W., Dinisco, C., Steinman, L., Dalton, D., Fathman, C. G. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis, is an autoimmune disorder seen in mice and rats following immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP) or MBP-derived peptides. IFN-gamma, a cytokine produced by a variety of cells, is involved in many inflammatory and immune regulatory events. Contradictory results concerning exacerbations and the disease course were seen comparing injections of IFN-gamma in humans suffering from multiple sclerosis to studies using anti-IFN-gamma Abs in mice with EAE. To study the role of IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma-producing cells in EAE, we crossed IFN-gamma knockout mice (H-2b) (unable to produce IFN-gamma due to the disruption of the IFN-gamma gene) with an EAE-susceptible mouse strain, B10.PL (H-2u). EAE was seen in IFN-gamma knockout mice, heterozygotic (IFN-gamma +/-) mice, as well as wild-type littermates following immunization with MBP. Histologic analyses of the central nervous system of IFN-gamma knockout mice with EAE revealed massive infiltrates composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. We conclude that the presence of IFN-gamma is not crucial to the induction or the clinical course of EAE.

S., Szafer, F., HENSLEEDOWNEY, P. J., Walker, M., King, S., Godder, K., Pati, A. R., BEST, R., Steinman, L., Geier, S. S., Gee, A. P. The purpose of this study was to characterize the phenotype and clonality of the T cell population in patients who experience acute rejection (AR) following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from a partially mismatched related donor (PMRD). Phenotypic analysis was performed using flow cytometry, assignment of donor/host lineage by cytogenetics or HLA-specific flow cytometry, and analysis of the T cell receptor (TCR) by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We have previously reported the initial appearance in the blood of AR patients of host CD8+brightCD3low T cells that progressively express increasing amounts of CD3+ cells. We now report that this cell population can differentiate into either a cytotoxic T cell phenotype (CD3+CD8+HLA-DR+CD57-) usually associated with AR of grafts from matched unrelated donors or a suppressor T cell phenotype (CD3+CD8+CD57+HLA-DR-) usually associated with AR of grafts from matched sibling donors. Analysis of the TCR V beta subsets from two patients revealed sorted host CD3+CD8+ cells (purity 90-95%) from the first patient to express V beta 18 almost exclusively. In a second patient with late rejection (55 days post-BMT), the CD3+CD8+ cells were predominantly restricted to V beta 1, 5.1, 7, 9, and 18. Although CD3+CD8+ T cells are known to be associated with AR, cytotoxic and suppressor lineages in AR from the same type of BMT and clonal distribution of T cells in AR have not been reported. Preliminary results suggest that V beta expression in AR of PMRD grafts is restricted and host T cell phenotype may vary. Further studies will investigate whether specific mismatches correlate with specific V beta usage and/or host T cell phenotype.

S., Steinman, L. We previously demonstrated the local production of the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the central nervous system (CNS) in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for the human disease multiple sclerosis.To assess the role of IL-6 in autoimmune CNS inflammation, we administered neutralizing antibodies to IL-6 in the EAE model. Their effect was examined at the clinical and histopathological level. Levels of administered antibody and IL-6 bioactivity were followed in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).Systemically administered antibodies penetrated into the fluid CSF in animals in which EAE was induced. Administration of anti-IL-6 reduced the development of actively induced as well as adoptively transferred EAE and was associated with increased levels of IL-6 activity in the CSF and to a lesser extent in the serum. Anti-IL-6 was still effective when given 1 day before the onset of disease signs in adoptively transferred EAE. The disease-reducing effect of anti-IL-6 was also reflected at the pathological level by the absence of inflammatory infiltrates in the CNS.Our study indicates that IL-6 plays an important role in autoimmune CNS inflammation. However, due to the complex nature of the in vivo interactions of administered antibodies, the disease-reducing effect of the anti-IL-6 antibodies could be caused by neutralization of IL-6 activity or by enhancement of IL-6 activity via induction of higher IL-6 levels in the CNS.

Analysis of pathogen-reactive T cell clones (CD3+4+8-TCR alpha beta +), isolated from the synovial fluid of 2 HLA-B27-positive patients with Yersinia enterocolitica-triggered reactive arthritis, has provided important information about the cellular immune response to this disease-inciting pathogen. This study demonstrates that the proteins secreted by Y. enterocolitica, including a protein with tyrosine phosphatase activity (YopH), are potent immunogens stimulating CD4+ cells within the inflamed joint. The pathogen-reactive T cell clones preferentially utilized a limited set of T cell receptor variable region gene segments. A purified Yersinia superantigen triggered a proliferative response in most of the antigen-reactive T cell clones tested. These results suggest that the activity of this pathogen's superantigen influences the cellular immune response to its antigens.

T cells found in EAE lesions show similarities in the VJ and VDJ regions of their alpha and beta chains with T cells in MS lesions, and with T cells that are specific for MBPp84-103 isolated from patients with MS. If this region of MBP is critical in the pathogenesis of MS, then therapy aimed at controlling the immune response to this immunodominant region of MBP may be beneficial in treating MS. View details for REINDUCTION OF EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS IN MICE Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Lewis rats and some strains of mice is typically a monophasic disease, and recovered animals are resistant to reinduction of disease. We demonstrate that SJL mice remain susceptible to disease after recovery, and suffer a second episode of disease when reinjected with spinal cord homogenate in complete Freund's adjuvant. Reinduced disease occurs earlier after injection than the initial disease (mean onset 7.3 days compared with 14.5 days), and has comparable severity and incidence. The susceptibility to reinduced disease is present for at least 20 weeks after the initial injection. If the initial episode of EAE is elicited using a synthetic peptide of proteolipid protein, then reinjection of the same peptide causes reinduced disease. PL/J mice and PL/J x SJL F1 mice are also susceptible to reinduced disease which occurs with an accelerated onset and higher incidence than the initial disease. We conclude that SJL and PL/J mice have a defect in immunoregulation which causes them to be susceptible to recurrent episodes of autoimmune disease.

One strategy was to sequence TCR gene rearrangements directly from MS lesions. The second strategy utilized T-cell clones with a selectable mutation that are found only in MS patients. The selection of T-cell clones with mutations in the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene was used to isolate T-cells reactive to myelin basic protein (MBP) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). These T-cell clones are activated in vivo, and are not found in healthy individuals. The third complementarity determining regions (CDR3) of the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains are the putative contact sites for peptide fragments of MBP bound in the groove of the HLA molecule. The TCR V gene usage and CDR3s of these MBP-reactive hprt- T-cell clones are homologous to TCRs from other T-cells relevant to MS, including T-cells causing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and T-cells found in brain lesions and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients. In vivo activated MBP-reactive T-cells in MS patients may be critical in the pathogenesis of MS.

L., Porteus, M., Steinman, L., Stevens, D. A. CSF lymphocytes from patients with Coccidioides immitis meningitis exhibited a significant antigen-specific response to in vitro stimulation with C. immitis antigens. In some patients, lesser responses to control antigens (Candida and PPD) were also detected. Antigen-specific responses by CSF lymphocytes were seen early in the course of this disease as well as several years after patients had entered remission. When compared to CSF cells, the response of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells was similar but of a much smaller magnitude and at times undetectable. Fluorescence activated cell sorting revealed an increased percentage of CD3+ (T-cells), CD4+ (helper/inducer) and CD3+/HLA-DR+ (activated T-cell) cells in the CSF of C. immitis meningitis patients compared to their blood. Most of the antigen-specific proliferative response resided in the CD4+ lymphocyte subset. CSF T-cell proliferation assays may have a role in the diagnosis of C. immitis meningitis.

D., Michie, S. A., Tisch, R., Karin, N., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. To elucidate the role of cell adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and to determine the predominant lymphocytic homing pathway(s) involved in the selective lymphocytic infiltration of pancreatic islets (insulitis), nonobese diabetic mice were treated with monoclonal antibodies specific for the L-selectin and integrin alpha 4 lymphocyte adhesion molecules. Treatment of neonatal mice with either anti-L-selectin or anti-integrin alpha 4 monoclonal antibodies for the first 4 weeks of life led to a significant and long-term protection against spontaneous occurrence of insulitis and diabetes. The same treatment failed to inhibit lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary glands (sialadenitis). This tissue-specific inhibition of inflammation may be attributed to differences between the pancreas and salivary gland in their expression of endothelial ligands for L-selectin (peripheral vascular addressin) and for integrin alpha 4 (mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1). Mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 is highly expressed by vessels within the inflamed islets but was not detected in the salivary glands. In contrast, peripheral vascular addressin- and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1-expressing vessels can be found in almost every area of inflammation within the salivary glands but are seen in only 40-50% of inflamed islets. Anti-L-selectin and anti-integrin alpha 4 treatment had no demonstrable effect on anti-beta-cell autoimmunity or on the immune responses to foreign antigens. Therapeutic treatment with anti-L-selectin after the onset of insulitis from 10 to 14 weeks of age delayed the onset but failed to prevent spontaneous insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, whereas anti-integrin alpha 4 treatment resulted in a significant and long-lasting suppression of the disease. These data strongly suggest that integrin alpha 4 plays a prominent role in the spontaneous development of insulitis and diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice. View details for CELL-ADHESION MOLECULES - A SELECTIVE THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR ALLEVIATION OF IDDM Yang, X. D., Michie, S. A., Tisch, R., Karin, N., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. Selective homing of autoreactive lymphocytes to the pancreatic islets of Langerhans is essential for triggering the cascade of molecular and cellular interactions which culminate in the specific destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells. Based upon the sequential multistep model of lymphocyte adhesion to the endothelium, we investigated the possibility of preventing the progression of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) by selectively blocking L-selectin and alpha 4-integrin homing receptors, which function at different stages of the adhesion process. Treatment of NOD mice with mAb specific for L-selectin or alpha 4-integrin resulted in a significant inhibition of lymphocytic infiltration (insulitis). Both spontaneous development and acute transfer of IDDM were completely prevented by administration of anti-alpha 4-integrin antibody and partially inhibited by anti-L-selectin antibody. The protective effect was of long duration. Interestingly, the autoimmune T cell responses to a panel of beta cell autoantigens and the lymphocytic infiltration of salivary glands (sialadenitis) appeared unaffected by anti-L-selectin or anti-alpha 4-integrin treatment. These data suggest that prevention of lymphocyte homing to the pancreatic islets may provide a selective target for prevention/treatment of IDDM in patients. View details for REVERSAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS WITH A HYDROXAMATE INHIBITOR OF MATRIX METALLOPROTEASES Gelatinases, belonging to the matrix metalloproteases, contribute to tissue destruction in inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system such as multiple sclerosis. We used experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as an animal model to evaluate the effect of a hydroxamate matrix metalloprotease inhibitor (GM 6001) on inflammatory demyelination. A single dose of the inhibitor, given intraperitoneally, provided sufficient levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of animals with EAE to induce at least a partial inhibition of the gelatinase activity in the cerebrospinal fluid. When administered daily either from the time of disease induction or from the onset of clinical signs, GM 6001 suppressed the development or reversed clinical EAE in a dose-dependent way, respectively. Animals returned to the same clinical course as the nontreated group after cessation of treatment. Animals treated from the onset of clinical signs had normal permeability of the blood-brain barrier, compared with the enhanced permeability in nontreated animals. These results indicate that matrix metalloprotease inhibition can reverse ongoing EAE. This effect appears to be mediated mainly through restoration of the damaged blood-brain barrier in the inflammatory phase of the disease, since, the degree of demyelination and inflammation did not differ between the treatment groups.

J., Brocke, S., Ling, N., Steinman, L. An immunodominant epitope of myelin basic protein (MBP), VHFFKNIVTPRTP (p87-99), is a major target of T cells in lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS) and in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). T cells found in EAE lesions bear the same amino acids in the third complementary determining region of the T cell receptor (TCR) as those found in MS lesions. We analyzed the trimolecular interactions between MBP p87-99, class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and TCR, and designed soluble inhibitors for therapy. F, N, I, and V at positions 90, 92, 93, and 94 interact with MHC, whereas K, T, and P at positions 91, 95, and 96 interact with TCR. The peptides, p87-99[95T > A] and p87-99[96P > A] could compete more effectively with p87-99 for binding to MHC and could antagonize the in vitro response to T cells to p87-99 more effectively than p87-99[91K > A]. However, only p87-99[91K > A] prevented and reversed EAE, indicating that the extent of MHC or TCR competition does not predict success in treating EAE. To elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of EAE, draining lymph node cells from rats immunized with the native peptide alone or together with each of the three TCR antagonists were challenged in vitro with p87-99. Administration of p87-99[91K > A], but not p87-99 [95T > A] or p87-99[96P > A], reduced the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- alpha and interferon (IFN) gamma. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha are two cytokines that are critical in the pathogenesis of EAE and MS.

Using a quantitative PCR, we first characterized the T cells infiltrating muscle biopsies from six DMD patients. High levels of TCR V beta 2 transcripts were observed in DMD muscle tissue. TCR V beta 2 transcripts from seven DMD patients and five controls were sequenced, and the VDJ junctional region analyzed in 166 clones. One specific amino acid motif, RVSG, was found in the third complementary determining region (CDR3) of TCR V beta 2 chains in samples from five DMD patients, but not in controls. A specific immune reaction at the site of tissue degeneration may play an important role in the pathogenesis of DMD.

A., Allegretta, M., Steinman, L., Sriram, S. Characterization of T cells responding to autoantigens is central to understanding autoimmune disease. We have used somatic mutation at the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene as an index of T-cell amplification in vivo. With this strategy we previously showed that myelin basic protein-reactive T cells can be isolated only from the HPRT mutant T-cell population cultured from the peripheral blood of multiple sclerosis patients and not from normal individuals. In this study, 165 HPRT mutant and 104 wild-type clones were examined for their reactivity to myelin basic protein and overlapping peptides of myelin basic protein. Five HPRT mutant clones that recognized myelin basic protein and myelin basic protein peptides along with three clones that responded to myelin basic protein peptide alone were isolated. All but one of the eight clones recognized peptides derived from the carboxy terminus of myelin basic protein (p84-168). Sequence analysis showed heterogeneous expression of T-cell receptor V alpha and V beta genes and CDR3s. These studies showed that in vivo amplified autoimmune T cells from patients with long-standing disease use diverse T-cell receptor elements in the recognition of C-terminal myelin basic protein peptides.

We treated 21 multiple sclerosis patients with two to four doses of cM-T412, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the CD4 antigen found on helper/inducer T lymphocytes. The mean number (+/- standard error) of circulating CD4 lymphocytes decreased from 888 (+/- 81) cells/mm3 at baseline to 246 (+/- 18) after treatment. At 1 year after the last treatment, the CD4 count had recovered to only 335 (+/- 32). The antibody had no effect on CD8 lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, or other leukocytes. Side effects were minimal. Despite the prolonged depletion of CD4 lymphocytes, no opportunistic infections occurred. Only 1 patient had a possible allergic reaction. Most patients were clinically stable, but a few progressed. We conclude that repeated treatment with cM-T412 is effective in reducing the number of circulating CD4 lymphocytes and has no limiting side effects.

Brocke, S., VEROMAA, T., Weissman, I. L., Gijbels, K., Steinman, L. The association of infection with autoimmune diseases is enigmatic, partly because cause and effect are difficult to establish in chronic diseases. Microorganisms might initiate multiple sclerosis and trigger relapses of disease. Superantigens might be involved in autoimmunity through the (re)activation of T cells, including autoreactive cells, expressing certain T cell receptor beta chain variable regions.

J., Steinman, L., Weiner, H. L., Kuchroo, V. K. Immunization with the multideterminant autoantigen myelin basic protein (MBP) causes experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease that serves as a model for multiple sclerosis (MS). MBP peptides Ac1-11 and p35-47 induce potent EAE in mice of the H-2u haplotype. T cells specific for Ac1-11 predominantly utilize one T-cell receptor (TCR) V beta gene segment, V beta 8.2. All T-cell clones and hybridomas analyzed, regardless of TCR V beta usage, utilize D beta 2 and J beta 2 elements. The NZW mouse strain (H-2z), which contributes to the spontaneous 'lupus-like' illness in (NZB x NZW)F1 mice, has a genomic deletion encompassing D beta 2 and J beta 2 gene segments. The NZW strain expresses class II (I-A and I-E) genes which share identical sequences with H-2u class II. We investigated whether these strains are susceptible to EAE induced with intact MBP and known encephalitogenic MBP peptides. In vitro analysis demonstrated that NZW antigen-presenting cells (APC) can present MBP and MBP peptide Ac1-11 to an encephalitogenic T-cell clone derived from an H-2u mouse, confirming the functional identity of NZW class-II (I-A) molecules with their respective H-2u class-II gene products. In vivo results demonstrated that NZW and (NZB x NZW)F1 mice are susceptible to EAE induced with intact MBP and Ac1-11. MBP p35-47 caused EAE in (NZB x NZW)F1 mice, which express alleles for both the normal (NZB) TCR beta-gene locus, and the abnormal (NZW) TCR beta-gene locus containing the J beta 2 deletion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) View details for A HIPPOCAMPAL PROTEIN ASSOCIATED WITH PARANEOPLASTIC NEUROLOGIC SYNDROME AND SMALL-CELL LUNG-CARCINOMA BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS Sakai, K., GOFUKU, M., Kitagawa, Y., Ogasawara, T., Hirose, G., Yamazaki, M., Koh, C.

A hippocampal 38 kd autoantigen recognized by an autoantibody from the serum of a patient with paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) was isolated by screening a human hippocampal cDNA library. The 1,991-nucleotide ple21 clone was obtained and the deduced 350-residue protein encoded by the ple21 cDNA clone was found to be highly homologous to the neuron-specific RNA recognition motifs (RRMs)-containing proteins. The homologies were confined to the RRMs and the RRM connecting region. The presence of RRM in the antigenic protein may be important in the pathogenesis of SCLC-associated paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome.

We conducted an open trial of cM-T412, a chimeric monoclonal anti-CD4 antibody, in 29 patients with MS. This antibody caused a prompt and long-lasting depletion of circulating CD4 (helper/inducer) lymphocytes. The mean (+/- SE) CD4 count for the group decreased from 870 (+/- 66) cells/mm3 at baseline to 76 (+/- 11) 3 hours after treatment, and then increased to 425 (+/- 38) at 1 month after treatment and 475 (+/- 39) at 6 months after treatment. Numbers of CD8 (cytotoxic/suppressor) lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, granulocytes, and monocytes changed transiently but showed no significant long-term effects. The most common side effects were headache, nausea, myalgia, fever, and tachycardia occurring in the first few hours after treatment. No serious or unexpected infections or other significant adverse effects occurred. Kurtzke EDSS scores remained stable, and MRI scans showed less contrast enhancement 1 week after treatment. We conclude that treatment of MS patients with cM-T412 chimeric anti-CD4 antibody is well tolerated at the doses tested and produces a long-lasting, selective depletion of CD4 lymphocytes.

M., Lock, C. B., Smilek, D. E., Pearson, C. I., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. The precise mechanisms of failure of immunological tolerance to self proteins are not known. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) susceptibility alleles, the target peptides, and T cells with anti-self reactivity must be present to cause autoimmune diseases. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a murine model of a human autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis. In EAE, residues 1-11 of myelin basic protein (MBP) are the dominant disease-inducing determinants in PL/J and (PL/J x SJL/J)F1 mice. Here we report that a six-residue peptide (five of them native) of MBP can induce EAE. Using peptide analogues of the MBP-(1-11) peptide, we demonstrate that only four native MBP residues are required to stimulate MBP-specific T cells. Therefore, this study demonstrates lower minimum structural requirements for effective antigen presentation by MHC class II molecules. Many viral and bacterial proteins share short runs of amino acid similarity with host self proteins, a phenomenon known as molecular mimicry. Since a six-residue peptide can sensitize MBP-specific T cells to cause EAE, these results define a minimum sequence identity for molecular mimicry in autoimmunity.

D., Karin, N., Tisch, R., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. Leukocyte adhesion to the endothelial venules in the pancreatic islets is thought to be one of the initial steps in the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. It has been suggested that leukocyte adhesion to endothelium is a sequential multistep process involving various different homing receptors. We report here that blocking different homing receptors--namely, L-selectin and very late antigen 4 (VLA-4)--which function during different stages of the adhesion process, by specific monoclonal antibodies inhibits insulitis and prevents diabetes in mice. Moreover, leukocyte attachment to the inflamed vessels within pancreatic sections could be inhibited by anti-L-selectin and anti-VLA-4 antibodies. Interestingly, anti-L-selectin or anti-VLA-4 antibody did not appear to influence the autoimmune response to a panel of pancreatic beta-cell autoantigens. These data suggest that L-selectin and VLA-4 receptors are involved in mediating leukocyte homing to the islets and that intervention of these two adhesion pathways may provide a novel approach for treatment of autoimmune diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

CD4 and CD8 were not quantifiable at baseline, became detectable at 5 days after immunization, and increased steadily to a peak during clinical disease. I-A increased after CD4 and CD8, but before onset of disease. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 did not increase until after onset of clinical disease. CD4, CD8, and I-A remained elevated long after recovery from disease. These results suggest that infiltration of CD4 and CD8 cells into the spinal cord and subsequent upregulation of I-A mRNA play an important role in the development of EAE, but reversal of these processes is not necessary for recovery. Upregulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA does not appear to be important for development of disease.

G., Steinman, L. The role of infection in the pathogenesis of clinical relapses that occur in most autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, remains to be established. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) serves as a model for multiple sclerosis, with episodes of relapsing paralysis. In certain strains of mice, T-lymphocytes expressing the V beta 8 T-cell receptor (TCR) engage the amino-terminal epitope Ac1-11 of myelin basic protein, leading to EAE. The bacterial superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) activates V beta 8-expressing T cells. Here we show that after immunization with Ac1-11, or after transfer of encephalitogenic T-cell lines or clones reactive to Ac1-11, SEB induces exacerbation or relapses of paralytic disease in mice that are in clinical remission following an initial episode of paralysis, and triggers paralysis in mice with subclinical disease. Tumour necrosis factor has a critical role in the mechanism underlying SEB-induced exacerbation of disease, because anti-tumour necrosis factor antibody given in vivo delays the onset of paralysis triggered by SEB. On reactivation of autoaggressive cells through their T-cell receptor, superantigens may induce clinical relapses of autoimmune disease.

In this study we analyzed the usage frequencies of the TCR V-gene segments by alpha beta+ T cells present in synovial fluid of 17 patients with chronic arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis. The results of this study, obtained from semiquantitative PCR analyses, showed that in all patients most of the TCR V alpha- and V beta-gene segments could be detected both in fresh PBMCs and in fresh SFMCs. The relative frequencies of use of these V-region genes were variable between the different patients. Although there was some skewing of increased usage frequencies of particular TCR V alpha and V beta genes among SFMC-derived TCRs when compared with PBMCs, we could not correlate such increased TCR V-gene usage with the inflammation in the joints as a disease-specific marker. View details for GAMMA-DELTA T-CELL RECEPTOR REPERTOIRE IN BRAIN-LESIONS OF PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS Hvas, J., Oksenberg, J. R., Fernando, R., Steinman, L., Bernard, C. C. The identification of activated T cells in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) suggests that these cells are critical in the pathogenesis of this disease. Recently we have used the PCR method to analyse rearrangements of V alpha and V beta genes of the T cell receptor (TCR) in samples of MS and control brains. The results of these studies showed that TCR V gene usage in MS brains may be restricted and in particular that V beta genes may be preferentially rearranged in certain HLA haplotypes associated with susceptibility to MS. In view of the recent evidence that T lymphocytes bearing the gamma delta chains may have autoreactive potential, we have assessed whether or not such TCR-bearing lymphocytes were also present in chronic MS lesions. TCR V gamma and V delta were analysed by the PCR method using a panel of V gamma and V delta primers paired with C gamma or C delta primers in 12 MS brains, as well as in brain samples of ten normal post-mortem cases and three neurological controls. TCR V gamma-C gamma and V delta-C delta rearrangements were confirmed using Southern blotting and hybridisation of the PCR products with specific C gamma and C delta probes. Only one to four rearranged TCR V gamma and V delta transcripts were detected in each of the 23 brain samples obtained from 12 MS patients, with the majority of gamma delta T cells expressing the V gamma 2 and V delta 2 chains. In marked contrast, V gamma and V delta transcripts could only be found in one of the ten non-neurological control brains analysed. To assess the clonality of V gamma 2 and V delta 2 T cell receptor chains in the brain samples of MS patients, we have sequenced the junctional regions of the TCR V gamma-N-J gamma-C gamma and V delta-N-D delta-N-J delta-C delta segments amplified from brain tissues, CSF and spleens of two MS patients and from the spleen of two control subjects. The sequence analysis obtained so far shows no compelling evidence of an MS specific expansion of one or more clones expressing particular types of gamma delta T cell receptors. In contrast, a clonal expansion of a different population of TCR gamma delta-bearing T cells was found in the spleen of both an MS patient and one of the control individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) View details for CLONAL ANALYSIS OF INVIVO ACTIVATED CD8+ CYTOTOXIC T-LYMPHOCYTES FROM A MELANOMA PATIENT RESPONSIVE TO ACTIVE SPECIFIC IMMUNOTHERAPY KANMITCHELL, J., Huang, X. Q., Steinman, L., Oksenberg, J. R., Harel, W., Parker, J. W., Goedegebuure, P. S., Darrow, T. L., Mitchell, M. S. To study in vivo activated cytolytic T cells, CD8+ T cells clones were isolated from a melanoma patient (HLA A2, A11) treated with active specific immunotherapy for 5 years. CD8+ T lymphocytes, purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, were cloned directly from the peripheral blood without antigen-presenting cells in the presence of irradiated autologous melanoma cells and recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-4. These conditions were inhibitory to de novo in vitro immunization. Of the 28 cytolytic CD8+ T cell clones, 21 lysed the autologous melanoma cell line (M7) but not the autologous lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL-7) nor the two melanoma cell line, M1 (HLA A28) and M2 (HLA A28, A31), used to immunize the patient. The remaining 7 clones were also melanoma-specific, although their reactivities were broader, lysing several melanoma cell lines but not HLA-matched lymphoblastoid cells. Eight clones from the first group, ostensibly self-MHC-restricted, were expanded for further analysis. All expressed cluster determinants characteristic of mature, activated T cells, but not those of thymocytes, naive T cells, B cells or natural killer (NK) cells. They also expressed CD13, a myeloid marker. Of the 8 clones, 3 expressed both CD4 and CD8, but dual expression was not correlated with specificity of lysis. Two CD8+ and 2 CD4+ CD8+ clones were specific for the autologous melanoma cells, the other 4 were also reactive against other HLA-A2-positive melanomas. Cytotoxicity for both singly and doubly positive clones was restricted by HLA class I but not class II antigens. Analysis of the RNA expression of the T cell receptor (TCR) V alpha and V beta gene segments revealed heterogeneous usage by the A2-restricted clones and, perhaps, also by the broadly melanoma-specific clones. Apparent TCR-restricted usage was noted for the self-MHC-restricted clones; 2 of the 4 expressed the V alpha 17/V beta 7 dimer. Since the T cell clones were derived from separate precursors of circulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), the V alpha 17/V beta 7 TCR was well represented in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of this patient. In summary, we show that melanoma cells presented their own antigens to stimulate the proliferation of melanoma-reactive CD8+ CTL. CTL with a range of melanoma specificities and different TCR alpha beta dimers were encountered in this patient, perhaps as a result of hyperimmunization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) View details for T-CELL RECEPTOR GENE USAGE OF ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR-SPECIFIC T-HELPER CELLS Melms, A., Oksenberg, J.

W., Pararajasegaram, G., Sun, Y. M., Steinman, L. Improved molecular methods allow identification of the specific autoaggressive T cells involved in autoimmune inflammations. In this study of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein-induced uveitis, TCR V beta usage was studied using RNA-polymerase chain reaction amplification of transcripts derived directly from ocular tissues and from T cell lines obtained from the spleen. Specific V beta 5' primers from the major murine TCR V beta families were coupled with a common 3' primer from the V beta C region. Amplification of rearranged TCR V beta-D beta-J beta-C beta sequences was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. In ocular tissue from sensitized mice, TCR V beta expression was limited mainly to one to three V beta families, with predominant expression of V beta 2, V beta 12, and V beta 15. In most animals there was similar, albeit limited, TCR gene usage in both the recognition of autoantigen in uveitogenic T cell lines and at the site of inflammation in the eye. Identification of a limited TCR V beta repertoire in Ag-reactive T cell lines correlated with TCR usage at the target site of autoimmune expression. The gene products of the restricted TCR V beta rearrangements found in lesions and in the cell lines may serve as the target for selective immunotherapy. View details for SELECTIVE AND NONSELECTIVE STAGES IN HOMING OF T-LYMPHOCYTES TO THE CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM DURING EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGIC ENCEPHALOMYELITIS Karin, N., Szafer, F., Mitchell, D., Gold, D. P., Steinman, L. The diversity of Ag-specific receptors on T cells homing to an inflammatory infiltrate in the central nervous system has been analyzed. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a T cell-mediated inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, was induced in Lewis rats with a CD4+, CD8- T cell line specific for peptide 68-86 of myelin basic protein. Within the line a wide array of TCR V beta genes was transcribed including the V beta 8, V beta 10, V beta 15, V beta 16, and V beta 19 families. Accumulation of T cells at the site of inflammation was determined by using RNA-polymerase chain reaction amplification of rearranged TCR V beta transcripts derived from brain. By 8 to 10 h after i.p. infusion of the pathogenic T cell line, TCR V beta transcripts, including mainly V beta families that were predominantly rearranged by the line, could be identified in brains. Restricted TCR V gene transcripts with predominance of the V beta 8 family were identified in brain 48 h after injection, before onset of disease. Paralysis was apparent by 4 to 5 days after injection. At this time diverse V beta gene transcripts were detected in brain, reaching a maximum by day 9, when paralyzed rats have recovered. By day 14 a second stage of limited heterogeneity in the T cell infiltrate could be identified with predominant expression of V beta 8, V beta 9, V beta 10, and V beta 19. Interestingly, three out of these four V beta families were predominantly expressed within the encephalitogenic line. Thus, T cell migration to brain in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is characterized by a rapid penetration of T cells followed by a selective trapping of T cells before the clinical manifestations of disease. When clinical disease was present the T cell infiltrate was diverse, whereas in the post-acute phase of disease the T cells in the central nervous system had limited heterogeneity with selective accumulation of T cells transcribing the same V regions that were detected in the line that incited disease.

A., Hodgkinson, S., Steinman, L. The repertoire of TCR V beta genes transcribed and expressed within the central nervous system was determined in mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Disease was induced in (PL/J x SJL/)F1 mice by immunizing with myelin basic protein-acetylated peptide 1-11, and mice were sacrificed at intervals from day 3 postimmunization to 3 wk after recovery from disease. Transcription of V beta genes was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on RNA extracted from spinal cord, and expression of the V beta gene products was detected by immunohistochemistry with mAb specific for various V beta proteins. Multiple V beta genes were found to be transcribed and expressed in the central nervous system starting 7 days after immunization, and continuing up to 3 wk after clinical recovery. Preferential utilization of a single TCR V beta gene was not detected in the central nervous system at any time in the course of disease.

C., ALLSUP, A., SODERBERG, C., Anzola, J., Freitas, V., Turck, C., Steinman, L., Peltz, G. Forty-three CD3+4+8- TCR alpha beta+ Borrelia burgdorferi-reactive T cell clones isolated from the peripheral blood of a single patient with clinically active chronic Lyme arthritis were characterized. The spirochetal Ag recognized by 16 of these T cell clones was determined by reactivity with a panel of recombinant spirochetal Ag, which included the OspA, OspB, flagellin, Hsp60 and Hsp70 proteins. All three T cell clones reactive with heat shock proteins recognized a non-cross-reactive epitope unique to the spirochetal Ag. Analysis of the TCR V regions revealed preferential usage of V beta 5.1; 5 of 15 T cell clones that recognized an unidentified spirochetal Ag utilized this V beta gene segment. Most of the T cell clones recognized a given spirochetal Ag exclusively within the context of one HLA class II allele. However, two T cell clones, which recognized an unidentified Ag in the spirochetal lysate within the context of different HLA class II alleles, were both TCR V beta 5.1+, although each displayed a distinct alpha-chain. Moreover, in vitro incubation of this patient's PBMC with B. burgdorferi Ag resulted in a specific increase in the percentage of T cells expressing TCR V beta 5.1. These results indicate that B. burgdorferi has a V beta-selective factor influencing the cellular immune response in a patient with clinically active Lyme disease.

G., Steinman, L., Brocke, S. Superantigens have the ability to stimulate a subset of T cells based upon their expressed TCR beta-chain. It has been demonstrated that the administration of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in mice leads to unresponsiveness in V beta 8+ T cells in vivo which are the same T cells that could be stimulated in vitro by this enterotoxin. We present here data on the effect of SEB administration in DBA/2 and (PL/J x SJL)F1 mice on their T cell response to two different T cell determinants, the responses against which are dominated by the use of V beta 8+ T cells. Treatment of mice with SEB not only diminished their primary T cell proliferative response to these determinants, but also was able to effectively reduce the memory T cell response. SEB treatment, however, showed only a modest effect in preventing Ac 1-11-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in H-2u mice.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system in which a restricted cellular immune response has been observed. In order to establish whether such T cell responses are likely to be antigen-specific particularly with regard to myelin basic protein (MBP), we analysed T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements directly from MS brain plaques, using the polymerase chain reaction on reverse transcribed messenger RNA, and compared these with TCR of previously described MBP-specific T cell clones from MS and the rat model experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Rearranged V beta 5.2 genes were detected in the brains of all patients who were HLA DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602, DPB1*0401. The V beta 5.2-D beta-J beta sequences in these MS brain plaques revealed five motifs. One of the common motifs was identical to that described for the VDJ region of a V beta 5.2 T-cell clone. This clone was from an MS patient who was HLA DRB1*1501, DQB1*0602, DPB1*0401, and it was cytotoxic towards targets containing the MBP peptide 89-106 (ref. 1). The deduced amino-acid sequence of this VDJ rearrangement, Leu-Arg-Gly, has also been described in rat T cells cloned from experimental allergic encephalomyelitis lesions, which are specific for MBP peptide 87-99 (ref. 2). VDJ sequences with specificity for this MBP epitope constitute a large fraction (40%) of the TCR V beta 5.2 N(D)N rearrangements in MS lesions. The capacity of rat T cells with these VDJ sequences to cause experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and the prevalence of such sequences in demyelinated human lesions indicate that T cells with this rearranged TCR may be critical in MS.

Each episode improved after treatment with steroids. Laboratory studies revealed no evidence of multiple sclerosis or a structural spinal lesion. He had antinuclear and anti-DNA antibodies and the HLA-A1, B8, DR3 haplotype known to be associated with certain autoimmune diseases. We propose an autoimmune cause for the recurrent episodes of myelitis. View details for RECURRENT TRANSVERSE MYELITIS, MYASTHENIA-GRAVIS, AND AUTOANTIBODIES The minimum structural requirements for peptide interactions with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and with T cell receptors (TCRs) were examined. In this report we show that substituting alanines at all but five amino acids in the myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide Ac1-11 does not alter its ability to bind A alpha uA beta u (MHC class II molecules), to stimulate specific T cells and, surprisingly, to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in (PL/J x SJL/J)F1 mice. Most other amino acid side chains in the Ac1-11 peptide are essentially irrelevant for T cell stimulation and for disease induction. Further analysis revealed that binding to A alpha uA beta u occurred with a peptide that consists mainly of alanines and only three of the original residues of Ac1-11. Moreover, when used as a coimmunogen with MBP Ac1-11, this peptide inhibited EAE. The finding that a specific in vivo response can be generated by a peptide containing only five native residues provides evidence that disease-inducing TCRs recognize only a very short sequence of the MHC-bound peptide.

O. Expression of the lymphokine genes in human astroglial cell lineage was studied. Primers for 9 different human lymphokines, from IL-1 alpha to IL-8, were used to analyze RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma, one neuroblastoma cell line and 4 fresh brain specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). mRNA transcripts of neither IL-1 nor IL-3, the biological activities of which were observed in rat primary cultured astrocytes, could be detected within these cell lines. Two out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U138 and U373, expressed IL-6 genes. IL-8 gene was detected within U87, U138, U251, U373 glioma cells. After stimulation with IL-1 beta, all astrocytoma and one neuroblastoma cell line expressed IL-6 and IL-8 genes. In addition to the cultured cells, we examined IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression within human malignant astrocytoma specimens. The result shows that three out of four glioma specimens expressed IL-6 and IL-8 genes. From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived IL-6 or IL-8 may participate in local immune reactions accompanying infection, degeneration and malignancies in the central nervous system. [An analysis of lymphokine gene expression within astrocytoma]. The profile of lymphokines secreted by 14 T cell clones and 24 T cell lines reactive with Yersinia Ag isolated from the synovial fluid cells of two HLA-B27+ patients with Yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis was characterized. In response to Ag-specific or -nonspecific stimulation, all of the Yersinia-reactive T cell clones and lines had a pattern of lymphokine secretion resembling that of murine (Th1) cells. A total of 50% of T cell lines and clones randomly isolated from a reactive arthritis patient, without prior in vitro stimulation with Yersinia Ag, also exhibited a Th1-like profile of cytokine secretion upon nonspecific activation. This indicates that the selective expansion of this subset of T cells had already occurred in vivo. The possibility that the predominance of Th1-like T cells was an artefact generated by the T cell cloning procedure was excluded; 50% of the randomly isolated T cell clones and lines produced IL-4, IL-5, or both cytokines upon nonspecific activation. These results indicate that Yersinia Ag selectively activate a Th1-like subset of T cells in patients with Yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis. Accumulation of such cells in the synovial tissue of patients with reactive arthritis may play a key role in the pathogenesis of this disease.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory neurologic disease initiated by myelin basic protein-reactive CD4+ T cells, which are restricted by a particular MHC class II molecule. Recent studies have utilized inhibitor peptides that bind to restricting MHC class II molecules in order to inhibit EAE, presumably by means of competing with encephalitogenic epitopes. However, these studies leave open the possibility of alternative explanations, such as Ag-specific nonresponsiveness and immunodominance. In order to demonstrate that competition for MHC binding alone can inhibit EAE, the inhibitor peptide should ideally be structurally unrelated and nonimmunogenic yet physically associate with the MHC class II molecule. In this study, we show that the OVA-323-339 peptide, which is unrelated to the disease-inducing peptide, binds to A alpha uA beta u. However, although OVA-323-339 is extremely immunogenic in A alpha dA beta d-expressing BALB/c mice, it is nonimmunogenic in (PL/J x SJL)F1 and PL/J mice expressing A alpha uA beta u. When administered as a coimmunogen with Ac1-11, OVA-323-339 inhibited induction of EAE in (PL/J x SJL)F1 mice. Myelin basic protein-89-101, which does not bind A alpha uA beta u, had no effect on the disease process. This study provides evidence that MHC class II binding alone can modulate the induction of EAE. The use of a nonimmunogenic non-self peptide to modulate an autoimmune disease minimizes the potential complications of immunodominance or alternative regulatory mechanisms associated with immunogenic peptide therapies and further confirms the MHC-blocking model of immunosuppression.

Applications of PCR have revolutionized the field of immunogenetics particularly in studies of human leukocyte antigen class II polymorphism and more recently in the analysis of T cell receptor usage. The diversity of the variable region of the T cell receptor, however, has made it difficult to amplify the complete repertoire of T cell receptor transcripts. We have chosen to address this problem through the design of oligonucleotide primers specific for each of the known V alpha- and V beta-region T cell receptor families in order to characterize the T cell receptor repertoire. Using nonradioactive probes labeled with horse radish peroxidase, the system presented here allows for the rapid elucidation of the T cell receptor repertoire expressed in cells or tissue samples, such as those derived from autoimmune lesions. The identification of the T cell receptor repertoire involved in a pathogenic process can have therapeutic implications given the success of reversing experimental autoimmune disorders by directing specific forms of immunotherapy against V region gene products.

Expression of T cell receptor (TCR) V alpha and V beta genes in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within human malignant brain tumor was examined. Primers for 18 different human TCR V alpha and 21 V beta families were used to analyze TCRV-(D)-J-C gene rearrangements in TILs in 8 human malignant glioma specimens obtained at surgery. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, we detected limited TCR variable region, V alpha gene expression in malignant glial tumors and also V alpha 7 and V alpha 12 TCR genes were preferentially expressed. Usage of TCR V beta gene was not as restricted as in TCR V alpha. These TILs expressing a limited repertoire of TCRs might be isolated, expanded, and used therapeutically for treatment of malignant brain tumors.

Gene delivery by transplantation of normal myoblasts has been proposed as a treatment of the primary defect, lack of the muscle protein dystrophin, that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a lethal human muscle degenerative disorder. To test this possibility, we transplanted normal myoblasts from a father or an unaffected sibling into the muscle of eight boys with DMD, and assessed their production of dystrophin. Three patients with deletions in the dystrophin gene expressed normal dystrophin transcripts in muscle biopsy specimens taken from the transplant site one month after myoblast injection. Using the polymerase chain reaction we established that the dystrophin in these biopsies derived from donor myoblast DNA. These results show that transplanted myoblasts persist and produce dystrophin in muscle fibres of DMD patients.

Applications of the polymerase chain reaction have revolutionized the field of immunogenetics, particularly in studies of human leukocyte antigen class II polymorphism, and more recently in the analysis of T-cell receptor usage. However, the enormous diversity and variability of the T-cell receptor complex have made the amplification of the complete repertoire difficult. Several methods have been devised to address this problem. Each system is described with recent examples of its use and an assessment of its advantages and disadvantages. The use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction in T-cell receptor analysis is also discussed. The elucidation of the T-cell repertoire involved in a pathogenic process can have therapeutic implications, given the success of reversing experimental autoimmune disorders by directing specific forms of immunotherapy against V region gene products. View details for THE POLYMERASE CHAIN-REACTION FOR DETECTION OF T-CELL ANTIGEN RECEPTOR EXPRESSION The interaction of the immunodominant pertussis toxin peptide containing residues 30-42 (p30-42) with soluble DR1 molecules and the T-cell receptor (TCR) of 12 DR1-restricted human T-cell clones has been analyzed. Peptide analogues of p30-42 containing single alanine substitutions were used in DR1-binding and T-cell proliferation assays to identify the major histocompatibility complex and TCR contact residues. Each T-cell clone was found to recognize p30-42 with a different fine specificity. However, a common core comprising amino acids 33-39 was found to be important for stimulation of all T-cell clones. Within this core two residues, Leu33 and Leu36, interact with the DR1 molecule, whereas Asp34, His35, Thr37, and Arg39 are important for TCR recognition in most of the clones. Computer modeling of the structure of p30-42 showed that an alpha-helical conformation is compatible with the experimental data. The analysis of TCR rearrangement revealed that the peptide was recognized by T-cell clones expressing different variable region alpha (V alpha) and variable region beta (V beta) chains, although a preferential use of V alpha 8-V beta 13 and V alpha 11-V beta 18 combinations was found in clones from the same donor. Understanding the details of the interaction of antigenic peptides with the major histocompatibility complex and TCR molecules should provide the theoretical basis to design T-cell epitopes and obtain more immunogenic vaccines.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory condition of the central nervous system with similarities to multiple sclerosis. In both diseases, circulating leukocytes penetrate the blood-brain barrier and damage myelin, resulting in impaired nerve conduction and paralysis. We sought to identify the adhesion receptors that mediate the attachment of circulating leukocytes to inflamed brain endothelium in EAE, because this interaction is the first step in leukocyte entry into the central nervous system. Using an in vitro adhesion assay on tissue sections, we found that lymphocytes and monocytes bound selectively to inflamed EAE brain vessels. Binding was inhibited by antibodies against the integrin molecule alpha 4 beta 1, but not by antibodies against numerous other adhesion receptors. When tested in vivo, anti-alpha 4 integrin effectively prevented the accumulation of leukocytes in the central nervous system and the development of EAE. Thus, therapies designed to interfere with alpha 4 beta 1 integrin may be useful in treating inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis.

C., SANCHEZMADRID, F., Steinman, L., Karin, N. Anti-I-A antibodies, administered in vivo at the time of S-antigen injection, suppress development of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in Lewis rats. While the effects of anti-I-A are profound, the exact mechanism for this suppression is unknown. We attempted adoptive transfer of this form of suppression by injecting lymphocytes from anti-I-A-treated animals into syngeneic recipients which were later injected with S-antigen. Histologically, globes of 75% of the anti-I-A-treated animals showed no inflammation while 25% of these animals developed mild uveitis. In the group of animals which were injected with S-antigen and also received spleen cells from anti-I-A-treated rats, only 1 showed mild uveitis while the remaining 7 had no inflammation. The animals undergoing adoptive transfer of spleen cells and which were primed with an irrelevant antigen, readily developed uveitis. Suppression of S-antigen-induced EAU was abrogated by pretreatment of donor animals with cyclophosphamide. In vitro studies revealed that spleen cells of S-antigen-primed, anti-I-A-treated donors specifically suppressed lymphocyte responses to S-antigen. These in vivo and in vitro results suggest that generation of antigen-specific suppressor cells play a role in the anti-I-A immunotherapy of EAU.

View details for ASSOCIATION OF SUSCEPTIBILITY TO MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS WITH TCR GENES With the aim of investigating the distribution of T cells expressing different T-cell receptors (TCR) in the inflamed synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis patients, we have used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify TCR V alpha and V beta transcripts from synovial biopsies obtained by arthroscopy from patients with arthritis of variable duration. From each of nine patients a single biopsy was taken. Southern hybridization analysis of amplified products revealed extensive heterogeneity of TCR V beta in most patients. On the other hand, restriction in V alpha gene expression was seen in several patients. A highly restricted V alpha repertoire was observed in all cases with arthritis of short duration. In addition, two of three samples of short duration yielded a more limited number of V beta transcripts than the others. No conformity was, however, seen in usage of individual V alpha and V beta transcripts among the investigated patients. The present data thus demonstrate variability in synovial TCR expression between rheumatoid arthritis patients, but they also indicate a development towards greater diversity with increasing disease duration, implicating the necessity for careful choice of cases, preferentially selecting for early stages of disease, when further analysing rheumatoid synovial T cells for TCR usage as well as for antigen specificity.

Expression of granulocyte (G) and granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony stimulating factor (CSF) genes in human cells of astroglial lineage was studied. Primers for CSFs were used to analyze RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma cell lines and 8 fresh brain specimens by polymerase chain reaction. Constitutive expression of mRNA transcripts of GM-CSF could be detected in all astrocytoma and one neuroblastoma cell lines, and two out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U87MG and U138 MG, expressed G-CSF genes. After stimulation with interleukin (IL)-1 beta + tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, all cell lines expressed G-CSF. In addition to the cultured cells, we examined gene expression within human malignant astrocytoma, peritumoral brain and autopsied normal brains. The results show that some of the tumor and its surrounding reactive lesions express G- and GM-CSF genes but normal brains do not. The concentration of G- and GM-CSF in supernatants of cultured cells was assessed at the protein level by ELISA. A low level of GM-CSF activity was constitutively present in all astrocytomas. G-CSF was detected in unstimulated U87MG and U138MG and other cell lines could synthesize G-CSF after the stimulation of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha at the level of mRNA. Furthermore, the concentration of CSFs increased markedly upon stimulation with IL-1 beta and/or TNF-alpha in both a time- and dose-dependent fashion. From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived CSFs may participate in local immune reactions accompanying infection, degeneration and malignancies in the brain.

This study has led to novel immunotherapeutic approaches, many of which are based on the administration of synthetic peptides. Since short peptides are understood to be the minimal antigenic units bound by MHC molecules for recognition by T cells, they are attractive experimental tools for finely modulating specific immune responses. It is clear that a large number of defined peptides can dramatically influence the course of EAE. Table IV lists a number of potential mechanisms which may mediate disease prevention. Increasing evidence supports the idea that prevention of autoimmune disease can result from MHC-blockade by peptides which competitively bind to class II molecules. However, for some peptides such as the perplexing partial agonist Ac1-11[4A], the mechanism by which these precisely defined units act is not yet fully understood. Numerous hurdles hinder immediate clinical application of peptide-based immunotherapy. Nevertheless, the knowledge gained by probing experimental autoimmunity with defined peptides promises to inspire original and practical approaches to treating human autoimmune disease. EAE: a model for immune intervention with synthetic peptides. Smilek, D. E., Gautam, A. M., Pearson, C., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. Expression of lymphokine genes in the human astroglial cell lineage was studied. Primers for 9 different human lymphokines, from IL-1 alpha to IL-8, were used to analyze RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma cell lines and fresh brain specimens by PCR. mRNA transcripts for IL-8 were detected in all neuroglial cells. In addition to the cultured cells, we examined IL-8 gene expression within human malignant astrocytoma, peritumoral brain and autopsied normal brains. The result shows that tumor and cells of the surrounding reactive lesion express IL-8 genes, but it is not expressed in normal brains. Next, the concentration of IL-8 in supernatants of cultured cells was measured quantitatively by a solid phase ELISA assay. IL-8 activity was produced constitutively in all astrocytomas and increased markedly upon stimulation with IL-1 beta or TNF alpha, in both a time- and dose-dependent fashion. From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived IL-8 may take part in neutrophil-mediated inflammation which accompanies infection, degeneration and malignancy in the brain.

View details for Prevention of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by antibodies against a4b1 integrin Steinman L, Yednock T, Cannon C, Fritz L, Sanchez-Madrid F, Karin N Expression of the Cytokine genes in human astroglial cell lineage was studied. Primers for 5 different human cytokine, TNF-alpha, -beta, IFN-gamma, G-CSF and GM-CSF, were used to analyze messenger RNA transcripts in 5 cultured human astrocytoma, one neuroblastoma cell lines and fresh brain specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Three out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U138, U251, U373 MG and IMR32 neuroblastoma cells expressed TNF-alpha genes. After stimulation with IL-1 beta (1000 U/ml) all these cell lines expressed TNF-alpha genes. TNF-beta genes could not be detected in these cell lines even in the presence of any cytokine stimuli. We were able to detect expression of IFN-gamma genes within 2 astrocytoma cell lines (U87MG and A172), which interestingly did not show TNF-alpha activity. Constitutive expression of mRNA transcripts of GM -CSF could be detected in all astrocytoma and two out of 5 unstimulated astrocytomas, U87MG and U138MG, expressed G-CSF genes. After stimulation with IL-1 beta, all cell lines expressed G-CSF. In addition, we also examined gene expression of these cytokines within 4 human malignant astrocytoma specimens, 2 peritumoral brain and 2 autopsied normal brains. The results show that tumor and surrounding lesions express TNF-alpha (4 of 6), TNF-beta (1/6), IFN-gamma (4/6), G-CSF (3/6) and GM-CSF (5/6) but not normal brains. One tumor specimen also expresses TNF-beta as well as TNF-alpha genes (case 2). From these results, it is suspected that astroglial cell-derived cytokines may participate in local immune reactions accompanying glioma in the brain. PROSPECTS FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY DIRECTED TO THE T-CELL RECEPTOR IN HUMAN AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASE Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an experimental demyelinating disease of rodents. In (PL/J x SJL) F1 mice, it is induced by immunization with the myelin basic protein peptide Ac1-11. Ac1-11 [4A], a myelin basic protein peptide analog with a single amino acid substitution, (i) binds to class II major histocompatibility complex molecules and stimulates encephalitogenic T cells in vitro better than Ac1-11, (ii) is nonimmunogenic and nonencephalitogenic in vivo in (PL/J x SJL)F1 mice, (iii) prevents EAE when administered before or at the time of immunization with Ac1-11, and (iv) prevents EAE when administered later, near the time of disease onset. Initial studies suggest that Ac1-11 [4A] does not prevent EAE by competitive inhibition or by activation of regulatory cells. Thus, substitution of a single amino acid in a myelin basic protein peptide confers the capacity to prevent rather than induce EAE, even after peptide-specific encephalitogenic T cells have been activated.

Expression of T-cell-receptor (TCR) V alpha and V beta genes in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) of 29 patients, 15 melanomas and 14 malignant glial tumors (glioma and medulloblastoma), was investigated. The identification and propagation of T cells with anti-tumor reactivity is crucial to the understanding of the human immune response to tumors, which may possibly be useful in the successful implementation of adoptive immunotherapy against cancer. Despite clinical evidence that a more favorable prognosis is associated with the degree of lymphocyte infiltration within a tumor, the actual role of TIL remains uncertain. In order to address this question, we examined the diversity of the RNA transcripts of TCR genes in TILs within 29 specimens obtained at surgery. Using the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) method and primers for 18 different human TCR V alpha and 21 V beta families to analyze TCR V-(D)-J-C gene rearrangements, we detected a limited expression of TCR variable-region V alpha genes of TILs. TCR V beta gene rearrangements were more diverse than those for V alpha. In addition to restricted usage of TCR V alpha genes, preferential expression of V alpha 7 genes was found in 20 out of 29 cases (69%). Predominant usage of V alpha 7 genes was more remarkable in melanoma TILs (14/15) than in glial tumor TILs (6/14). These findings were also confirmed by Southern blot analysis with oligonucleotide probes for the constant (C) region of TCR alpha and beta chains. We suspect that some specific T-cell populations may be directed to antigenic determinants in melanoma cells.

E., Wraith, D. C., Hodgkinson, S., Dwivedy, S., Steinman, L., McDevitt, H. O. Expression of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within primary and metastatic melanoma specimens was studied. In order to analyze TCR gene transcription in TILs within these tissues, we analyzed reverse transcribed complementary DNA from mRNA directly from tissues using the polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction-amplified products were confirmed by dot or Southern blot hybridization with C alpha or C beta oligoprobes. First, we investigated the diversity of TCR V alpha and V beta gene usage in human malignant melanoma patients with multiple metastasis. We found in one patient, bearing multiple skin lesions, that the patterns of TCR V alpha and V beta repertoires in different sites of the skin (leg and chest wall) were almost the same. However, in another patient with skin and brain melanomas, different TCR repertoires were presented. Next, we examined the usage of murine TCR V beta genes in TILs within the primary and metastatic sites (liver, lung, and brain) of C57BL/6 mice bearing B16-F10 murine melanoma. The population of TILs in each primary and metastatic site expressed from one to four TCR V beta genes. In each metastatic site, the profile of TCR V beta gene expression was different. A different TCR V beta usage in TILs distributed within metastases of various organs may reflect differences in tumor antigenicity at these sites or may be due to differential homing patterns to these tumors.

Many lessons that have been learned in an animal model of central nervous system demyelinating disease, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, also apply to multiple sclerosis and certain successful approaches for the treatment of this disease are now being attempted in humans.

Some investigators have proposed myoblast transfer as a potential therapy for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Little is known about the immunobiology of myoblast transplantation. Transplantation rejection is mediated to a large extent by CD8+ T cells, which recognize alloantigens encoded by class I HLA genes, and by CD4+ T cells, which recognize alloantigens encoded by class II HLA genes. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is a potent inducer of HLA class II molecules as well as beta 2-microglobulin, which is co-expressed with HLA class I. IFN-gamma may be a critical cytokine involved in graft rejection. We purified human myoblasts by flow cytometry and incubated them in vitro for varying time periods with recombinant human IFN-gamma. The inducibility of HLA-DR and -DP molecules raises a note of caution concerning possible rejection phenomenon which might occur following myoblast transplantation.

To study antitumor immunity in patients with choroidal melanoma, T cells were generated from the peripheral blood of choroidal melanoma patients by mixed lymphocyte/tumor cell culture (MLTC). Because autologous tumors are generally unavailable, an allogeneic choroidal melanoma cell line, OCM-1, was used as the specific stimulus. Lymphocyte cultures from 27 patients were characterized by cell-surface phenotypes, patterns of reactivity towards cells of the melanocytic origin and T-cell-receptor gene usage. Antimelanoma reactivity was found in cell-sorter-purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. To analyze this reactivity, sorter-purified CD4+ and CD8+ cells from a MLTC were cloned by limiting dilution in the presence of exogenous interleukin-2 and interleukin-4 as well as irradiated OCM-1. Under these conditions, CD4+ T cells did not proliferate, perhaps because of the absence of antigen-presenting cells. However, CD8+ grew vigorously and 29 cytolytic CD8+ T cell clones were isolated. On the basis of their pattern of lysis of OCM-1, a skin melanoma cell line M-7 and its autologous lymphoblastoid cell line LCL-7, the clones were categorized into three groups. Group 1, representing 52% of the clones, lysed all three target cells, and are alloreactive. However, since OCM-1 and M-7 did not share class I antigens, these clones recognized cross-reactive epitope(s) of the histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) molecule. Group 2, constituting 28% of the clones, lysed both the ocular and skin melanoma cell lines but not LCL-7, and were apparently melanoma-specific. Unlike classical HLA-restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes, these T cells might mediate the lysis of melanoma cells via other ligands or a more degenerate type of HLA restriction. For the latter, the HLA-A2 and -A28 alleles would have to act interchangeably as the restriction element for shared melanoma-associated antigen(s). Group 3, representing only 10% of the T cell clones, was cytotoxic only to OCM-1, but not to M-7 or LCL-7. These clones may recognize antigens unique to ocular melanoma cells. Our data suggest that choroidal melanoma patients can recognize melanoma-associated antigens common to both ocular and cutaneous melanoma cells, and presumbly their autologous tumor. Thus, choroidal melanoma, like its skin counterpart, may be responsive to immunotherapeutic regimens such as active specific or adoptive cellular immunotherapy.

Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a T cell mediated model of demyelinating disease that develops as a result of an autoimmune response to the myelin structural antigen, myelin basic protein (MBP). Much information has accumulated on the nature of trimolecular interactions which lead to the activation of self-reactive T lymphocytes in this disorder. Many parallels exist in the etiopathogenesis of EAE and multiple sclerosis (MS). Based upon these similarities selective immunotherapy that targets either class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex or T cell receptor variable region genes will be described for EAE with consideration given to application of these principles in MS.

R., Posner, M. R., Mitchell, M. S. Oligonucleotide probes were used to investigate the role of DQ beta molecules in susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. Although shared amino acid and nucleotide sequences in DQ beta 1 have been suggested to be critical in disease development, we find that the distribution of sequences corresponding to residues 71-77 is not greater in patients versus controls.

View details for THE DEVELOPMENT OF RATIONAL STRATEGIES FOR SELECTIVE IMMUNOTHERAPY AGAINST AUTOIMMUNE DEMYELINATING DISEASE Chimeric (murine/human) anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody was infused into seven patients with mycosis fungoides. Successive patients received doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg of antibody twice a week for 3 consecutive weeks. All patients had some clinical improvement, but responses were of relatively short duration. Serum levels of chimeric antibody varied as a function of dose. At the 80-mg dose level, antibody was readily observed in biopsied skin lesions. Although there was coating by antibody of most CD4 positive cells in the blood, there was no significant depletion of CD4 positive cells. Low-level antibody responses against the mouse Ig variable region and human Ig allotypic constant region determinants were observed in several patients, but none were of clinical significance. All but two patients made primary antibody and T-cell proliferative responses to a simultaneously administered foreign protein test antigen. However, there was marked suppression of the mixed lymphocyte reaction. We conclude that at the dose levels studied, a chimeric anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (1) had some clinical efficacy against mycosis fungoides; (2) was well tolerated; (3) had a low level of immunogenicity; (4) had immediate immunosuppressive effects; and (5) did not induce tolerance to a co-injected antigen.

We isolated a complementary DNA clone encoding a 52-kd protein recognized by an anti-neuronal cell antibody in serum from a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration associated with uterine carcinoma. The recombinant protein expressed in prokaryotic cells was specifically recognized by the anti-neuronal cell antibody from the patient, and its molecular weight was identical to that of antigenic proteins in the cerebellum. The deduced protein consisted of 450 amino acids dominated by hydrophilic residues, the calculated relative molecular mass was 51,238, and the predicted value of the isoelectric point was 4.99. This complementary DNA sequence and the deduced protein sequence have not been reported previously, and the sequences showed no homologies with the complimentary DNA or the amino acid sequences in the GenBank, EMBL, or NBRF databases, including the complementary DNA for a 34-kd cerebellar protein (CDR34) that is recognized by an anti-Purkinje cell antibody. Unexpectedly, the transcript of this gene was detected not only in the cerebellum and the brain stem but also in an extraneural tissue, the intestine.

Over the past decade monoclonal antibodies have been successfully employed in a number of animal models of autoimmune disease. We have used antibodies to the class II gene products of the major histocompatibility complex, the CD4 molecule on helper T cells, and the T-cell receptor. Monoclonal anti-class II antibodies have been administered to treat paralytic disease in the animal model of multiple sclerosis--experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These antibodies not only reverse acute paralytic disease but also decrease the number of relapses in a model of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis when given after the first attack. The advantage of this form of therapy is that it is haplotype specific. In other words, in a heterozygous individual it is possible to block the major histocompatibility gene associated with disease susceptibility while leaving other major histocompatibility gene products free for antigen presentation. Thus, animals given this form of immunotherapy are not significantly immunosuppressed. Antibodies to the CD4 molecule have been equally effective in treating animal models of autoimmunity. We and others have reversed ongoing paralysis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Relapses have been diminished after the administration of anti-CD4. Antibodies to CD4 have been used successfully to treat animal models of systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia gravis. Recent trials with anti-CD4 have been successful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The latter trial employed a chimeric human/mouse antibody. Antibodies to the variable region of the T-cell receptor have been employed to treat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ISOLATION OF A COMPLEMENTARY-DNA CLONE ENCODING AN AUTOANTIGEN RECOGNIZED BY AN ANTINEURONAL CELL ANTIBODY FROM A PATIENT WITH PARANEOPLASTIC CEREBELLAR DEGENERATION Sakai, K., Mitchell, D.

Genomic DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes and brain plaques of patients with MS was analyzed for the presence of sequences homologous to the HTLV-I pol gene using the polymerase chain reaction and dot blot techniques. Comparison of DNA amplification patterns between patients with MS, and with control subjects who have other autoimmune conditions, with those in healthy control subjects and with an HTLV-I-infected cell line indicates that HTLV-I pol sequence is not present in the peripheral blood of patients with MS, and that the virus is not active in MS brain plaques.

Anticipatory grief is similar to the normal process of mourning, but it happens before the actual death. It is in anticipation of the death. Mourning is usually discussed in context of the family and loved ones of a dying person. Anticipatory grief can be felt by the family, loved ones, and the child dying. Anticipatory grief happens before death. This is often as a result of a terminal diagnosis or a life-threatening illness, when death is a possibility. This grief has some common stages. But each person and family is different and experiences grief, death, and illness in their own way. What are the different phases of anticipatory grief? Each person expresses grief and bereavement in his or her own way and time. Anticipatory grief may include the following phases, in any order. Grief is often an expression that includes each of these phases or stages in multiple times, intensities, and orders: In this stage, the person realizes that death is inevitable and has no expectation for a cure. Sadness and depression often occur with this first stage. The next phase is concern for the dying person. Family members may regret arguments or disciplining the dying child. For the dying child, concern may increase for him or herself and his or her own fears of death. The child may also be worried about the emotions expressed by loved ones. In this phase, the actual death may be ""rehearsed."" The physical process of death and what may happen after death are concerns in this phase. Funeral arrangements and saying good-bye to loved ones may occur as a result of some anticipatory grieving. In the last phase, loved ones may be imagining what their lives are going to be like without the person who is dying. Parents may be thinking about the unused toys left behind, missed proms and birthdays, or even what they are going to tell the child's teachers when school is missed. Siblings may wonder what it will be like to lose their brother or sister. The person dying may think about life after death.

1c2d0640-4b50-4c58-b72e-fccedbe71d22,"FDA Approves 2 New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: What You Need to Know There are two pieces of encouraging news for people with progressive and relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The news comes in the form of two new drugs recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). On March 26, FDA officials the Novartis drug, Mayzent (siponimod), for various forms of multiple sclerosis, including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), and active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Novartis officials said the pill will be available sometime in early April. They noted that Mayzent, a tablet taken once a day, is the first treatment specifically for people with active SPMS in more than 15 years. The annual price tag is expected to be for the treatment. On March 29, the FDA also EMD Serono’s (cladribrine), also for RRMS and active SPMS but not for clinically isolated syndrome. Company officials told Healthline the annual price tag is expected to be $99,500 for the two-year treatment. There are nearly living with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States and about worldwide. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society states that people with RRMS have a 50 percent chance of progressing to SPMS within the first 10 years. Another 90 percent have a chance of transitioning after 25 years. People with relapsing remitting forms of MS currently have 15 FDA-approved disease modifying treatments (DMTs). People living with SPMS now have three choices. The last MS treatment by the FDA was ocrelizumab in 2017. It entered the market with a $65,000 annual . Here’s a look at the two drugs approved by the FDA last week. In 2010, the FDA Gilenya, the company’s widely used drug for MS treatment. Novartis last year, seeking to block the sales of generic versions of Gilenya after the drug’s main patent expires in August. “Mayzent works to sequester certain white blood cells in lymph nodes. These are considered important in inflammatory response in MS. If they can’t get out into system then they can’t cause over inflammation in MS.” , a nurse practitioner at the Johns Hopkins Multiple Sclerosis Center in Maryland and the associate vice president of healthcare access for National Multiple Sclerosis Society. In the phase III trial of Mayzent with 1,651 patients, the fraction of patients with confirmed progression of disability was statistically significantly lower in the Mayzent group than in the placebo group. Patients treated with Mayzent had a 55 percent relative reduction in annualized relapse rate. “This drug crosses the blood brain barrier,” explained , a neurologist at the University of California San Francisco. “We’re not exactly sure what it does, but the results show it slows progression in those with later stage of disease.” “The immune system is activated in the periphery and dives into brain and causes havoc,” he added. “We believe that in progressive MS cells get into the brain and destroy from the inside out. This medication works in the brain. Others work in the periphery.” Side effects common during the trials included headaches, elevations in blood pressures, increase in liver enzyme, and a reduction in white blood cell counts that might cause infection. Novartis shared with Healthline that it has developed a comprehensive patient support program for Mayzent, to help patients navigate insurance coverage and identify resources for those who are uninsured or underinsured. “Mayzent has been demonstrated to have a modest but statistically significant effect on slowing progression in persons with SPMS who are still ambulatory with or without a device,” , professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles and clinical director of the UCLA MS program, told Healthline. Officials at Merck KGaA, the parent company of EMD Serono, said in a that Mavenclad is the “the first ever oral treatment to provide two years of proven efficacy with a maximum of 20 days of treatment.” Mavenclad is taken for 8 to 10 days in each of the two years of treatment. There are no other treatments needed. In the phase III study of Mavenclad with 1,976 participants, patients experienced a in annual relapse rate and a 33 percent reduction in rate of disability progression measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). They also experienced a lower number of lesions compared to the placebo group. Mavenclad works by targeting certain white blood cells (lymphocytes) that lead the immune attack in MS. The drug temporarily reduces the number of certain lymphocytes without continuous suppression of the immune system. Risks include upper respiratory tract infection, headache, herpes, alopecia, and lymphopenia. Serious adverse reactions reported in the clinical program included malignancies. The company states that due to its safety profile this drug is generally recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. “Price to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his/her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out of pocket cost,” EMD Serono officials told Healthline. “Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans.” “We are committed to helping support patients who are prescribed Mavenclad. offers personalized patient support, including assistance with navigating insurance coverage questions and additional resources that may be able to help eligible patients who are uninsured or underinsured,” company officials added. The availability of the new drugs is being tempered by their high costs. “While we are grateful to have another treatment available for people with MS, one with a more convenient delivery option, this benefit is overshadowed by the high list price,” said , executive vice president of advocacy for the National MS Society. “To have a new MS treatment priced just shy of six figures a year is disheartening,” Talente told Healthline. “This also illustrates the distorting effect of drug prices in the United States.” Talente said price and a company’s commitment to its patients go hand in hand. Choosing which medication is right is a basic risk benefit equation,” added West. “It is a different equation for everybody. More options mean a better chance to find a great solution for each patient. It’s about matching the right medicine to the right patient at the right time.” West was a paid consultant for Mavenclad and has been compensated by Novartis on other projects in an advisory manner.

Blood tests can help your doctor rule out conditions such as that trigger some of the same symptoms as MS. This puts your doctor one step closer to making an accurate diagnosis. Since symptoms come and go, and there isn’t one test that provides a conclusive diagnosis, it can take a long time to diagnose MS. shows a great deal of promise, but more clinical studies are needed. While the wait may be frustrating, each test will help eliminate or confirm other potential causes for your symptoms. A number of conditions cause symptoms similar to those of MS. All of these should be investigated. Some, like (PML) virus and , can be identified with an MRI.

Symptoms that lupus and MS share include: Like MS, there isn’t a single test for lupus. A blood test that is positive for and other antibodies may indicate lupus or some other autoimmune disease, but not MS. Treatment for lupus depends on your symptoms. , better known as Devic’s disease, is a rare immunological disorder that is strikingly similar to MS. The two conditions share many symptoms, including: A test called the NMO-IgG blood test will be negative in people with MS, but positive in of people with Devic’s disease. Devic’s disease doesn’t respond to the same disease-modifying medications as MS. It can be treated with steroids and other immune-suppressing drugs. Certain vitamin deficiencies, such as a lack of , can cause symptoms that mimic those of MS. , common in both B-12 deficiency and MS, is damage to the protective covering that surrounds nerve fibers within the central nervous system. Symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency include numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, weakness, and fatigue. Copper, , and deficiencies can also cause neurological symptoms. A simple blood test can check the levels of essential vitamins in your blood. Your doctor can walk you through treatment plan with supplements and dietary changes. To reach the diagnosis of MS, your doctor must find: damage in two distinct areas of the central nervous system that the areas of damage developed at two different points in time Generally, a series of tests are needed to meet the criteria for diagnosis. In addition to symptom history and blood tests, your doctor might also order the following tests. An is painless, noninvasive, and can produce detailed images. Performed both with and without contrast dye, an MRI can identify lesions on the brain and spinal cord. The images can show if the lesions are old, new, or currently active. In addition to diagnosis, an MRI can help monitor disease progression. Although can’t rule out or confirm MS, it can help with diagnosis. Spinal fluid is obtained from a needle inserted between the bones of your lower spine. In people with MS, the spinal fluid sometimes contains elevated levels of IgG antibodies or proteins called oligoclonal bands, which could also be caused by some other diseases. About of people with MS have no spinal fluid abnormalities. This involves staring at a screen with an alternating checkerboard pattern. This helps determine if there’s any impairment of your optic nerve pathways. After diagnosis, the next step is to discuss treatment options with your doctor. There’s a growing list of disease-modifying drugs designed to reduce relapses and slow disease progression in relapsing MS. These drugs haven’t been shown to work for progressive types of MS. These powerful drugs must be taken consistently to be effective, and they can have serious side effects. Be sure to discuss the pros and cons of each with your doctor. Other symptoms, such as fatigue, can also be treated. Your doctor can refer you to local resources to learn about MS. You may find it helpful to join an MS support group, either or in person. Although everyone’s experiences with MS are different, it might help to share your experiences with others. There’s no cure for MS, so management is a lifetime commitment. In addition to your general doctor, you’ll also need a neurologist on your healthcare team to evaluate symptoms and monitor disease progression. Sometimes MS can lead to severe disability, but most people continue to have a good quality of life and can expect a normal lifespan. — — Medically reviewed by Multiple sclerosis can be difficult to diagnosis.

b3669cc3-1cd3-4c89-acd4-b019b4150ef7,"— — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is often diagnosed when people are in their 20s and 30s. The disease typically follows a pattern, moving through different variations or types over the years. This is because as you get older, your MS symptoms are likely to change. MS damages myelin, the protective coating around nerves. This damage interrupts the flow of nerve impulses from the brain to the body. The greater the damage that’s done to the myelin, the more severe your symptoms will become. Everyone with MS is different. How quickly your disease progresses and the symptoms you experience won’t necessarily be the same as someone else’s with the condition. Your doctor can’t predict exactly how your disease will change over time. But advances in MS research are offering better treatments to slow the disease’s progression and improve the outlook for people living with MS. MS often starts with a single attack. Suddenly your vision becomes blurry, or your legs feel numb or weak. When these symptoms last for at least 24 hours and this is the first attack, they’re called clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CIS typically starts between ages 20 and 40. It’s caused by inflammation or damage to myelin in your central nervous system. CIS can be a warning of MS to come, but that isn’t always the case. Between of people with CNS will develop MS. If an MRI shows signs of brain lesions, MS is much more likely to develop. Up to of people with MS are first diagnosed with RRMS. It typically starts when people are in their 20s or 30s, although it can begin earlier or later in life. In RRMS, attacks on myelin produce periods of symptom flare-ups called relapses. During a relapse, symptoms may include: Each relapse can last from a few days to a few months. The exact symptoms and their severity can be different for each person. After a relapse, you’ll enter a symptom-free period called remission. Each remission lasts for several months or years. The disease doesn’t progress during remission. Some people stay in RRMS for many decades. Others progress to the secondary-progressive form within a few years. It’s impossible to predict how each person’s disease will act, but new treatments are helping to slow the progression of MS overall. About of people with MS are diagnosed with the primary progressive form. PPMS usually appears during the mid to late 30s. In PPMS, nervous system damage and symptoms steadily get worse over time. There are no real remission periods. The disease continues to progress, and it can eventually lead to problems walking and performing other daily activities. SPMS is the stage that follows RRMS. In this type of MS, myelin damage gets worse over time. You won’t have the long remissions that you had with RRMS. Increasing nervous system damage will lead to more severe symptoms. In the past, about with RRMS moved into the SPMS stage within 10 years, and transitioned to SPMS within 25 years. With new MS drugs, fewer people are progressing to SPMS, and the transition is happening much more slowly. Experts don’t yet know how long these treatments can delay the progression to SPMS. MS is a disease that starts early in life but progresses over time. Most people start with the relapsing-remitting form, alternating periods of symptoms called relapses with symptom-free periods called remissions. Without treatment, the disease continues to the secondary-progressive form. Yet new and more effective treatments are slowing MS progression, sometimes for decades. — — Advancing MS: Coping with Depression, Stress, and Anger Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Depression and MS: Ways to Care for Your Mental Health If you have MS, you're at an increased risk of developing depression.

9c9981ab-400d-4876-a705-fcbb3165e533,"Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis — — Secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis. It’s considered the next stage after relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). With SPMS, there are no longer any signs of remission. This means that the condition is worsening despite treatment. However, treatment is still recommended at times to help reduce attacks and hopefully slow the progression of disability. This stage is common. In fact, most people with MS will develop SPMS at some point if not on an effective disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Knowing the signs of SPMS can help you detect it early. The sooner your treatment starts, the better your doctor will be able to help you reduce new symptoms and worsening of your disease. MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that comes in different forms and affects people differently. According to , about 90 percent of those with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS. In the RRMS stage, the first noticeable symptoms include: RRMS symptoms can come and go. Some people might not have any symptoms for several weeks or months, a phenomenon called remission. MS symptoms can come back, too, though this is called a flare-up. People can also develop new symptoms. This is called an attack, or relapse. A relapse typically lasts for several days to several weeks. The symptoms can gradually worsen initially and then improve gradually over time without treatment or sooner with IV steroids. RRMS is unpredictable. At some point, many people with RRMS no longer have periods of remission or sudden relapses. Instead, their MS symptoms continue and worsen without any break. Continued, worsening symptoms indicate that RRMS has progressed to SPMS. This usually occurs 10 to 15 years after the first MS symptoms. However, SPMS can be delayed or even possibly prevented if started on effective MS DMTs early on in the disease course. Similar symptoms exist within all forms of MS. But SPMS symptoms are progressive and don’t improve over time. During the early stages of RRMS, symptoms are noticeable, but they aren’t necessarily severe enough to interfere with everyday activities. Once MS progresses to the secondary-progressive stage, symptoms become more challenging. SPMS develops as a result of neuronal loss and atrophy. If you notice your symptoms becoming worse without any remission or noticeable relapse, an MRI scan may aid in the diagnosis. MRI scans can show the level of cell death and brain atrophy. An MRI will show increased contrast during an attack because leaking of the capillaries during an attack causes a greater uptake of the gadolinium dye used in MRI scans. SPMS is marked by the absence of relapses, but it’s still possible to have an attack of symptoms, also known as a flare-up. Flare-ups are usually worse in heat and during times of stress. Currently, there are 14 DMTs used for relapsing forms of MS, including SPMS that continues to have relapses. If you were taking one of these drugs to treat RRMS, your doctor may have you on it until it stops controlling disease activity. Other types of treatment can help improve symptoms and quality of life. These include: Clinical trials test new types of medicine and therapies on volunteers in order to improve treatment for SPMS. This process gives researchers a clearer sense of what’s effective and safe. Volunteers in clinical trials may be among the first to get new treatments, but some risk is involved. The treatments may not help with SPMS, and in some cases, they may come with serious side effects. Importantly, precautions should be in place to keep volunteers safe, as well as protect their personal information. Participants in clinical trials generally need to meet certain guidelines. When deciding whether to take part, it’s important to ask like how long the trial will last, what the potential side effects might include, and why researchers think it’ll help. The lists clinical trials in the United States, though the COVID-19 pandemic may have delayed planned studies. Clinical trials currently listed as recruiting include one for , which may slow the progression of SPMS, as well as research into whether different types of therapy can help people with MS . Another trial aims to test whether can help people with progressive MS stay mobile and protect the brain. And a clinical trial is set to finish later this year of cells. Its goal is to test the safety and efficacy of stem cell treatment in people with progressive MS. Progression refers to symptoms becoming measurably worse over time. At some points, SPMS may be described as “without progression,” meaning it doesn’t seem to be measurably worsening. Progression varies considerably among people with SPMS. In time, some may need to use a wheelchair, but remain able to walk, possibly using a cane or walker. Modifiers are that indicate whether your SPMS is active or inactive. This helps inform conversations with your doctor about possible treatments and what you can expect going forward. For example, in the case of SPMS that’s active, you might discuss new treatment options. In contrast, with absent activity, you and your doctor may discuss using rehabilitation and ways to manage your symptoms with possibly a DMT that has less risk. The average life expectancy for people with MS tends to be about shorter than the general population. It’s not entirely clear why. Apart from severe cases of MS, which are rare, the main causes seem to be other medical conditions that also affect people generally, like cancer and heart and lung disease. Importantly, life expectancy for people with MS has increased in recent decades. It’s important to treat MS in order to manage symptoms and decrease disability worsening. Detecting and treating RRMS early can help prevent the onset of SPMS, but there’s still no cure. Though the disease will progress, it’s important to treat SPMS as early as possible. There’s no cure, but MS isn’t fatal, and medical treatments can significantly improve quality of life. If you have RRMS and are noticing worsening symptoms, it’s time to talk to your doctor. — — More in Finding Balance with Progressing Multiple Sclerosis Lifestyle Modifications That Make a Difference for Secondary Progressive MS Mobility Support Devices for Secondary Progressive MS: Braces, Walking Devices, and More FDA Approves 2 New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: What You Need to Know New Medication and Treatment Options for Secondary Progressive MS Support for Life with Secondary Progressive MS: Social, Financial, and More Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) is a chronic condition that causes new and more severe symptoms to develop over time.

The following are some of the key differences between RRMS and PPMS: RRMS is diagnosed earlier. Most people are diagnosed with RRMS in their 20s and 30s.PPMS is diagnosed later. Most people are diagnosed with PPMS in their 40s and 50s. People with RRMS tend to have more brain lesions with more inflammatory cells.Those with PPMS tend to have more spinal cord lesions and fewer inflammatory cells. RRMS affects women two to three times more often than men. People with RRMS will likely have mobility issues, but these issues are more gradual.People with PPMS often experience more mobility issues and have more trouble walking. In general, PPMS tends to affect the body’s ability to function more than RRMS does. For example, those with PPMS may also find it more difficult to continue working because of their mobility issues and declining neurologic function. As far as symptoms go, RRMS and PPMS are oftentimes very different from each other. People with RRMS enter periods of flare-ups and remission, while those with PPMS are in a continual phase of deterioration.

77314a19-dc77-4bf7-b9c7-5cc6306a7733,"New Drug Shows Promise in Treating Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis — Half of all people with MS are ultimately diagnosed with secondary progressive MS. This new treatment is the first to slow progression of the disease. Is a breakthrough treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) finally on the horizon? It’s still too early to answer that question, but in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a new Novartis drug called siponimod (BAF132) was able to delay progression of the disease in people with SPMS, many of whom had already reached a stage of advanced disability. The study, funded by Novartis, included 1,651 participants from 31 countries. The results were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal . After three months of use, siponimod was able to slow down the disease’s effects by 21 percent and reduced the risk of six-month disease progression by 26 percent. Participants who took a daily oral dose of siponimod also lost less brain volume, had fewer brain lesions, and reduced their number of annual relapses by 55 percent. However, siponimod didn’t improve how well the participants could walk. The results of this study show that siponimod “can delay disability progression in typical established SPMS patients, where other approaches tested so far have been unsuccessful,” Dr. Ludwig Kappos, a professor at University Hospital of Basel in Switzerland and the principal study investigator, said in a . “These data are all the more impressive when considering that the majority of patients already had advanced disability when starting treatment.” Other experts are more cautiously optimistic, pointing out that siponimod was tested against a placebo and for a relatively short amount of time. “There’s an indication that siponimod could be useful in SPMS, but we need more studies,” said Dr. Jaime Imitola, director of the Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Multidisciplinary Clinic and Translational Research Program at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. SPMS is an advanced form of MS, an autoimmune disease that disrupts the normal flow of information in the brain as well as between the brain and body. Symptoms vary from person to person, but numbness and tingling, trouble walking, extreme fatigue, dizziness, pain, depression, and even paralysis. The estimates that more than 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. At least two to three times more women than men are affected. The majority of people with MS initially receive a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). They experience occasional periods of time in which their symptoms improve or may even go away for a while. But within a decade of initial diagnosis, of people with RRMS progress to SPMS. With this form of MS, symptoms no longer wax or wane, but stick around — and get steadily worse. While researchers are always looking for new treatments for SPMS, so far other potential drugs haven’t produced . Of the 15 medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of RRMS, for SPMS. Siponimod is what’s known as a “disease-modifying therapy.” This is a type of drug that works to keep a disease from getting worse. By binding to lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and blocking them from entering the central nervous system, siponimod is able to reduce the inflammation that’s responsible for so many SPMS symptoms. “The challenge is going to be how to determine who is going to respond to this medicine and who will not,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “It looks like the younger and closer to the conversion to SPMS you are might be factors that contribute to a response to therapy. But until [siponimod] is used more broadly, it will be hard to know for sure.” Bebo expects the risks and side effects of siponimod to be similar to the immunosuppressive drug fingolimod (Gilenya), which has a similar mechanism of action. These include a slightly higher risk for infection, slowed heart rate, macular edema, and liver damage. Novartis plans to file for approval of siponimod for SPMS with the FDA this year, which means it could be available in late 2019 or early 2020. In the meantime, Imitola stresses that it’s important for patients with MS to get a prompt diagnosis and start treatment with a MS specialist as soon as possible. “Why wait until a patient is declared to have SPMS, around 10–15 years after relapses, to reduce progression?” Imitola asked. “If you stop the disease in its tracks early on with potent medications, then a patient may never get to SPMS. That is the goal. It’s clear that the next generation of MS medications are changing the natural history of the disease. We need more medications that tackle the neurodegeneration in MS.” — Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis.

670b51d8-75a7-4bf7-aa52-aaf118dc82c1,"Everything You Need to Know About Transitioning from RRMS to SPMS — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects your brain and the spinal cord. According to the National MS Society, about people over the age of 18 live with this condition in the United States. MS is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the CNS. This triggers inflammation and damages myelin, an insulating material that surrounds nerve fibers. The exact mechanism of how someone gets the disease is unknown. However, we do know that there is likely a combination of triggers including genetic and environmental factors. Damage to these fibers can trigger multiple neurological symptoms. This includes fatigue, numbness, weakness, cognitive problems, and issues with walking. The severity of your symptoms varies from person-to-person, and depends on the type of MS you have. Many people are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). But over time, symptoms can progress to another type of MS, known as secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Here’s what you need to know about both types of MS. RRMS refers to a type of MS in which you experience periods of new MS symptoms or relapses followed by periods of remission. Remission is when symptoms improve or disappear. During relapses, you may have new typical MS symptoms like numbness, tingling, and blurred vision. These symptoms can lasts for days, weeks, or months, and then slowly improve over weeks to months. Some people experience complete disappearance of their symptoms during remission. On the other hand, if your symptoms continue, they may not be as severe. About with MS receive an RRMS diagnosis at first. Many people experience progression of their symptoms after living with RRMS for some time. This means that the disease becomes more active, and periods of remission become less and less frequent. This stage of MS is known as secondary progressive multiple sclerosis or SPMS. This condition is best described as MS without relapses. MS affects everyone differently, and not everyone with RRMS will transition to SPMS. But SPMS only develops after an initial diagnosis of RRMS. You’ll have typical MS symptoms during the transition from RRMS to SPMS, but you may experience a slow worsening of symptoms. You may even develop new symptoms. Before, maybe you had numbness or mild weakness, and these didn’t interfere much with your daily life. Once you transition to SPMS, though, you may notice cognitive changes, such as difficulty finding words. You may also have increased difficulty with walking or more noticeable numbness and tingling. The cause of this transition is unknown, but it may have to do with the disappearance of nerve fibers as the result of progressive nerve damage. Or it may be connected to the progressive loss of grey matter, which can be more subtle. Some people transition soon after an MS diagnosis, whereas others live with RRMS for decades before transitioning to SPMS. Since MS symptoms are unpredictable, it can be difficult to distinguish an RRMS relapse from the onset of SPMS. Speak with your doctor if you feel that you’re experiencing new or worsening symptoms. Your doctor can use an imaging test like an MRI to examine inflammation in your brain. Based on the level of inflammation in your brain as well as your relapse history, your doctor can determine whether your symptoms are a new relapse or SPMS. Even though some people with RRMS eventually transition to SPMS, it’s possible to delay disease progression. Treating MS is key to improving your symptoms and quality of life, and ultimately, slowing down the disease. Your doctor can prescribe disease-modifying therapies to help decrease inflammation, which can also improve the severity and frequency of your attacks. These include injectable, oral, and infusion medications such as: These treatments and others can help with the relapsing forms of MS. Talk to your doctor to find out which one is best for you. You may also receive intravenous corticosteroids to reduce acute inflammation in your CNS. This helps speed up recovery from an MS relapse. MS is a progressive condition that can lead to disability. You may eventually require some type of rehabilitation to help with daily living. Programs vary based on your needs. If you’re having difficulty with speech or swallowing, you may receive assistance from a speech or language pathologist. Or you may need appointments with an occupational therapist if you’re having difficulty with personal care, housework, or employment. Lifestyle changes can help improve your symptoms, too. Regular exercise may reduce spasticity and joint stiffness. It can improve both your flexibility and your overall health. Plus, exercise increases the brain’s production of endorphins, which are hormones that help regulate your emotions and mood. To avoid injury, start slow with gentle activities like water aerobics or walking. It’s also important to stretch both before and after activity to reduce muscle spasms, which are common in MS. Learn how to pace yourself and set limits. Additionally, you’ll want to avoid foods that can increase inflammation. These include highly processed foods such as hamburgers and hot dogs and foods high in salt. Examples of foods that can reduce inflammation are whole foods such as green leafy vegetables, fish high in omega-3s, and fruits such as blackberries and raspberries. If you smoke, talk to your doctor about ways to quit. Some people feel better after confiding in a close friend or family member, or after joining a support group for MS. MS is a serious condition, but early treatment can help you achieve remission and slow the progression of the disease. Worsening of symptoms can also interfere with the quality of your life.

18044e9e-6311-419f-aa83-7edc3be07a52,"— Research shows that popular cholesterol-lowering drugs can protect the brain from atrophy, slowing disability in progressive MS. A new study published in reveals that a common cholesterol drug may help to slow disability in people with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). A research team led by Dr. Jeremy Chataway, a neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, found that high, daily doses of simvastatin, (sold under the brand name Zocor), reduced brain atrophy in people with progressive MS. Brain volume has been shown in earlier studies to be directly linked to disability. What is encouraging to note, said Dr. Timothy Coetzee, Chief Advocacy, Services and Research Officer at the National MS Society in an interview with Healthline, “is that cholesterol lowering therapies may hold promise for treating people with secondary progressive MS, for whom there are currently few treatment options.” Related News: Medical Marijuana May Ease MS Symptoms » Chataway’s team divided 140 people ages 18 to 65 with secondary-progressive MS into two groups. One group received simvastatin for two years while the other group took a placebo. The study was double-blinded, meaning that neither the researchers nor the participants knew who was on simvastatin and who was taking placebo. The participants had a yearly MRI scan to record the volume of their brains, as well as other tests including the EDSS, which is used to measure disability and progression in MS. At the end of two years, researchers found that the group taking simvastatin showed 43 percent less brain atrophy than the placebo group. And the simvastatin group experienced no more adverse events than the placebo group, suggesting that the drug was well tolerated. Read: Early Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis » According to the National Library of Medicine, was first approved for use in the U.S. in 1991. Like all statin drugs, simvastatin lowers LDL, or “bad” cholesterol, and in turn decreases the risk of heart attack and stroke. Two decades after its approval, simvastatin is still widely used to treat high cholesterol with “more than 40 million prescriptions being filled yearly.” Simvastatin is considered to be safe with minimal side effects, which, according to , can include constipation, nausea, headache, memory loss, and forgetfulness. Because there is also a slight risk of liver damage, people taking the drug should be monitored regularly. Learn the 12 Things You Should Never Say to Someone with a Chronic Health Condition » “We hope these are the first steps towards a treatment for secondary progressive MS,” Chataway told Healthline. Although it isn’t yet clear how statins prevent brain atrophy, Chataway theorizes, “perhaps they protect the blood vessels [or] endothelium.” Why statins are effective for progressive MS but not relapsing MS remains a mystery that only further research can solve. The more scientists learn about MS, the more they think there may be two different disease processes at work in relapsing and progressive forms of the disease, one that involves the body’s inflammatory immune response and another that does not. Chataway cautions that this was a small, phase 2 study, so he doesn’t recommend that people with progressive MS start to take simvastatin just yet. With these promising results, however, the next step will be to conduct a phase 3 study with 800 or more volunteers who have progressive MS. According to Chataway, large-scale studies will decide for certain how effective statins might be in treating this long neglected form of the disease. “It’s also proof of concept that you can repurpose a therapy successful in treating one disorder and target it for the successful treatment of something totally different,” Coetzee said. And because it’s already on the market as a generic cholesterol treatment, if simvastatin is approved for progressive MS, it is sure to be affordable.

5eb2be07-cabc-407c-a9de-6ab7f7488611,"Medically reviewed by — — Understanding the typical progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) and learning what to expect can help you gain a sense of control and make better decisions. MS occurs when the body’s immune system abnormally targets the central nervous system (CNS), though it’s not considered to be an autoimmune disorder. The attack on the CNS damages the myelin and the nerve fibers that the myelin protects. The damage disrupts or distorts the nerve impulses being sent down the spinal cord. People with MS generally follow one of four disease courses that vary in severity. The first stage to consider occurs before your doctor has made a diagnosis of MS. In this initial stage, you may have symptoms that you’re concerned about. Genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role in who gets MS. Perhaps MS runs in your family, and you’re worried about your likelihood of developing the disease. Maybe you’ve previously experienced symptoms that your doctor has told you might be indicative of MS. At this stage, your doctor can determine whether you’re at high risk for developing the condition based on your medical history and a physical exam. However, there is no definitive test to confirm the presence of MS and many of the symptoms also occur with other conditions, so the disease can be tough to diagnose. The next step on the continuum is receiving a diagnosis of MS. Your doctor will diagnose you with MS if there is clear evidence that, at two different points in time, you have had separate episodes of disease activity in your CNS. Often it can take time to make this diagnosis because other conditions must first be ruled out. These include CNS infections, CNS inflammatory disorders, and genetic disorders. In the new diagnosis stage, you will likely discuss treatment options with your doctor and learn new ways to manage everyday activities with your condition. There are different types and stages of MS. Learn more below about the different types. This is the first episode of symptoms caused by inflammation and damage to the myelin covering on nerves in the brain or spinal cord. Technically, CIS doesn’t meet the criteria for a diagnosis of MS as it’s an isolated incident with only one area of demyelination responsible for symptoms. If an MRI shows another episode in the past, a diagnosis of MS can be made. The type of MS generally follows a predictable pattern with periods in which symptoms worsen and then improve. Eventually it may progress to . According to the , around 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS. People with RRMS have flare-ups (relapses) of MS. Between the relapses, they have periods of remission. Over a few decades, the course of the disease is likely to change and become more complex. Relapsing-remitting MS can progress into a more aggressive form of the disease. The reports that, if left untreated, half of those with the relapsing-remitting form of the condition develop secondary-progressive MS within a decade of the first diagnosis. In secondary-progressive MS, you may still experience relapses. These are then followed by partial recoveries or periods of remission, but the disease doesn’t disappear between cycles. Instead, it steadily worsens. Approximately 15 percent of people are diagnosed with a relatively uncommon form of the disease, called primary-progressive MS. This form is characterized by slow and steady disease progression with no remission periods. Some people with primary-progressive MS experience occasional plateaus in their symptoms as well as minor improvements in function that tend to be temporary. There are variations in the progression rate over time. In addition to adults, children and adolescents can be diagnosed with MS. The reports that between 2 and 5 percent of all MS patients noticed symptoms that started before they were 18 years old. Pediatric MS follows a similar course of progression as the adult form of the disease with similar symptoms as well. However, some children experience additional symptoms, such as and . Also, the disease course may progress more slowly for younger people than it does for adults. There are a variety of treatment options available to a person diagnosed with MS. Your doctor and medical team can help you find the best combination of treatments to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Prescription treatments and medical interventions include: Any time you’re making a change to your treatment plan, consult your doctor first. Even natural remedies can interfere with medications or treatments you’re currently taking. When you’re aware of what to look for in each stage of MS, you can take better control of your life and seek appropriate treatments. Researchers continue to make strides in their understanding of the disease. Improved therapeutic advances, new technologies, and FDA-approved medications are having an impact on the underlying course of MS. Using your knowledge and working closely with your doctor can make MS easier to manage throughout the course of the disease. Are there any ways to slow the progression of MS? If so, what are they? Besides a healthy diet and exercise with stretching, make sure you are taking in enough Vitamin D since MS patients have been found to be deficient. And as always, taking MS medications regularly has been shown to slow the disease progress and prevent relapse. Answers represent the opinions of our medical experts.

1d47ed1f-f497-451d-af75-7b90f7a1b9f9,"Medication and Treatment for Primary Progressive MS — — is one of the four types of multiple sclerosis (MS). According to the , about 15 percent of people with MS receive a diagnosis of PPMS. Unlike other types of MS, PPMS progresses from the start without acute relapses or remissions. Although the disease usually progresses slowly and may take years to diagnose, it typically leads to problems with walking. There’s no known cause of MS. However, many treatments can help prevent the progression of . Most existing MS drugs are designed to control inflammation and reduce the number of relapses. However, PPMS causes significantly less inflammation than relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), the most common type of MS. In addition, although there might be occasional small degrees of improvement, PPMS doesn’t have remissions. Because it’s impossible to predict the course of PPMS progression in any individual who has it, it’s difficult for researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of a drug on the course of the disease. However, as of 2017, one PPMS drug has received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is FDA-approved to treat both PPMS and RRMS. It’s a monoclonal antibody that destroys certain B cells of the immune system. Research suggests that B cells are partially responsible for damage to the brain and spinal cord tissues of people with MS. This damage is enabled by the immune system itself. Ocrelizumab is administered by intravenous infusion. The first two infusions are administered 2 weeks apart. Later infusions are administered every 6 months. The goal of using stem cells to treat PPMS is to promote the immune system to repair damage and reduce inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). For a process known as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), stem cells are collected from a person’s own tissues, like bone marrow or blood, and then reintroduced after their immune system has been suppressed. This is done in a hospital setting and is currently FDA approved. However, HSCT is a major procedure with serious side effects. More research and outcomes from clinical trials are needed before this becomes a widely used treatment for PPMS. Several clinical trials are currently underway in people with PPMS. Clinical trials go through several phases before they receive FDA approval. Phase I focuses on how safe the drug is and involves a small group of participants. During phase II, researchers aim to determine how effective the drug is for certain conditions like MS. Phase III typically includes a larger group of participants. Researchers also look at other populations, dosages, and drug combinations to find out more about how safe and effective the drug is. A two-year is currently evaluating the oral antioxidant lipoic acid. Researchers are studying whether it can preserve mobility and protect the brain more than an inactive placebo in progressive forms of MS. This study builds on an that looked at 51 people with secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Researchers found that lipoic acid was able to reduce the rate of brain tissue loss compared to placebo. Biotin is a component of the vitamin B complex and is involved in cell growth and the metabolism of fats and amino acids. An is recruiting people with PPMS who are taking a high dose of biotin (300 milligrams) daily. Researchers want to see if it’s effective and safe in slowing the progression of disability in people with PPMS. In observational studies, researchers monitor participants without intervening in the process. Another is evaluating a high-dose biotin formulation known as MD1003 to see if it’s more effective than a placebo. Researchers want to know if it can slow the disability of people with progressive MS, especially those with gait impairment. A small open-label looked at the effects of high-dose biotin in people with either PPMS or SPMS. Doses ranged from 100 to 300 milligrams per day for 2 to 36 months. Participants in this trial showed improvement in visual impairment related to optic nerve injury and other MS symptoms, such as motor function and fatigue. However, another found that high-dose biotin nearly tripled the relapse rate in participants with PPMS. The has also warned that high doses of biotin may lead to inaccurate lab results for people with certain conditions, including MS. Masitinib is an oral immunomodulatory drug that has been developed as a possible treatment for PPMS. The treatment has already shown promise in a . It’s currently under investigation in a in people with PPMS or relapse-free SPMS. Ibudilast inhibits an enzyme called phosphodiesterase. Used as an asthma medication mainly in Asia, it has also been shown to promote myelin repair and help protect nerve cells from damage. Ibudilast was awarded fast track designation by the FDA. This could speed its future development as a possible treatment for progressive MS. Results of a phase II trial in 255 patients with progressive MS were published in . In the study, ibudilast was associated with slower progression of brain atrophy than a placebo. However, it also led to higher rates of digestive system side effects, headache, and depression. Many other treatments, aside from medications, can help optimize functioning and quality of life despite the effects of the disease. Occupational therapy teaches people the practical skills they need to take care of themselves both at home and . Occupational therapists show people how to preserve their energy, since PPMS typically causes extreme fatigue. They also help people adjust their daily activities and chores. Therapists may suggest ways to improve or renovate homes and workplaces to make them more accessible to people with disabilities. They may also assist in treating memory and problems. Physical therapists work to create specific exercise routines to help people increase their range of motion, preserve their mobility, and reduce spasticity and tremors. Physical therapists can recommend equipment to help people with PPMS get around better, such as: Some people with PPMS have problems with their language, speech, or swallowing. Pathologists can teach people how to: They may also recommend useful telephone aids and speech amplifiers to make communicating easier. can help you reduce spasticity and maintain a range of motion. You can try yoga, swimming, stretching, and other acceptable forms of exercise. Of course, it’s always a good idea to discuss any new exercise routine with your . CAM therapies are considered nonconventional treatments. Many people incorporate some type of CAM therapy as part of their MS management. There is very limited research evaluating the safety and effectiveness of CAM in MS. But such therapies are intended to help prevent the disease from damaging your nervous system and maintain your health so your body won’t feel so much of the effects of the disease. According to one , the most promising CAM therapies for MS include: Talk to your doctor before adding CAM to your treatment plan, and make sure you continue to adhere to your prescribed treatments. A big part of your overall treatment plan will be to manage your symptoms. You may need a variety of medications, lifestyle changes, and complementary treatments to do this. Depending on your symptoms, a doctor may prescribe: medications to reduce fatigue, such as modafinil (Provigil) medications to help treat erectile dysfunction (ED) These lifestyle changes could make your symptoms more manageable: Eat a healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Perform strength-building exercises to build up muscles and boost energy. Try gentle exercise and stretching programs like tai chi and yoga to help with balance, flexibility, and coordination. Manage stress with massage, meditation, or acupuncture. The goal of rehabilitation is to improve and maintain function and reduce fatigue. This may include: Ask your doctor for a referral to specialists in these areas. PPMS isn’t a common type of MS, but multiple researchers are still exploring ways to treat the condition. The 2017 approval of ocrelizumab marked a big step forward because it is approved for PPMS indication. Other emerging treatments, such as anti-inflammatories and biotin, have garnered mixed results in PPMS so far. Ibudilast has also been studied for its effects on PPMS and SPMS. Recent results from a phase II trial show that it causes some side effects, including depression. However, it was also associated with a lower rate of brain atrophy. Speak with your doctor if you want the most up-to-date information on the best ways to manage your PPMS. — — Doctor Discussion Guide: What to Ask About Primary Progressive MS Everything You Need to Know About PPMS and the Workplace People Like Me: Living with Primary Progressive MS 15 Ways to Live Your Best Life with Multiple Sclerosis A multiple sclerosis diagnosis can turn your world upside down, but it doesn't need to prevent you from doing what you love.

6466eec7-eb8b-4b88-a683-124de422ed54,"Medically reviewed by — — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most widespread disabling neurological condition of young adults around the world. You can develop MS at any age, but most people receive diagnoses between the . There are relapsing, remitting, and progressive types of MS, but the course is rarely predictable. Researchers still don’t fully understand the cause of MS or why the rate of progression is so difficult to determine. The good news is that many people living with MS don’t develop severe disabilities. Most have a normal or near-normal lifespan. There’s no national or global registry for new MS cases. Known figures are only estimates. Recent findings from a National MS Society study estimate nearly in the United States are living with MS. This is more than double the last reported number, and the first national research on MS prevalence since 1975. The society also estimates that 2.3 million people live with MS globally. About are diagnosed each week in the United States, says the MS Discovery Forum. Rates of MS are higher . It’s estimated that in (below the 37th parallel), the rate of MS is between 57 and 78 cases per 100,000 people. The rate is twice as high in northern states (above the 37th parallel), at about 110 to 140 cases per 100,000. The incidence of MS is also higher in colder climates. People of Northern European descent have the highest risk of developing MS, no matter where they live. Meanwhile, the lowest risk appears to be among Native Americans, Africans, and Asians. A 2013 study found only of all diagnosed MS cases are in children. Far more women have MS. In fact, the National MS Society estimates MS is more common in women than men. MS is , but researchers believe there may be a genetic predisposition to developing the disease. About of people with MS have one or more family members or relatives who also have MS, notes the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. In the case of identical twins, there’s a 1 in 3 chance for each sibling to have the disease. Researchers and neurologists still can’t say with certainty what causes MS. The ultimate cause of MS is damage to myelin, nerve fibers, and neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Together these make up the central nervous system. Researchers speculate that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is at play, but it’s not fully understood how. The relationship of the immune system and the brain, however, could be considered a culprit. Researchers suggest the immune system could mistake normal brain cells for foreign ones. One thing the MS community knows for certain is that the disease is . CISis considered to be of MS, but it may or may not progress to MS.To get a diagnosis of MS: A person has to experience a neurologic episode (typically lasting 24 hours or more) that resulted in damage to the central nervous system. People who are at high risk of developing MS are found to have MRI-detected brain lesions. There’s a chance of receiving an MS diagnosis within a few years, estimates the National MS Society. Meanwhile, people at low riskdon’t have MRI-detected brain lesions. They have a 20 percent chance of receiving an MS diagnosis in the same amount of time. RRMS is characterized by clearly defined relapses of increased disease activity and worsening symptoms. These are followed by remissions when the disease doesn’t progress. Symptoms may improve or disappear during remission. Approximately of people receive a diagnosis of RRMS at first, says the National MS Society. SPMS follows an initial RRMS diagnosis. It sees disability gradually increase as the disease progresses, with or without evidence of relapse or changes in an MRI scan. Occasional relapses may occur, as will periods of stability. Untreated, about of people with RRMS transition to SPMS within a decade of the initial diagnosis, estimates a 2017 study. About 90 percent of people transition within 25 years. PPMS is diagnosed in about of people with MS, estimates the National MS Society. People with PPMS experience a steady progression of the disease with no clear relapses or remissions. The rate of PPMS is equally divided between men and women. Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 35 and 39. A high percentage of MS cases don’t progress. These may fit into a subgroup with a “very stable benign” form of the disease, per a presented in 2017. Researchers say it’s possible for people to remain in the RRMS phase for 30 years. At the other end of the spectrum, a 2015 study found about of people with MS develop a more aggressive course of the disease. It’s known as highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (HARRMS). Symptoms vary a great deal from one person to another. No two people have the same combination of symptoms. This, of course, complicates identification and diagnosis. In a , one-fifth of European women surveyed received misdiagnoses before eventually receiving an MS diagnosis. The average woman was found to go through about five visits with a healthcare provider over the course of six months before reaching a diagnosis. According to the , symptoms can impact the mind, body, and senses in a number of ways. These include: There’s no single “MS test.” To receive a diagnosis, your doctor needs to collect your medical history and perform a neurological examination and a series of other tests. Tests may include: Since the exact cause of MS is still unknown, there’s no known prevention. There’s also no cure for MS yet, but treatments can manage symptoms. MS medications are designed to lessen the frequency of relapses and slow the progression of the disease. There several approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat MS. They include: These medications aren’t approved for use during pregnancy. It’s also unclear if MS medications are excreted through breast milk. Talk to your doctor about your MS medications if you’re considering becoming pregnant. People with MS can safely carry a baby to term. Pregnancy doesn’t generally affect MS in the long term. MS has been found to affect decisions about pregnancy, though. In a , 36 percent of women participants decided not to have children at all or postponed the timing of getting pregnant due to their MS. While people with MS often experience during pregnancy, about have a relapse within six months of giving birth. MS is an expensive disease to treat. A found the total lifetime costs per person with MS to be $4.1 million. The average yearly healthcare costs range from $30,000 to $100,000 based on the mildness or severity of the disease.

bd20bf11-33b2-4bb1-89c0-958003dffffd,"— The activity of the Epstein-Barr virus in the body syncs up to relapses in patients with RRMS. In a new published on April 11, investigators in Italy found that, in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), the immune response to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) appeared to cycle simultaneously with their disease activity, meaning that when the virus was active, so was their MS. The study, conducted by investigators at the Santa Lucia Foundation in Rome, Italy examined cytotoxic (CD8+) T-cells, which are cells that kill infected or abnormal cells in the body. They found an increased response to the antigens produced by active EBV in the blood of MS patients during relapses, as compared with samples taken during periods of remission. Antigens are substances that the body sees as foreign or harmful—including toxins from viruses like Epstein-Barr—and deploys an immune response to find and kill. EBV is a member of the herpesvirus family and, according to the (NIH), nearly 95 percent of all people between the ages of 35 and 40 have been infected by it. EBV is responsible for the viral infection known as mononucleosis (or “mono”). EBV only results in mono in 35 to 50 percent of patients, while others never show any outward signs that they’ve been infected. Although the symptoms of mono, which include a fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph glands, eventually go away, EBV takes up a permanent residence in certain cells in the immune system where it lies dormant for years. For people who suffer from RRMS, the cycles of disease activity can be as varied and irregular as the symptoms they produce. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. The immune system attacks the myelin, or protective covering, of nerve cells in the brain, causing electrical “shorts” in the signaling pathways. This can result in symptoms ranging from mild numbness to blindness or complete paralysis. In the relapsing-remitting form of MS, these attacks can last from a few days to several months. The flare-ups are followed by periods of remission where there is a lessening of disease activity. More than 400,000 people have been diagnosed with MS in the United States, and more than 1.2 million worldwide. According to the , about 80 to 85 percent of MS patients are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS. In the study, investigators followed 113 patients with RRMS and 49 healthy control subjects over the course of four years, analyzing their blood in order to track their levels of CD8+ T-cell activity and map it to their MS disease cycles. Of the RRMS patients, 79 were on no disease modifying therapy, 20 were on Interferon Beta 1a, and 14 were on natalizumab, which is sold as Tysabri. Patients experiencing a relapse of their MS, verified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain, also showed elevated EBV activity as measured by the presence of the CD8+ T-cells. The researchers also studied the brain tissue of five MS patients who had donated their bodies to science. They found an interaction between an active EBV-specific protein and CD8+ T-cells in MS lesions in the brains of those patients at the time of their deaths. The role of EBV as a potential trigger for multiple sclerosis has long been debated. Whether it—or any virus—directly causes the disease or creates a “perfect storm” situation whereby the immune system, in trying to eradicate the virus, goes haywire and mistakes myelin proteins as the enemy, is unclear. According to Dr. Steven Jacobson, Chief of the Viral Immunology Section at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, it’s important to note that “While EBV may be one of the triggers in MS…what triggers reactivation in one person may not in another.” He told Healthline that MS is not a disease with a single, defined, viral trigger like AIDS, for example, which is triggered by the HIV virus.“The results [of this study] do not answer the question of whether EBV dysregulation is a consequence or cause of MS,” said Dr. Tom Ech, Program Officer of the Autoimmunity and Mucosal Immunology branch of the NIH in an interview with Healthline, “but suggest a link between EBV reactivation, antiviral immune response and disease activity during the relapsing-remitting stage of MS.”The results of this study suggest that the ebb and flow of EBV as it cycles between dormant and active phases could set the stage for the reactivation of MS. This has led to the hypothesis that RRMS could be controlled with antiviral drugs that keep EBV in check. However, many more studies will be required to prove or disprove this theory. “What this group [of researchers] has shown is that further studies need to be done with antiviral drugs,” said Jacobson, who has been studying viruses and MS for more than 30 years at the NIH. “In fact, the ‘interfere’ part of the name ‘interferon’ [used to treat RRMS] stands for the drug’s ability to interfere with viral replication within cells. This also raises the question of whether this classic therapy for MS could be used as an antiviral drug.” Although there is currently no vaccine for the Epstein-Barr virus, researchers are working diligently to develop one. Australian scientists at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research have conducted the first human trial of an . The study was small, but it demonstrated human tolerance for the vaccine and the study subjects did not develop mono.Although this newest study does provide a tantalizing glimpse into possible interactions between the immune system and viruses, it doesn’t prove that EBV is a viral trigger for MS. It’s not a “smoking gun,” but rather another piece of the overall puzzle in what is a complex disease process. Jacobson said that the US government, through the NIH, has been devoting more funding to MS research than ever before, including partially funding this study, as well as others involving therapies now on the market. There are medication on the market now to help control MS symptoms, but the ultimate goal is to stop it in its tracks. “While we are able to suppress the disease activity [with the current therapies],” said Jacobson, “the key is to stop degeneration.” — Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

d194e8df-120f-43fa-aaf0-589d65a9dcf9,"— — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that damages nerve cells in your central nervous system (CNS). Your CNS is composed of your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. causes symptoms that gradually get worse, as well as symptoms that come on suddenly after a period of being controlled. This sudden appearance of symptoms is called a . There’s for MS, and the damage it causes can’t be reversed. However, certain medications can help you manage the condition. Condition management focuses on medication that can treat relapses, as well as modify the disease to reduce damage and disability. It also involves other drugs that treat the symptoms or complications of MS. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the following drugs for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS): cladribine (Mavenclad), dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), diroximel fumarate (Vumerity), fingolimod (Gilenya), monomethyl fumarate (Bafiertam), ozanimod (Zeposia), siponimod (Mayzent), teriflunomide (Aubagio) interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Rebif), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron, Extavia), glatiramer acetate (Copaxone, Glatopa), peginterferon beta-1a (Plegridy) alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), mitoxantrone hydrochloride, natalizumab (Tysabri), ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) There are several types of that work to help change the course of MS. The length of treatment with these medications can range from a few months to years, depending on how effective the medications are for you. Your may recommend switching between these drugs throughout the course of your treatment. This will depend on how effectively each drug manages your disease and how you tolerate the side effects. If you switch to a different DMT, your doctor will take note of whether you develop new . The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 12 MS medications that are administered by injection or infusion. They help modify relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. They also treat clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), a one-off episode of neurological symptoms. CIS can progress to MS and is sometimes categorized as a type of MS. These drugs are made up of proteins that keep certain from entering your brain and spinal cord. These WBCs are thought to that forms a protective coating over your nerve fibers. Therefore, preventing these WBCs from moving into your brain and spinal cord can help slow their damage and reduce the number of relapses you have. You inject these drugs yourself. Your healthcare provider will show you how to do this. The number of injections depends on the drug: Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is a manufactured substance that resembles a basic protein of natural myelin. It’s thought to work by prompting the WBCs to attack the substance instead of the myelin cells. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. You inject this drug yourself once per day or three times per week, depending on your dosage. Your healthcare provider will show you how. People who receive injections three times per week should ensure that at least 48 hours elapses between their injections. The FDA has also approved Glatopa, a generic form of Copaxone. Natalizumab (Tysabri) is an antibody that may block damaged T lymphocytes from moving into your brain and spinal cord. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. A healthcare provider gives you this drug as an intravenous (IV) infusion. The infusion takes about an hour, and you’ll get it every 4 weeks. Mitoxantrone hydrochloride was originally used to treat cancer. Now it’s also prescribed to treat people with MS. It suppresses the immune system cells that are thought to attack myelin cells. This medication is only available as a generic drug. It’s used to treat SPMS or worsening RRMS in instances where other drugs haven’t worked. It has a high risk of serious side effects, so it’s only appropriate for people with these more severe forms of MS. A healthcare provider gives you this drug as a short IV infusion once every 3 months. The infusion should only take 5 to 15 minutes. Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) is approved for people with relapsing forms of MS, including RRMS and active SPMS. It’s intended for people who’ve tried at least two other MS medications but found that treatment was unsuccessful or caused intolerable side effects. It works by reducing the number of specific B and T lymphocytes in your body. This action may decrease the inflammation of and damage to nerve cells. Alemtuzumab is given as a 4-hour IV infusion. To start, you receive this drug once per day for 5 days. Then 12 months after your first treatment course, you receive it once per day for 3 more days. Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is the newest infusion treatment for MS. It was approved by the FDA in 2017. It’s the first drug used to treat primary progressive MS (PPMS). It’s also used to treat CIS and relapsing forms of MS. Ocrelizumab appears to work by targeting and ultimately reducing the number of B lymphocytes. B lymphocytes are responsible for damage and repair of the myelin sheath. Ocrelizumab is given as an IV infusion. To begin, you’ll receive it in two 300-milligram (mg) infusions, separated by 2 weeks. After that, you’ll receive it in 600-mg infusions every 6 months. You’ll also receive a corticosteroid and an on the day of each infusion to reduce the risk of reaction to the medication. Ofatumumab (Kesimpta) was approved by the FDA in August 2020 and is the newest treatment for MS. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Like ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), it also works by targeting harmful B lymphocytes and reducing their overall number. Ofatumumab is given as an injection once per week for the first 3 weeks. After a 1-week break, the drug is given as a monthly injection. The FDA has approved eight oral medications for the treatment of MS. Fingolimod (Gilenya) comes as an oral capsule that you take once per day. It was the first oral medication approved by the FDA to treat RRMS. It’s also used to treat CIS and active SPMS. Fingolimod causes the damaging WBCs to remain within your lymph nodes. This reduces the chance that they’ll enter your brain or spinal cord and cause damage. Teriflunomide (Aubagio) is an oral tablet that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Teriflunomide works by blocking an enzyme that’s needed by the damaging WBCs. As a result, teriflunomide helps decrease the number of these cells, which reduces the damage they can inflict. Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It appears to work by interfering with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals to reduce the risk of MS relapse. It may also have antioxidant properties that help protect against brain and spinal cord damage. Monomethyl fumarate (Bafiertam) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s the newest oral drug on the market, having been approved by the FDA in April 2020. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Monomethyl fumarate is a bioequivalent of dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera). Like dimethyl fumarate, monomethyl fumarate may have antioxidant properties and appears to work by interfering with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals. Cladribine (Mavenclad) is a pill that you take for a total of 16 or 20 days over the course of 2 years. You’ll have treatment for 2 weeks per year, with each one lasting 4 or 5 days. There’s a 1-month break in between the 2 weeks of treatment. It’s approved for people with relapsing forms of MS, including RRMS and active SPMS. It’s intended for people who’ve tried at least one other MS medication but found that treatment was unsuccessful or caused intolerable side effects. It may work by reducing the number of harmful B and T lymphocytes that you have. Siponimod (Mayzent) is an oral tablet that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It’s believed to work by blocking certain inflammatory cells from leaving your lymph nodes. This action limits the amount of nerve damage that they can inflict. Diroximel fumarate (Vumerity) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Diroximel fumarate has the same active ingredient as dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), and it works the same way. This means that it may also have antioxidant properties and interfere with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals. Ozanimod (Zeposia) is an oral capsule that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It’s believed to work by blocking immune cells from leaving your lymph nodes and entering your CNS. Fingolimod (Gilenya) is currently the only DMT that’s approved by the FDA for use in children. It’s safe for use in people ages 10 years old and up. However, doctors may prescribe other DMTs off label. Off-label drug is when a medication approved by the FDA for one purpose is used for a different purpose that hasn’t been approved. However, a doctor can still use the drug for that purpose. This is because the FDA regulates the testing and approval of drugs, but not how doctors use drugs to treat their patients. So, your doctor can prescribe a drug however they think is best for your care. While many relapses go away on their own, more severe relapses require treatment. Inflammation causes MS relapses, and it’s typically treated with . These drugs can reduce inflammation and help make MS attacks less severe. Corticosteroids used to treat MS include: If corticosteroids don’t work, your doctor may prescribe corticotropin (H.P. Acthar Gel). Corticotropin is an injection, and it’s also known as ACTH gel. It works by prompting the adrenal cortex to secrete the hormones cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone. The secretion of these hormones helps to reduce inflammation. Medications to treat MS symptoms and complications Other drugs can be used to treat specific or from MS-related damage. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is an oral tablet taken twice per day to help improve walking. Dalfampridine works by blocking potassium channels, which form tiny pores in your nerve cells. This action may help damaged nerve cells to better send messages. Improved nerve impulse conduction aids in leg muscle control and strength. A doctor will often give to people with MS who have painful muscle stiffness or muscle spasms. Drugs commonly used to treat these symptoms include: is a common problem for people with MS. For this symptom, your doctor may prescribe a drug such as modafinil (Provigil). They may also prescribe an off-label drug, such as amantadine (Gocovri) and fluoxetine (Prozac). means “bad sensation.” It’s a type of pain that can feel like ongoing burning or itching. It may also feel like wetness, electric shock, or pins and needles. According to a published in Nature Reviews Neurology, some research has shown that people with MS are more likely to be clinically depressed than the general population. Drugs used to treat depression in people with MS include: Constipation is another common complication of MS. Your doctor may recommend with one of the following : Bladder dysfunction is also a common complication of MS. Symptoms may include frequent urination, , or hesitancy in starting urination. You may also experience frequent (nighttime urination). Both men and women with MS tend to have higher rates of sexual dysfunction than the general population, according to an from 2016. that may be prescribed to help treat include: Older drugs that must be injected directly into the penis are also available. These drugs aren’t used as much now that oral drugs are available. They include alprostadil (Caverject). A drug that may be used off label for this purpose is the blood pressure medication papaverine. People with a vagina or clitoris may experience problems such as reduced feeling or . There are no drugs currently available to treat these problems. However, for vaginal dryness, you can use water-soluble personal lubricants available over the counter. Many different types of drugs are available to help you manage MS. The type of drugs that may be best for you depend on the type of MS you have and the symptoms you experience. You may not be able to access all of these medications. Ask your doctor to confirm which drugs are currently on the market in your area and which ones might be most appropriate for you. Speaking with your doctor is especially important if you’re pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Work with your doctor to to manage your MS symptoms and help prevent further damage from the disease. Sticking to your treatment plan can help you feel better and slow the progression of your condition. — — MS Treatment Chart: Comparing Disease-Modifying Therapies Oral vs. Injectable MS Treatments: What’s the Difference?

437a7a03-863e-448d-afbd-0fd1c5f0ba41,"How Close Are We to a Cure for Multiple Sclerosis? — — There’s currently no cure for multiple sclerosis (MS) yet. However, in recent years, new medications have become available to help slow the progression of the disease and manage its symptoms. Researchers continue to develop new treatments and learn more about the causes and risk factors of this disease. Read on to learn about some of the latest treatment breakthroughs and promising avenues of research. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are the main group of medications used to treat MS. To date, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved DMTs for different types of MS. It treats relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive MS (PPMS). This is the to be approved to treat PPMS and the only one approved for all four types of MS. This drug treats pediatric MS. It was already approved for adults. In 2018, it became the first DMT to be approved . It’s to treat relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) as well as active secondary progressive MS (SPMS). It’s to treat RRMS, Active SPMS, and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). In , it effectively reduced the rate of relapse in people with Active SPMS. Compared to a placebo, it cut the relapse rate in half. This drug is to treat RRMS, Active SPMS, and CIS. It’s similar to dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), an older DMT. However, it causes fewer gastrointestinal side effects. . This drug is approved to treat CIS, RRMS, and active SPMS. It’s the newest DMT to be added to the market and was FDA approved in March 2020. While new treatments have been approved, another medication has been removed from pharmacy shelves. In March 2018, daclizumab (Zinbryta) was around the world. This drug is no longer available to treat MS. Several other medications are working their way through the research pipeline. In recent studies, some of these medications have shown promise for treating MS. The results of a new suggest that ibudilast might help reduce the progression of disability in people with MS. To learn more about this medication, the manufacturer a phase III clinical trial. The findings of a suggest that clemastine fumarate might help restore the protective coating around nerves in people with relapsing forms of MS. This oral antihistamine is currently available over the counter but not in the dose used in the clinical trial. More research is needed to study its potential benefits and risks for treating MS. These are only a few of the treatments currently being studied. To learn about current and future clinical trials for MS, visit . Thanks to the development of new medications for MS, people have a growing number of treatment options to choose from. To help guide their decisions, scientists are using large databases and statistical analyses to try to pinpoint the best treatment options for different types of patients, reports the . Eventually, this research might help patients and doctors learn which treatments are most likely to work for them. To understand the causes and risk factors of MS, geneticists and other scientists are combing the human genome for clues. Members of the International MS Genetics Consortium have identified associated with MS. For example, identified four new genes linked to the condition. Eventually, findings like this might help scientists develop new strategies and tools to predict, prevent, and treat MS. In recent years, scientists have also the role that bacteria and other microbes in our guts might play in the development and progression of MS. This community of bacteria is known as our gut microbiome. Not all bacteria are harmful. In fact, many “friendly” bacteria live in our bodies and help regulate our immune systems. When the balance of bacteria in our bodies is off, it can lead to inflammation. This might contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases, including MS. Research into the gut microbiome might help scientists understand why and how people develop MS. It could also pave the way for new treatment approaches, including dietary interventions and other therapies. Scientists continue to gain new insight into the risk factors and causes of MS as well as potential treatment strategies. New medications have been approved in recent years. Others have shown promise in clinical trials. These advancements are helping improve the health and well-being of the many people who live with this condition while bolstering hopes for a potential cure. — — Six Talking Points to Bring Up at Your Next Appointment for MS Oral vs. Injectable MS Treatments: What’s the Difference?

It’s caused by an immune response that destroys the myelin sheath, or coating on nerves. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is one of the four types of MS. The three other types of MS are: PPMS is one of the least common types, affecting about of all people diagnosed with MS. Most people affected by MS have acute attacks with symptoms, called relapses, and periods of months or years with little to no symptoms, called remissions. PPMS is different. The disease progresses once symptoms start to appear, hence the name primary progressive. There may be periods of active progression and then periods of inactive progression of symptoms and disability. One difference between PPMS and the relapsing forms is that while active progression may stop temporarily, the symptoms don’t resolve. In relapsing forms, the symptoms may actually improve or return near where they were before the most recent relapse. Another difference is that there isn’t as much inflammation in PPMS compared to relapsing forms. Because of this, many of the drugs that work for relapsing forms don’t work for PPMS or SPMS. The progression of symptoms can worsen over a few months or several years. PPMS is often diagnosed in people in their . RRMS, on the other hand, usually presents in people in their 20s and 30s. PPMS also affects both sexes equally, while RRMS affects two to three times as many women as men. PPMS is caused by slow nerve damage that stops nerves from sending signals to each other. All four types of MS involve damage to the protective coating (myelin) of the central nervous system, called demyelination, as well as damage to the nerve. PPMS symptoms are similar to SPMS symptoms. Of course, what one person experiences will be different from another. A continuous contraction of certain muscles may cause stiffness and tightness, which may affect movement. This can make it more difficult to walk, use the stairs, and influence your overall activity level. About of those with PPMS experience . This can significantly affect daily life and make it difficult to work and complete regular activities. Those diagnosed with PPMS may find themselves very tired from simple activities. For example, the task of cooking dinner could wear them out and require them to take a nap. Another early symptom of PPMS is or tingling in various body parts, such as your face, hands, and feet. This can be confined to one area of your body, or travel to other parts. This can include , , inability to identify colors and contrasts, and pain when moving your eyes. While PPMS typically affects mobility, some individuals may experience a cognitive decline. This can significantly impair remembering and processing information, solving problems, focusing, and learning anything new. Those with PPMS may have episodes of and lightheadedness. Others may experience vertigo, a sensation that they’re spinning and losing their balance. Bladder and bowel problems can range from , to the constant need to go, to . This can lead to sexual problems, such as , , and less sensation in the genitals. About will face at least one depressive episode. Although it’s common to be upset or angry about the increasing disability, these mood changes typically go away with time. , on the other hand, doesn’t subside and requires treatment. PPMS has similar symptoms to other types of MS, as well as other nervous system disorders. As a result, it may take up to longer to get a confirmed PPMS diagnosis than a RRMS diagnosis. have a year of progressively worsening neurologic function meet two of the following criteria: Your doctor will likely conduct a medical history exam and ask you about any previous neurologic events. They may ask for family members to be present, as they can contribute their experiences with past symptoms. Your doctor will then likely do a thorough physical exam, specifically checking your nerves and muscles. Your doctor will order an MRI scan to check for lesions in the brain and spinal cord. They may also order an to check for electrical activity in the brain. Finally, your doctor will perform a to look for signs of MS in the spinal fluid. There’s no cure for PPMS. One medication, ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), is approved for PPMS as well as relapsing forms of MS. are commonly used in relapsing forms, however, because they decrease inflammation. PPMS doesn’t have a lot of inflammation, so immunosuppressants may not be recommended as useful. Research on effective treatments is ongoing. While there’s no cure for PPMS, those diagnosed with PPMS shouldn’t give up hope. With the help of doctors, physical therapy professionals, speech pathologists, and specialists in mental health, there are ways to manage the disease. These can include medications that help relieve symptoms, such as for muscle spasms, as well as a healthy diet, exercise, and a proper sleep routine.

4b355584-a2b4-4e07-83a0-41cb313ba7a6,"Study Looking at High-Dose Biotin as a Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis — The B-complex vitamin has performed well in two trials involving people with MS. A phase III trial is now scheduled. A chance made by scientists in France is generating some important questions. Namely, “Can high-dose biotin help treat progressive multiple sclerosis?” Biotin is one of the B-complex vitamins. It’s also known as vitamin H. The exact role biotin plays in the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) is not known, but initial studies show it both benefits myelin and provides energy for neurons. Both of these benefits can help people with relapsing and progressive MS.

The initial trial that tested it against MS had only 23 participants, but it showed significant results. A second, randomized double-blind was larger, with 154 participants. Again, the high-dose biotin showed success in helping improve, and stop, disability in people with progressive and relapsing MS. Since there is only one FDA-approved drug for progressive MS (Ocrevus), the search is on for more treatments. Dr. Jaime Imitola, director of the Progressive MS clinic at The Ohio State University, stresses the importance of understanding the results of a study and what it could mean to someone with MS. “Take, for example, the variety of success that biotin has shown in studies for multiple sclerosis, but the studies are small, under 300 participants,” he told Healthline. “These studies show great potential and more studies are needed since only a subset of patients seems to respond. We need to know more about these responders.” , which ran the first two studies on MD1003, is starting a phase III trial of the drug to test its effectiveness as a treatment for progressive MS. The , called SPI2, will involve 600 patients from 65 study centers in the United States and Europe. “The results of phase III will help show the efficacy of these earlier tests.” Dr. Margaret Burnett, associate professor of neurology at the USC Keck School of Medicine, told Healthline. “Biotin is different than other agents,” Burnett explained. “While other approaches have been designed to work with the immune system, MD1003 is designed to preserve and support the nervous system by protecting its oligodendrocytes and neurons.” This different approach could provide a way to stop disease progression by addressing the factors that cause it, specifically demyelination and damage to the neurons. Read more: New drug to treat MS gets FDA approval » Biotin is available over the counter, but the dose you get is much smaller than what is being tested – about 10,000 micrograms compared to 300 milligrams. However, the supplement is still showing enough promise for some neurologists to prescribe biotin for their patients. , professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School recently told doctors at the Race to Erase MS Forum that they recommend 300 milligram of biotin for their MS patients from a compounding pharmacy with the caveat that it is a bit pricey at about $150 per month. High-dose biotin is considered relatively safe with no downsides. But it can affect blood test results for a few conditions such as thyroid disease and should be stopped prior to blood work. Biotin is also available naturally through a healthy diet. Humans, or any mammal, cannot synthesize biotin and must obtain it from dietary sources such as eggs, dairy, almonds, whole grains, and meat. No tests to date have been performed on biotin from food having any effect on MS. She also notes that while there is no one diet recommended for everyone with MS, she “encourages all patients to eat a well-rounded diet.” Editor’s Note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

05aa5e62-ad51-4169-8221-03d2c1b64cb6,"Drug That Helps Prevent Multiple Sclerosis Relapses Gets FDA Approval — by Jennifer Chesak A new injectable drug called ofatumumab that helped reduce multiple sclerosis relapses in a phase 3 clinical trial has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Ofatumumab works by targeting B cells in an effort to control the immune system. Ofatumumab would join the drugs Ocrevus and Aubagio in treating multiple sclerosis relapses. A new drug for treating relapsing multiple sclerosis has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Novartis today that their injectable drug ofatumumab (brand name Kesimpta) was given the FDA go-ahead after a successful phase 3 clinical trial. “When treating patients with [relapsing multiple sclerosis], Kesimpta is a meaningful treatment option that delivers both high efficacy and safety with the ability for patients to have more freedom in managing their disease,” , the president of Novartis Pharmaceuticals, said in the company press release. “This approval is wonderful news for patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis,” added , director of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences and co-chair of the steering committee for the drug’s early clinical trials, said in same press release. “In the key clinical studies, this breakthrough treatment produced a profound reduction in new brain lesions, reducing relapses and slowing underlying disease progression.” More than 900 people received ofatumumab in the multi-center clinical trial this summer. In published earlier this month, the immune-modulating drug was shown to quiet inflammatory disease activity. Researchers said a subcutaneous injection of ofatumumab produced a significant reduction in new inflammation as well as fewer clinical relapses and progression events. In the second year of treatment, nearly 9 out of 10 study participants on ofatumumab showed no sign of disease activity. The study covered two double-blind, double-dummy phase 3 trials, ASCLEPIOS I and ASCLEPIOS II. Both were funded by Novartis. The trials were conducted at 385 sites in 37 countries, comparing ofatumumab with teriflunomide, currently marketed in the United States as , by Sanofi Genzyme. The results of the new study showed that 20 milligrams (mg) of injection of ofatumumab every 4 weeks reduced relapses by more than 50 percent, the risk of disability progression by 34 percent, and new T2 lesions by more than 80 percent, compared to a 14-mg daily pill of Aubagio. Ofatumumab is an anti-CD20 immune modulator designed to selectively deplete B cells. Teriflunomide has different mechanics and is designed to reduce T-cell and B-cell activity. “This data is very promising and very positive,” , PhD, the executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, told Healthline last week. “We are excited about this option.” Ofatumumab is similar in action to ocrelizumab, marketed in the United States as by Genentech. These two drugs were not compared against each other, but the mechanics are the same as they target B cells in an effort to manage the immune system. “The clinical data is similar between the two, but the route of administration is different,” said Bebo. Ocrevus is a twice-a-year IV infusion and is performed in a hospital setting. The most common side effects are infusion reactions, which can happen up to 24 hours after injection. Other side effects include upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin infections, herpes, and a reduced immune system. Ofatumumab is a subcutaneous self-injection performed by the patient in their home. The drug is injected on day 1, day 7 and day 14, then continues once every 4 weeks. Side effects during the studies included headaches, increase risk for upper respiratory tract infections, and possible injection site reactions. Neither ofatumumab nor Ocrevus has shown cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), but both drugs warn about the possibility. There were eight cases of appendicitis reported in the ofatumumab group versus two with Aubagio. Researchers do not know if this was coincidental or related to the drug. Ofatumumab had a slightly higher rate of herpetic diseases such as herpes. Out-of-pocket expenses for infusions tend to be more than an injection. And there are insurance issues around infusions that can make it more complicated. Genentech provides patient assistance for financial and personal support via their Ocrevus website. Ocrevus was in 2017 by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Ofatumumab was only tested for relapsing forms of MS, including active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). The FDA’s approval review for this drug is scheduled for next month. “The data is highly impressive,” , director and founder of The MS Center for Innovations in Care at Missouri Baptist Medical Center, told Healthline. “Ofatumumab will be another great option for relapsing forms of MS.” “There was not a trial for progressive MS, but it might have a similar effect as Ocrevus,” he added. If the drug is approved by the FDA, the label will have specific application details and will include the protocol such as injection locations. Singer has already had a number of conversations with patients regarding the potential of this new drug. Both Singer and Bebo emphasized the importance of people with MS talking with their neurologists and healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding their therapy and risks. The National MS Society, in a joint effort with The Consortium of MS Centers and Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada, created a data collection bank called at the onset of the pandemic. This is a data collection resource for physicians to enter clinical data on COVID-19 cases among people with MS and other demyelinating diseases within the central nervous system. At this time, there are 800 cases registered. This data will help uncover if there are any consequences with COVID-19 and any of the MS disease-modifying therapies. “Based on the data in hand now, it does not seem like having MS in itself changes the course of COVID-19,” Bebo said, “It is the comorbidities that make a difference and can cause poor outcome, the same as in the general population.” “The National MS Society has several informative articles about those living with MS and concerns with COVID-19. In addition, the Society has turned all of their MS support groups into a digital format to help more people,” he said. “Even in the face of COVID, we are still making progress in MS, still looking for hope,” Bebo said. “We’ve had two MS drugs approved this year, maybe a third one by the end of the year.” Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

0dca2b8d-fb18-4f31-89ac-206ba885d9f7,"Rehabilitation interventions in multiple sclerosis: an overview , –() Multiple sclerosis is a complex, heterogeneous disease associated with long-term disability. Despite the availability of advanced disease-modifying and symptomatic therapies that may decrease activity and progression of disease and alleviate complaints to a certain extent, there is still a need for comprehensive rehabilitation interventions in order to reduce sequels and symptoms of the disease on personal activities and social participation to achieve the highest possible independence and the best quality of life. Timing and setting of rehabilitation interventions should be selected individually depending on disease phase, functional deficits, personal requirements, as well as specific goals. In addition, limitations and disease-specific characteristics that may influence rehabilitation outcome should be noted. Rehabilitation interventions should be considered early for maintaining functional capacity and reducing risk for losing important abilities or independence. Due to gradual failure of adaptive compensatory mechanisms along the course of disease, benefits of rehabilitation interventions are generally higher in earlier phases of MS. Inpatient and outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation has been shown to be beneficial in improving disability, participation and quality of life despite progression of the disease. Good evidence exists for different specific interventions improving physical and cognitive performance. Other important issues responsible for beneficial effects of comprehensive rehabilitation in MS include education, instruction, and information of patients and caregivers. Comprehensive assessment of health domains in MS patients using standardized framework and common language for describing the impact of disease at different levels, using International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) core sets may increase the knowledge of needs of these patients for more efficient and adapted rehabilitation interventions meeting these individual requirements, and promote perception and acceptance of rehabilitation as a valuable treatment option in MS. ICF core sets may increase the knowledge of more efficient and adapted rehabilitation measures meeting more properly individual requirements, and promote perception and acceptance of rehabilitation as a valuable treatment option in MS.

4d32ce6f-a506-4c83-9a63-dd864eacf8fe,"Vitamin D and Multiple Sclerosis: A Comprehensive Review Vitamin D and Multiple Sclerosis: A Comprehensive Review , –() Numerous observational studies have suggested that there is a correlation between the level of serum vitamin D and MS risk and disease activity. To explore this hypothesis, a literature search of large, prospective, observation studies, epidemiological studies, and studies using new approaches such as Mendelian randomization was conducted. Available data and ongoing research included in this review suggest that the level of serum vitamin D affects the risk of developing MS and also modifies disease activity in MS patients. Newer Mendelian randomization analyses suggest there is a causal relationship between low vitamin D level and the risk of MS. Post-hoc evaluations from two phase 3 studies, BENEFIT and BEYOND, support the findings of observational trials. Study limitations identified in this review recognize the need for larger controlled clinical trials to establish vitamin D supplementation as the standard of care for MS patients. Though there is increasing evidence indicating that lower vitamin D levels are associated with increased risk of MS and with greater clinical and brain MRI activity in established MS, the impact of vitamin D supplementation on MS activity remains inadequately investigated. Knowledge of the widespread effects of vitamin D on skeletal and non-skeletal functions, including immune functions, has developed considerably over the past 3 decades. Higher levels of vitamin D are associated with reduced risk for developing multiple sclerosis (MS), and with reduced clinical activity in established MS, including decreased risk of relapse and reduction in disease activity on brain MRI [, ]. Vitamin D supplementation may diminish the risk of MS in the general population, as well as in children of mothers supplemented before and during pregnancy []. In the information that follows, we will summarize the available data on vitamin D, with a focus on vitamin D’s effects on the risk of onset of MS and on the disease course of MS. Sources, Metabolism, and Biological Functions of Vitamin D Vitamin D is a lipid-soluble vitamin, but acts like a hormone. Unlike a vitamin, which is an essential organic compound that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be ingested, vitamin D can be synthesized []. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]VD), also known as calcitriol (Fig. ) [] has chemical similarities to typical hormones such as testosterone, estrogen, and cortisol []. The main sources of vitamin D are sunlight, diet, and supplementation (Fig. ) []. UVB in the 290–315-nm range photolyses 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to form pre-vitamin D3, which then isomerizes to vitamin D3 or cholecalciferol []. Foods rich in vitamin D include fatty fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel), cod liver oil, egg yolk, and shiitake mushrooms. The plant form of vitamin D is called vitamin D2 or ergocalciferol []. Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol are also available from fortified foods (e.g., milk, cereal, some orange juice, and cheeses) and vitamin supplements. Relative to sun exposure, diet is a poor source of vitamin D, providing only 40–400 IU per food serving, whereas whole-body UVB exposure for 20 min for a light-skinned person during the summer months will produce upwards of 10,000 IU of vitamin D [, ]. However, UVB exposure and vitamin D production through the skin may be reduced with increased skin pigmentation, age, use of sunscreen, and environmental factors such as winter season, high latitude, pollution, cloud cover, and ozone levels []. For instance, sun exposure during most of the winter at latitudes above ~ 33° North (e.g., Atlanta, GA, USA; Casablanca, Morocco) and below ~ 33 degrees South (e.g., Santiago, Chile; New South Wales, Australia; Southern Cape of Africa) provides minimal, if any, vitamin D production []. Both forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol, and ergocalciferol are biologically inactive and undergo an enzymatic transformation in the liver to 25(OH)D (calcidiol). Stimulated by parathyroid hormone, 25(OH)D goes through a second hydroxylation in the kidney or other tissues to 1,25(OH)VD (also known as calcitriol if derived from vitamin D3), which is the active metabolite (Figs.  and ) [, ]. 1,25(OH)VD has a half-life of several hours, while 25(OH)D has a relatively long half-life (20–60 days), and thus more accurately exemplifies the overall vitamin D stores in the body. This supports the standard practice of measuring 25(OH)D in serum, and represents an integrated measure of vitamin D derived from both UVB exposure and diet. As a side note, most assays that evaluate 25(OH)D do not discriminate between the original forms of vitamin D (vitamin D3 or D2). However, the latter is usually a minor component because natural sources of ergocalciferol are scarce, and ergocalciferol is more rapidly catabolized than cholecalciferol []. The active metabolite 1,25(OH)VD is released into the bloodstream and transported in the blood. It binds to the vitamin D binding protein in blood and on the surface of target tissues. 1,25(OH)VD mediates its biological effects by binding to intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR), which then recruits cofactors to form a transcriptional complex that binds to vitamin D response elements []. This association regulates the expression of at least 500 genes that drive a variety of physical functions []. The VDR is found in almost all human tissues, not just those participating in the classic actions of vitamin D, such as bone, gut, and kidney. The non-classic actions of VDR can be allocated to three main categories: regulation of hormone secretion, regulation of immune function, and regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation []. Vitamin D deficiency has been classically attributed to bone health. In the early 1900s, rickets, a consequence of vitamin D deficiency, was very common among children in industrialized cities, and observations were made that sunlight exposure or cod liver oil may help to prevent this condition []. Other musculoskeletal consequences of vitamin D deficiency include secondary hyperparathyroidism, increased bone turnover, bone loss, and risk of low-trauma fractures. Today, we understand that VDR is widely distributed throughout the human body and involved in many biological functions. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with numerous diseases including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, infectious diseases, mental disorders, and autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, Crohn’s disease, and MS [, ]. These diseases are all linked to vitamin D levels that are sufficient to prevent rickets, but are still suboptimal. Curiously, as rickets is no longer a problem, one might assume that the vitamin D deficiency problem is also no longer an issue. However, now that we know that autoimmunity may be related to low vitamin D levels, and that the incidence of autoimmune diseases has increased, we must consider if there is a higher vitamin D threshold related to autoimmunity, or if the environment changed since the Industrial Revolution. Since multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered an autoimmune disease, it is of interest to review briefly the potential effects of vitamin D related to immune function. The active form of vitamin D plays an essential role in lymphocyte activation and proliferation, T-helper cell differentiation, tissue-specific lymphocyte homing, the production of specific antibody isotypes, and regulation of the immune response []. Targeted immune cell types include macrophages, dendritic cells, and T and B cells. Mora and colleagues (Fig. ) [] summarized the roles and effects of vitamin D on these immune cell types []: Macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) constitutively express VDRs, whereas VDR expression in T cells is upregulated only after activation. In macrophages and monocytes, 1,25(OH)VD positively impacts its own effects by increasing the expression of VDR and the cytochrome P450 protein, CYP27B1. Certain Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated signals also can increase the expression of VDRs. The active form of vitamin D induces monocyte proliferation and the expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and cathelicidin (an antimicrobial peptide) by macrophages, contributing to innate immune responses to some bacteria. 1,25(OH)VD decreases DC maturation, inhibiting upregulation of the expression of MHC class II, CD40, CD80, and CD86. In addition, it decreases IL-12 production by DCs while inducing the production of IL-10. In T cells, 1,25(OH)VD reduces the production of IL-2, IL-17, and interferon-γ (IFNγ) and attenuates the cytotoxic activity and proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The active metabolite of vitamin D might also promote the development of forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3)+ regulatory ( ) cells and IL-10-producing regulatory type 1 (TR1) cells. 1,25(OH)VD blocks B cell proliferation, plasma cell differentiation, and immunoglobulin production. Notable in the context of this review, many of the mechanisms of vitamin D on immune processes have similarities to mechanisms described for interferon-beta []. Definition of Vitamin D Deficiency and Targeted Levels of Vitamin D The clinical definition of vitamin D deficiency and what constitutes optimal levels has been the subject of debate. Two organizations, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the Endocrine Society, have released separate recommendations regarding vitamin D requirements [, , ]. Blood levels of 25(OH)D as suggested by the IOM and the Endocrine Society and the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) by both organizations are provided in Table  [, , ]. The foundational basis for the recommendations by these two organizations are fundamentally different. The IOM guidelines based their recommendation on a population model and focused on bone health (calcium absorption, bone mineral density, and osteomalacia/rickets) aiming to prevent vitamin D deficiency in 97.5% of the general population. Based on the model applied, no evidence was found that a serum 25(OH)D concentration > 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) had beneficial effects at a population level. Therefore, the IOM concluded that the daily requirements for vitamin D were adequate to reach the “sufficient” 25(OH)D level of 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), and that these levels were generally attained by most of the population [, ]. Alternatively, the Endocrine Society concluded that a level of 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) was not sufficient. The Endocrine Society based their recommendations on a medical model taking into consideration available evidence on skeletal and extraskeletal effects of vitamin D, in addition to the few negative studies. Moreover, they took into consideration the low toxicity potential of vitamin D supplementation. In their view, serum 25(OH)D levels of ≥ 30 ng/mL (≥ 75 nmol/L) are “sufficient” for children and adults, levels of 40–60 ng/mL (100–150 nmol/L) are “ideal” (considering assay variability), and levels of up to 100 ng/mL (250 nmol/L) could be considered “safe” [, ]. The Endocrine Society advocates for screening and corrective action for individuals at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Such individuals include African American and Hispanic children and adults; pregnant and lactating women; older adults with a history of falls or nontraumatic fractures; obese children and adults (BMI > 30 kg/m); and patients with musculoskeletal diseases, chronic kidney disease, hepatic failure, malabsorption syndromes, and some lymphomas []. Furthermore, the group recommends supplementation at suggested daily intake and tolerable-upper-limit levels, depending on age and clinical circumstances (Table ) [, , , ]. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D and the tolerable-upper-limit levels vary with age and under certain circumstances such as those involving pregnancy, obesity, or comorbidities. A daily dose of 600–800 IU should satisfy the requirements for optimal bone health [], but a higher intake (1000–2000 IU) is needed to achieve and maintain 25(OH)D levels > 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) []. Vitamin D supplements can be administered daily, weekly, monthly, or every 4 months to reach an adequate serum 25(OH)D concentration. For cases of extreme vitamin D deficiency, a bolus application of vitamin D has been proposed, but a steady-state serum 25(OH)D concentration is more likely to be maintained by more frequent, lower doses of vitamin D []. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is widely preferred over vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), as it has proven to be the more potent form of vitamin D in all primate species, including humans []. Vitamin D supplementation at doses of 1500–2000 IU/day for adults as suggested by the Endocrine Society appears to be well tolerated, with relatively minor concerns about toxicity for most patients []. Caution should be exercised in patients with impairment of renal function, cardiovascular diseases, chronic granuloma-forming disorders (sarcoidosis or tuberculosis), or chronic fungal infections. Some patients with lymphoma have activated macrophages that produce 1,25(OH)VD in an unregulated fashion. 1,25(OH)VD stimulates intestinal calcium absorption []. Without vitamin D, only 10–15% of dietary calcium and about 60% of phosphorus are absorbed. Vitamin D sufficiency enhances absorption of calcium by 30–40% and phosphorus by 80% [, , ]. Vitamin D intoxication is characterized by hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia and in the long term, can lead to soft tissue and vascular calcification and nephrolithiasis []. After review of available literature, the Endocrine Practice Guidelines Committee concluded that vitamin D toxicity is a rare event caused by inadvertent or intentional ingestion of excessively high amounts of vitamin D []. Concerns were expressed for people with 25(OH)D levels of 150 ng/mL (375 nmol/L) or higher, when daily doses of vitamin D exceed 10,000 IU or when high intake of vitamin D is combined with high intake of calcium. A dose-ranging study reported that 10,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 for 5 months in healthy men did not alter their serum calcium or their urinary calcium excretion, which is the most sensitive indicator for potential vitamin D intoxication []. However, there is a paucity of evidence supporting the use of higher levels of vitamin D over a prolonged time []. Safety findings in three studies conducted in patients with MS using doses of vitamin D above 10,000 IU/day are noteworthy. One open-label trial of vitamin D in patients with MS evaluated the safety of a dose-escalation protocol from 4000 to 40,000 IU/day (mean of 14,000 IU/day). Concomitantly, patients received 1200 mg of calcium per day . a control group (allowed up to 4000 IU/day of vitamin D and supplemental calcium if desired) over 1 year []. All calcium-related measures within and between groups were normal. Despite a mean peak 25(OH)D level of 165 ng/mL (413 nmol/L), no significant adverse events occurred. The safety results were in line with a previously conducted, smaller study in 12 patients with MS also using doses of up to 40,000 IU []. In the third study, 15 patients with relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) were supplemented with 20,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 for 12 weeks []. The median vitamin D level increased from 50 nmol/L (range: 31–175 nmol/L) at week 0–380 nmol/L (range: 151–535 nmol/L) at week 12 ( < 0.001). All patients completed the observation period without side effects, hypercalcemia, or hypercalciuria []. There are cases in the literature in which exceptionally high doses (considerably above the daily upper limit of 10,000 IU) led to vitamin D toxicity: Bell and coworkers described a 67-year-old woman with vitamin D intoxication. Because of a compounding error by the pharmacy, the woman had taken 600,000 IU (rather than the intended 600 IU) of cholecalciferol daily for more than 3 years, leading to reversible hypercalcemia and partially reversible renal impairment []. Fragoso and colleagues reported considerable vitamin D toxicity in 21 MS patients who were exposed to levels ranging from 8000 IU/day to extremely high, supra-physiological doses of 150,000 IU/day (average 87,000 IU) []. In order to assess the correlation between vitamin D and MS, a literature search of large, prospective, observational studies, epidemiological studies, and studies using new approaches such as Mendelian randomization was conducted. This article is based on previously conducted studies, and as such, does not involve any new studies of human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors. Since vitamin D was proposed as an important factor in MS development in the 1970s, numerous experimental and epidemiologic studies have been conducted to answer key questions such as Does vitamin D prevent MS? How does vitamin D impact MS activity? and Can vitamin D supplementation favorably alter the course of MS? Observational study data does suggest that adequate vitamin D levels may reduce the risk of MS and affect the course of the disease. However, study limitations restrict the extent to which inverse associations can be attributed to vitamin D, and additional studies are needed to further understand the nature of this association []. Epidemiologic studies substantiate that the prevalence of MS is greater at higher latitudes and tends to peak in areas with the lowest exposure to ultraviolet light [,,,,,]. Additionally, to some degree, diets rich in vitamin D-containing oily fish may offset this risk [, ]. In “historical” cohorts, the risk of MS decreased among people who migrate from higher to lower latitudes []. However, this latitudinal finding has appeared to decline in recent decades and may be linked to an increased trend towards avoiding sun exposure or staying indoors for longer portions of the day, even in warmer climates [, ]. An Australian case–control study examined whether leisure sun exposure, combined with 25(OH)D status impacts the risk of a first demyelinating event and whether this was related to a latitude gradient []. Independently, higher levels of sun exposure (past, recent, and cumulative), higher actinic skin damage and higher 25(OH)D levels were associated with significantly reduced risks of a demyelinating event. The investigators calculated that the differences in leisure sun exposure, serum 25(OH)D level, and skin type would additively account for a 32.4% increase in the incidence of first demyelinating events from the low to high latitude regions in Australia []. The independent association of sun exposure and MS risk suggests that UV light itself may influence MS risk. Partially supporting this is research that showed that experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) could be prevented in mice through whole-body irradiation with UV light []. However, this research did not discriminate between vitamin D-related and nonrelated effects of UV light. The research did note that in the Northern Hemisphere, significantly more people with MS are born in May (9.1%), when there is less sunlight during pregnancy than in November (8.5%), when there is an increased amount of sunlight []. Some argue that this is an artifact of more births during certain months [] though others disagree []. Using data from two large cohorts of the Nurses’ Health Study involving more than 187,000 women (including 300 who developed MS during the study), Munger and colleagues evaluated the association between calculated vitamin D intake from diet or supplements and the risk of developing MS []. Women who had a higher intake of dietary vitamin D (approximately 700 IU/day) had a 33% lower incidence of MS compared with those with lower intake. In addition, women who used vitamin D supplements (≥ 400 IU/day) had a 41% reduced risk of developing MS compared to non-users. Having higher levels of 25(OH)D (irrespective of dietary vitamin D intake) also seems to predict a lower risk of MS onset. Using a longitudinal study design, Munger and colleagues evaluated serum vitamin D levels derived from blood samples of seven million US military personnel. Those with 25(OH)D levels greater than 100 nmol/L (40 ng/mL) had a 62% lower chance of subsequently developing MS []. Vitamin D Levels During Pregnancy and MS Risk in Offspring The Finnish Maternity Cohort is a comprehensive registry, established in 1983, that includes more than 800,000 women and more than 1.5 million serum samples. This cohort also served as a basis for examining the association of vitamin D levels during pregnancy and MS risk []. One hundred ninety-three patients with a diagnosis of MS, whose mothers were captured in the registry and had an available serum sample from the pregnancy with the affected child, were matched with 326 controls. Vitamin D levels were low in both groups, but lower in the mothers of MS patients than in controls [34.6 nmol/L (13.9 ng/mL) vs. 37.5 nmol/L (15.0 ng/mL);  = 0.006]. Moreover, MS risk was 90% higher in the offspring of vitamin D-deficient mothers [25(OH)D < 30 nmol/L (12.0 ng/mL)] compared with offspring of mothers who were not vitamin D deficient [relative risk, 1.90; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.20–3.01;  = 0.006] []. These data suggest that insufficient vitamin D levels during pregnancy may increase the risk of MS []. The association between neonatal 25(OH)D status and risk of MS was examined in a large population-based case–control study using data from the nationwide Danish MS Registry and the Danish Newborn Screening Biobank (DNSB) []. Data from 521 patients with MS and 972 controls were investigated. The analysis by quintiles revealed individuals with the highest risk of MS were in the lowest quintile group of 25(OH)D (< 20.7 nmol/L), and individuals the lowest risk were in the highest quintile group (≥ 48.9 nmol/L); with an odds ratio for highest vs. lowest group of 0.53 (95% CI 0.36–0.78). Children born with 25(OH)D levels < 30 nmol/L seemed to be at an especially high risk of developing MS. The additional benefits of higher levels of 25(OH)D were less pronounced []. Studies Utilizing Mendelian Randomization to Measure MS Risk Data on vitamin D and risk of MS have been largely based on observational studies that measure an inverse association. However, MS is identified as the primary cause of low 25(OH)D) and thus cannot be excluded with these methods. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses use genetic associations to test the effects of biomarkers, such as 25(OH)D, on the risk of disease, because inherited alleles are not affected by most confounding variables or disease status [, ]. Thus, the possibility of confounding or reverse causation can largely be excluded. Three recent publications made use of this epidemiological approach. Mokry and colleagues applied genome-wide data on genetic variants that predicted blood 25(OH)D levels from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study to participants in the International MS Genetics Consortium study []. They found that a genetically determined decrease in blood 25(OH)D level predicted increased MS susceptibility. An increase of 25(OH)D levels by 50% decreased the odds of getting MS by approximately 50% [, ]. Similar findings were seen from MR analyses using data from two populations, a US administrative claim database and two population-based case–control studies from Sweden []. The third publication, from the Network of Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Centers, again investigated the US and Swedish datasets []. Genetic risk scores were used to estimate the causal association between low 25(OH)D levels and pediatric-onset MS. This data also supports independent and causal effects of decreased 25(OH)D levels on susceptibility to pediatric-onset MS []. Studies Contradicting the Association of Vitamin D Levels with MS Risk Ueda and colleagues investigated the link between vitamin D status at birth and risk of adult-onset MS in a population-based, multicenter, case–control study in Sweden []. The authors analyzed stored neonatal dried blood samples of 459 MS subjects and 663 controls (matched on sex, age, and residential area). There was no association between neonatal serum 25(OH)D quintiles and risk of MS as adults. When the findings were adjusted for confounding factors in early life (e.g., month of birth, latitude of birth, and breastfeeding), in adult life (e.g., sun exposure, intake of vitamin D-rich dairy products, fatty fish consumption, smoking, and body mass index at 20 years of age), ancestry, MS heredity, and socioeconomic group, results were not considerably affected []. Whether the study provided conclusive results was the subject of debate for two primary reasons: (1) blood samples at birth were not well preserved and may have been affected by substantial degradation of 25(OH)D; and (2) the range of 25(OH)D levels at birth was narrow and mostly low (mean = 29.7 nmol/L, median = 25.6, interquartile range = 17.0–38.4 nmol/L) []. Optic neuritis (ON) is a common first symptom of MS. Pihl-Jensen and coworkers conducted a cross-sectional study to assess whether 25(OH)D levels can predict later development of MS in acute ON by evaluating the differences in mean serum 25(OH)D levels between subjects with ON ( = 164) and those with MS ( = 948) []. Deseasonalized serum 25(OH)D levels of the ON onset group were used for statistical analyses. The majority (56.1%) of the patients had 25(OH)D levels below 50 nmol/L (mean 47.64 ± 21.48 nmol/L). There were no significant differences in 25(OH)D levels between ON subjects who developed MS and those who did not develop MS during the median follow-up time of 741 days ( = 0.279), indicating no statistically significant effect on the hazard of MS development. However, significant associations were found between 25(OH)D levels and elevated IgG index levels or CSF pleocytosis, both markers of inflammatory activity or risk of MS. The interpretation of the latter finding was difficult due to the risk of reverse causation. Although the role of using 25(OH)D levels as a predictor for the development of MS after acute ON could not be demonstrated, the study data do suggest that there may be a link between development of MS after acute ON. They also provide a rationale for additional research for a possible role of vitamin D in the early stages of MS []. Levels of Dietary Vitamin D Intake and Risk of MS–Implications for Public Health Whether a daily dose of vitamin D or a gestational dose of vitamin D per day is not yet proven []. Additionally, it is not known what level of serum 25(OH)D would prevent MS in a large majority of individuals. Most studies in this review reported 25(OH)D levels below 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) in a significant proportion of their investigated populations, which is below the healthy minimum level. Indicating that establishing a target in the general population general population, pregnant women, and their offspring to achieve the minimum levels of 25(OH)D may be considered an important goal for health (i.e., 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL), according to IOM [, ] or 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL), according to the Endocrine Society) [, ]. Effects of Vitamin D Status and MS Disease Activity Understanding how existing vitamin D levels and vitamin D exposure affect clinical relapses and MS lesion activity is critically important to this review. As such, the findings from larger studies investigating these effects are summarized below. Impact of Vitamin D Levels on Disease Activity in RRMS: Observational Studies In a prospective longitudinal study from the Netherlands, 25(OH)D was measured every 8 weeks for a mean of 1.7 years in 73 patients with RRMS []. Fifty-eight patients experienced a total of 139 exacerbations during the study period. Relapse risk was significantly reduced in those with medium [50–100 nmol/L (20–40 ng/mL)] and high [> 100 nmol/L (> 40 ng/mL)] serum vitamin D levels (vs. < 50 mol/L or 20 ng/mL) compared to those with low levels []. For each doubling of serum vitamin D concentration from baseline of 10, 20, 30, MS relapse risk decreased by 27%. Although this suggests a beneficial effect of vitamin D on MS, it must be noted that there is also a possibility that conditions associated with MS relapse had an effect on serum vitamin D levels []. Incident rate ratios (RR) for relapse in relation to serum vitamin D levels were measured in a retrospective study of 110 patients with pediatric-onset MS []. After adjusting for several factors (age, gender, race, ethnicity, disease duration, and treatment), the authors found that every 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L) increase in 25(OH)D level was associated with a 34% decrease in relapse risk. Similar findings were seen in a prospective cohort study from Tasmania, Australia, in a group of 145 adults with RRMS, in which 25(OH)D levels were measured twice a year for a period of 3 years []. For each 10 nmol/L increase in serum vitamin D level, there was an associated 12% lower risk of MS relapse. Adjustment for potential confounders, such as timing of the blood testing, did not affect the results. Most of the participants in this study (82%) were receiving immunomodulatory therapy. The authors concluded that raising 25(OH)D levels by 50 nmol/L could decrease the hazard of a relapse by up to 50% (Fig. ) []. The EPIC natural history study was a 5-year cohort study conducted at the University of California, San Francisco which sought to determine the associations between serum or plasma vitamin D levels and MRI activity in a group of 469 white, mostly non-Hispanic patients with MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) []. Sixty-four percent received disease-modifying therapy within the previous 12 months. Vitamin D levels increased significantly during the study, especially for those patients using supplements. Only 9% of patients were taking vitamin D supplements at baseline, but 43% were taking them by year 5. Patients who reported using vitamin D supplements had an 8.7 ng/mL (21.75 nmo/L) higher vitamin D level, on average, compared with those who did not. Additionally, lower vitamin D levels were strongly associated with development of new T2 lesions and with contrast-enhancing lesions on brain MRI. Each additional 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L) increment of 25(OH)D was associated with a 15% lower risk of new T2 lesions and a 32% lower risk of enhancing lesions (Fig. ) []. Higher vitamin D levels were associated with a lower (but not statistically significantly) risk of MS relapses. Findings from this study also showed strong “within-person” effects of vitamin D levels in individual patients with MS. The authors concluded that “individuals with CIS/RRMS with higher vitamin D levels are at much lower risk of the subsequent development of new lesions and of gadolinium (Gd+)-enhancing lesions on brain MRI, even after accounting for potential confounding factors” []. More recently, Mowry and colleagues examined the association of vitamin D levels with brain volume measures and new lesions in patients with CIS ( = 65) []. The scientific rationale for these data are based on the concept that brain volume is thought to reflect neurodegeneration better than classical MRI parameters such as T2 lesion load and Gd+-enhancing lesions []. Each 25-nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D level was associated with 7.8-mL higher gray matter volume ( = 0.025). Higher levels of 25(OH)D also were associated with the composite endpoint of ≥ 3 new brain T2 lesions or ≥ 1 relapse within 1 year ( = 0.096). Despite the limitations of the small sample size, these findings suggest that higher vitamin D levels in CIS may slow neurodegeneration []. Lower vitamin D levels also correlate with other surrogates of MS disease activity, including lower odds of remaining relapse free in MS [], greater disability and disease severity in MS [, ,,], conversion from CIS to clinically definite MS (CDMS) [], and poorer nonverbal long-term memory performance []. These data were largely generated by observational studies that restrict the extent to which inverse associations can be attributed specifically to vitamin D. Properly designed and conducted clinical trials are needed to further define the nature of this association. Impact of Vitamin D Levels on Disease Activity Based on Post-Hoc Analyses from BENEFIT and BEYOND To our knowledge, no large randomized, double-blind, controlled, prospectively phase 3 trials have been conducted to study the impact of vitamin D levels on MS activity as a primary endpoint. However, in two phase 3 studies, the BENEFIT study [], and the BEYOND study [] post hoc analyses were conducted to investigate this potential link. The BENEFIT (Betaseron in Newly Emerging Multiple Sclerosis for Initial Treatment) study was a randomized trial originally designed to evaluate the impact of early versus delayed IFNB-1b treatment in patients with CIS [,,]. Patients with a first event suggestive of MS and a minimum of two clinically silent lesions on MRI were randomly assigned to receive interferon beta-1b (IFNB-1b) 250 μg ( = 292; early treatment) or placebo ( = 176; delayed treatment) subcutaneously every other day for 2 years or until diagnosis of CDMS, in which case they could switch to IFNB-1b therapy. All patients were then eligible to enter a prospective follow-up phase with open-label IFNB-1b for up to 5 years after randomization. Patients and study personnel remained unaware of initial treatment allocation throughout the study up to year 5. During the observation period, regular study visits were scheduled to collect clinical and MRI data, with visits at baseline and months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 []. A post hoc analyses aimed to determine whether vitamin D status [serum 25(OH)D levels] would predict disease activity and prognosis up to 5 years after the first attack in early-disease CIS patients []. Serum samples were collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months and levels of 25(OH)D were measured (by ELISA). Of the 468 patients included in BENEFIT, 465 patients had at least one 25(OH)D measurement, 417 had two or more, 396 had three or more, and 303 had all four measurements. 25(OH)D levels were seasonally adjusted to obtain an estimate of long-term 25(OH)D status. To minimize the possibility that lower 25(OH)D levels were a consequence, rather than the cause, of MS severity, the cumulative average 25(OH)D levels at 12 months were related to the outcomes between 12 and 60 months or between 24 and 60 months (thereby allowing inserting a 1-year lag between 25[OH]D measurements and the assessment of MS activity or progression) []. Three sets of analyses were performed: (1) continuous 50-nmol/L (20-ng/mL) increments to determine the overall linear trend; (2) quintiles to explore the dose response; and (3) categorical analysis using ≥ 50 nmol/L versus < 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) []. Findings indicated that patient characteristics affected vitamin D levels. Those with higher (seasonally adjusted) 25(OH)D levels tended to be younger and to have a lower body mass index (BMI), a lower number of T2 lesions, and a higher brain volume at the CIS stage, but otherwise were similar to patients with lower levels of 25(OH)D []. Over the 5-year follow-up period, 81.3% (377 patients) converted to MS according to the McDonald 2001 criteria that include MRI lesions [] and 46.6% (216 patients) converted to CDMS based on exacerbations or progression alone. The hazard of conversion decreased with increasing serum 25(OH)D and mean serum 25(OH)D levels at 12 months predicted subsequent conversions to McDonald MS ( = 0.02) and CDMS ( = 0.05) []. An increasing serum 25(OH)D level was associated with a decreasing rate of new active lesions on MRI; this effect was particularly strong in patients with both 6- and 12-month serum 25(OH)D measurements. A 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) increment in average serum 25(OH)D levels within the first 12 months predicted a 57% lower rate of new active lesions (RR, 95% CI: 0.43 (0.26–0.70),  < 0.001) and a 57% lower relapse rate (RR (95% CI): 0.43 (0.20–0.92,  = 0.03). In evaluating the potential progression of MS on MRI, higher levels of serum 25(OH)D were associated with less T2 lesion volume accumulation over time. For a 50 nmol/L increase in serum 25(OH)D, the relative decrease in T2 lesion volume was 20% per year ( < 0.001). Restricting results to patients with both 6-month and 12-month serum 25(OH)D measures, tended to strengthen results []. The dichotomous analysis of serum 25(OH)D levels (< 50 vs. ≥ 50 nmol/L) is shown in Fig.  []. For instance, the percentage loss of brain volume over time was lower in patients with 25(OH)D levels ≥ 50 nmol/L at the 12-month time point compared with those with serum 25(OH)D levels < 50 nmol/L ( = 0.005). Although a 50 nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D levels did not reach significance for a reduction in the average expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score ( = 0.11), patients with serum 25(OH)D levels ≥ 50 nmol/L had a significantly lower annualized change in EDSS score compared with those patients with serum 25(OH)D levels < 50 nmol/L ( = 0.004) while on IFN-b-1b. Across all analyses, associations were generally stronger for MRI than for clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, “the latter were still remarkable considering the overall low rate of relapses (0.2 per year) and small EDSS score change (median change, 0.0) in BENEFIT” []. Strengths of the BENEFIT study included (1) its longitudinal design, (2) the exclusive recruitment of patients at the CIS stage, (3) the use of repeated serum 25(OH)D measurements, (4) the large number of patients, (5) standardized treatment (e.g., early vs. late IFNB-1b), and (6) rigorous clinical and MRI assessment of all patients during a 5-year period. Limitations of the study included (1) the fact that most patients were eventually treated with IFNB-1b and some crossed over during the 2 years of the study, and (2) while a clear dose response was observed for the most sensitive MRI outcomes, the effects did not reach a plateau level, and, therefore, serum 25(OH)D levels greater than the median 69 nmol/L could have had a greater effect. According to the authors, a low 25(OH)D level early in the disease course is a strong risk factor for long-term MS activity and progression in patients with early MS who were treated with IFNB-1b []. The BENEFIT cohort had an early treatment group and a delayed treatment group. The associations of 25(OH)D levels and MS activity were more pronounced for patients in the early treatment group than for those in the delayed treatment group (Table  [] and Fig.  []), although a test for interaction between 25(OH)D levels and treatment assignment was significant only for the time to CDMS ( = 0.04) []. These results suggest that early treatment with IFNB-1b may have an additive effect along with 25(OH)D to reduce disease severity and progression in both clinical and imaging outcomes. To explore the mechanistic rationale for the potential additive effects of 25(OH)D levels and early IFNB-1b treatment, Munger and colleagues conducted a global gene expression analysis in which expression profiles were measured at various time points among participants in the BENEFIT clinical trial []. The relationship between genes or gene sets expressed in association with 25(OH)D and those associated with MS activity was examined. The numbers of Gd+-enhancing lesions served as a marker of disease activity. A 50 nmol/L increase in serum 25(OH) levels reduced the Gd+ lesion count by 55%. Adjusting for gender, age, treatment, and treatment − 25(OH)D interaction did not alter the significance of the findings. Gene expression in whole blood was studied in 295 individuals, evaluating approximately 19,000 genes. Reduced Gd+ lesion count was significantly associated with increased expression of 25(OH)D-related genes, an effect that was independent of IFNB-1b treatment. This effect was also noticed when looking at single genes that were associated with regulation of 25(OH)D levels. The authors hypothesized that there was an additive effect of 25(OH)D and IFNB-1bin reducing Gd+ lesion counts []. The second data set from randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trials in MS was derived from the BEYOND (Betaseron Efficacy Yielding Outcomes of a New Dose) study []. Compared with the BENEFIT study, the BEYOND study included patients with established MS (vs. patients with CIS) and was shorter in duration (2 vs. 5 years). It also included considerably more patients (1482 vs. 465) and was conducted in different geographical regions (North America, Western and Eastern Europe, Southern Hemisphere vs. Europe and Canada). BEYOND was a large, phase 3, prospective, multicenter, blinded, randomized clinical trial. Patients were monitored for at least 2 years. Clinical visits were scheduled every 3 months, and an MRI was performed at baseline and annually thereafter. A post hoc analysis assessed 25(OH)D levels and the subsequent MS disease course and disease progression as characterized by MRI and clinical endpoints []. Eligible patients for the vitamin D analyses included 1482 participants randomized to receive 250, or 500 μg of IFNB-1b with at least two measurements of 25(OH)D obtained 6 months apart. Serum 25(OH)D measurements were performed at baseline, 6, and 12 months. In longitudinal analyses, 25(OH)D was inversely correlated with the cumulative number of active lesions between baseline and the last MRI (average follow-up time, 2 years). A 50-nmol/L higher level of serum 25(OH)D was associated with a 31% lower rate of new lesions [relative rate (RR), 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55–0.86;  = 0.001]. This inverse association was also strong and significant in analyses restricted to patients with 25(OH)D levels > 50 nmol/L (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46–0.84;  = 0.002) and was consistent in each of the four geographic regions (Fig. ) []. The lowest rate of new lesions was observed among patients with 25(OH)D levels > 100 nmol/L (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37–0.78;  = 0.002). No significant associations were found between 25(OH)D levels and change in brain volume, relapse rates, or EDSS scores []. Strengths of this study include the large number of participants, the regionally diverse population with varying baseline characteristics, and the repeated measurements of 25(OH)D, which helped characterize patients’ long-term vitamin D status. The relatively short follow-up is the most important limitation of this study. This limited follow-up may explain the lack of association between serum 25(OH)D levels and measures of brain atrophy or clinical endpoints, both of which were modified by 25(OH)D in the longer BENEFIT study [, ]. Regarding targeted vitamin D levels, the authors stated: “Our observation of the lowest level of MS activity among patients with serum 25(OH)D levels above 100.0 nmol/L [40 ng/mL] is consistent with the results of a previous investigation in the US [], and suggests that the 25(OH)D levels in most patients with MS who are not receiving supplemental vitamin D may be suboptimal” []. Effects of Disease-Modifying Therapies on Vitamin D Levels in MS Patients MS disease activity may be additively affected by vitamin D and IFNB-1b []. This hypothesis is supported by investigations from the same researchers suggesting that processes regulated and triggered by 25(OH)D may be additively enhanced by IFNB-1b [], and independently by observations from Stewart and colleagues from the Menzies Research Institute in Tasmania []. In an observational cohort study, conducted in 178 patients with MS, vitamin D levels were measured every 6 months over an average of 2.2 years. Patients who took an interferon had significantly higher 25(OH)D levels than those who did not ( < 0.001). Each 10-nmol/L increase in serum vitamin D was associated with a 10% lower relapse rate. Interestingly, interferon treatment was protective only against relapse among persons with higher vitamin D levels. Among those with insufficient vitamin D, there was an increased risk of relapse despite interferon treatment. The investigators hypothesized that treatment with IFNB may increase serum vitamin D levels through enhanced responsiveness to sun exposure and recommended that persons being treated with IFNB should have vitamin D status monitored and maintained in the sufficiency range []. Also, noteworthy from these data, this group did not find similar associations for glatiramer acetate (GA) therapy and vitamin D. The notion of complementary or even synergistic effects of IFNB and vitamin D is further supported by observations from Rotstein and coworkers based on the CLIMB (Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigation of MS at Brigham and Women’s Hospital) cohort []. The CLIMB cohort is a prospective cohort study that began enrolling patients in 2000. The objective of the study was to determine whether 25(OH)D levels predicted new disease activity in MS patients treated with IFN-β ( = 96) or GA ( = 151). Separately, due to different selection criteria, a similar analysis was conducted for patients treated with fingolimod (FTY,  = 77). Serum 25(OH)D concentration was adjusted for season, and patients were divided into subgroups by 25(OH)D tertile. The primary study endpoint was ‘time to first inflammatory event’, defined as a combination of either first relapse or first Gd+ lesion, using a Cox model adjusted for age, sex, and disease duration. The results demonstrated higher 25(OH)D levels associated with a longer time to the combined first event in the IFNB subgroup [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.58;  = 0.012], but not in GA-treated participants (HR = 0.89;  = 0.50). For Gd+ lesions alone, there was a significant association observed in GA and IFNB subgroups, although the effect was more pronounced with IFNB (HR = 0.57;  = 0.039 vs. HR = 0.41;  = 0.022). No significant associations were found for relapses. There were some sampling difficulties in this cohort and, therefore, the results need to be interpreted with certain caution. For FTY, due to the mandated first-dose observation, samples were available for all patients. Higher 25(OH)D was associated with a longer time to the first event (HR = 0.48;  = 0.016) and with relapses (HR = 0.50;  = 0.046), but not with Gd+ lesions []. The large, prospective cohort and the prolonged follow-up times were strengths of this study, as well as the availability of two 25(OH)D measurements for the majority of patients. However, more regular 25(OH)D measurements would have been ideal and offered greater insights into study conclusions []. Studies Contradicting the Association of Vitamin D Levels with Disease Activity Contradictory to the aforementioned information are findings reported by researchers from Norway []. In this small prospective cohort study, 88 patients with RRMS were followed with regular MRI and 25(OH)D measurements during 6 months before and up to 18 months after initiation of IFNB. During the pre–IFNB treatment phase, higher levels of 25(OH)D were associated with reduced MRI activity; each 10-nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D was associated with 12.7% ( = 0.037) lower odds for new T1 Gd + lesions, 11.7% ( = 0.044) lower odds for new T2 lesions, and 14.1% ( = 0.024) lower odds for combined unique activity. However, there was no association between 25(OH)D and disease activity after initiation of IFNB. With clinical measures, neither the occurrence of relapses nor EDSS progression was associated with 25(OH)D levels during both study phases. Strengths of the study were the prospective design and the frequent MRI and 25(OH)D assessments during the observation period. Limitations were the relatively short time on IFNB and the small number of participants, as well as the minimal 4 nmol/L increase in serum vitamin D levels following vitamin D supplementation. In the discussion of the study results, the authors expressed their surprise about the lack of an association between 25(OH)D levels and MRI after initiation of IFNB, “as there is no evidence suggesting that the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D are counteracted by IFNB or vice versa. A reasonable explanation is that IFNB reduced radiologic disease activity, leaving relatively little left to be reduced” by vitamin D []. When reviewing available data discussing the effects of vitamin D and MS, of key interest is whether vitamin D supplementation can favorably alter the course of MS. Unfortunately, current evidence does not offer consensus to answer this question. Studies with vitamin D alone or with vitamin D as an add-on to a disease-modifying therapy are conflicting [, ,,,,,,,,,,]. Although these studies are generally small, largely uncontrolled, and used highly variable doses of vitamin D, it can be noted that there are initial promising data arguing for vitamin D supplementation in patients with MS [, ,,,,,,]. Furthermore, recent investigations with immunological response markers suggest that vitamin D supplementation in patients with MS exhibits in vivo pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects in MS [], and lacking evidence of a treatment effect does not necessarily demonstrate proof of no effect. Studies Supporting the Benefit of Supplemental Vitamin D Researchers from Finland conducted a 1-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with vitamin D3 as an add-on treatment to IFNB-1b in patients with MS. Thirty-four patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group (vitamin D, 20,000 IU/week vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), and IFNB-1b) and 32 to the control group (placebo and IFNB-1b) []. The primary outcome measure was an MRI T2 burden of disease (BOD), which tended to increase more in the placebo group (median change of 287 mm) than in the vitamin D group (median change of 83 mm); however, the difference was not statistically significant ( = 0.105) (Fig. ) []. Results for other MRI outcomes were mixed. The number of T1 Gd+ lesions decreased in both groups ( = 0.002), but the change was significantly higher in the vitamin D group ( = 0.04). New/enlarging T2 lesions at the 12-month point trended higher in the placebo group, but the differences were not statistically significant ( = 0.286). The percentage of patients with MRI activity (12-month time point) trended lower in the vitamin D group, but these differences also did not reach significance ( = 0.322). While there was no significant difference in annual relapse rate demonstrated between groups, there was a tendency toward reduced disability accumulation as measured by EDSS ( = 0.071) and toward improved timed tandem walk ( = 0.076). There were no significant differences in adverse events between the groups. The authors concluded that larger randomized, controlled trials with more than 1 year of follow-up are warranted to confirm the promising MRI results and to fully address clinical outcomes []. A study by Burton and colleagues introduced earlier in this manuscript in the context of the safety profile of higher doses of vitamin D supplementation also offers insight into the role of vitamin D supplementation and the disease course of MS []. In this open-label, controlled trial, patients were randomized to a vitamin D treatment group ( = 25, escalation protocol 4000–40,000 IU/day, mean 14,000 IU/day) or to a control group ( = 24, received vitamin D3 4000 IU/day if desired). Despite the high doses of vitamin D, no significant adverse events occurred during the 52-week study period. The annualized relapse rate during the trial year was lower in the treatment group than in the control group (0.26 vs. 0.45;  = 0.09), and more patients in the treatment group remained relapse free. Additionally, the treated patients reported a persistent reduction in T-cell proliferation compared with controls, and treatment group patients appeared to have fewer relapse events and a persistent reduction in T-cell proliferation compared to controls. Study limitations included the use of supplementation or other agents in the control group, the small sample-size, and thus the limited power []. The Danish Multiple Sclerosis Center prospectively gathered data in a cohort of 170 natalizumab-treated patients during winter 2009–2010 (baseline) with follow-up during the subsequent winter []. Patients with insufficient serum 25(OH)D levels (selected cut-off 50 nmol/L) at baseline were advised to take Vitamin D supplements according to Danish recommendations: 2000 IU for patients with levels between 25 and 50 nmol/L, 3000 IU for those with levels between 25 and 12.5 nmol/L and 4000 IU for those with levels below 12.5 nmol/L. 134 patients were included in the clinical data set. Of the 134 patients, 43 had taken vitamin D supplements due to vitamin D insufficiency (mean 25(OH)D levels: 34 nmol/L). Their levels increased significantly by 32.6 nmol/L (95% CI: 24.4–40.8 nmol/L,  < 0.0001) from baseline to follow-up. Moreover, a significant inverse relationship with the annualized relapse rate (ARR) was found: for each nmol/l increase in 25(OH)D, a 0.014 (95% CI − 0.026 to − 0.003) decrease in ARR was observed ( = 0.02). Overall, the data suggest that correcting vitamin D insufficiency by the means of vitamin D supplements in patients with MS may be beneficial []. Darwish and colleagues looked into the cognitive effects of vitamin D supplementation of patients with MS on IFNB []. At baseline, patients were stratified into a vitamin D-deficient group (25(OH)D levels < 25 ng/mL or 62.5 nmol/L,  = 39) and a vitamin D-sufficient group (25(OH)D levels > 35 ng/mL or 87.5 nmol/L). “Deficient” patients received 10,000 IU vitamin D3 daily for 3 months and reported a significant increase of 25(OH)D levels to 49.0 ± 14.6 ng/mL (122.5 ± 36.5 nmol/L). Additionally, after 3 months these “deficient” patients scored better on the Brief Visuospatial Memory test delayed recall (BVMT-DR,  = 0.02) and the montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA,  = 0.006), but not on the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) and Stroop. The authors concluded that the lack of significant change on the SDMR and Stroop testing was due to the short disease duration and the propensity for study participants to perform within normal ranges for these tests. Alternatively, “sufficient” patients continued their usual treatment that may have included vitamin D3 supplementation at various dosages. These patients reported 25(OH)D levels at 64.2 ± 18.7 ng/mL (160.5 ± 46.8 nmol/L) at study end. Sufficient 25(OH)D levels predicted better cognitive performance on the BVMT-DR at baseline and 3 months after adjusting for all measured confounding variables. Study limitations included a small study population ( = 88), short study duration (3 months), and a quarter of the patients not returning to the month 3 visit. The authors also described not allowing true control for other sources of vitamin D as other possible confounders, such as sun exposure and dietary vitamin D []. Only available in abstract format are the results of two studies which evaluated the benefits and risks associated with high-dose vitamin D supplementation in patients treated with IFNB-1a. Although both failed to demonstrate an effect on clinical parameters, their MRI results demonstrated positive results. SOLAR is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 2 study. Two hundred and twenty-nine patients with a 25(OH)D serum level below 150 nmol/L were randomly assigned to cholecalciferol at a dose of 14,000 IU per day or placebo []. All patients received subcutaneous IFNB-1a. After recruitment delays, the study design was adjusted and the percentage of patients with “disease activity free” status (defined as no relapses, no EDSS progression, and no new Gd+ or T2 MRI lesions) at week 48 were introduced as a new primary endpoint. This endpoint was not met (37.2% for cholecalciferol group vs. 35.3% for placebo group,  = 0.912). Likewise, no differences between groups for other clinical parameters such as ARR or EDSS were found. However, results regarding the MRI parameters were promising with a significant 32% reduction in the number of new, combined, unique active lesions in the cholecalciferol group ( = 0.005). Furthermore, there was a trend toward more cholecalciferol recipients being free from new T1 hypointense lesions, which became significant in those aged 18–30 years. The short duration of the trial (48 weeks) and the relatively small sample size (229 patients) may have led to the lack of significance of the clinical outcomes. For comparisons, most randomized trials of new MS drugs recruited over 800 patients to be able to demonstrate a significant effect vs. placebo. Despite the large sizes, some were not able to show a significant effect on disability progression (e.g. CONFIRM study [] TRANSFORMS []). Additionally, these data are not placebo-controlled, but rather an active comparator. Also, the power analysis is not designed to assess a minor effect and would require > 10,000 patients. Likewise, the second study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study []. One hundred and twenty-nine patients ( = 129) were randomly assigned to receive 100,000 IU of cholecalciferol twice monthly (equivalent to a daily dose of 7143 IU) in addition to IFNB-1a over a 24-month period. Again, significant effects in favor of vitamin D supplementation were found for selected MRI parameters such as new or enlarged weighted T1 and T2 lesion, but no effect was found for clinical parameters []. A preliminary study from Iran conducted by Etemadifar and colleagues assessed the safety and efficacy of high-dose vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy in women with MS []. Fifteen pregnant women with confirmed MS and with serum 25(OH)D levels < 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) were randomly allocated to received 50,000 IU/week (daily dose of 7143 IU) vitamin D3 or routine care from 12 to 16 weeks of gestation until delivery. 25(OH)D levels increased significantly and no significant adverse events occurred. The women in the vitamin D group had significantly fewer relapses during pregnancy (0 vs. 5;  < 0.05), a tendency for fewer relapses up to 6 months after pregnancy (0 vs. 4; statistically nonsignificant), and a more stable EDSS than those without supplementation. The authors advocated for adding high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation during pregnancy to the routine care of women with MS. Study limitations included a small sample size, and conclusions are limited by the loss to follow-up of 37 out of 52 of the original baseline cohort []. The role of vitamin D supplementation in patients with MS was also evaluated by Jelinek and colleagues, with the authors taking a very different epidemiological approach []. This was an internet survey among 2301 patients with MS who self-reported data on geographical location, intentional sun exposure for health, supplementation with vitamin D, and other lifestyle variables, as well as self-reported doctor-diagnosed relapse rates and disability (Patient Determined Disease Steps). Survey participants were asked to respond to a health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used for comparisons, including multiple linear regression modeling. Nearly two thirds of respondents (64.6%) lived in the Northern Hemisphere, mostly in developed countries. Most (82.3%) were female, with a median age of 45 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 38–53 years) and a median time since diagnosis of 6 years (IQR: 3–12 years), with the majority (61.6%) having RRMS. More than 80% of the patients indicated that they took vitamin D supplements, mostly between 2000 and 5000 IU daily (Table ) [], and 67% reported intentional sun exposure to raise vitamin D levels. Unadjusted regression modeling incorporating deliberate sun exposure, latitude, and vitamin D supplementation showed strong associations between sun exposure and HRQoL. However, the effect disappeared when controlling for age, disability, physical activity, and fish consumption. In contrast, the associations between supplementation of vitamin D and HRQoL were maintained when adjusting for these variables, with a dose–response effect. The beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on HRQoL was considered to be of “clinically significant magnitude” []. Lower annualized relapse rates were significantly associated with taking vitamin D supplementation vs. not taking supplements. The dose taken seemed to be of less importance. No effect on disability was found for either supplementation or deliberate sun exposure, but an increase of latitude by 1° (farther from the equator) predicted increased odds of moderate or high disability []. The large data set may compensate for some of the limitations of this study design. Vitamin D supplementation (along with all other measures) was self-reported and not validated with blood tests. No validated tool exists for quantifying variables like deliberate sun exposure; in this study, the question required simply a yes/no answer []. Furthermore, there might be a selection bias in terms of the patients included, as respondents to such Internet surveys are patients who are typically very “engaged” with their situation and disease. Studies Contradicting the Benefit of Supplemental Vitamin D A study by Stein and colleagues is widely discussed among those not supporting vitamin D supplementation []. In this 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, patients were allocated to either high or low dose of vitamin D2. The high-dose regimen was 6000 IU twice daily, the low-dose regimen 1000 IU daily. Twenty-three patients were included (11 in the treatment arm, 12 in the control group). There were no significant differences between the groups on the two primary endpoints—cumulative number of new Gd+ lesions and change in the total volume of T2 lesions—nor were there differences on clinical outcome measures, such as number of relapses and effect on EDSS []. , in which the manuscript was published, ranked the study as providing class I evidence, but this rating is arguable. Although the study was double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized, the sample size was very small ( = 23). Moreover, there were withdrawals (two in the low-dose group, one in the high-dose group), and one patient from the low-dose group was partially excluded from MRI analyses due to brain surgery. Although the authors stated that the two groups were well matched, one patient (in the high-dose group) had 38 Gd+ lesions at baseline, while all other patients had between two and five Gd+ lesions at baseline. The low-dose group was, on average, 10.5 years older than the high-dose group; importantly, the number of exacerbations in MS declines over time, biasing the data in favor of the low-dose group. In addition, this study compared low-dose and high-dose vitamin D administration and did not utilize a concurrent control group of subjects that did not receive any supplemental vitamin D. Finally, even though vitamin D2 seems to be a less potent form of vitamin D than vitamin D3 in all primate species [], the 1000-IU/day regimen for the low-dose group is above what the IOM recommends in terms of daily intake [] and both groups may have benefited from vitamin D supplementation. In a 96-week, randomized, controlled trial designed to evaluate the effects of supplementation with 20,000 IU/week of vitamin D (averaged to approximately 2800 IU/day) on bone mineral density in 35 MS patients, Kampman and colleagues found that consumption of vitamin D did not result in beneficial effects on the measured MS-related outcomes, which included annualized relapse rates. However, the study was not powered to address clinical outcomes []. The authors suggested that the low annualized relapse rate seen at baseline could have contributed to the absence of significant effects in this study. Study limitations included a small sample size ( = 68), which may be inadequate for assessing effects on clinical outcomes []. Furthermore, two studies from Iran did not find a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on clinical or MRI outcome measures in patients with RRMS. Shaygannejad and colleagues studied 50 patients in a 12-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 clinical trial []. The 25 patients in the treatment group received 4000 IU/day of vitamin D for the first 2 weeks and were thereafter escalated to 8000 IU/day in addition to their disease-modifying agent. The control group ( = 25) was treated with placebo combined with disease-modifying therapy. In a separate study, Mosayebi and colleagues evaluated the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation at a dose of 300,000 IU/month vs. placebo in a randomized, prospective study with 62 patients []. Over the 6-month observation period, no differences between groups on either EDSS or Gd+ lesion count were observed, but immune-inhibitory transforming growth factor beta and interleukin 10 were significantly higher in the vitamin D-supplemented group compared with placebo []. Several of the studies above were included in a meta-analysis conducted by James and colleagues evaluating the effect of vitamin D-related intervention trials on MS relapses []. The five studies [, ,,,] included 129 patients with high-dose vitamin D supplementations and 125 controls. Administered doses of vitamin D supplementations, study designs, patient populations, outcome parameters, and observation period were considerably variable among the assessed studies. Given these differences, the numerous limitations of each of these studies and the mixed reported study results, it is not surprising that the meta-analysis did not find a significant association between vitamin D treatment and the relative risk of relapse in MS []. In the view of the authors, “further larger and more prolonged studies…are merited” to better understand the role of vitamin D supplementation in MS []. Ongoing Studies Evaluating the Role of Supplemental Vitamin D in MS A search of recently initiated and ongoing clinical studies evaluating the role of supplemental vitamin D in MS revealed the following: The Efficacy of Vitamin D Supplementation in Multiple Sclerosis (EVIDIMS) study (NCT01440062) [, ] is a German multicenter, stratified, randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical phase 2 study. Eighty patients with CIS or MS whose disease courses were stable while taking IFNB-1b were randomized to receive either high-dose (on average, 10,200 IU/day) or low-dose (on average 200 IU/day) vitamin D3 for 18 months as a supplement. The primary outcome measure is the number of new T2 lesions. Secondary endpoints include additional MRI and optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters, clinical parameters, as well as cognition, fatigue, depression, and quality of life. Safety and tolerability of high-dose vitamin D supplementation are additional outcome measures. This study is ongoing, and results are expected in 2018 or 2019. The Vitamin D to Ameliorate Multiple Sclerosis (VIDAMS) study (NCT01490502) [88, 90] is a randomized, controlled, phase 3 study that aims to include 172 patients in the US. After a run-in phase of 1 month on GA, patients will be assigned to low-dose (600 IU/day) vs. high-dose (5000 IU/day) vitamin D3 as an add-on therapy to GA. This academic study is currently recruiting patients and will terminate in 2018 [, ]. Clinical and MRI parameters will also be evaluated. Evidence available to date suggests that the level of serum vitamin D affects the risk of developing MS and also modifies disease activity in MS patients. Until several years ago, evidence that higher levels of vitamin D are associated with favorable effects on MS risk and a reduction in MS activity was supported largely by observational studies. Limitations of these studies restricted confidence in a specific effect of vitamin D in MS. Newer data with Mendelian randomization analyses suggest there is a causal relationship between low vitamin D level and the risk of MS. Furthermore, post hoc evaluations from the phase 3 BENEFIT and BEYOND studies substantiate findings of observational trials. Across all trials, associations between 25(OH) levels and MS and its activity are generally stronger for MRI than for clinical outcomes, which may be due to the higher sensitivity of MRI compared to typical clinical parameters. Low or even insufficient 25(OH)D levels were common in many earlier cohorts. Patients in more recent studies have higher baseline vitamin D levels, potentially changing the immunopathology of MS and altering responses to some therapeutic drugs. In aggregate, studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial for patients with MS and others. However, the study limitations identified in this review recognize the need for larger controlled clinical trials to establish vitamin D supplementation as the standard of care for MS patients. Though there is increasing evidence indicating that lower vitamin D levels are associated with increased risk of MS and greater clinical and brain MRI activity in established MS, the impact of vitamin D supplementation on MS activity remains inadequately investigated. There is no consensus on “sufficient” vitamin D levels. In the view of IOM, 25(OH)D levels greater than 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) are sufficient. The Endocrine Society argues for 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) or higher, based on a medical model which takes into account skeletal and non-skeletal health. Numerous studies suggest that serum 25(OH)D levels of approximately 100 nmol/L (40 ng/mL) are the lower limit for controlling MRI and clinical activity in patients with MS. More research is needed to establish the recommended levels of vitamin D supplementation necessary to reduce the risk for MS and MS clinical activity. In conclusion, based on the data reviewed, identification and correction of vitamin D insufficiency with supplementation at recommended doses is a sensible clinical action/course/target/objective and one that provides a favorable risk–benefit profile for vitamin D for most patients with MS.

Spanish Neurology Biotech Launches with €7.6M Series A Accure Therapeutics, a neurology biotech targeting central nervous system (CNS) conditions such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease, has launched in Barcelona with a Series A of €7.6M.  Alta Life Sciences, a life science venture capital firm based in the same city, and the Spanish governmental institution The Centre for Technological and Industrial Development funded the round. The new company plans to target a number of different neurological conditions and has three small molecule candidate drugs it plans to develop. Its lead candidate, which is designed to target multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, has already been tested at phase I and the company is ready to test it at phase II. Accure Therapeutics also has two preclinical candidate drugs for Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy in development. All three of these candidate drugs have been licensed from the Spanish biotechs Bionure and Iproteos. Laurent Nguyen, Accure’s CEO, was previously CEO of Bionure. “The concept of Accure Therapeutics is to power an R&D and regulatory engine dedicated only to the CNS in Europe with a critical mass able to build a diversified product portfolio by carefully selecting programs on their own merits, at least in advanced or late preclinical phase to early clinical development, to progress further,” There is a large unmet demand in the sector, but neurological diseases have proved challenging for companies to target in the past. This is particularly true for diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, with many trials failing at a late stage and many big pharma companies “Developing new drugs in CNS conditions is challenging but the reward will be high should you be successful,” “We want to capitalize on the progress made in better understanding the neurobiology and in designing adequate clinical trials… to put our candidates in the best position to demonstrate a benefit.”  Nguyen acknowledges that the current pandemic makes setting up a new company challenging, but believes that it is possible to continue with some restrictions. “When it comes to R&D activities, we are outsourcing our preclinical experiments to contract research organizations,” “Initiating and running clinical trials may be more challenging and we are in constant contact with our investigator’s site and CRO to anticipate, monitor, and adjust for potential bottlenecks. The rest of the year will tell exactly what the impact will be on our ability to execute clinical trials, if any.” It’s been a good week for neurology biotechs in Europe in terms of financing. The Swiss company Arvelle recently confirmed the , which has finally bagged a total of €188M to fund the commercialization of an anti-epileptic treatment. Another Swiss neurology startup called GliaPharm raised earlier this week to fund the preclinical development of a treatment for an undisclosed orphan neurological disease.

The course of MS is unpredictable. Some people may feel and seem healthy for many years following diagnosis, while others may be severely debilitated very quickly. Most people fit somewhere between these two extremes. Although every individual will experience a different combination of MS , and it is hard to predict how MS will affect a person over their lifetime, there have been four basic types of MS identified relating to the course of the disease. Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) is the first episode of neurological symptoms experienced by a person, lasting at least 24 hours. The person may experience a single sign or symptom, or more than one at the same time. As with MS, it is caused by inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system. Not everyone who experiences CIS goes on to develop MS, but CIS can be an indicator for it. Researchers don’t yet know why CIS turns into MS for some people but not others. If someone with CIS also has lesions (as seen on a brain MRI) that are similar to those seen in MS, then they are at higher risk. Research suggests that early of CIS can delay conversion to MS for people at high risk. In relapsing MS (sometimes called relapsing-remitting MS), people experience attacks or exacerbations of symptoms (‘relapses’), which then fade or disappear (‘remission’). The symptoms may be new, or existing symptoms may become more severe. Relapses can last for varying periods – from a few days up to months – and then the disease may then be inactive for months or years. About 85 per cent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with relapsing MS. Relapsing MS can also be categorised by whether it is or (someone who has arelapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). It can also be classified as (a confirmed increase in disability over a specified period of time following a relapse) or Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) is a secondary phase of relapsing MS that may develop years or even decades following diagnosis with relapsing MS. Most people who have relapsing MS will transition to SPMS. In SPMS there is progressive worsening of symptoms over time with no definite periods of remission. SPMS can also be categorised by whether it is or (someone who has arelapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). It can also be classified as (evidence of disease worsening over time, with or without relapses) or About 10 to 15 per cent of people with MS are diagnosed with primary progressive MS (PPMS). People with PPMS have steadily worsening symptoms and disability from the start, rather than sudden attacks or relapses followed by recovery. PPMS can also be categorised by whether it is or (someone who has arelapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). It can also be classified as (evidence of disease worsening over time, with or without relapses) or For useful descriptions of what looks like in relapsing MS, primary and secondary progressive MS, see the graphs on the National MS Society’s web page here.

Happy thanksgiving to those of you celebrating today!This is your chance to ask questions about progressive MS directly to international experts. We received a lot of questions in advance – thank you! Peer Baneke, our Chief Executive has just arrived back from Russia and has popped in to say hello. Thank you very much. Thank you all for the many suggestions you sent us for questions to answer. We’ve had questions about diet, about alternative medicine, about myelin repair and myelin protection, exercise and rehabilitation, about stem cells of course, and also about the search for a cure. Now, these are too many questions to tackle in one hour, in one webinar, so we’ll start off with progressive MS because that was the issue where most of you asked questions about. Thank you Peer. Now, over to your host for the webinar, Dr Dhia Chandraratna. Thank you Ceri. Hi, I’m Dr Dhia Chandraratna, Head of Research at the MS International Federation and I will be your host today. We are delighted to have with us two world renowned experts in MS, Professor Alan Thompson and Professor Olga Ciccarelli.Prof. Alan Thompson is the Chair of the International Medical and Scientific Board of MSIF and the Dean of the Faculty of Brain Sciences at University College London. Prof. Olga Ciccarelli is a Professor of Neurology at University College London and also one of our first ever Du Pre Grant recipients.Today they will be answering your questions on progressive MS. So let’s get started! Alan, as an introduction to the topic, can you tell us what is progressive MS?   Let me begin my saying a few words about multiple sclerosis itself and then moving along to the progressive form.  As many of you will know, MS is a condition which affects the brain, causes inflammation, damage to the myelin sheath, and damage to the nerve fibres themselves. It often affects young adults and it usually causes attacks or relapses that come and go over time. But then you also have the progressive form of MS and that basically is describing a gradual change over time, a gradual worsening of disability over time.There are two forms of progressive MS – primary progressive that occurs from the onset, right from the beginning people notice that they have some deterioration, usually in their walking which gets gradually and sometimes quite subtlety worse over time, and then there’s secondary progressive MS which occurs maybe five, ten or fifteen years after relapsing-remitting MS and again you notice this very gradual progression over time.Primary and secondary progressive MS probably constitute together up to 50-60 % of the MS population worldwide. Thank you Alan for a very clear introduction. We have some questions coming in now – from Karen in Canada and Joanne in the United States. The first is a question to Olga. They want to know why there are no treatments for progressive MS. What are the challenges in finding treatments for progressive MS? That’s correct. We don’t have available treatments to slow down progression in progressive MS and this is due to the fact that we don’t fully understand the mechanisms of progression. So there’s been a lot of research and there has been progress on understanding these mechanisms but until we understand fully why there is a neurodegeneration causing progression it is difficult to treat it.Also there is the challenge in identifying outcome measures to use in trials to measure the efficacy of treatment in performing large clinical trials with suitable medications. There are a lot of challenges but this has been tackled in recent years and hopefully we will have some good news soon.  Thank you Olga. The next question is from Jan Zantingh in Lebanon and Linda Doubleday in New Zealand. They would like to know – this is a question to Alan – why isn’t more research being done on progressive MS?  I begin by saying I agree completely with Olga that this is a more complicated form of multiple sclerosis and one which we don’t understand as well as the relapsing-remitting form. But actually there is quite a lot of research going on in the world. I think the last estimate, when we looked worldwide at all the research that is being supported, was up to $90 million spent on research into progressive MS.But there are a couple of points to make about this. I think it’s not very joined up so there’s research going on in different parts of the world independently and of course the key thing is that none of this research has got over the bar and resulted in a treatment. Until we have a treatment people feel there’s not a lot going on.  There is a lot going on but there is a real potential to bring all this research together, to focus it more and to be more strategic in how we approach it. And that’s really why the Progressive MS Alliance was established. Thank you. And just following on from that we have a question from Kevin Kelly in Ireland and Kate Cherry from Australia. They would like to know what is the Progressive MS Alliance and what are they trying to achieve. I have given an introduction to this already. The whole idea of the Progressive MS Alliance is to bring all of the research across the world together to try to tackle this very difficult issue. When you’ve got something that’s very challenging you need collaboration to try to understand it and then to treat it. The Alliance is about bringing together as many people as possible with expertise in the area to tackle the problems or the issues that are blocking or slowing treatments for progressive MS. Olga mentioned some of those and they are around having good models of the disease, understanding what is happening inside the tissue of people with progressive MS, identifying targets for treatment, having trials both early and then larger more definitive trials, having outcome measures that we could use in those trials and then the hugely important area of symptomatic treatment and rehabilitation. So the Alliance is trying to drive this area forward. It is an alliance of MS societies around the world brought together by the MS International Federation and its focus is upon treatment for progressive MS. Thank you. And just following on from that a question for Olga from Non Smit in South Africa and Sue Morris from the UK. Alan just talked about some of the areas that the Alliance is trying to focus on. Can you tell us what are the most promising areas of research in progressive MS? The most promising is trying to define a treatment that slows down progression in MS and I think this can be done by researching the mechanisms of the disease. This is achievable by studying people with MS with a clinical assessment or an imaging assessment and trying to understand what is contributing to clinical progression. Then an important area of research is evaluating outcomes which we can use in clinical trials to identify whether people are having a good response to the treatment to understand whether the treatment is effective for MS or not. And then there is important research trying to identify and measure for prognosis, so we want to know and be able to tell a person with MS whether it is likely to progress faster in a shorter period of time or perhaps slower is a long period of time. We want to give answers to individuals about their future, about what’s going to happen in the following years – something that makes a difference for individuals. And then obviously there is the area of treatment trials, trying to bring together difference centres, different expertise worldwide, to perform these very challenging clinical trials to test the efficacy of the medication. We know there has also been a lot of interest in other research areas and if we can raise the funds we would love to put on other webinars in the future. So, if you can make a gift, please use the simple form at the bottom of the page. Let’s go back to our questions. The next question is to Alan from Dan Favotto from Australia and Karim Daya from Canada, and they would like to know, what are the best available treatments currently for progressive MS? well, I make two points to begin with. The first is that we don’t have a specific treatment for progressive MS as Olga has mentioned earlier. But the second is that all forms of MS need a very active management plan. That is the same for relapsing remitting as it is for progressive MS. So health is really important, keeping yourself well is very important. Looking after yourself, a good diet, exercise, also very important. In progressive MS, you get a number of symptoms; difficulty with mobility, with bladder, with tremor, and all of these need to be treated symptomatically, and that’s crucially important. Of course rehabilitation is also key. It brings together all the symptomatic management, but also improves quality of life for people with progressive MS. So having progressive MS isn’t about not having active management. That is absolutely critical. In fact arguably, it is more important to be actively managing your condition when you have progressive MS, than with relapsing remitting MS. Thank you. The next question is to Olga and it’s from Bergthora Bergsdottir from Iceland and Gillian Hirsch from Israel, and their question is: ‘are there new treatments on the horizon for progressive MS?’ Yes, definitely there are new treatments undergoing clinical trials, so they are already being tested in phase II or phase III clinical trials. Others are more experimental, so perhaps further away from clinical trials. These are treatments that are trying to target neuroprotection, so trying to protect the tissue from further damage, and then you must have heard of treatments that are trying to repair what has been damaged. I think these are the two main streams, either protect the central nervous system, the cells from further neurodegeneration or trying to improve the conduction along the nerves, trying to restore some of the function, so repair what has been lost. There are medications, completely new medications being discovered, but also some older medications that are now going to be tested in progressive MS to see whether they can have an effect. So I think as Alan said there is a lot going on, and we expect, we hope, to have something available in the near future. Great! The next question is on stem cells for Alan and it is from Vladislava Vassitskina from Estonia and Christian Oleson from Denmark and Teresa de Marcos from Spain. And they would all like to know: is there hope for stem cells as a treatment for progressive MS? So again, I will begin by saying that stem cells are a topic that has been discussed now over a number of years, and it’s one that there’s always been great hope for, but it’s taking quite a long time to realise that hope. So where are we at the moment? I think we’ve had a number of small studies looking at different forms of stem cells. There are many different kinds, and insofar as those small studies can be evaluated, they do show some encouraging evidence, but none of them are absolutely clear in their outcome. And what we need with stem cells is larger trials, or bringing together the small trials to get a definitive answer. So this perhaps is rather a long winded way of saying that yes there is potential and there is hope. Stem cells suppress inflammation, but they also encourage repair or remyelination. So you’ve got two actions that could be very useful in multiple sclerosis.  So there is hope, it is a difficult area to do definitive studies, but they are ongoing at the moment and they are developing very well. So I think it’s a question of watching this space. But we need proper trials and we need to make sure that if people want to get involved with stem cells they do so through proper trials and not in any other way. The next question is to Olga and it’s from Jeyachitra Alagar from India and Rebecca Anderson from the USA and Judy Slater from the UK. The question is: what is the role of rehabilitation and exercise in managing progressive MS? As Alan mentioned before, rehabilitation is essential in the management of progressive MS and has to focus on the person with progressive MS. So it is not something that can be advised to [EDIT: a wide audience], it has to be for a very specific case. It is important to improve mobility of the person, to improve exercise tolerance, help to maintain cognitive function, help to keep people in employment or help people to come back to employment if they want to. It is important to manage the person with MS in general to improve the quality of life, to reduce impact of symptoms, so we include obviously symptomatic treatments. But exercise – everyone should do it, I know I should, Alan probably and everyone here should do exercise! So I always say this is not something exclusively for progressive MS, it is good to have it as part of a daily routine for everyone, but in particular for people with progressive MS it is essential to keep mobility, to keep a general wellbeing to improve quality of life. Thank you Olga. We have a question now from Drew Heap and Debra Tiegren in the USA, Brian Lee from Australia and also Monica Silva from Canada. And their question to Alan is: ‘is there any research on myelin repair and neuroprotection? What are the advances in that area? Well the straightforward answer to that question is yes. There is a lot of research in myelin repair and in neuroprotection. When you’re dealing with progression, which of course is about loss of axons, loss of tissue, then protecting the brain or repairing the brain are two really critical areas to try and develop. But they are complex and challenging. We talked a bit about stem cells earlier, which of course is one of the approaches to myelin repair and there has been some progress in that area. And Olga mentioned neuroprotection which is not something we want to do just for progressive MS but for a whole range of neurological conditions, there’s also been quite a lot of activity. There is a lot going on here in the UK, some going on in the States and in other countries globally. There are studies now in progress which are looking at a number of drugs which we are using for other conditions but which actually have a neuroprotective component to them, and they are happening now; the MS SMART trial in the UK, SPRINT MS in the States. We are focusing on this area and as I say, it is challenging. But through the Progressive MS Alliance we would be hoping to have far more studies in this area, and in a finite period of time, to have treatments. Great. We have a question now from John Davis sent to us by email, and the question is how do we know if drugs are having an effect on progressive MS, we don’t know how our progression would have progressed without the drug, so how do you measure efficacy? Who’s going to take that? This is a very good question. We always get this question. So how do I know whether a drug is effective for me or not, since I don’t have myself without the medication? But if a medication is licensed and is available for prescription, it’s a medication that has been tested in clinical trials against a placebo, which is a tablet without a chemical effect. So we assume that it is an effective medication. Whether it is helping that specific person then is really down to discussion with the individual whether he or she has noticed any change over time. Has she noticed that the course of the disease? Whether progression has stabilised or maybe has improved with the medication? So it’s really coming from discussion and communication with their own doctor. I will just add to that, that it is very difficult as an individual to know whether a medication is having an effect so that is why clinical trials are so critical. You can’t tell from an individual experience. In clinical trials we’re not just looking at what’s happening to the person with MS, we’re also looking at things like their MRI scans and there we can see the rate of tissue loss and if that is actually being slowed. I think that with a person with MS you can get a sense over a period of time, perhaps 6 or 12 months or even longer, whether that gradual change has now plateaued or maybe even improved. I think it is difficult but not impossible to detect that kind of change. Thank you, we have a question coming in now from Twitter from David Seffer, who asks, “Interferons have completely stopped my relapses. Should I continue to take them when I have evolved progressive MS?” It’s a good question and one which comes up in clinic a lot. We know that the main effect of interferons is to reduce relapses and if it’s working well then you’re not having relapses. There’s a difficult question as to whether you’re no longer having relapses but you think you may be getting very subtly and very gradually worse; and is that progressive MS? And should you stop your medication? And if you do stop your medication are you likely to have attacks? It’s not a very straightforward question. MS Is a very individual condition and I think it’s very important that every patient discusses their condition with their own neurologist to decide what is best for them. Sometimes it can be quite difficult. We sometimes have this tendency to stop taking medication when it’s being effective, so that’s something we should avoid doing. The next question is also coming from Twitter, “Does MS progress faster in men than in women?” That’s a good question. There is some evidence that men with secondary progressive MS progress faster than women with secondary progressive MS. There is also possibly more cognitive impairment than women. In primary progressive MS the difference between the two genders is less clear. I think that in general the differences are more at the individual level than an effect of gender but it is definitely worth discussing. This next question has been asked by many people on email and twitter, asking how they can get on clinical trials? There are a number of different ways. Firstly, they will be attending their own hospital and their own neurologist and I anticipate the MS team there will know about what trials are going on. They can discuss them with the person with MS and discuss what the inclusion criteria are. Of course you can go on the web and you can look at websites. MS International Federation has a very good website. There are also the MS societies and many will flag up the trials that are going on. Some trials have their own websites so you can see what’s happening directly. It can be a little confusing and I think that the first step should always be your local MS team. The next question from Twitter is from David Seffer, “Is there a way to definitely tell when one has passed from relapsing remitting MS to progressive MS?” There is no way to tell you now definitely have progressive MS, it is something which happens more retrospectively. During clinical assessment we tend to discuss how MS is evolving. When a person reports progression of symptoms in the absence of clear episodes of relapses, so there is evidence that neurological evidence is accumulating despite the fact there are no acute episodes, then this may have become progressive MS. But what happens is that after a certain period of time you come back and you say, ‘well this has been now two years or three years that I’ve been progressing without acute relapses’. There is the difficulty that it cannot be [assessed] over one day or one month, it is something which is identified over a longer period of time. It comes out through discussion with your doctor because we do not have a single test which says, ‘you now have progressive MS’. The next email has come in from Loretta, who talks about the similarities between Alzheimer’s and multiple sclerosis. She wonders whether it is worth studying the similarities between the two conditions? This is a very important question because we often look at these conditions in isolation and there is a lot to be learnt by looking across neurological disorders. I think particularly for progressive MS where we know there is tissue damage, tissue loss and neurodegeneration that makes it more similar to certain other conditions like Alzheimer’s or motor neurone disease. It’s looking at the basic mechanisms which underpin or underlie that neurodegeneration that is important. So that is why it is important to look across these different conditions and the literature, because these conditions are very challenging. Nobody understands all aspects of any neurodegenerative condition. If we can get some clues from one which we can then apply to another then that is very useful. So a very good question, particularly for progressive MS. This one has just come in by email and it asks, is the Progressive MS Alliance focusing on the immune and autoimmune factors? The Alliance is focusing on all mechanisms that could result in progression so the immune system plays a big part. Both parts of the immune system. The innate immune system is perhaps less studied so is becoming more of a focus for research. The immune system is being studied and particularly the relationship of the immune system to demyelination and neurodegeneration and how all of these things link up. If you impact on one what effect will that have on the others? So those relationships are key and the immune system is absolutely central to that. A very good question. Another question has come in via email, from Anne. She would like to know more about nutritional approaches and any particular diets and if there is any benefit on progressive MS? We do not have any evidence that a specific diet helps to slow down or stop progression in progressive MS. I get this question all the time in clinic, ‘should I go on this diet or that diet…’. My personal advice is that people are free to try whatever diet they like as long as people don’t expect to see huge improvements from that specific diet. I know that online you can see reports from people who have shown incredible improvements from diets. I think that some of the diets are also quite challenging. If it is a very strict diet it’s difficult to follow; it is also sometimes quite difficult for the whole family because you have four or five different meals with different preparation, then it becomes an obsession, then you feel guilty when you don’t follow the diet. So in general it’s a bit like exercise, everyone should follow a healthy lifestyle doing exercise and eating a healthy diet. But we cannot recommend any specific diet because we do not have the evidence to do so. We have a question from Kholoud in Saudi Arabia, asking if there is a role for Alemtuzumab in treating progressive MS? The main evidence at the moment is that Alemtuzumab has a very strong effect on relapses and often results in no attacks. Patients often find that they are improving both in terms of not having attacks but in terms of their mobility so they see changes. A specific effect on progressive MS has not been demonstrated and that’s much more difficult. Whether or not – and this is another quite challenging question – whether or not suppressing relapses and inflammation in the earlier part of MS has an impact on the progression that might follow is a very difficult question which has not yet been answered. The relationship, if you like, between that early inflammatory phase and the progressive phase. When we look at scans of people with MS and we look right from the beginning, what we see is that although they have a lot of lesions on their scans when they have relapses they also have a gradual loss of tissue right from the very beginning of their MS. So there is a very subtle neurodegenerative part right from the beginning. It may well be that that continues and may not necessarily be affected by suppressing the inflammation. It’s difficult to say and again it’s back to this relationship between inflammation and neurodegeneration. Does one cause the other, or is one a reaction to the other? That is still a very fundamental question which we are yet to get a very clear answer on. There’s another question actually, related to that, coming from twitter and this is about brain atrophy and it’s about MS and the relationship with brain atrophy in the longer term and they’ve also asked if you can explain brain atrophy for a lay audience. Ok so it’s a good question. Brain atrophy you can see over time as reduced volume of the brain. So everyone, over time, develops some volume loss everyone sitting here, we’re all losing some neurons. But it has been recognised that the people with MS have a faster loss of brain volume over time. But as you know as part of aging there is also some development of brain atrophy. The surviving tissue adapts to the loss of volume and it creates connections to continue functioning in a sufficiently acceptable way. So although there is brain atrophy there is also some plasticity of the brain for which  neurological  functions are maintained, cognitive functions are maintained. What happens in progressive MS is that the development of brain atrophy becomes more significant. This is why it is used as an outcome measure in clinical trials. What we want to see is a treatment that slows down or has an effect on reducing the development of volume loss. So it’s actual loss of tissue over time and it’s more loss of tissue than you would see with normal aging which is what we’re all doing! We’ve got another question coming from twitter from Nick who wants to know: How critical is basic physiological research to finding a cure and how does this translate to the  clinic? I think that basic physiological research is really important because we do know that in MS normal physiological processes are affected. There is involvement of what we call the autonomic nervous system which has an effect on these physiological mechanisms. We also know – and this is back to the exercise literature – that over time people tend to do less and as a result they do even less so you become deconditioned. So actually physiological wellbeing, particularly around cardiovascular respiratory, is really important. Whether that tells us more about the underlying mechanisms about MS I’m not so sure. I think it’s very important for the person with MS and very important to manage and understand but perhaps not fundamental to the actual finding of a treatment for progressive MS. We’ve got another question from Sally Beck via twitter. There’s sort of two questions but she’s linked them. What are your thoughts on CCSVI and any recent trials using statins? They both increase the blood flow. I think it’s fair to say that we have no evidence of any effect by CCSVI on the brain or on progression in MS. I’m aware of people who have had CCSVI either as part of clinical trials – especially in the States – or as private treatment and I come from a country where CCSVI has been used a lot and still currently used but it is not something we can recommend because there is no evidence that it is effective. Well I think in relation to CCSVI I think that when the initial positive reports came out in the literature there was a lot of excitement about it. There was a huge response from people with MS to look at this exciting area and as a result the MS societies funded a lot of research to look at the underlying mechanism of CCSVI, which is really about dilating veins. [There were] also much more detailed studies of the effect on people with MS and that was a useful exercise because we now have  a very large database. [This] research base really shows  little or no effect on underlying mechanisms  and little or no treatment effect but it is based on really sound evidence. That’s all we have to approach any of these potential new treatments because you can never be sure until you have done that really hard research approach. I wanted to add that I know people who had CCSVI treatment and they felt better and I always get this question in clinic. ‘Well you say the clinical trials show no evidence of this treatment but in fact I had it and I feel better and I had it and I feel the same or I had it and I feel worse.’ You come back to the question we had earlier on, how do I know that the treatment is effective for myself?  We are talking about treatments being tested in large clinical trials. Very sound research but then obviously an individual person may feel that it has an effect but on a chemical level and on a clinical trials level that effect hasn’t been observed. If that makes clear? So can I now go on and talk about the statins? I think statins are really very interesting. I mean they are obviously an incredibly useful group of drugs which help many people with a whole range of different conditions. They have been looked at in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis and there have been several trials and they’ve been mainly negative but there has been recently a trial in progressive MS which was published in The Lancet which demonstrated an effect both on the measure of brain atrophy but also on the patient’s own level of mobility or disability. That’s the statin trial which looked at 80 milligrams of simvastatin, [which] has been positive. It was a relatively small phase  2 trial so we now really need to go on to do a major phase 3 trial. So that’s an ideal study to be done internationally involving many of the MS societies and also perhaps the Progressive MS Alliance. I think statins are very interesting and it’s interesting that they seem to work in progressive MS but not in relapsing remitting MS which gives you some indication of what the mechanism might be. There’s a question from Dorothy in California. In order to cure MS do you have to destroy and rebuild the immune system? Quite challenging. I don’t think so. I don’t think you have to destroy and rebuild the immune system, no. The approach so far has been to try to modulate it. Try to improve the response in a way that is the correct immune response but destroying and rebuilding may be a bit extreme. I don’t think that’s the approach we are doing so far, no. We can remember that in MS we have an altered immune system, most of it functions very well, in fact some of it might over function, so actually it’s much more as Olga said, we use the word ‘modulate’ to try and influence the immune system so that it functions more normally. That’s not about rebuilding. Thank you.  Alessandro in Italy wants to know more about any functional MRI studies in relation to progressive MS and also in particular in relation to spinal cord studies. Alessandro, it’s a very good question. As you know, scanning the spinal cord with MRI is very challenging, for several reasons. It’s a very small structure so it’s very difficult to image. But definitely there’s been study with functional MRI and there will be more studies in the future. The question is to try to overcome the challenges and design a study which can give some important understanding of the mechanism of the disease. But definitely there are functional MRI studies of the spinal cord in MS and more I think are due to come. I think it’s  probably also important to make the  point that when we say ‘functional MRI’ what we’re talking  about is using imaging to actually,  as it says, see how the brain functions when it is doing tasks so you have an idea of the working brain. It’s not just taking static pictures of the brain.  You’re looking at what the brain is actually doing as we are doing things or thinking or acting so it gives you a real insight into how the brain is changing over time and therefore how the effect multiple sclerosis can have on the brain itself. It’s also very useful in looking at things like rehabilitation to see how you might be able to address some of the problems with brain function and improve it so it’s a very powerful tool. It’s quite a complex tool but one with lots of potential for the future. Thank you. We’ve just received a question form Paul via twitter.  He says ‘After sexual intercourse I find my symptoms clear for a short while, is there a medical reason why?’ I can’t think of any medical reason why this is happening and no, I don’t think we have an answer for this. OK. Rachel, via email, just wants to know a little more about the clinical trials process. For example what does phase 1, phase 2, phase 3 mean? So that’s a really very good question and I think it prompts us to just to talk a little bit about how you get from identifying a potential treatment to  licensing a drug and this is a long journey if it’s a new drug which can take anything up to ten or twelve years. If you think that you’ve found something in the laboratory which might actually have an effect in the central nervous system, which will in turn have a useful effect in MS, the first thing you have to do is to do some further studies involving animals to actually see if there is any danger to this agent. The next is then doing small safety study in small groups of people that don’t have any condition, that don’t have MS and then you move on to studies that will involve people with MS. Again small studies which will be looking at side effects and at safety. And that would be first-in-man trials or phase 1 studies. You then go on to do phase 2 study which is larger and is actually looking at efficacy. Is this drug useful? But it may not be looking at a clinical measure, it may be using imaging or some protein in the blood or in the spinal  fluid to see if there’s a really clear beneficial effect from this agent. If that’s true you’ll then move on to what we call a phase 3  trial which is the large, definitive, clinical study which will be the kind of study to move on to the drug being licenced and used as a treatment in the population. Quite a lengthy process. Now, if you have drugs ‘off the shelf’ that are already being used for another conditions, and this has certainly been the case for some of the drugs we have been looking at in progressive MS, then of course you can move quite quickly to a phase 2 or phase 3 trial without any of the earlier work and that’s why repurposing of these agents is a very, a short cut to potential and new treatments for multiple sclerosis. Are there any promising agents around that have been looked at in repurposing trials. Well there are. The statins which we talked about earlier are a really good example of a repurposing agent. So we know they lower cholesterol, we know they reduce risk factors and now we have a sense, an indication that they may be useful in progressive MS but now we need a phase three trial. I think when we go back to neuroprotection a number of the drugs which we know to be neuroprotective are drugs which are used in epilepsy. There are many I could mention and these are the drugs we are now looking at in MS. Phenytoin is an agent which has been around for many years in epilepsy. We are looking at this in optic neuritis to get a sense of whether or not it could have a neuroprotective effect. Lamotrigine is another and there’s a whole range of existing agents so repurposing is very important. Thank you, we have a question from Cindy in London by email and she wants to know if there is any effectiveness of oxygen treatments in progressive MS? Yes, oxygen therapy has been studied and some people are using it. Some people report improvements in their energy level. I don’t think that the evidence of the effect in the mechanisms of progression is there already so this is not something that is recommended as a first line treatment for MS. I think I probably emphasise the fact that there is not a sound evidence base to support what we call hyperbaric treatment in MS. It came about as a treatment when I was starting in MS nearly 30 years ago and there is not a sound evidence base so I would not be enthusiastic about exploring it. We have a question from Martin via Twitter. He asks “Is Fingolimod as dangerous as the sources I have read on the internet claim?” Fingolimod, as with any other treatment we use – not just in neurology, in any medical speciality – has a list of side effects. So this is why every time it is prescribed for a person with MS we have to balance the benefits with the side effects. The person has to be informed about the possible risks but also see what it is useful to try this medication to improve for example the relapse rate. It is true it is associated with side effects but I think that any medication has side effects. Even aspirin! I always say to my patients, if you ever read the list of aspirin you wouldn’t take that. Everything comes with benefits and side effects. And I think that is an important point. All the time you are looking at the benefit and the risk. There is a risk benefit analysis. It tends to be the case that as the treatments become more effective they are stronger and they often have stronger side effects. Of course that is why we wouldn’t use very strong drugs with very strong side effects in somebody with very mild MS. You would certainly think about using it with someone who has very active MS, and this is the balance of the discussion you would have with someone all the time with the person with MS and make a decision with them. And in case of aggressive treatment or treatment with the worst safety profile then you keep engaged with the medical team, the MS specialist and come back for regular follow up and blood test. There is follow up, you don’t only give them medication and then not see the person anymore. You continue to monitor the effect and possible side effects of the drug. We’ve got through a lot of questions and thank you for answering so many of them. But unfortunately we’re running out of time so I’m just going to ask one final question to Alan: If I was recently told I had progressive MS, what would the future look like for me? I think if you were told you had progressive MS the first point is that you would look after yourself well. It doesn’t change anything. You look after yourself, you have to actively manage your condition as you would any other form of MS. I think you would keep really abreast of research activity as that whole area has exploded and it’s incredibly exciting. I think particularly to link in with the activities of the Progressive MS Alliance. You may even consider becoming involved in a clinical trial, which would be an excellent thing to do. And you would anticipate a treatment for progressive MS in a finite period of time. I think it is positive, very positive. And much more positive now than even five years ago. Now I’d like to pass over to Olga who will talk about how MS International Federation has supported her in her career. Yes so I’m very grateful to the MSIF because when I finished my training in neurology I was awarded a Du Pre grant from the MSIF, this was in 2000, not sure I had to disclose the year! So this allowed me to come to the UK to work with Alan and Professor Miller and learn more about MS. At that time we did not have [many] treatments available for MS so a lot has changed really in 14 years. This is an excellent organisation that has provided funding for young researchers to move abroad and have experience of how things work in other countries, in this case UK. To develop a passion for MS, improve their research skills and clinical skills. So yes, a big thank you to the MSIF. I think if you enjoy this webinar what we want to ask you is to make a donation to the MSIF, in order for this kind of activity to be repeated in the future. Also send your feedback if you want to make changes for the future, this has to be interactive process. But we also need donation to give grants that allow young researchers to come to UK [and] but also other locations to improve understanding and discovering treatments for MS. So I got the figure of about $40,000 dollars, that’s about €50,000 to support five young researchers to get out of their own countries, come to the UK [and other countries], learn more about MS, learn about symptomatic treatment, learn more about the challenging medications. Then go back to their own countries to share this knowledge with their teams. So this is why we need your help. , whatever you like. Even $1 or €1 will be helpful to help the MSIF to help them fund more research into MS and with the purpose of today, into progressive MS. Thank you. It just remains for me to thank our wonderful world renowned experts, Professor Thompson and Professor Ciccarelli and our wonderful host Dhia for answering so many of your questions. Thank you for spending some time with us and sending in your questions. Good bye and see you next time.

d10474f9-13fc-4d4f-b920-ec78e0c6721e,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice There are four main types of MS: clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing MS, secondary progressive MS and primary progressive MS. The course of MS is unpredictable. Some people may feel and seem healthy for many years following diagnosis, while others may be severely debilitated very quickly. Most people fit somewhere between these two extremes. Although every individual will experience a different combination of MS , and it is hard to predict how MS will affect a person over their lifetime, there have been four basic types of MS identified relating to the course of the disease. Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) is the first episode of neurological symptoms experienced by a person, lasting at least 24 hours. The person may experience a single sign or symptom, or more than one at the same time. As with MS, it is caused by inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system. Not everyone who experiences CIS goes on to develop MS, but CIS can be an indicator for it. Researchers don’t yet know why CIS turns into MS for some people but not others. If someone with CIS also has lesions (as seen on a brain MRI) that are similar to those seen in MS, then they are at higher risk. Research suggests that early of CIS can delay conversion to MS for people at high risk. In relapsing MS (sometimes called relapsing-remitting MS), people experience attacks or exacerbations of symptoms (‘relapses’), which then fade or disappear (‘remission’). The symptoms may be new, or existing symptoms may become more severe. Relapses can last for varying periods – from a few days up to months – and then the disease may then be inactive for months or years. About 85 per cent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with relapsing MS. Relapsing MS can also be categorised by whether it is or (someone who has arelapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). It can also be classified as (a confirmed increase in disability over a specified period of time following a relapse) or Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) is a secondary phase of relapsing MS that may develop years or even decades following diagnosis with relapsing MS. Most people who have relapsing MS will transition to SPMS. In SPMS there is progressive worsening of symptoms over time with no definite periods of remission. SPMS can also be categorised by whether it is or (someone who has arelapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). It can also be classified as (evidence of disease worsening over time, with or without relapses) or About 10 to 15 per cent of people with MS are diagnosed with primary progressive MS (PPMS). People with PPMS have steadily worsening symptoms and disability from the start, rather than sudden attacks or relapses followed by recovery. PPMS can also be categorised by whether it is or (someone who has arelapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). It can also be classified as (evidence of disease worsening over time, with or without relapses) or For useful descriptions of what looks like in relapsing MS, primary and secondary progressive MS, see the graphs on the National MS Society’s web page here. These characterisations are important as they can affect whether a certain type of will be effective or not. Thessaloniki, Greece, 10/2011.

8325bd52-28d3-4acb-856d-3c338f2db1a4,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice There are four main types of MS: clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing MS, secondary progressive MS and primary progressive MS. The course of MS is unpredictable. Some people may feel and seem healthy for many years following diagnosis, while others may be severely debilitated very quickly. Most people fit somewhere between these two extremes. Although every individual will experience a different combination of MS , and it is hard to predict how MS will affect a person over their lifetime, there have been four basic types of MS identified relating to the course of the disease. Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) is the first episode of neurological symptoms experienced by a person, lasting at least 24 hours. The person may experience a single sign or symptom, or more than one at the same time. As with MS, it is caused by inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system. Not everyone who experiences CIS goes on to develop MS, but CIS can be an indicator for it. Researchers don’t yet know why CIS turns into MS for some people but not others. If someone with CIS also has lesions (as seen on a brain MRI) that are similar to those seen in MS, then they are at higher risk. Research suggests that early of CIS can delay conversion to MS for people at high risk. In relapsing MS (sometimes called relapsing-remitting MS), people experience attacks or exacerbations of symptoms (‘relapses’), which then fade or disappear (‘remission’). The symptoms may be new, or existing symptoms may become more severe. Relapses can last for varying periods – from a few days up to months – and then the disease may then be inactive for months or years. About 85 per cent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with relapsing MS. Relapsing MS can also be categorised by whether it is or (someone who has arelapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). It can also be classified as (a confirmed increase in disability over a specified period of time following a relapse) or Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) is a secondary phase of relapsing MS that may develop years or even decades following diagnosis with relapsing MS. Most people who have relapsing MS will transition to SPMS. In SPMS there is progressive worsening of symptoms over time with no definite periods of remission. SPMS can also be categorised by whether it is or (someone who has arelapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). It can also be classified as (evidence of disease worsening over time, with or without relapses) or About 10 to 15 per cent of people with MS are diagnosed with primary progressive MS (PPMS). People with PPMS have steadily worsening symptoms and disability from the start, rather than sudden attacks or relapses followed by recovery. PPMS can also be categorised by whether it is or (someone who has arelapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). It can also be classified as (evidence of disease worsening over time, with or without relapses) or For useful descriptions of what looks like in relapsing MS, primary and secondary progressive MS, see the graphs on the National MS Society’s web page here. These characterisations are important as they can affect whether a certain type of will be effective or not. Thessaloniki, Greece, 10/2011.

89637d9b-1f8d-4a14-84d3-c0afe3ff0716,"Study Reassures on MS Patients' Breast, Colorectal Cancer Risk — But higher incidence of other cancers in Canadian data by , Senior Staff Writer, MedPage Today Incidence of breast and colorectal cancers was similar between people with and without multiple sclerosis (MS), but MS patients had a higher incidence of other cancers, including bladder cancer, according to a population-based study. Among 54,000 persons with MS and 267,000 people without the disease, risk of breast cancer (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.78-1.09) or colorectal cancer (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.64-1.07) did not differ, reported Ruth Ann Marrie, MD, PhD, of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, and colleagues in . ""This is good news for people with MS, because earlier studies have shown a link between MS and breast and colorectal cancers,"" Marrie said in a statement. ""While we did not find that link, our study did show that people with MS had a 72% greater risk of developing bladder cancer."" ""The increased risk of bladder cancer in people with MS may have to do with the fact that people with the disease are more likely to have urinary tract infections and use catheters,"" she added. ""However, more research is needed to confirm our findings."" In 2015, a found that cervical, breast, and digestive system cancers had the highest incidence in MS, but findings about relative risks of cancer among MS patients were inconsistent. ""Studies published since 2014 continue to report disparate findings regarding cancer risk in MS,"" Marrie and colleagues wrote. Incidence rates are needed to support pharmacovigilance in clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), they added: at times, the only way to determine whether a number of cancer cases is excessive is by comparing it to MS-specific incidence rates. Breast cancer incidence is of particular interest since several in ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) phase III clinical trials. The drug, which was in 2017 in the U.S., carries a . In their analysis, the researchers identified MS cases in Manitoba and Ontario and matched each case to five controls without MS on birth year, sex, and region, linking the cohorts to cancer registries. Records in Manitoba were from 1984-85 to 2017-18; in Ontario, they were from 1994-95 to 2017-18. In total, the researchers evaluated 53,984 MS cases and 266,920 controls; 70% of both groups were female. Neither cancer incidence nor mortality differed between MS patients and controls for breast and colorectal cancer. This was consistent across two time periods, from 1998 to 2007 when DMTs including interferon-beta and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) were first introduced for MS, and 2008-2017 when second-generation DMTs including natalizumab (Tysabri), dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), fingolimod (Gilenya), teriflunomide (Aubagio), and alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) were used. From 2008-2017, the incidence of bladder cancer was 25.7 cases per 100,000 person-years among MS patients and 14.60 cases among controls (IRR 1.72, 95% CI 1.28-2.30). Ovarian cancer incidence was elevated in the MS cohort from 2008-2017 (IRR 1.50, 95% 1.01-2.24). Cervical and uterine cancer incidences were lower among MS cases than controls. Central nervous system cancer incidence consistently was elevated in MS patients during 1998-2007 and 2008-2017, even after excluding meningiomas from the analysis (2008-2017 IRR 2.14, 95% CI 1.49-3.07). The findings ""add to our knowledge, helping to provide background rates that can inform how we monitor patients and choose treatments,"" said Robert Bermel, MD, of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, who was not part of the study. ""The data on bladder and ovarian cancers underscore the importance of monitoring patients with MS for symptoms suggestive of these diseases,"" he told ""When questions arise about whether specific MS treatments may increase the risk of a certain type of cancer, we rely on studies such as this for establishment of the disease-specific risk from which to plan additional studies and for guidance to patients."" Though Marrie and colleagues adjusted data for comorbidities, they couldn't incorporate health behaviors like smoking, diet, and physical activity into their analyses. They also couldn't determine how clinical MS characteristics -- a relapsing onset versus a primary progression course, for example -- were linked with cancer incidence. Prescription data were not available in Ontario and the researchers were unable to assess how DMT use may be related to cancer. covers neurology and neuroscience news for MedPage Today, writing about brain aging, Alzheimer’s, dementia, MS, rare diseases, epilepsy, autism, headache, stroke, Parkinson’s, ALS, concussion, CTE, sleep, pain, and more.

b34e40eb-1f10-4271-a2f4-ff9c17ec8e44,"— WASHINGTON -- The FDA has approved teriflunomide (Aubagio) for treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. by WASHINGTON -- The FDA has approved the oral drug teriflunomide (Aubagio) for treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. In the primary phase III trial submitted to the FDA, , the drug reduced annualized relapse rates by 31% relative to placebo. A similar placebo-controlled phase III study found a 36% reduction in relapse rate. Teriflunomide, made by Genzyme/Sanofi, is the active metabolite of the rheumatoid arthritis drug leflunomide (Arava). Its specific mechanism of action is to inhibit pyrimidine synthesis, which in turn reduces proliferation of certain immune cells. In clinical trials, side effects reported by patients included diarrhea, nausea, and reversible hair thinning. Abnormal liver function tests were also seen in the trials, prompting the FDA to order a boxed warning. It will ""alert prescribers and patients to the risk of liver problems, including death, and a risk of birth defects. Physicians should do blood tests to check liver function before a patient starts taking Aubagio and periodically during treatment,"" the FDA said. Since animal studies suggest that the drug may cause fetal harm, women of childbearing age will be required to have a negative pregnancy test before starting the drug. However, clinicians familiar with the clinical trial results consider teriflunomide to be relatively safe compared with other drugs used to treat MS, with relatively modest efficacy as the tradeoff. That was the chief finding from a third , reported at a meeting earlier this year. It tested teriflunomide head-to-head against the injectable agent interferon-beta-1a (Rebif), a traditional mainstay of MS therapy. The trial was designed to show that the oral drug was superior to interferon in a composite measure of efficacy and safety. Teriflunomide missed that endpoint, with a subanalysis showing that while discontinuations due to adverse effects were less frequent with teriflunomide, relapses were more common. ""I think most people's impression of teriflunomide is that its potency is moderate, but it's well tolerated and it will be a useful addition,"" Jeffrey Cohen, MD, of the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, told after seeing the TENERE data. Russell Katz, M.D., director of the Division of Neurology Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation, said in a statement announcing teriflunomide's approval that it was important to ""have a variety of treatment options available to patients."" Results of two other phase III trials of teriflunomide have yet to be publicly reported. These include TOPIC, evaluating teriflunomide as monotherapy in early MS or clinically isolated syndrome, and TERACLES, testing the drug as an add-on to interferon beta. Approval of another anticipated new drug for MS, also made by Genzyme/Sanofi, has been delayed, the company said late last month. The FDA told the company to rewrite its marketing submission for alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) to allow agency staff to ""better navigate the application."" The drug, a monoclonal antibody against the CD52 immune cell marker, is currently approved under the name Campath for treating leukemia. For MS, it would be administered by infusion just once a year. It has reduced annualized relapse rates , but with side effects including autoimmune thyroid disease. Because the drug depletes both B- and T-cells, infection rates are increased as well. Some researchers have also expressed concern about the resulting alterations in immune regulation, which appear to be irreversible. Also in the late-stage MS pipeline is another oral drug, . Its manufacturer, Biogen Idec, filed for U.S. marketing approval in February 2012.

2ff79889-eab0-4b19-97b8-7216d3066379,"— Three new drug approvals, vaccination guidelines, and more by Multiple sclerosis (MS) news in 2019 focused largely on drugs -- new drugs, old drugs, drug costs, and treatment strategies -- but new vaccination guidelines and biomarker research also earned headlines. The FDA approved three new MS drugs in 2019, most recently (Vumerity), a new oral fumarate drug to treat relapsing forms of MS. Like dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), which was approved in 2013 for relapsing MS, diroximel fumarate is designed to convert to monomethyl fumarate in the body, but appears to produce fewer gastrointestinal side effects than the older drug. Diroximel fumarate relied in part on dimethyl fumarate's safety and efficacy data and findings from the ongoing, open-label phase III study to win FDA approval. Two other MS drugs earned OKs this year, the first being (Mayzent) for adult patients with relapsing forms of MS, including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease. The drug was the first oral agent for secondary progressive MS (SPMS) with active disease and the first treatment specifically approved for patients with active SPMS in over 15 years. The FDA based its decision on the phase III trial results, which demonstrated that patients with SPMS had 21% lower risk in time to 3-month confirmed disability progression with siponimod than with placebo. The other FDA nod went to (Mavenclad), also for active secondary progressive disease and relapsing MS, based on results of the phase III clinical trial. In that study, cladribine (also a chemotherapy drug) significantly decreased the number of MS relapses and reduced the progression of disability versus placebo. The drug had a to its ultimate approval. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (Arzerra) -- approved for chronic lymphocytic leukemia but investigational for MS -- outperformed teriflunomide (Aubagio) in reducing annualized relapse rate (ARR), according to two phase III studies presented at the 2019 European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) congress in September. In the ASCLEPIOS I trial, monthly injections of ofatumumab led to a 50.5% relative reduction in ARR compared with oral teriflunomide; in ASCLEPIOS II, the ARR with ofatumumab bested that of teriflunomide by 58.5%. Like ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), which was approved in 2017 for relapsing and primary progressive MS, and rituximab (Rituxan), which is used off-label in MS, ofatumumab depletes B cells; but unlike those drugs, ofatumumab can be self-injected. Also reported at ECTRIMS were new findings about , an investigational selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) modulator, which outperformed teriflunomide in a head-to-head trial of adult relapsing MS patients. In the OPTIMUM phase III trial, oral ponesimod reduced ARR by 30.5% versus teriflunomide over about two years. The trial aimed to place ponesimod within the spectrum of the oral MS drugs, ""which are getting to be, more and more, the standard treatment,"" OPTIMUM researcher Ludwig Kappos, MD, of University Hospital of Basel in Switzerland, told Ocrelizumab showed real-world safety and effectiveness in data presented at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) forum in March. In a prospective study of patients who started treatment in 2017, ocrelizumab showed fewer adverse events than expected in six months of clinical practice. Also at ACTRIMS, an extension study of patients from the CARE-MS II trial showed that over eight years, alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) continued to show benefits in clinical outcomes, lesion load, and brain volume loss in relapsing-remitting MS. Interim data from the real-world ESTEEM study presented at the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC) annual meeting in June showed that dimethyl fumarate was effective and safe for black patients with relapsing-remitting MS. And in the phase IIIb ASSESS trial, also presented at CMSC, fingolimod (Gilenya) bested glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) at lowering relapses and disease activity in relapsing-remitting MS patients. A trial published in January showed that, in patients with highly active relapsing-remitting MS, than disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), though ocrelizumab and alemtuzumab were not included in the study. Also in January were the results of a three-cohort study that showed that patients treated initially with fingolimod, natalizumab (Tysabri), or alemtuzumab had a lower risk of converting to secondary progressive MS than patients who started with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta (Rebif). ""The ditherers must take note,"" wrote editorialist Ari Green, MD, of the University of California San Francisco: ""The signs are strongly pointing to the to forestall damage. Waiting on the sidelines does not appear justified."" In real-life settings, an observational study in Wales found that starting produced better long-term outcomes. And higher-efficacy infusible therapies had a disproportionately larger effect in patients, a chart review of 1,000 patients at University of Colorado in Aurora presented at ECTRIMS suggested. At ACTRIMS, a small study looked at patients with and found they had similar times to relapses, inflammatory events, and disability progression as stable patients who remained on treatment. ""This data suggest that younger age goes along with more inflammatory disease activity and that is the critical group that needs to be treated with DMTs,"" said author Tanuja Chitnis, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, in an interview with ""And potentially after the age of 45 or 50, in stable patients, there may be opportunities to stop or step down DMTs."" Biomarkers that predicted long-term MS outcomes also racked up headlines. At ECTRIMS, researchers showed that levels of serum neurofilament light (NfL) increased six years before the clinical onset of MS. Research presented at ACTRIMS indicated that early levels of serum NfL may pinpoint which MS patients are at . And in a longitudinal study published this year, 15 years after a clinically isolated syndrome event, showing that spinal cord and gadolinium-enhancing lesions had consistent links with secondary progression development and physical disability. Two studies published this year assessed rising MS drug costs. One found that MS patients with private insurance paid 20 times more in 2016 compared with 2004; the other showed that prices of self-administered MS drugs more than quadrupled in 11 years and Medicare spending for Medicare Part D beneficiaries soared more than 10-fold during the same period. The American Academy of Neurology issued new indicating that most MS patients should receive recommended vaccinations, including yearly flu shots. A case-control study presented at ECTRIMS demonstrated that . ""In the general population, vaccinations are seen as a problem; there are lobbies in many countries against vaccinations,"" Mar Tintore, MD, PhD, of University Hospital Vall d'Hebron in Barcelona, Spain, told ""In MS patients, vaccinations are especially important. Now that we are using immunosuppressive drugs, we need to vaccinate our patients.""

bea70da6-b98c-44df-ab98-418f21c7779f,"— Most patients' responses lasted through 5-year follow-up by BARCELONA -- Disability progression, brain atrophy, and relapses all remained significantly reduced in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis for 3 years after completing two courses of alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) therapy, researchers said here. Most patients in the drug's pivotal trials who remained in an extension study did not require repeat treatments since the initial two courses given during the first year, there has been no increase in the annualized relapse rate among those remaining in the CARE-MS I extension study, said , of Charles University in Prague. She also noted that patients with strong initial responses to the treatment maintained those responses through the follow-up period, which now extends to 5 years from patients' initial enrollment. Extension data from CARE-MS I, assessing efficacy and safety of alemtuzumab as compared with high dose interferon in treatment naive RRMS patients, found that efficacy was maintained over 5 years with a 55% decrease in relapse rates. The majority of patients did not require retreatment beyond the initial two doses of drug. Five-year data did not reveal any new safety concerns. Note that this study was published as an abstract and presented at a conference. These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Other extension-phase analyses reported here at the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis annual meeting showed that the drug's benefits persisted in a wide range of efficacy measures, including effects on brain atrophy and MRI lesion burden. For example, , of VU University Medical Centre in Amsterdam, and colleagues reported that rates of brain volume loss remained low throughout the 5-year period -- with an almost negligible 0.07% rate of loss in the final year of follow-up. Another analysis led by , of the University of British Columbia, found that, among patients not receiving booster doses of alemtuzumab, about two-thirds showed no evidence of MRI lesion activity in year five, and 65% had no evidence of any kind of disease activity -- clinical or MRI-detected -- during the last follow-up year. , of OhioHealth Physician Group in Columbus, Ohio -- a site investigator in the CARE-MS program, but not an author of any of the current reports -- told that the follow-up data ""looks the same or better in many cases"" than what was reported from the main trials. He noted that among all patients in the extensions, 40% were still showing no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). ""We've never seen this before,"" Boster said. Alemtuzumab differs from other MS therapies in several ways. An anti-CD52 antibody, it initiates a profound and, in many individuals, an apparently permanent shift in immune responsiveness in a way that limits development of MS relapses. It is delivered in two infusion courses given a year apart, and unless patients show a resumption of significant disease activity, no further dosing is given. It was approved in late 2014 on the basis of two pivotal trials, , the first of which tested the drug as first-line therapy for relapsing-remitting MS while the second recruited patients who had used other disease-modifying drugs. Both trials used interferon-beta as the control, and were unblinded because the sponsor, Genzyme-Sanofi, believed a double-blind design was impractical given alemtuzumab's unusual dosing schedule. The drug performed very well, with annualized relapse rates of 0.18 and 0.26 in CARE-MS I and II, respectively, both of which were about half the rates seen with interferon, and with similarly impressive effects on MRI measures. But the unanswered question was how long the effects would last. The data reported here appear to supply that answer: at least 5 years. Patients completing the randomized phase were invited to participate in the extensions, and nearly all did so. The current reports focused on those who were assigned to alemtuzumab in the randomized phase: the extensions enrolled 349 from CARE-MS I (95% of those eligible) and 393 from CARE-MS II (93% of those eligible). Retention through the subsequent 3 years of follow-up was also high, with about 10% lost to follow-up by year five. Havrdova, in her platform presentation, reported that 32% of patients in the CARE-MS I extension received one or more additional courses of alemtuzumab, and another 2% received another disease-modifying therapy. About half of these retreatments were because patients showed relapses, and 26% were because MRI scans revealed new lesion activity; 23% involved both. Annualized relapse rates remained very close to the 0.18 seen in the randomized phase, ranging from 0.14 to 0.19 during the 3 years of the extension. And rates of NEDA did as well: ranging from 60% to 62% during the extension, compared with 68% during the second year of the randomized phase. When Havrdova and colleagues restricted their analysis to participants with NEDA during year two of the randomized phase, more than 90% of them remained free of clinical disease activity and about 80% showed no resumption in MRI lesion activity. NEDA was maintained in a total of 77% of those who had NEDA during the randomized phase. A separate analysis of the CARE-MS II extension, reported by , of Central Texas Neurology Consultants in Round Rock, Texas, as a poster, yielded generally similar results. But adverse events remain a concern with alemtuzumab. The clinical trials showed that infections and new autoimmune diseases -- especially involving the thyroid -- were increased with the drug. Havrdova reported that all autoimmune events occurred within 2 years of the last dose among the 349 CARE-MS I extension participants, meaning that the risk continued in patients who took retreatments. The incidence of thyroid autoimmune events peaked at 20% in the first year of the extension (treatment year three) and declined thereafter. Immune thrombocytopenia, another worrisome side effect, was relatively rare at 1.1% during the entire 5-year study. Autoimmune nephropathy was also rare with just a single event occurring in year 3. Infections, however, were common and remained so during the extension. Some 56% of alemtuzumab-treated patients developed infections during the main study's first year; in year five, 40% developed infections. Fox told that the infection risk was not particularly worrisome and that the new data, overall, just confirmed what was already known about alemtuzumab's safety profile. He also pointed out the drug came with a risk evaluation and management strategy that includes regular monitoring for autoimmune effects, and that these -- especially those affecting the thyroid -- don't pose particularly difficult management issues. Both analyses were funded by Genzyme/Sanofi, manufacturer of alemtuzumab. Study authors reported consulting and other financial relationships with the firm and with many others with interests in multiple sclerosis.

Introduction Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune connective tissue disease characterized by multisystem involvement with inflammation, vasculopathy, fibrosis of the skin, and internal organs. Vascular injury is an early event in SSc pathogenesis and may be evident before the onset of fibrosis. It plays a central role in promoting Raynaud's phenomenon, digital ulcers, renal damage, and pulmonary arterial hypertension [1-6]. The interaction between autoimmunity, vascular injury, and fibrosis promotes the progressive tissue damage. Among these factors, autoimmunity and vascular injury characterize the earliest phases of the disease and contribute to the progression of fibrosis [7-9]. Angiogenesis, the formation of newly formed capillaries from preexisting vessels via a well-programmed cascade of events, is dysregulated in SSc and cannot ensure an efficient vascular recovery. Vascular injury induces hypoxia and tissual ischemia which are the primary triggers for angiogenesis, but are not able to induce a compensatory angiogenesis. 2. Vascular Involvement in SSc In early stages of SSc endothelial cell injury is followed by vascular remodeling, which is characterized by capillary enlargement, intimal proliferation, telangiectasia, and accumulation of proteoglycans in the arterioles. Later, during the course of the disease, loss of capillaries and small arterioles induces the formation of avascular areas [10, 11]. In larger size vessels, there is vascular occlusion and thrombosis due to endothelial proliferation, fibrotic intimal proliferation, fibrin deposition, and smooth muscle cell hypertrophy [10-12]. A typical clinical feature of SSc is the Raynaud's phenomenon, which is characterized by persistent vasospasm of digital arteries with alternation of ischemia and reperfusion and an increased expression of junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) [11]. The increase expression of JAMs promotes neutrophils and platelets attachment to endothelial cells. Neutrophils and platelets, in turn, induce the production of superoxide radicals which are responsible for endothelial cell injury [10]. Thus, in SSc an endothelial cell damage has been observed already in early phases of the disease, which probably together with neural dysfunctions, and other intravascular alterations, is in turn involved in inducing vascular injury [3, 4, 10]. Even if etiopathogenesis of endothelial cell damage is still unclear, autoimmunity seems to be responsible for endothelial production of cytokines and adhesion molecules, leading to apoptosis of the endothelial cell [10,13-15]. Moreover, an imbalance between vasodilator agents, such as nitric oxide, and vasoconstrictor agents, such as endothelin-1 (ET-1), has been observed in SSc and is involved in altered vascular permeability [15]. In fact, increased ET-1 expression is involved in inflammation, vascular fibrosis, and increased smooth muscle cell proliferation [4]. Moreover, the expression of ET-1 receptor type B, called ETB receptor, is reduced in SSc on endothelial cell surface but overexpressed on smooth muscle cells where it is responsible for fibrosis and vasoconstriction [16,17]. Cipriani et al. [18] have demonstrated that endothelial cells in SSc, under the synergistic effect of transforming growth factor-[beta] (TGF-[beta]) and ET-1, may transdifferentiate toward myofibroblasts in a process called endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) by which endothelial cells change their morphological features and assume myofibroblast-like features. By using skin sections obtained by SSc patients, Manetti et al. [19] have recently observed that EndoMT has a key role in inducing endothelial dysfunction and dermal fibrosis in SSc. Macitentan, an ET-1 receptor antagonist, has demonstrated an inhibitory effect in vitro on EndoMT and on fibroblast activation, suggesting its potential role as new therapeutic strategy against fibrosis in SSc [18,20]. Transdifferentiation of pericytes to myofibroblasts has also been hypothesized in SSc [21]. By considering that pericytes are cells that reside on the wall of the blood vessels and their primary function is to maintain the vessel integrity, their transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts may contribute to vessel instability. Vascular damage may induce the onset of avascular areas and/or morphologic changes in vessel wall, such as fibrosis. These alterations play a central role in inducing tissual hypoxia which may induce digital ulcers, gangrene and amputation of the extremities, and dysfunction in several internal organs [22-26]. 3. Vascular Implications and Fibrosis Angiogenic cytokines, responsible for vessel formation and stabilization, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), TGF-[beta], and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), are also involved in fibrosis. An impaired cross-talk between endothelial cells and perivascular cells, such as pericytes, may induce an abnormal expression of these angiogenic factors in SSc [27]. This is responsible for subsequent vessel instability and perivascular-myofibroblast phenotypic transdifferentiation, which contribute to fibrosis in the skin and internal organs and to the loss of peripheral vascularization [27]. 4. The Role of Imbalance between Angiogenic and Antiangiogenic Factors An imbalance between angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors has been observed in several autoimmune diseases [28-30]. In SSc a dysregulation of some angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), PDGF, TGF-[beta], monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1/CXCL12), interleukin (IL)-8, ET-1, and urokinase type plasminogen activator receptors (uPAR), and some antiangiogenic factors, such as angiostatin, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), endostatin, platelet factor 4 (PF4/CXCL4), IL-4, and pentraxin 3 (PTX3), has been described (Table 1) [10,11, 30-36]. High levels of VEGF have been demonstrated in SSc, in spite of an inadequate angiogenesis [37, 38]. Nevertheless, by considering that previous studies did not distinguish between proangiogenic VEGF(165) and antiangiogenic VEGF(165)b isoforms, originated by alternative splicing in the terminal exon of VEGF pre-RNA, Manetti et al. [39] have observed that a switch from proangiogenic to antiangiogenic VEGF isoforms may be responsible for the inefficient angiogenic response in SSc. Recently, increased production of VEGF(165)b has been found in platelets isolated from SSc patients, suggesting a role for platelets in insufficient angiogenesis [40]. Even if numerous angiogenic factors are overexpressed in SSc, reduced levels of Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) have been observed in sera of patients with SSc, whereas Ang-2, an antagonist of Ang-1, was upregulated. Moreover, reduced levels of Kallikreins 9,11, and 12, three serine proteases with angiogenic activity, have been observed in SSc endothelial cell [41, 42]. An increased production of antiangiogenic factors, such as endostatin and angiostatin, has been observed in SSc. Recent evidence shows that endostatin levels are increased in all phases of the disease while angiostatin levels are significantly elevated in late disease and are correlated to lung disease severity [43]. 5. Reduced Expression of Receptors for Angiogenic Factors A possible role in the lack of response to angiogenic factors in SSc, despite their overexpression, has been suggested for the reduced expression of some receptors on cell membrane. In fact, a reduced expression of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1), an angiogenic factor also known as CXC motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12), and its receptor CXCR4 has been found in later stages of disease skin biopsy samples from SSc patients, while they were upregulated in the skin of patients with early SSc, playing probably a role in the inadequate angiogenic response [44]. Nevertheless, contrasting results for VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) and VEGFR-2 expression have been described in SSc endothelial cells [45-49]. Moreover, overexpression of VEGFR-3 and chemokine receptors, such as CXCR2 (receptor of IL-8) and CXCR6 (receptor of CXCL6), has been found in endothelial cells and dermal fibroblasts isolated from SSc patients [44, 50, 51]. Recently, Tsou et al. [52] have found that increased expression of angiogenic chemokines, such as growth-regulated protein-[gamma] (Gro-[gamma]/CXCL3) and granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (GCP-2/CXCL6) in serum and endothelial cells obtained from SSc patients, was unable to induce angiogenesis. 6. Impaired Expression of Angiogenic Transcription Factors Another hypothesis to explain the lack of response to angiogenic factors in SSc is the impaired expression of angiogenic transcription factors, such as Friend leukemia integration-1 (Fli1) and Fos-related antigen 2 (Fra-2). Fli1 acts as a suppressor of collagen transcription in human skin as demonstrated in vivo. The persistent reduced expression of Fli1 in SSc fibroblast cultures has been correlated to abnormal matrix deposition in scleroderma skin. Low Fli1 levels have been correlated to the detachment of preexisting pericytes, extracellular matrix degradation by endothelial proteinases, enhanced migration, proliferation, and cell survival. On the contrary, Fli1 deficiency plays a role in inhibiting tube formation of endothelial cells, suggesting that Fli1 deficiency is probably a consequence of both proliferative obliterative vasculopathy, characterized by occlusion of arterioles and small arteries, and destructive vasculopathy, characterized by loss of small vessels, which are the typical alterations in SSc vasculopathy [53]. On the other hand, high levels of Fra-2 have been seen in SSc patients, and its overexpression has been correlated to increased profibrotic effects of TGF-[beta] and PDGF [54-56]. 7. JAM-A The reduced expression of JAM-A on endothelial cells surface decreases FGF-2 induced angiogenesis [57] and has been correlated to an increased cleavage of IL-8 and uPAR, two angiogenic factors which are responsible for endothelial cell proliferation, extracellular matrix degradation, and the adhesion of endothelial cells to the extracellular matrix, by MMPs overexpression in fibroblast and endothelial cell [58-60]. 8. Genetic Polymorphisms Genetic polymorphisms may also be involved in SSc pathogenesis. Gene polymorphism of uPAR, called UPAR rs344781, has been associated with increased risk of vascular injury in SSc, while gene polymorphism of MMP-12, named MMP-12 rs2276109, has been correlated with diffuse cutaneous SSc and pulmonary fibrosis [61, 62]. Moreover, an increased expression of histone deacetylases-5, an enzyme involved in the control of genes associated with angiogenesis regulation, has been observed in endothelial cells from SSc patients, suggesting a potential role for epigenetic modification in impaired angiogenesis [63]. 9. [alpha]-Klotho Recently, a role for a-klotho, a pleiotropic protein, originally described as an antiaging factor, has been suggested in SSc pathogenesis by acting as a powerful proangiogenic factor. This factor plays important pleotropic effects on endothelial cells, by interacting with VEGFR-2 and transient receptor potential canonical-1 (TRPC-1) cation channel to control cellular homeostasis [64]. Mazzotta et al. [65] have found that a-klotho is significantly decreased in the microvasculature in SSc skin and that its administration may efficiently improve dermal microvascular endothelial cells from SSc patients functions in vitro. 10. A Link between Vascular and Nervous System Emerging evidences underline the link between vascular and nervous system. In fact, factors responsible for transmitting axonal guidance cues, such members of class III semaphorin (Sema3) family, play an antiangiogenic role in physiological and pathological vascular development. These factors are involved in reducing cell adhesion by disrupting integrin-mediated adhesive structures, resulting in a filopodial retraction in endothelial cells. Recently, by using dermal microvascular endothelial cell cultures from SSc patients, Mazzotta et al. [66] have suggested that a member of Sema family, named Sema3E, by binding to its receptor Plexin-D1 plays probably a role in the dysregulation of angiogenesis and vascular tone control by inducing neurovascular mechanism alterations which are clinically evident above all in the early stage of the disease. A low expression of neuropilin-1, a receptor for both Sema3s and VEGF-A, has been observed in SSc, suggesting a further additional factor involved in impaired angiogenesis [67]. 11. The Role of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) in the Vascular Alteration during SSc: Therapeutic Implications In SSc patients, MSCs are characterized by senescence [68]. Nevertheless, MSCs may preserve immunomodulatory ability, which might have potential therapeutic implications in SSc. In fact, Cipriani et al. [68] have found increased levels of IL-6 and TGF-[beta] in SSc-MSCs. On one hand, increased levels of IL-6 have been considered as an adaptive mechanism to senescence and are responsible for immunosuppressive effects. On the other hand, increased levels of TGF-[beta] may be involved in determining both immunosuppressive effect on lymphocyte proliferation and immunoregulatory effects, via inducing expression of CD69 on T cells surface [68]. Moreover, MSCs may differentiate into endothelial cells [69], suggesting a potential therapeutic role in vascular alteration during SSc. Different sclerotic conditions, including localized scleroderma, have been effectively treated with autologous fat tissue grafting (AFTG). In patients affected by advanced SSc-related perioral thickening and mouth opening limitation, AFTG of the lips has demonstrated an improvement of mouth opening [70]. The efficacy of this treatment has been correlated to the presence of a stem cell population, called adipose-derived MSCs (ATDMSCs) in the adipose tissue. In fact, ATDMSCs may differentiate into endothelial cells and produce angiogenic factors, suggesting a potential role in promoting angiogenesis [71]. ATDMSCs exert also several immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting both proliferation of T and B cells, and the expression of numerous proinflammatory cytokines [72]. Furthermore, adiponectin expression from adipose tissue is responsible for antifibrotic effects [73]. 12. Concluding Remarks SSc in the earliest stages is characterized by morphologic alterations in vessel walls, such as fibrosis and capillary loss. Endothelial cell injury plays a central role in promoting these changes, which are responsible for inducing hypoxia. These events lead to an increased angiogenesis. Nevertheless, in SSc patients angiogenesis is not compensatory. The reason of this inefficient angiogenesis in SSc is still unclear. Nevertheless, an imbalance between angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors and a reduced expression of some receptors or cofactors of angiogenic agents has been suggested. Even if further studies are needed to explain the role of angiogenesis in the pathogenesis of SSc and to elucidate the mechanism responsible for angiogenesis dysregulation, endothelial cell injury and angiogenesis dysregulation seem to play a central role in the pathogenesis of SSc. This may provide a basis for a rational approach to the development of new therapeutic strategy to ensure efficient angiogenesis. https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/5345673 Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.

4b887440-aa7f-4c16-bab2-2d3d5368a535,"/ Multiple sclerosis Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic central nervous system (CNS) disease which affects the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. Even in the absence of symptoms, the disease is continuously active (causing brain damage) from early stages of MS. In recent times, MS prevalence rates in India have been revised from 1 case in every lakh to3 cases/100,000 people– compare this to US, where MS occurs in 1 per 1000 people. MS is anautoimmune disease because the MS patient’s immune system (body’s defence against infection) attacks a part of its own body – the nerve cell myelin sheath. The nervous system consists of billions of neurons (nerve cells) which relay messages within the brain and between the brain and other body parts. In a normal nervous system, nerves (bundles of nerve cells) pass messages amongst themselves at superfast speed. The axon (long arm of a nerve cell) is covered by the myelin sheath (multi-layered bands) with small gaps in between. The nerve impulses, that is, chemical signalsjump from gap-to-gap and rapidly spread the messages to surrounding nerve cells. MS is neurodegenerative because the damaged myelin sheath and oligodendrocytes (cells that produce myelin) delay communication between nerve cells resulting in inefficient functioning of various body systems. Demyelinating (without myelin sheath) nerve cells occurs in multiple areas of the brain and nervous system. Damaged portions of the axon undergo (develop hardened scars) A noteworthy feature of MS is the remissions (remyelination with improved symptoms) and relapses (further demyelination with worsened symptoms) cycle that occur over time. MS does not result from any particular lifestyle choice and is not contagious. A link between MS and autoimmune diseases and smoking has been reported. Several other viral and bacterial infections e.g., Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and childhood mumps, are considered as MS triggers. Sincevitamin D is important for proper immune function, low levels of this vitamin are considered as a potential cause of MS. Environmentally, strong associations exist between MS and geography (temperate and cold zones) and demographics(age, gender, and ethnicity). Genetics play a role in MS, though not hereditary, as there is increased risk of MS incidence among siblings. Scientists are investigating which genes are common within families affected by MS or in populations with high MS incidence rates. MS symptoms are variable, unpredictable, and appear in different patterns. Most common patterns are relapsing/remitting (symptoms come and go) and chronic progressive(symptoms continuously worsens). Depending on which part of the nervous system develops demyelination, the condition affects corresponding body systems.The first MS symptom, in nearly 50% patients, appears as double or blurred vision caused by optic neuritis (demyelination of nerves connected to the eyes). Loss of coordination (30% patients) and speech difficulties also occur frequently. Other common symptoms include - MRI(magnetic resonance imaging) scans of over 90% of MS patients show the presence oflesions (demyelinated and scarred areas). MRI scans along with the patient’s medical history plus neurological exam confirms MS diagnosis.Spinal taps(check spinal fluid for abnormalities) andEEG (measures brain electrical activity) help rule out other autoimmune conditions or infections (HIV or Lyme disease). High disease variability is a challenge for patients and neurologists It is difficult to predict the development course of MS which may be asymptomatic, mild or severe.In severe cases the patients lose their ability to write, speak or walk which drastically affects their daily lives. In a recent publication,(a Chennai-based Clinical Neurologist) commented that access plus cost of diagnostic tests and treatment arefor MS patients. For example, a MS patient in Chennai pays Rs. 70,000 monthly for drugs that require alternate day injections. In addition, there is minimal to zero insurance or disability compensation for patients who are unable to work as a result of their weakened physical, mental and emotional abilities. MS treatment options include disease-modifying drugsmethylprednisolone, interferons (Avonex, Betaseron), Copaxone and Rebif that provide symptom relief and slowdown the disease progressionto prevent relapses. Counselling, physical and occupational therapy help to cope with movement and behavioural symptoms. MS is not fatal but complications arising from a weak immune system, such as pneumonia, lower life expectancy by ten years in MS patients.  (US-based MS expert) during a Feb 2012 presentation, at The TS Srinivasan Institute, observed that MS prevalence in India is probably underestimated because of a lack of awareness amongst patients and neurologists. Dr. Rudick, also declared that MS treatment had progressed beyond the ABCR drugs (Avonex, Betaseron and Copaxone and Rebif) to personalised medicine such that several drug combinations could be used to possibly completely block multiple sclerosis disease (MS) activity. MS Society of India (MSSI) supports MS patients and caregivers MSSI (), found in 9 cities, offers useful advice, reading material, research updates, and community support. MSSI also organizes and conducts health camps, workshops, social events and fundraisers across the country throughout the year.  To end with, here’s a heart-warming picture of a 36 year old MS patient, Jigna Chanpura, who recently completed a 21km Half Marathon at a MSSI event.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) literally means “many scars,” which refers to the lesions that accumulate in the brain and spinal cord throughout the course of the disease. These scars, or lesions, consist mostly of dead nerve cells, whose axons have been denuded of the myelin sheaths that normally protect them and permit the conduction of nerve impulses. MS is a chronic, degenerative disease that usually begins in young adulthood and most visibly destroys muscular control, although many other brain functions are affected. Most people will live with MS for decades after their diagnosis. MS reduces life expectancy after onset (as measured by current diagnostic criteria) by only about 10-15 years, and about half of the patients survive 30 years or more from onset. THE CLINICAL PICTURE: SYMPTOMS, DISEASE COURSE, VARIATION, AND DIAGNOSIS MS, as defined by ongoing central nervous system (CNS) lesion formation and increasing cumulative damage, is now recognized as a disease that is active in most patients most of the time. Disease activity has reversible and irreversible sequelae; irreversible sequelae ultimately lead to progressive impairment and disability in most patients. MS takes a variety of forms, distinguished by the clinical pattern of disease activity (, ). Accumulated deficit can produce sustained worsening in both relapsing and progressive MS.

Varieties of MS Autopsy studies indicate there are individuals without any known clinical history who have neuropathologic changes typical of MS. It is difficult to get an accurate estimate of subclinical disease, but one recent review suggested asymptomatic MS might account for up to 25% of all cases. This is the major MS subtype. Approximately 85% of patients with a diagnosis of MS start out with relapsing MS. Overall, this subtype accounts for 55% of MS. Relapsing MS patients show a high rate of inflammatory lesion activity (gadolinium-enhancing lesions). This category represents a subset of relapsing patients who have few attacks and make an excellent recovery. They show minimal impairment and disability, even after 20-30 years. The proportion of MS patients with benign disease is controversial. Reasonable studies suggest 10-20% of people with MS fit into this category. This subtype accounts for 10% of MS. Patients show gradual worsening from onset, without disease attacks. These patients tend to be older and often present with a spinal cord dysfunction without obvious brain involvement. This subtype is the least likely to show inflammatory lesion activity on MRI (gadolinium-enhancing). Unlike the other subtypes of MS, men are as likely as women to develop primary progressive MS. This subtype accounts for 5% of MS. Patients show slow worsening from onset, with superimposed attacks. Recent studies suggest these patients are similar to primary progressive patients. This is the major progressive subtype and accounts for approximately 30% of MS. Relapsing MS patients usually transition to secondary progressive disease. They show gradual worsening, with or without superimposed relapses. Natural history studies of untreated relapsing MS indicate 50% of patients will be secondary progressive at 10 years and almost 90% by 25 years. This form of MS shows a lower rate of inflammatory lesion activity than relapsing MS, yet the total burden of disease continues to increase. This most likely reflects ongoing axonal loss. Also referred to as Marburg variant MS, this is the most severe form of MS. Significant disability develops much more rapidly than usual, over weeks to months. Pathologic changes are widespread and destructive. These cases are rare and generally occur in young people. This refers to patients who present with an isolated CNS syndrome (optic neuritis, incomplete transverse myelitis, brainstem or cerebellar lesion), which is often the first MS attack. Clinical, MRI, and CSF studies indicate that such patients with normal brain MRI and CSF have a low risk of developing MS. In contrast, those with abnormal MRI have a high risk of developing MS. NOTE: CSF = cerebrosinal fluid; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future.

In progressive MS, the dominant pattern is a gradual accumulation of neurologic deficits, with slow clinical worsening. Disease activity and progression have both clinical and subclinical components. Clinical disease activity and progression are judged by observation and neurologic examination. Subclinical components refer to pathological changes that are not observable in a clinical examination but are observed using a variety of laboratory tests, predominantly neuroimaging parameters. Relapses are variously referred to as acute attacks, exacerbations, or disease flare-ups. They involve the acute, or sudden onset, of focal neurologi- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Examples of typical MS relapses include blurring of vision in one eye (optic neuritis), persistent numbness or tingling of a body part (sensory system relapse), weakness of a body part (motor system relapse), or loss of coordination (cerebellar system relapse). Early in the MS disease process, relapses are likely to involve sensory, motor, cerebellar, or visual system abnormalities ( , ). Later in the disease process, relapses are likely to involve bladder, bowel, cognitive, and sexual function abnormalities. Acute disease attacks are a characteristic feature of the relapsing-remitting MS subtype. Relapses also occur in patients with progressive relapsing disease and in a number of patients with secondary progressive disease. The only clinical disease subtype in which relapses never occur is primary progressive MS. Areas of the CNS often affected by MS. Reprinted with permission from University of Delaware. Sensory problems (numbness or tingling of a body part) ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Relapses generally consist of three phases. There is a period of worsening, with onset of new deficits or increasing severity of old deficits. This is followed by a period of stability, with no change in deficits. The final phase is the period of recovery, with variable degrees of improvement in deficits. Most patients recover within six weeks, although for some, improvements can continue over months. Recovery can be complete return to baseline status, partial return, or no improvement. However, some degree of improvement is typical, particularly early in the disease. Relapsing patients then remain clinically stable until the next disease attack. To be considered a relapse, deficits must persist for a minimum of 24 hours. This avoids confusion with deficits lasting only minutes to hours, which are believed to be a consequence of impaired nerve conduction through old lesion areas rather than the formation of a new lesion. Alternatively, new abnormalities that last seconds to minutes, such as Lhermitte's sign (a tingling sensation radiating down the arms, neck, or back on neck flexion), or paroxysmal attacks (stereotypic neurologic deficits occurring multiple times a day that last less than a minute) are also considered relapses if they occur repeatedly over several weeks. Sequential relapses are considered distinct only when they occur at least 30 days apart with a month of clinical stability in between. Although clinical relapses always produce changes in a patient's condition, they are not always associated with changes on neurologic examination. Maximal deficit in an MS relapse typically develops over several days but in some cases can develop much faster, over hours or even minutes, or much more slowly, over a period as long as several weeks. Physiologic factors such as temperature, pH, or electrolyte balance can temporarily disrupt nerve conduction and produce neurologic abnormality. A relapse must be distinguished from a which is a neurologic deterioration associated with a physiologic change such as infection or fever. This condition can last for days, mimicking a true relapse. Pseudoexacerbation deficits disappear once the precipitating factor has been corrected. They reflect a temporary disruption in nerve conduction, rather than the formation of a new lesion. Approximately 85 percent of MS patients begin with relapsing-remitting disease. MS relapses can involve a single neural system, as in optic neuritis, or several anatomically distinct systems at the same time, for example, combined motor and sensory problems. Attacks involving single neural systems are somewhat more common in the first MS relapse. Most patients experience their second attack within two to three years of the first, but 5 percent of patients remain free of relapses for 15 years or more. In most cases, there is substantial recovery from the first relapse; only 4 percent of patients show no improvement. The average relapse rate is one to two attacks a year, but this rate normally declines over time. The longer a person has MS, the less likely it is that relapses will be followed by complete recovery and the more likely it is that relapses will be associated with residual deficits and increasing disability.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Relapse features have prognostic significance (). In the first few years after disease onset, the number and type of relapses, as well as the degree of recovery, help predict future disease course. Relapses that involve visual, sensory, or brainstem systems have a better prognosis than those that involve cerebellar, motor, or sphincter systems. In the first two years of disease, a low relapse rate with excellent recovery indicates a better prognosis than a high relapse rate with poor recovery. Relapses restricted to single neural systems are prognostically better than those involving multiple systems. The relapse rate also has prognostic significance in the later stages of MS. With a disease duration of five or more years, an increasing relapse rate, polyregional relapses that involved multiple systems, and incomplete recovery from relapses indicate a worse prognosis. The relapsing form of MS is characterized by acute disease exacerbations. In contrast, progressive MS is characterized by slow deterioration and increasing neurological deficits. There are three forms of progressive MS. Approximately 15 percent of MS patients show slow deterioration from onset. In the second form, 10 percent have either primary progressive MS and never experience acute disease attacks or progressive relapsing MS (5 percent), and have occasional subsequent attacks. The third form, secondary progressive MS, is the major progressive subtype. These are relapsing patients who begin to slowly worsen 5 to 15 years after the first relapse. Once relapsing patients enter a progressive phase, they either stop having relapses or continue to experience exacerbations superimposed on slow worsening. Documentation of a progressive course requires at least six months of observation. Observation over a year or two is often necessary to be confident of progression, since deficits can accumulate at a very gradual rate. The major defining feature of progressive MS is slow deterioration that occurs independently of acute disease relapses and does not reflect residual deficits from acute disease attacks. An analysis of the disease course among 1,844 patients indicated that the presence or absence of relapses during the progressive phase does not significantly affect the progression of irreversible disability (4 percent of ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. patients in this study had been treated for up to one year with beta-interferon, but this did not affect the study results). Progressive MS patients can be clinically stable for up to several years at a time and can even show slight improvement for a period of time. Ultimately, however, all progressive MS patients develop disability with limited ability to walk. Progressive MS is a more severe form than benign or relapsing-remitting MS and has a worse prognosis. Clinical parameters such as relapses and progression underestimate the actual damage to tissue that occurs in MS. When macroscopically normal-appearing brain tissue is looked at under the microscope, one can detect inflammation, gliosis (scarring), and myelin damage. Chemical studies of normal-appearing brain tissue often reveal changes in organelles such as lysosomes, in enzymes, and in myelin constituents. In addition, a number of the new research neuro-imaging techniques can detect changes in brain and spinal cord areas that appear free of lesions on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some of these abnormalities are detectable several months to years before they can be seen with conventional MRI. Changes in normal-appearing brain tissue are generally pronounced in MS patients with severe impairment. As a group, secondary progressive MS patients show more abnormalities in normal white matter and brain tissue than relapsing patients. (White matter corresponds to brain regions where axons are ensheathed in myelin; gray matter corresponds to brain regions that are rich in cell bodies.) Primary progressive patients often show subtle but diffuse changes in normal-appearing brain areas. Even conventional MRI indicates that most new lesion formation is clinically silent, meaning that clinical exam does not reveal any corresponding symptoms. Approximately 80 to 90 percent of new brain lesions do not produce identifiable relapses. They might, however, be associated with subtle cognitive changes or other neuropsychological changes that are not detected in clinical examination. The total lesion burden increases in MS patients, on average, 5 to 10 percent per year, reflecting in large part the development of clinically silent lesions. (This does not apply to patients on the disease-modifying therapies discussed later in this section.) Atrophy of both brain and spinal cord can be detected even in patients with minimal symptoms. Atrophy can progress without obvious lesion formation, most likely reflecting loss of axons. MS patients show an accelerated rate of age-related brain and spinal cord atrophy that is three- to tenfold higher than the rate in control populations. Spinal cord lesions are generally similar to those in the brain except for the absence of “black holes” (see discussion in of T1-weighted lesions). Spinal MS lesions rarely cover more than half of the cross-sectional area of the cord or exceed two vertebral segments in length. They are found more often in the cervical spinal cord (neck region) than thoracic region (midback) and are most ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. MRI involves application of a magnetic field to the body that causes nuclei with odd numbers of protons, such as hydrogen nuclei, to behave like tiny magnets. These protons align themselves either parallel or antiparallel to the applied external magnetic field. The net magnetization induces an electric current that forms the basic MR signal. An MR image is formed by determining the spatial distribution of the signal and reconstructing the data into detailed images. The signals are picked up by a very sensitive antenna and forwarded to a computer for processing. Two time constants, T1 and T2 relaxation times, are important in determining the appearance of MR images. T1, or the longitudinal relaxation time, is the time constant when 63 percent of the original longitudinal magnetization is regained as the nuclei return to alignment with the external magnetic field. T2 or the transverse relaxation time, is the time constant when the transverse magnetization decreases to 37 percent of its original value as the nuclei lose alignment with each other following the initial application of an external magnetic field (a radio-frequency pulse). By altering the imaging parameters and pulse sequences used, differences between tissues with intrinsically different proton densities and T1 and T2 relaxation times can be highlighted or obscured. Image contrast can be either T1 weighted or T2 weighted in order to emphasize the differences between normal and pathological tissues. For example, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is dark on T1-weighted images and bright on T2-weighted images. White matter is bright on T1-weighted images, whereas a matter is dark but not as dark as CSF. common in the midcervical region. Disease activity is much less frequent in the spine than in the brain. In summary, the clinical manifestations of MS possibly represent only the “tip of the iceberg,” with most of the CNS damage occurring much earlier and being detectable only when the accumulated damage overwhelms the ability of the CNS to compensate. The mechanisms through which CNS tissue is damaged or destroyed are discussed in greater detail later in the chapter. At the present time, neuroimaging provides the best assessment of disease activity in MS (, ). A number of neuroimaging techniques can measure distinct pathologic changes and thereby provide markers for different aspects of the MS disease ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Magnetic resonance imaging is a technique that creates cross-sectional images of the brain using a magnetic field and radio waves (). It is a versatile, powerful, and sensitive tool for measuring abnormalities in the brain. This is especially valuable with MS, because so much of the pathological activity of the disease is neurologically asymptomatic. Indeed, until neuroimaging results proved otherwise, the disease appeared to be quiescent during remissions. Neuroimaging has revealed a previously unsuspected level of activity and pathology throughout the course of disease. Contrast agents are used in MRI in cases where contrast between two tissues is poor. The contrasting agent, gadolinium, is normally excluded from the brain by the blood-brain barrier.

Gadolinium-enhancing activity on MRI correlates with clinical relapses and predicts increased risk or further disease activity. However, since most new brain MRI lesions are clinically silent, gadolinium-enhanced lesions are seen more often than clinical relapses. In T2-weighted images, MS lesions appear as very bright white areas against a gray or more neutral background and are the most readily visualized MS lesions by MRI. They reflect lesions with different pathology and of various ages, and reversible as well as irreversible abnormalities. T2-weighted hyperintense lesions can be used to measure the total lesion volume (burden-of-disease). The variable pathology, which is not distinguished in T2 burden-of-disease measures, is probably a determinant of associated disability. Only a modest relationship has been observed between T2 burden of disease and clinical disability in relapsing and secondary progressive MS. However, in patients with clinically isolated syndromes who are in the early stages of MS, T2 burden-of-disease has been correlated with the development of MS, as well as the clinical subtype of MS and disability 10 years later. The magnitude of T2 burden-of-disease changes very early in the disease process and may be valuable for predicting subsequent course. Atrophy of both brain and spinal cord can be detected in MS patients, including relapsing patients with minimal neurologic deficits. Both axon and myelin loss contribute to tissue atrophy. Recent studies suggest that CNS atrophy may be the best neuroimaging correlate for clinical disability (reviewed in 1999 by Trapp et al.). A number of different methodologies are used to measure atrophy. Current advances involve measurement of the whole brain and improved automation, but the optimal technique has not been decided. Axonal injury can be measured on proton MR spectroscopy by estimating -acetyl aspartate (NAA) levels in brain tissue. NAA is a molecule that is virtually confined to axons and neurons. Levels of NAA can fluctuate, suggesting that they can be used to measure reversible as well as irreversible damage. Persistent reduction of NAA on MR Spectroscopy correlates with axon loss, damage, or dysfunction. Reduced NAA is found not only within MS lesions but also in the normal-appearing white matter of relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, and primary progressive MS patients. The reduction in NAA is more severe in secondary progressive MS than in relapsing MS. In addition, NAA decrease in cerebellar white matter has been correlated with clinical ataxia. NAA can be measured in a discrete region of interest within the brain. Recently, whole-brain NAA has been measured in MS. This appears to be a more meaningful neuroimaging marker to evaluate axon damage. MR spectroscopy can also be used to measure lipid changes within both lesions and normal- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. appearing brain tissue, but these studies are very preliminary and NAA measurements are the major focus of current MR spectroscopy studies in MS. Also referred to as black holes, T1-weighted hypointense lesions have lower signal intensity than the surrounding white matter. T1 hypointense lesions are most common in the supratentorial region (cerebral hemispheres). They are much less common in the infratentorial (brainstem and cerebellum) region and are not reported in the spinal cord. Compared to T2-weighted lesions, they represent more severe tissue pathology, with axon loss, demyelination, and extracellular edema. In postmortem studies of progressive MS, T1-weighted hypointense lesions correlate strongly with axon density measurements. T1-weighted hypointense lesions show a stronger correlation with disability than T2-weighted hyperintense lesions. Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) can be used to study global brain function or to measure changes within a local region of interest. Populations of bound and soluble protons produce different signals in response to the external magnetic field. The magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) is the ratio of the different signals produced by these two populations. It is reduced in MS and is believed to reflect both demyelination and axon loss, thereby producing an index of tissue destruction. MTR measurements are correlated with MS disability, as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS; see ), as well as cognitive measures. MTI shows great promise as a disease marker. Lower MTR values occur with disease worsening in relapsing, secondary progressive, and primary progressive MS patients and even in patients with clinically isolated MS syndromes. In primary progressive patients who have a relatively small T2 burden of disease, MTR is significantly reduced, suggesting that axon damage is significantly greater in this clinical subtype. Differences in MTRs are associated with different lesion pathology. Lesions that are more destructive (as indicated by T1 hypointensity) have reduced MTR values. Lesions that remain hypointense show a persistent reduction in MTR, whereas lesions that become isointense recover in MTR. New lesions in secondary progressive patients have a lower MTR than those in relapsing patients. The decline in MTR over three years is significantly greater in secondary progressive MS than in relapsing MS, supporting a relationship between MTR changes and disease progression. MTR measures allow more significant lesions to be detected and may provide a better potential correlate with clinical disability. Reduction in MTR can precede the development of new lesions on conventional MRI. Diffusion-weighted MRI is sensitive to the diffusion, or random motion, of water molecules in tissue. It can detect subtle pathological changes that are not seen on conventional MRI. This technique ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. might allow detection of pathological change in white matter tracts, including demyelination and loss of axons, by quantifying anisotropy through a measure of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI can identify significantly altered diffusion properties in normal-appearing white matter. Lesions with the highest diffusion are the more destructive black holes, while the greatest change in anisotropy is seen in acute inflammatory lesions. Coincident with new lesion formation, diffusion-weighted imaging has shown changes in contralateral normal-appearing white matter. High-field-strength magnets, which are 4 tesla (T) or higher, increase the signal-to-noise ratio (conventional imaging machines are 1.5 T). They allow enhanced detection of small (less than 5 mm) MS lesions, particularly those aligned along blood vessels. Both MR spectroscopy and MTI can be conducted on high-field machines with enhanced sensitivity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, is a technique for determining which parts of the brain are activated by different types of sensation such as sight or sound, by different types of tasks such as moving one's fingers or legs, or by different mental tasks such as adding sums, reading, or memorizing. This “brain mapping” is achieved by using an MRI scanner to measure changes in blood flow to different areas of the brain. When a particular brain region is activated, blood flow into the region increases. The incoming arterial blood is rich in oxygenated hemoglobin, and there is a corresponding decrease in local deoxygenated hemoglobin. Changes in the MRI signal are derived from regional changes in the concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin, which is a paramagnetic molecule (reviewed in Hirsch et al.). The fMRI signal is, thus, determined by the balance between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. FMRI can provide second-by-second images of changes in response to different stimuli and during performance of mental tasks. It provides a unique tool for assessment of neural circuits involved in loss and recovery of function, as well as for measuring the circuits underlying symptoms that are as difficult to study as cognitive changes, fatigue, pain, and sensory disturbances. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the fluid that circulates around and within the brain and spinal cord. CSF provides a vehicle for removing waste products of cellular metabolism from the nervous system and is believed to be nutritive for both neurons and glial cells and to function as a transport system for biologically active substances such as releasing factors, hormones, neurotransmitters, and metabolites. Sampling this fluid thus provides an index to substances active in the CNS and possibly those involved in MS pathology. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. A number of potential CSF disease markers have been reported in MS, including markers that are proposed as distinguishing between different types of MS (). For the most part, these are markers of tissue damage or immune disturbance. None are currently used in routine clinical practice, since they have not proved useful enough to justify serial lumbar punctures. There has been particular interest in the specificity of oligoclonal bands in MS. Oligoclonal bands are produced by the overrepresentation of particular anti-bodies that can be visualized when CSF proteins are separated by gel electrophoresis where they appear as separate bands of protein on a gel matrix. Each of the bands contains a single type of antibody produced by a single clone of B cells. Oligoclonal bands are for the CSF of MS patients, but they are not to MS patients. For example, they are also found in the CSF of patients with other inflammatory status, such as viral brain infections. In MS, however, the particular antigens that elicit each antibody band are unknown. Investigators have recently used molecular approaches such as phage display libraries to probe MS oligoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) bands for sequence information related to their antigenic target. These are powerful methods that should allow for the identification of antigenic targets for the oligoclonal IgG. A main question, however, is whether the oligoclonal IgG bands represent an immune response directed against the etiologic agent of MS or merely constitute a by-product of immune system activity. In other words, upregulation of the antibody response and the heterogeneous distribution of antibodies into oligoclonal IgG bands could be a result of B-cell hyperactivity rather than an immune response to a specific etiologic pathogen. A variety of blood, urine, and mucosal fluid disease markers have been studied in MS, but none of them have provided a reliable disease marker. Again they are either markers of tissue damage (such as S-100) or immune activation (such as neopterin). Blood markers have included matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, circulating adhesion molecules, levels of various cytokines and their receptors, different subpopulations of cells, a variety of antibodies including antiviral and autoreactive antibodies, S-100 levels, and neopterin levels. Urine disease markers have included myelin basic protein-like material, free light chains, neopterin, gliotoxin, and neuron-specific enolase. Mucosal fluid cells and immunoglobulins have also been studied. The diagnosis of MS is based on both clinical parameters, such as medical history and neurological examination, and paraclinical parameters such as MRI, CSF oligoclonal banding, and evoked potentials. There is no MS-specific diag- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. nostic test, and the intermittent nature of the disease and high variability in presenting symptoms make diagnosis difficult (listed in ). The presentation of MS can be monosymptomatic or have multifocal signs and symptoms, and many neurodegenerative disorders are similar to MS in their presentation. The general diagnostic criteria, established in 1965 by a committee sponsored by the National MS Society (the MS Society), state that a diagnosis of “clinically definite” MS (CDMS) requires clinical evidence of two or more white matter lesions on at least two occasions. In 1983, these criteria were expanded by Poser et al. to include the use of paraclinical parameters, and they have since become the standard MS diagnostic criteria (). In July 2000, an international committee met to further revise these criteria, in particular to make MRI information a more integral component and to incorporate diagnostic criteria for primary progressive MS. The results of that meeting, however, were not available at the time of this writing. The failure of the Poser criteria to incorporate primary progressive MS has recently been addressed by revised criteria that define definite, probable, and possible levels of diagnostic certainty. These criteria are based on clinical findings, CSF abnormalities, brain and spinal cord MRI abnormalities, and evoked potentials. Using these criteria, at least one year of clinical progression must be documented before a diagnosis of primary progressive MS can be made. MRI reveals neuropathological damage in 70 to 95 percent of people with MS and, because of its sensitivity, is the most helpful paraclinical diagnostic test. However, the use of MRI in MS diagnosis has led to concern that its high sensitivity combined with limited MS specificity leads to misdiagnosis, since other conditions including myelopathy and disseminated encephalomyelitis can cause MRI lesions similar to MS lesions. Thus, it is important that imaging be used in combination with clinical data for the diagnosis of MS. Recently, several sets of criteria for the definition of “MRI-definite” MS have been suggested (). Patients with clinically isolated syndromes are particularly difficult to diagnose, and Barkhof et al. and Fazekas have identified criteria that are relevant to such cases. Although assessment of spinal cord damage using MRI remains behind the development of brain methodology, it can be useful in diagnosing patients suspected of MS, particularly in cases with equivocal or negative brain MRI results. Spinal cord imaging increases the diagnostic sensitivity of MRI and might also enable earlier diagnosis. When demyelination or sclerosis (scarring) occurs, the conduction of nerve impulses along axons is slowed or interrupted. Impaired conductance is reflected in an increased latency of evoked potentials or an increase in the amount of time that elapses between the presentation of a sensory stimulus and the resulting ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. change in the brain's electrical field. Evoked potentials are measured by placing small electrodes on the head in the region corresponding to the stimuli presented ( ). Abnormal evoked responses to different types of stimuli provide clues to the location of plaques or lesions and are useful in detecting “clinically silent” lesions that do not produce easily observable symptoms. However, abnormal evoked responses are not unique to MS. For example, although abnormal visual IgG antibodies are composed of light and heavy polypeptide chains. Free light chains are found in patients with chronic infections or inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, but also in healthy individuals particularly following strenuous exercise. Cytokines are intercellular signaling proteins produced by cells of the immune system and CNS. They are involved in various aspects of disease processes, particularly inflammatory responses. Oligoclonal bands are produced by the overrepresentation of particular antibodies. They are of the CSF of MS patients, but not to it. Antiviral antibodies are produced by B cells in direct response to an antigen's presence, and certain antiviral antibodies are increased in the CSF of some patients with MS. Immunoglobulins are produced by plasma cells and are integral in adaptive immune responses. Polyclonal increases of IgG occur in chronic infection and inflammation. White blood cells responsible for cell-mediated immune responses to antigens, including viral infections. Adhesion, costimulatory, and other surface of MS. molecules Upregulated adhesion molecules in blood and CSF indicate sustained potential for inflammation in the CNS throughout the clinical spectrum A major component of myelin, MBP is increased in the CSF of some, but not all, MS patients following a demyelinating episode.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. evoked potentials are common in MS, they also occur in compressive lesions of the visual pathway and spinocerebellar degeneration. Evoked potentials can aid in the localization of lesions, confirm clinically ambiguous lesions, and confirm the organic basis of symptoms. In addition, changes in evoked potentials can be used to measure disease progression and the effectiveness of therapeutic treatment, including treatments designed to improve conduction. Continued S-100 protein is an astroglial-specific protein that binds calcium. When a brain lesion occurs, S-100 is released into both the CSF and the blood. As a marker of brain damage, NSE reflects the severity of disease in patients with intracerebral hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, head injury, and certain tumors. A major constituent of glial filaments in differentiated CNS astrocytes, GFAP has been used for the diagnosis of astrocytic tumors, the study of astrocytic gliosis, and CNS regeneration and transplantation. Neurofilaments are important for axonal structure, transport, and regeneration. Accumulation of neurofilaments in motor neurons can trigger a neurodegenerative process and may be a key intermediate in the pathway of pathogenesis leading to neuronal loss. A modulator of axon outgrowth and cell adhesion that adapts its structure to requirements during development by alternative splicing and posttranslational modification. CNTF appears to promote remyelination, as well as formation of oligodendroctyes. Highly cytotoxic for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, gliotoxin may represent an initial pathogenic factor leading to the neuropathological features of MS, such as blood-brain barrier involvement and demyelination. A marker of immune activation, neopterin is increased in CSF of relapsing-remitting patients and correlates with a decrease of -tryptophan, reflecting interferon-gamma-mediated activation of macrophages. Matrix metalloproteinases are enzymes that can dissolve the extracellular matrix of the blood-brain barrier. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Combinations of various types of evidence are used to diagnose MS under the Poser criteria. More than one combination of clinical and paraclinical evidence can support a diagnosis within a single category. Laboratory-supported diagnosis requires one of two possible immune disturbances in CSF: IgG oligoclonal bands or intrathecal IgG production. NOTES: CSF, Cerebrospinal fluid. OB, Oligoclonal bands.

Evoked Potentials as a Diagnostic Tool in MS Strobe light flash or reversible checkerboard pattern flash on a computer screen Series of clicking noises or tone bursts played into earphone On the scalp along the vertex and on each earlobe Evaluation of sensory nerve tracts in spinal cord, thalamus, and sensory cortex Mild electrical stimulus via electrodes on wrists or knees On the scalp, each wrist (medial nerve), and the knees (peroneal nerve) The use of evoked potentials as a diagnostic tool has greatly declined since the advent of the MRI, which provides a more comprehensive picture of disease activity. In at least some cases of progressive MS, visual evoked potentials show changes over time where none are detected in MRI scans. In May 2000, the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology concluded that although visual evoked potentials are useful to identify patients at increased risk of developing clinically definite MS, somatosensory evoked responses are only useful for that purpose, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend brainstem auditory evoked potentials as a diagnostic tool. Although MS is postulated to have an underlying immune-mediated pathogenesis, there is as yet no biologic marker that is disease specific and can be used for diagnostic purposes. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to allow detection of any putative disease-related infectious agent as a basis for defining the disease. Thus, MS continues to be defined by sets of criteria that have been ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. developed based on clinical and pathologic observations. MS may well be heterogeneous when viewed from the perspective of genetics, pathogenic mechanisms, clinical phenotypes, and immunopathology. To be considered a truly distinctive variant of MS, any putative distinct disease subtypes defined in one of these categories would have to be correlated with the distinctive features identified in each of the other categories. Cases classified as MS are recognized where disease distribution is mainly in the spinal cord, hind brain (cerebellum or brainstem), or cerebrum. Different animal models have distinct topographic distributions, some of which seem to have distinct immunopathologies. For example, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, the demyelinating disease that afflicts mice, is mainly a spinal cord disease. There is an apparent overrepresentation of specific phenotypes in certain geographic regions. For example, MS that is relatively restricted to the optic nerve and spinal cord is more common in Japan than in other countries. The Devic's pattern of MS features a predominance of spinal cord and optic nerve involvement. The pathology is considered more destructive than classical MS, and the prognosis is worse. At issue is whether these differences reflect different immunopathogenic mechanisms in a given individual, even when the disease trigger, or initiating event, is not distinct among such individuals. Even in identical twins with MS, the disease course can be markedly different. A number of immunomodulatory agents have been shown in double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase III trials to benefit patients with relapsing MS ( ; see also 1999 review by Rudick ). These agents help clinical disease features (they decrease the number of attacks, the severity of attacks, and sustained worsening on neurologic examination) as well as MRI disease features (they decrease the formation of new lesions, the number of contrast-enhancing lesions, the total burden of disease, and brain atrophy). Although all of these drugs have side effects, they are manageable in most patients. The benefit of treatment is sustained for at least several years. It is not yet known whether these agents prevent, reduce, or delay transition from relapsing to progressive MS, but preliminary data suggest that this may be the case. Throughout this report, the term “disease-modifying therapy” is used to distinguish these agents from other medications used to relieve the symptoms of MS that do not alter either the frequency of relapses or the rate of progression. Beta-interferon (IFN-Î²) is an anti-inflammatory regulatory cytokine with antiviral, antineoplastic, and immunomodulatory activity. It has a number of effects on the immune system that would be beneficial in MS. For example, it decreases cell migration into the CNS, inhibits T-cell proliferation and expression of cell activation markers, inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase (the enzyme that produces nitric oxide, a potentially damaging substance), and enhances ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

There are two types of recombinant (artificially made) beta-interferon. Beta-interferon-1a (Avonex, Rebif) is a duplicate of human beta-interferon. Beta-interferon-1b (Betaseron) has three molecular differences from human beta-interferon: it is not glycosylated, there is an amino acid substitution at position 17, and there is no “N-terminal” methionine. The three available beta-interferon therapies are given in different amounts and dosing schedules (). There are well-recognized side effects (most commonly flu-like reactions), which occur maximally during the first weeks or months of therapy. Flu-like reactions can be minimized by initiating therapy with a dose escalation schedule and consistent use of anti-inflammatory premedication during the first few weeks of therapy. *Rebif has been approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS by the European Commission but has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States because of the Orphan Drug Act. If tentative approval is received, Rebif could enter the U.S. market in 2003, when the exclusivity periods for Avonex and Betaseron end. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) consists of random polymers of four amino acids, designed to mimic myelin basic protein, an important component of CNS myelin. Glatiramer acetate is believed to work by activating antiinflammatory regulatory T cells, which then migrate into the CNS to inhibit local immune reactions. Glatiramer acetate has an excellent side effect profile. Patients may experience injection site reactions, but they tend to be quite minor. Some 10 to 15 percent of patients experience at least one immediate postinjection reaction characterized by chest tightness, palpitations, flushing, and anxiety within a few minutes of injection. The reaction lasts only minutes and is not dangerous. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) is a cytotoxic agent that interferes with DNA synthesis and repair, and suppresses a variety of immune system cells. It also enhances suppressor cell activity. It is given as an intravenous infusion over 5 to 15 minutes, every three months. Mitoxantrone is fairly well tolerated at low doses. In the recent Phase III trial, both the low (5 mg/m) and high (12 mg/m) doses showed efficacy, but the high dose gave the best overall results. Mitoxantrone should not be given at a cumulative dose of 140 mg/m or higher because of concerns about cardiotoxicity, which also means that this drug can be used for only a few years. Currently available treatments are highly effective in preventing the type of MS damage that can be visualized using MRI. They are moderately effective in preventing and reducing the severity of relapses, but they are generally disappointing in preventing long-term disability—the most important goal of treatment. This might reflect the timing of treatment, and there has been a recent emphasis on starting therapy at the time MS is first diagnosed. This type of early therapy is likely most effective in delaying or preventing long-term disability, although this effect has not yet been clearly demonstrated through empirical research studies (Richard Rudick, personal communication). Clearly, much remains to be done in the development of therapies for people who suffer from MS. Two recent studies, the interferon beta-1a (Avonex) prevention study (CHAMPS, Controlled High Risk Subjects Avonex Multiple Sclerosis Prevention) and the interferon beta-1a (Rebif) early treatment (ETOMS, Early Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis) trial, have compared the use of disease-modifying therapy with placebo in patients after their first attack who also have an abnormal brain MRI. These are patients at high risk for MS, but who do not meet current criteria for a definite diagnosis. In both studies, early treatment with a disease-modifying agent significantly delayed onset of a second clinical attack over the two-year study period. Patients who received treatment also showed significantly less MRI disease activity over the next two years. These two trials have led to a reassessment of when disease-modifying therapy should be started. The National MS Society consensus statement endorsed treatment of patients as soon as a definite diagnosis of relapsing MS is made. If new diagnostic criteria are formulated for an MRI-based diagnosis at the time of a first attack, it is likely that the use of disease-modifying therapy will expand to include these early patients.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Beta-interferon and glatiramer acetate have been tested mainly in relapsing MS. It is more controversial whether they benefit progressive MS. Several Phase III trials have examined beta-interferon therapy in patients with secondary progressive MS, with conflicting results. The European Secondary Progressive Study on beta-interferon-1b (Betaseron) showed a significant effect on slowing progression. In contrast, the North American Secondary Progressive beta-interferon-1b study and the European SPECTRIMS beta-interferon-1a (Rebif) study showed no significant effect on progression. These trials did, however, show positive results on secondary outcomes such as relapse rate and MRI disease parameters. The European study, which showed a treatment effect on progression in contrast to the two negative studies, included secondary progressive patients who had a shorter disease duration, were still experiencing relapses, and had contrast-enhancing brain MRI lesions. Considered as a whole, these studies suggest that in the earlier stages of MS, when there is still a significant inflammatory component (reflected in clinical relapses and gadolinium-enhancing lesion activity), beta-interferon may have a positive effect on clinical progression. In the later, nonrelapsing, progressive stages of MS, where there appears to be ongoing atrophy relatively independent of contrast-enhancing lesion activity, beta-interferon does not seem to slow progression. The European Phase III trial of Mitoxantrone enrolled both relapsing and secondary progressive MS patients. The drug had a positive effect on progression as indicated by a decrease in the EDSS impairment scale at the end of the study (change of -0.13 compared to +0.23 in the placebo group, p = .038) (for EDSS scale, see ). An ongoing trial (IMPACT Study) in secondary progressive MS is testing double-dose interferon beta-1a (Avonex) once a week. There have been no major treatment trials in primary progressive and progressive relapsing MS. There currently is an ongoing three-year Phase III trial of glatiramer acetate in primary progressive MS (the Promise trial). Each of the currently available disease-modifying treatments has shortcomings, including partial efficacy for patients as a group and potential adverse effects. There are four reasons why treatments fail—nonadherence on the patient's part, adverse side effects, production of neutralizing antibodies, and nonresponsive disease (reviewed by Cohen at al., 1999). Patient adherence is a factor in the efficacy of any medication, but particularly so when a patient's hopes exceed the outcome—which is particularly salient for therapies that are preventive, but not restorative. The primary principles to increase adherence are appropriate selection of patients for treatment, availability of adequate medical support throughout treatment, and perhaps most importantly, patient education before and during treatment. MS patients need to be fully informed that the therapy can prevent relapses and the accumulation of disability, ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. but that it will not improve preexisting manifestations. In addition, some patients are averse to self-injection and will not be persuaded to inject themselves with any medication (unless, perhaps, they are convinced of a substantial and certain benefit, which many MS patients are not). Health care financing policies vary widely among different countries and even within countries such as the United States and Canada. This will also influence patient adherence. In countries such as France where the costs of MS therapies are fully covered by the state, cost is unlikely to influence adherence, but in countries where patients must assume the full costs of MS disease-modifying therapies themselves, many of them will decide that they cannot afford to pay more than $10,000 (U.S.) annual expense for the modest health benefit they might gain. Adverse effects are a common reason for discontinuing treatment, but they are generally not serious health threats. The most common side effect of glatiramer acetate is irritation at the injection site, although it is typically mild. The most common side effects of beta-interferon are flu-like symptoms, and these usually resolve after three to six months. (Depression is also a possible side effect and is discussed in greater detail in .) Although only 4 percent of actively treated patients withdrew from beta-interferon clinical trials because of side effects, in clinical practice, 11 percent discontinue within four months of initiating treatment (reviewed in 1999 by Mohr et al.). (The percentage of patients who discontinue treatment because of side effects might, however, decline as physicians become more experienced in managing these side effects.) Defining nonresponsive disease in individual patients is difficult, because unfortunately patients can continue to experience relapses after initiation of disease-modifying therapy with beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate. Comparison of pre- and post-treatment relapse rates is fraught with problems, and it is often difficult to identify whether an individual patient is responsive to therapy. At a minimum, a patient's level of neurological impairment and disability should remain stable on therapy. Persistent gadolinium-enhancing or T2 lesion accrual should be considered a worrisome feature, even in the absence of clinical evidence of activity or worsening. Finally, neutralizing antibodies, which can interfere with the effects of interferons, appear in up to 20 percent of patients after two years of beta-interferon treatment. They do not appear to be an issue with glatiramer acetate. Increased neutralizing antibodies appear to be associated with reduced clinical benefit, although there is still some controversy about this point. For example, it is still not known what levels of neutralizing antibodies are clinically significant, how often they persist, and what is the most reliable method of measuring them. More research is needed on testing for neutralizing antibodies in MS patients treated with beta-interferons and how to best use the results to properly manage patient treatment.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Disease-modifying therapies are expensive, costing roughly $8,000 to $10,000 (U.S.) per year. Several studies have indicated that their costs outweigh their benefits, but these analyses have been heavily criticized. Forbes and colleagues argued that it is not cost-effective to treat progressive MS patients with interferon beta-1b in Britain and that the money spent on interferon beta-1b would be better spent on other services, such as supportive care and simple interventions to reduce the burden of patients' symptoms. Analyses of cost-effectiveness of medical treatment often use quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to measure health benefits (see ). The estimated costs of beta-interferon treatment per gain in QALY for relapsing-remitting MS range from 809,000 British pounds ($1,140,000 U.S.) to 2,038,400 British pounds ($2,870,000 U.S.). The estimates are considerably lower in Canada (406,000 to 490,000 Canadian dollars, or $270,000-$330,000 U.S.). For secondary progressive MS, the estimated costs of beta-interferon treatment per gain in QALY range from 874,600 British pounds ($1,230,000 U.S.) to 1,024,000 British pounds ($1,440,000 U.S.). While disease-related expenditures are relatively easy to calculate, the benefits of these expenditures are not so easy to calculate, particu- Quality-adjusted life-years are a health status measure that includes both quantity and quality of life in a single outcome measure. Multiplying life expectancy by a quality-of-life adjustment fraction, or utility, results in a QALY value. Utilities represent the level of quality or value associated with a particular health state, and range in value from 0, representing death, to 1, representing optimal health. Utilities are determined in two ways: by researchers through literature searches for previously conducted utility studies or by direct measurement of utility values based on the assessment of people's values for different levels of health. The use of QALYs for resource allocation has been widely criticized as discriminatory against the elderly and the disabled by placing less value on extending their lives due to the lower potential for health status improvement. The determination of utility values that accurately reflect the many ways quality of life can be affected is difficult in part because one of the underlying assumptions of QALYs— that the severity of a disease state or disability and the corresponding value represent a fixed quantity—is unlikely to be true. The effect of health status on quality of life depends in large part on an individual's unique perspective. Although the use of QALYs is one of the current standards for such evaluations, it is a crude attempt to express a qualitative, subjective reality in quantitative terms and has been criticized as being of limited value in this respect. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. larly in long-term diseases where treatments might slow the progress of disease, but neither cure it nor restore impaired functions. In addition to the limitations inherent in the use of QALYs, there are other problems with the conclusion that disease-modifying therapies are not cost-effective. The studies done to date have been criticized for using poor economic methodology in interpreting the data. In a year 2000 review of immunomodulatory drugs used to treat MS, the British National Health Service committee on health technology assessment concluded that the cost-effectiveness of these drugs is simply not known. The committee cited a lack of quality clinical trials for each drug, including methodological limitations, poor reporting of data, small sample sizes, short duration, inconsistent treatment regimes and outcome measures, and uncertainty about the clinical significance of reported benefits. The latter criticism might, however, change. New data about these drugs are emerging at such a rapid pace that conclusions about their benefits should be reconsidered as new data from clinical trials become available. In general, cost-effectiveness analysis should be considered skeptically. Cost-effectiveness is a highly politicized issue in which economic principles are often misapplied. Indeed, the United States health care system often favors economically inefficient delivery of some products—for example, liver transplants—in that health care providers are willing to underwrite additional costs to gain market share. Further, cross-national comparisons have little merit because of differences in national health care systems, as well as other economic and social factors. Finally, although economic analysis reveals important financial trade-offs, all societies hold certain social values that outweigh economic considerations. For many people, the health and well-being of their loved ones and themselves is among the deepest of these values. Ultimately, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying MS will have to be better understood to design rational therapies. Physiology of Myelin and Axons: Normal Function, Demyelination, and Repair The integrative activity of the nervous system, which underlies motor, sensory, cognitive, and psychological behavior, depends on electrical signaling between neurons. Each neuron encodes its message in the form of action potentials (small all-or-none electrical impulses) that are carried to other neurons via axons, the cable-like fibers that extend from neuron cell bodies. Many axons within the brain and spinal cord are myelinated. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The myelin sheath provides a high-resistance, low-capacitance insulator that increases the reliability and speed of action potentials conducted along axon fibers. Myelin is what makes the white matter of brain white. It is a multilayered sheath formed by the oligodendroglial cells, or oligodendrocytes, that insulate axons ( ). Each segment of the myelin sheath surrounds the axon in a segmented fashion, with segments (called internodes) periodically interrupted at nodes of Ranvier. The internodal axon is normally surrounded by myelin sheaths whose thicknesses are related to the caliber of the ensheathed axon. In normal Oligodendrocyte making myelin. The processes of a given oligodendrocyte wrap themselves around portions of the surrounding axons. As each process wraps itself around, it forms layers of myelin. Each process thus becomes a segment of the axon's myelin sheath. SOURCE: National Institutes of Health Office of Science Education. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. myelinated fibers, the action potential does not travel in a continuous manner. On the contrary, it jumps from one node of Ranvier to the next, in a manner known as “saltatory” (derived from the Latin word for “jumping”). Saltatory conduction is a rapid process, with the impulse taking only 20 one-thousandths of a second to jump from one node of Ranvier to the next; as a result, myelinated fibers conduct impulses with a high velocity. Significantly, voltage-dependent sodium channels are clustered at the nodes of Ranvier but are relatively more scarce in the internodal axonal membrane. In contrast, potassium channels, which exist in low density at nodes, are more abundant in the internodal and paranodal axonal membrane, under the myelin sheath. Therefore, loss of the myelin sheath exposes relatively inexcitable axonal membranes; the consequence is that nerve impulses are conducted more slowly or not at all. Axonal Conduction Is Impaired in Demyelinated Axons Following damage to the myelin, conduction velocity is reduced, and conduction slows along the demyelinated axon ( ). Studies using evoked potentials to examine human subjects with MS have demonstrated that this slowing of conduction does not, in itself, necessarily produce clinical deficits. In addition, however, conduction failure can occur in demyelinated axons. When conduction failure occurs, the axon potential is not propagated from one end of the fiber to the other, and information is lost. This produces a clinical deficit. Conduction failure in demyelinated axons is now known to result not only from loss of the insulating myelin, but also from the molecular organization of the axon membrane. Following damage to the myelin, internodal parts of the axon membrane (which had previously been covered by myelin) are uncovered. Myelinated Axons Exhibit Complex Molecular Architecture Prior to the last decade, axonal dysfunction in demyelinating diseases was considered to be due entirely to the loss of the myelin insulation. According to this schema, after the myelin is damaged, there is a “short circuit,” and impulse conduction is slowed or fails. It is now known that although the schema described above is partially correct, it is not the whole story. The axon itself exhibits an elegant molecular architecture, and following damage to the myelin, this architecture is disrupted. The molecular architecture of the axon is manifest by the placement of specialized protein molecules, called ion channels, within the membrane of the axon. Sodium channels act as tiny molecular batteries, which produce the depolarization that is necessary for the generation of action potentials. In contrast, potassium channels act as molecular brakes, damping electrical activity. Within myelinated axons, these two types of ion channels have a complementary structure. Sodium channels are clustered in high density in the axon membrane at small gaps in the myelin called nodes of Ranvier, where they support the produc- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Their numbers there are too low to support secure conduction, which contributes to conduction failure. Potassium channels, on the other hand, tend to be located in the internodal parts of the axon membrane, beneath the myelin sheath; as a result of this, they are masked by the Pathogenesis. Current concept of pathogenesis of neurological dysfunction associated with acute multiple sclerosis lesion in relapsing-remitting MS patient. Normal myelinated fibers (A) are demyelinated by inflammatory process (B), which causes conduction block.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. overlying myelin in normal myelinated fibers. The unmasking of potassium channels by demyelination thus introduces another factor that tends to interfere with the conduction of action potentials. Molecular Plasticity in Demyelinated Axons Underlies Restoration of Impulse Conduction Given that impulse conduction fails in demyelinated axons and that this contributes to clinical deficits, how do remissions occur? It is now clear that demyelinated axons possess a remarkable capability to rebuild themselves at the molecular level. In the weeks following demyelination, demyelinated axons acquire, within regions where myelin has been lost, a density of sodium channels that is high enough to support action potential conduction even in the absence of insulating myelin. The demyelinated nerve fibers insert additional amplifiers (sodium channels) in their membranes so that they are able to conduct action potentials reliably even though there is a short circuit. This is a striking example of neuronal plasticity, in this case at the molecular level. Although this molecular plasticity has been clearly demonstrated in laboratory experiments, a number of important questions remain: How do neurons “know” that their axons have been demyelinated and that there is a need to activate the machinery for synthesis of sodium channels? How do neurons control the synthesis and deployment of sodium channels? What turns on the genes for sodium channels and ensures that the correct types of sodium channels (there are nearly a dozen different types, which are like different types of batteries) are produced following demyelination? Also, how are sodium channels transported and inserted into the correct parts of the axon membrane so that they can function normally? These questions have important therapeutic implications and are currently under study. The presence of axonal degeneration in MS was recognized even in the early descriptions of this disease, but its presence has recently been reemphasized (). Axonal transection might be the structural basis for acquisition of permanent (nonremitting) neurological deficits, making it an especially important part of the pathology of MS. A corollary of this proposition would be that neuroprotective interventions that limit axonal injury should prevent, or at least lessen, the acquisition of new, permanent signs and symptoms in MS. As a step toward the development of neuroprotective strategies in MS, it will be important to delineate the mechanisms that underlie axonal injury in this disorder. Is it a consequence of demyelination? Alternatively, is the axonal damage a by-product of the inflammatory or immune processes involved in triggering demyelination? What is the nature of the “injury cascade” that leads from the ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. initial insult to ultimate degeneration of axons in MS? Understanding the pathogenesis of the process might lead to the development of new therapeutic targets for MS. These questions are being approached in models of other neurological diseases such as trauma and cerebrovascular disease, including stroke, and should be actively pursued in MS research as well. Axonal transection during inflammatory demyelination. According to this schema, axonal transection during (A) is a consistent feature of inflammatory demyelinating lesions. This results in degeneration of the distal axonal segment (B) and irreversible loss of neuronal function. During the relapsing-remitting course of multiple sclerosis (RR-MS), the CNS compensates for axonal destruction. Axonal degeneration as a result of chronic demyelination. This model posits that axonal viability depends upon oligodendrocyte-derived trophic effect. Chronically demyelinated axons (A) may undergo nerve transection (B) or wallerian degeneration (C), which are caused by lack of myelin trophic support. Axonal transection and degeneration.

MS is defined as a demyelinating disease because the myelin sheaths and their parent cells, the oligodendroglia, are major targets of immune-mediated damage (). The classical lesions are discrete plaques of demyelination, which, depending on disease stage, are associated with varying evidence of inflammation. The clinical signs, which are episodic and are not clinically predictable, are presumably related to the location of the lesions, although clinically “silent” demyelinating lesions also occur. These predominantly white matter lesions occur in multiple brain regions and appear at different times throughout the disease. Common syndromes correlated with lesions in specific areas include visual deficits, weakness and spasticity, eye movement abnormalities, and ataxia (). Lesions are often described as active or chronic, depending on whether there are signs of active inflammation, usually associated with ongoing demyelination, or whether the lesion is stable and does not show signs of inflammatory activity. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier that normally insulates the brain from pathogenic blood-borne substances is an early event in the development of MS lesions (). Antigen-specific T cells enter the nervous system, and when they encounter and recognize their specific antigen, a cascade of cytokine expression begins that contributes to the damage of the blood-brain barrier. This can be detected on contrast-enhanced MRI. Examination of active demyelinating lesions in autopsy cases of MS reveals structural and immunopathological abnormalities related to demyelination and abnormalities of oligodendrocytes. The inflammatory response is dominated by lymphocytes and macrophages, but the data on the relative numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells are still not settled. A plaque is characterized by loss of myelin sheath and infiltration by macrophages (which show myelin basic protein and myelin-associated glycoprotein immunoreactivities).

Clinical Pathological Correlations in Common Syndromes of MS Often related to the involvement of the optic nerve as occurs in optic neuritis Frequently associated with plaques involving connections between the brainstem nuclei subserving eye movements One of the consequences of lesions involving the spinal cord or descending motor tracts in the white matter of internal capsule or brainstem Usually the result of lesions in cerebellum or its input-output pathways inflammatory responses amplify, macrophages are filled with lipids, myelin damage occurs, and there is apparently some collateral damage to axons. Scattered B cells and plasma cells are also sometimes associated with these lesions. Immunocytochemical analysis has suggested that there may be leakage of immunoglobulins and complement from vessels at the margins of active plaques. There is evidence for upregulation of a variety of cytokines within MS plaques including various interleukins (IL-1, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 12); beta-interferon; tumor necrosis factor (TNF); and transforming growth factor (TGF). Cytokines are intercellular signaling proteins produced by cells of the immune system and CNS. Their involvement in any disease is complex. They can initiate, sustain, or terminate various aspects of disease processes and are particularly involved in inflammatory responses. Specific chemokine receptors are expressed by infiltrating cells in demyelinating MS brain lesions and in CSF. These results imply pathogenic roles for specific chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions in MS and suggest new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Some investigators have emphasized that the pattern of pathology suggests a dying-back oligodendrogliopathy (those parts of the cell, such as the most distal process, farthest from the cell body are the most vulnerable). During the active stages of disease, the number of oligodendrocytes can be reduced near the demyelinating foci. Subsequently, there might be partial recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursors that may, in part, repopulate the margins of the plaque and contribute to remyelination. Trapp and colleagues have emphasized that the relapsing-remitting course is intimately related to the inflammatory demyelination and classical plaques, while more chronic progressive forms of the disease are linked to transection, or severing, of axons at sites of inflammation and demyelination. They have shown that severed axons were a consistent component in the lesions of individuals with MS and suggest that the number of these injured axons is correlated to the magnitude of the inflammation within the lesion. Axonal damage might be a pathological correlate of irreversible neurological deficits that occur in patients with progressive MS. In individuals with chronic MS, plaques are often sharply demarcated with scattered lipid-containing macrophages and little evidence of ongoing myelin destruction. Demyelination can be incomplete. The density of axons may be significantly reduced. There is usually astrogliosis within these lesions. It is not clear exactly how the axonal damage that occurs at later stages plays into this complex evolving pathology, but the extent of axonal damage appears to be a critical determinant of whether a person recovers from an attack or not. Lack of recovery from attacks and disease progression are more likely when axons are more severely damaged and repair mechanisms fail. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

The tight seal of the cells lining the blood vessels forms a blood-brain barrier that keeps many substances out of the brain. Leaky blood vessels in the body allow many molecules to cross through to other tissues, but the tight construction of the vessels in the head guards against entry of most molecules into the brain. Normally, only certain molecules, for example, blood gases such as oxygen and small nutritional molecules, can cross the blood-brain barrier, but this barrier breaks down when the brain is injured or in certain diseases, such as MS.

A correlation between demyelination and axonal degeneration observed at autopsy is supported by imaging studies, including those that compare the concentrations of -acetyl aspartate. For example, one study measured the levels of NAA, an amino acid found only in neurons that serves as a biological marker for integrity of the axon and neuronal cell body. The brains of MS patients showed significantly greater side-to-side differences in levels of NAA, indicating decreased neuronal integrity on the side of the brain with lower NAA levels. There was a correlation between this asymmetry in motor function and the asymmetry of NAA concentrations in the internal capsule. Insights into processes that lead to demyelination and axon damage can be obtained by analyzing T1-weighted image hypointensities, proton spectroscopy, MTI, and DTI and by correlating these measures with clinical and pathological findings. Gliosis is a prominent feature of the MS lesion, but it is best regarded as a secondary phenomenon. Whenever the CNS is damaged, it undergoes an injury response, usually called reactive gliosis or glial scarring. The response is broadly the same whatever the source of injury, although the details vary somewhat with different types of pathology. The glial reaction to injury includes recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, stem cells, microglia, and astrocytes. Formation of the glial scar after CNS injury generally occurs over a period of weeks. Microglia are typically the first cell types to enter the lesion. In the normal brain, they are quiescent with short, branched processes. Following injury, they exhibit various changes, including activation, cell division, and migration to the injury site. During activation, microglia display conspicuous functional plasticity, which involves changes in cell morphology, cell surface receptor expression, and production of growth factors and cytokines, and they become, in general, more macrophage like. Microglia can be either neurotoxic or neurotrophic. The final glial scar is made up mainly of a meshwork of tightly interwoven astrocyte processes, attached to one another by tight junctions and gap junctions and surrounded by extracellular matrix (reviewed in 1999 by Fawcett and Asher). (Astrocytes are irregularly star-shaped, background structural cells of the nervous system.) Gliosis is usually restricted to the area of demyelination, but it sometimes extends beyond that area. There is no specific way to identify the presence and extent of gliosis in MS lesions through MRI, although the T1 signal might be more sensitive to gliosis than the T2 signal. The role of astrocytes in gliosis is not completely known. Since there is evidence that glial scars can inhibit both axon growth and myelination, it is clearly important to know what causes them to form, what cells are involved, why they are inhibitory, and how to manipulate them. Finally, although gliosis is generally considered harmful, there is also evidence that the gliotic ensheathment of demyelinated axons might favor the restoration of nerve conduction.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The relapsing-remitting form of MS appears to be related to the demyelination of axons during relapses, followed by the remodeling and remyelination with consequent restoration of conduction that underlies remission. Remyelination is carried out by surviving oligodendrocytes or by the proliferation of progenitor cells that are then stimulated to become oligodendrocytes. Molecular remodeling of demyelinated axons, in terms of their redistributing their sodium channels along the axon, might act as a form of adaptive plasticity; this process may represent a target for future therapies. In contrast, the progressive form of the disease, which appears clinically as an unremitting accumulation of deficits, might reflect the superimposition of axonal injury or degeneration on multiple chronic foci of demyelinated axons. The finding that axonal damage can occur frequently in MS and the suggestion that these lesions contribute to persistent neurological deficits are important issues in MS research. Thus, it will be important to understand the mechanisms whereby axons are damaged and to define ways of protecting axons, which may be vulnerable to degeneration, in part due to their proximity to inflammatory and demyelinating foci. It will also be important to search for molecules that promote the regrowth of injured axons to their appropriate targets. Some of the lessons from studies of the repair of spinal cord injury are likely to be relevant here. Moreover, because abnormal patterns of ion channels have been found within neurons whose axons are undergoing demyelination, it will be important to understand the factors that influence the regulation of these channels. These lines of research, involving strategies can restore conduction in demyelinated axons represent opportunities to restore that protect axons from degeneration or promote repair, and those agents that functions and could have significant implications for therapy. Similarly, future therapeutic approaches might involve replacement of oligodendroglia with pluripotent stem cells (discussed further in ). Progenitor cells, those either already present in an individual or provided from another source by injection, can produce myelin in demyelinated foci in experimental animals. Future experimental therapeutics will involve approaches directed at restoring oligodendrocytes to ensheath axonal processes and to induce physiological modeling of axons to restore conduction. The most striking pathology in MS is the immune system's attack and destruction of the body's own myelin sheath, which is why it is believed to be an autoimmune disease, although this has not yet been definitively proven (). The pathogenic trigger that first causes the immune system to attack myelin is unknown, but the immunopathology, or pathological activity of the immune system, that ensues after that initial attack is becoming clearer. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The immune system defends the body against foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. It does so by recognizing that foreign invaders have special markers distinguishing them as “non-self,” compared to the body's own tissue (or “self”) (). Normally, the immune system reacts only to non-self invaders, not to its own tissues. Unfortunately, this process is not foolproof. Autoimmunity is an immune response mounted against antigens that are naturally produced within the body, or self-antigens, to cause lasting tissue damage. In the strictest sense, an autoimmune disease must meet several criteria. First, the disease must be reproduced by transfer of autoantibodies or autoreactive T lymphocytes (T cells) from affected to unaffected individuals. Second, the self-antigen that elicits the immune attack must be identified. Third, this antigen (or a closely related one) should cause a similar disease in an animal model. (Scientifically, it would be best to show that the antigen caused the disease in humans, but it would be unethical to intentionally infect humans, hence, the compromise for evidence in animals). It is now feasible to transfer human genes into animals in an attempt to satisfy these criteria. One of the first so-called transgenic studies that introduced certain human genes into an animal without MS led to the development of a disease resembling MS. Among the newly added genes were those for a specific type of histocompatibility antigen and for a particular type of T-cell receptor that binds to a fragment of a myelin protein (myelin basic protein). This type of study begins to confirm the autoimmune nature of MS. Human autoimmune diseases, however, are generally classified as such without meeting these three stringent criteria. Circumstantial evidence often is marshaled for classification. For example, patients are classified as having autoimmune disease if they have high levels of autoantibody or autoreactive T cells, or because there is a correlation between the level of immune activity and disease severity. Some examples of autoimmune diseases are listed in . Why does the immune system have autoreactive lymphocytes? During development, the immune system randomly builds a vast repertoire of cells that respond to a multitude of foreign antigens. At the same time, the immune system must weed out those cells that react to self-antigens. Most self-reactive B cells and T cells are removed early during development. Other regulatory mechanisms exist to keep self-reactive lymphocytes unresponsive later on. These are among the normal regulatory mechanisms resulting in immunological tolerance to most self-antigens. Even though there are usually small numbers of autoreactive lymphocytes in a normal adult, most do not cause disease, and some might even serve a (currently unknown) beneficial purpose. With autoimmune disease, however, there are large numbers of autoreactive immune cells. Autoimmune disease thus can be thought of as a failure of normal regulatory mechanisms that guard against autoimmunity. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The causes of autoimmune response in MS and most other autoimmune diseases are unknown but likely include a combination of genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental agents. For most autoimmune diseases, the actual genes and environmental agents are unknown. Gender also plays a role because women are disproportionately affected by autoimmune disease. The reasons for the gender difference are also unknown but appear to relate to distinct immune environments in women and How can genes and environment trigger autoimmune pathology? Genes control many properties of the immune system. Theoretically, autoimmune disease can occur if any of the genes controlling the immune system's ability to distinguish self from non-self are defective. The genes often suspected of predisposing to autoimmune disease encode proteins, such as histocompatibility antigens, that participate in this complex process of self versus non-self recognition. Environmental or infectious agents can stimulate pathological autoimmune reactions through at least two possible mechanisms: molecular mimicry, superantigens, and bystander damage (). Molecular mimicry occurs when a bacterial or viral epitope—the fragment of an antigen that elicits an immune response—is very similar to a self-epitope. This can occur following an infection where an immune cell targeting an epitope on a bacterium subsequently cross-reacts with a self-antigen. Superantigens are proteins from bacteria or retroviruses that lead to widespread activation of T cells. Unlike most antigens, which activate only a specific T cell, superantigens activate approximately one out of every ten T cells. Because of their generic ability to activate so many types of T cells, superantigens may inadvertently activate autoreactive T cells, which then attack self-tissues. In bystander damage, a virus upregulates a nonspecific immune response that then leads to pathology; for example, proinflammatory cytokines might activate Th1 cells or macrophages that contribute to the immunopathology. Once damage occurs, new cellular epitopes become exposed and trigger an immune response in a process called epitope spreading, which can also lead to autoimmune pathology. During an immune response against a particular epitope, the number of lymphocytes that recognize the epitope normally multiplies. Yet, in epitope spreading, the immune response escalates to target other epitopes on the same antigen or on related antigens. In this way, an initially nonpathological autoimmune response expands to produce a pathological response. The underlying basis for epitope spreading in autoimmune diseases is poorly understood. Another way to produce a pathological autoimmune response is for autoreactive lymphocytes to gain access to a target antigen from which they are ordinarily separated. The brain is one example of an anatomical sanctuary site, because it is protected by the blood-brain barrier of the central nervous system. Normally, T cells that might react against myelin do not pass across this barrier into the central nervous system. In MS, however, T cells become activated, which enables them to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and reach their targets—myelin antigens—thereby generating an autoimmune response. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. One of the first pathological processes leading up to MS attacks is thought to be activation of autoreactive T lymphocytes, or T cells, and their migration into the central nervous system. However, T cells and the inflammatory molecules they secrete are not the only players. Many cells and molecules of the immune system—likely unleashed by T-cell activation—participate in demyeli- Interactions between major cell components of the immune system. This simplified outline shows interactions that occur in response to a foreign antigen. The antigen could be an epitope from a virus particle, bacterium, or other foreign agent. The antigen-presenting cell (APC) ingests the antigen (or in the case of an infecting virus, it may already be within the cell) and processes it into peptide fragments. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC, the cell surface structure characteristic of each individual) presents this target to a resting T cell. Binding of the peptide-MHC complex by the T-cell receptor activates the T cell. In the case of a CD8+ cell, it becomes a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), which will destroy any cells that have the same peptide-MHC complex on their surfaces. In the case of a CD4+ cell, the activated cell produces and secretes various cytokines that recruit and activate nonspecific effector cells (such as macrophages) or stimulate antigen-bound B cells to produce antibodies. When T and B lymphocytes are activated by a specific antigen, they undergo proliferation, producing more cells with their same antigen specificity. This serves to amplify the immune response against the foreign antigen. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001.

Although no virus has yet been shown to contribute to the etiology of MS, there are several ways in which this could occur, and one of these is shown in this figure. Activated T cells cross the blood-brain barrier following activation by a microbe with a structural similarity to a component of the myelin sheath. Once inside the brain, these cells attack self-antigens, such as the various myelin proteins that are attacked in MS. NOTE: MBP = myelin basic protein. SOURCE: Steinman and Oldstone, 1997.

The key features of this cascade are not fully understood, including the precise ordering of events, the antigens targeted by T cells, and the contributions of B lymphocytes, or B cells, and other cells of the immune system. Yet, as this section explains, much insight has been gained into the immunopathology of MS. This knowledge has been—and continues to be—fundamental for devising therapies targeted to the immunopathology of MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. As much as a century ago, researchers observed that T cells were particularly abundant in MS lesions. Over time, using modern immunologic techniques, they managed to isolate and characterize a particular type of T cell, the autoreactive T cell, from the blood and CSF of MS patients. These and related findings gave credence to the hypothesis that autoreactive T cells played a dominant role in MS. After all, immunologists have long known that T cells are capable of orchestrating a multifaceted autoimmune attack. However, this was not enough to explain MS pathology. First, elevations in certain types of autoreactive T cells were not unique to MS patients. Second, and more critically, T cells were necessary but not sufficient to cause demyelinating disease in animal models. The transfer of myelin-specific T cells into normal animals initiated only inflammation, not demyelination. This suggested that other immune cells, particularly antibody-producing B cells () and macrophages, might also play key roles, even if autoreactive T cells launched the process.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The prime autoantigen that elicits the autoimmune response in MS is not known. While there are many candidate autoantigens, as yet none is preeminent. Much MS research focused on myelin basic protein (MBP), located at the inner surface of the myelin membrane. Clinical studies were shaped by research on experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the classic animal model of demyelinating disease. In many species, MBP acts as a classical encephalitogenic autoantigen (an antigen capable of serving as the focus of an inflammatory attack in the brain). EAE research further established that in some strains of mice and rats, the autoimmune response to MBP displays two unique features. First, in the initial stages of the immune response in EAE, T cells react only to very small regions of the MBP molecule (“epitope dominance”), even though they later react to many more regions of the molecule (“epitope spreading”) (see ). Second, the encephalitogenic T cells in EAE use an unusually narrow repertoire of genes for their antigen receptors. (T cells recognize their target antigen by its capacity to bind to specific receptors on their surface membrane, called T-cell receptors [TCRs]). These two features raised hopes for developing immune-based therapies because a more limited range of therapies might succeed in combating MS in early stages. Unfortunately, these features turned out to be much less prominent in humans with MS. First, human T cells respond to a broader set of MBP epitopes. While there might be a relatively dominant epitope in the central portion of the MBP molecule, there are clearly many other target epitopes along the full sequence of this large polypeptide. Second, MBP-specific T cells use multiple genes for their TCRs, which allows for large variability among individuals. Generally, it appears that the T-cell response against myelin proteins differs greatly between individual patients, a property that suggests the potential need for individually designed immune therapies. Several research teams have attempted to identify MBP-specific T cells in MS patients. Unfortunately, these attempts did not show significant increases in MBP-specific T-cell counts in MS patients compared to healthy blood donors. However, when more definitive assay systems were used, increased frequencies of activated MBP-specific T cells were found in MS patients. These studies relied on complex methods and were influenced by numerous factors that complicate the interpretation of results. More direct assays, such as those that use binding of oligomeric class II-peptide complexes to specific T cells, might resolve the problem. To add a further degree of complexity, MBP does not appear to be the only autoantigen in MS: there are a number of additional myelin and nonmyelin proteins that are potential autoantigens in MS. Earlier hypotheses had implicated MBP on the basis of two lines of research. First, studies of EAE had suggested that MBP was indeed the most important, if not the only, encephalitogenic myelin autoantigen. Second, due to its particularly convenient molecular properties, MBP was the only myelin protein available both at high purity and in large ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. quantities. However, thanks to modern biotechnology, even minor myelin proteins are now available in large quantities and can be studied for their encephalitogenic capacity. Later studies established that many, if not all, myelin proteins are potentially encephalitogenic. Especially interesting among these newly recognized autoantigens is myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). In contrast to MBP, which lies on the inside of the myelin sheath, MOG lies on the surface. As one of the few myelin proteins accessible to humoral autoantibodies, MOG is a target for demyelinating immunoglobulins (see next section). In addition, MOG is a very effective autoantigen in rodents and in primates for encephalitogenic T cells. Some studies even demonstrated increased frequencies of MOG-reactive T cells in MS patients. These findings clearly warrant general confirmation. It is also important to investigate whether different subtypes of MS, which are distinguished by divergent clinical, genetic, and morphological features, are associated with enhanced T-cell responses against different target autoantigens. Thus far, research has spotlighted one class of T cells—those with a TCR termed Î±Î². Î±Î² T cells are the major class of immune cells centrally involved in adaptive immune responses against infections and tumors. Much less attention has been given to other T-cell classes (Î³Î´ T cells and NK1 T cells), which may function both as effector cells in autoimmune attacks and as suppressor cells that dampen autoimmune responses. There are reports linking the presence of Î³Î´ T cells in the brain (presumably) with the induction of heat shock proteins in MS lesions. Certain members of this broad class of proteins are a normal component of the myelin sheath, yet they are also found outside the CNS as well as in pathogens. The role of heat shock proteins in the development of the MS lesion is unknown, but there are various possibilities. Some of these proteins might act as a target autoantigen, as has been shown in autoimmune diabetes. They might also reflect inflammatory stress inflicted on local CNS cells, or they might be determinants of beneficial anti-inflammatory control mechanisms. Even though the precise pathological roles of T cells and their autoantigens are unresolved, this line of research has generated many approved or emerging therapies. These include vaccination strategies, which use either attenuated myelinspecific T cells or peptides representing myelin-specific T-cell receptors as vaccines to strengthen the body's own regulatory responses against pathogenic T cells (reviewed in Zhang et. al., 1998). Also under development are “altered peptide” therapies that use peptide analogues of myelin protein segments to induce autoreactive T cells to produce protective, rather than pathogenic, cytokine mediators. Cytokines, as discussed later, are a functionally diverse set of signaling molecules produced by T cells. *Each (Î± and Î²) refers to a polypeptide chain that forms the T-cell receptor. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. B cells (also known as B lymphocytes) have been detected in MS lesions for many years, although less consistently than T cells. While most MS research naturally focused on T cells, evidence also has accumulated for participation by autoreactive B cells. It now appears that both types of lymphocytes actively contribute to MS immunopathology. Autoreactive T cells are thought to launch inflammation and, through their release of cytokines, to stimulate B cells to secrete antibodies that cause demyelination. This is consistent with animal studies finding that EAE can be produced only by injecting myelin-specific T cells in combination with myelin-specific antibodies. Without injecting the antibodies, demyelination does not occur. In MS patients, levels in cerebrospinal fluid of the type of protein known to consist of antibodies (immunoglobulin) are often higher than in healthy people. The increased immunoglobulin is due to production by only a few different clones of B cells that have been induced to proliferate. B cells from the CSF of MS patients have been reported to contain mutations in the DNA sequences that encode antibodies, which is consistent with the notion of an antigen-driven selection of antibodies with high-affinity antigen-binding sites. Such events are commonly observed in immune responses against foreign antigens such as bacterial infections, as well as in humoral autoimmune responses. However, no foreign antigen or autoantigen responsible for the generation of oligoclonal bands in MS has yet been identified. One recent study using sophisticated immunocytochemistry furnished direct evidence of a pathologic role for autoantibodies. For the first time, MOG-specific antibodies were demonstrated to be bound to myelin debris in active MS lesions. If confirmed and extended to a larger group of patients, this finding would suggest that B-cell-derived autoantibodies might induce myelin destruction. On the other hand, although anti-MOG antibodies are found in the CSF of MS patients, they are also found in CSF of patients with other neurological diseases that are not demyelinating. Thus, despite tantalizing leads, the role of anti-MOG antibodies in MS patients is still unclear. Cytokines are soluble proteins produced and released by T cells, macrophages, and certain other cell types. Interferons (IFN- Î±, Î², and Î³), interleukins (including IL- 1, 4, 6, 10, 12, and 13), TGF-b, and the neuropoietic cytokines (such as ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor) are all different types of cytokines. They generally act as intercellular signaling molecules that regulate *Neuropoietic cytokines are the family of neural growth factors that act on both the nervous and the hematopoietic or immune systems.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. and carry out immune functions, but their repertoire is complex. Some function as pro-inflammatory, others as anti-inflammatory agents. Some even have divergent functions during different phases of disease. Cytokines, including the subset known as chemokines (for ), also alter the permeability of the blood-brain barrier or act on neural cells. Thus, particular cytokines can initiate, sustain, or terminate inflammatory disease processes. Proinflammatory cytokines and other secretory products of immune cells are proposed in several neurological diseases—including MS—to be toxic to neurons and oligodendrocytes if they are secreted in sufficiently high concentrations over a sustained period of time. In MS, the initial entry of autoreactive T cells into the CNS is thought to trigger the local production of cytokines and chemokines, which in turn begins the inflammatory process and enhances the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. A more permeable blood-brain barrier allows infiltration into the CNS of more immune cells which in turn contribute to the ongoing inflammation. Thus, understanding the roles of cytokines and their temporal sequence of activation is crucial to modifying the course of MS. Much of our present understanding of cytokine action in demyelinating disease comes from studies of animal models, including EAE. A large body of research is being compiled on the expression and possible function of cytokines as pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in MS. Some studies have used in situ immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization to visualize gene expression in lesions, whereas others have relied on the activation of inflammatory cells (T cells, B cells, macrophages) in vitro. Much of the research is comparing material from MS patients with or without treatment with immunomodulatory agents, especially glatiramer acetate and beta-interferon. Pro-inflammatory cytokines within active MS lesions have been localized to both infiltrating immune cells and glia. Longitudinal studies have linked clinical exacerbation and remission to high and low expression, respectively, of proinflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-Î³. For example, secretion of TNF-Î³ and cell adhesion molecules by inflammatory cells is upregulated immediately prior to relapse. Yet, not all findings could be verified in all patient groups studied. Understanding of cytokines and their diverse roles throughout the course of disease, although still incomplete, has nevertheless spawned new treatments. One explanation for the success of glatiramer acetate and beta-interferon relates to their control over cytokine expression: they can induce T cells to switch from a pro-inflammatory phenotype (Th1) to an anti-inflammatory phenotype (Th2). T cells that are switched to an anti-inflammatory phenotype release a variety of cytokines, such as IL-10, that reduce inflammation. CNS. CNS tissues were traditionally thought to be exempt from active immune reactivity, but it is now known ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. that the brain is subject to immune surveillance and can be the site of immune responses. Only activated and not resting T cells can cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with local CNS cells. Local glial cells can be stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines to express immunologically active molecules, such as the major histocompatability complex (MHC) products, cytokines, and chemokines required for local immune responses. Neurons are capable of suppressing immune responses within the CNS. Thus, immune responses are more likely to occur in areas of neuronal degeneration than in intact CNS tissues. Immune reactivity within the CNS must hence be viewed as the balance between the proinflammatory signals contributed by activated T cells and other inflammatory cells entering the brain and the anti-inflammatory signals from functional neurons. Epidemiologists define what causes a disease and what puts an individual at risk of getting this disease. They look for correlations such as whether Caucasians are more likely to have MS than Asians or whether residents of one county are more likely to get MS than residents of another. These correlations lead to hypotheses or working models as to which factors actually cause MS and which are only associated with it. These hypotheses or models can then be tested experimentally. Epidemiological studies have limitations, but for a complex disease like MS, they can rule out some factors and highlight others. They are the first step toward finding a biological mechanism for MS, or possibly a cure. Most epidemiological studies of MS have been observational and retrospective; researchers collected the information (for example, ethnicity, age of onset) from an individual (or from records) that had been diagnosed with MS. Such studies rely on an individual's ability to accurately recall information from years ago, for example, the infections that she or he had before the age of five. Other sources of data, such as death certificates, can contain incorrect information. Despite these shortcomings, a few factors consistently correlate with MS prevalence. Determining how these factors lead to an increased risk of MS has proven more difficult. The risk of MS increases with increasing distance from the equator. In the United States, this is seen as a gradient of risk, with higher risk in northern regions and a lower risk in the south. In Australia, the prevalence of MS increases similarly from lower, subequatorial latitudes to the more southerly latitudes. Studies on migrating populations, although inconclusive, offer tentative support for the hypothesis that environment influences MS risk. Individuals who have moved from a region with one risk level to a region with a higher or lower risk, in general, adopt the risk level of their new home. This is especially true for individuals moving from a low-risk to a high-risk area. Studies carried out in the 1960s and 1970s suggested that this geographical effect had a defined susceptibility period before age 15. Although these data still ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. appear in the MS literature and have led to several hypotheses about the effects of puberty or early dietary effects on MS risk, the sample numbers are too small to support such a tight cutoff. A later and larger study assayed the effects of migration by comparing location at birth with location at approximately 24 years of age. Although individuals did adopt the risk of their new home, the age values in that study are not precise enough to add to the argument for or against a cutoff. Most recently, a study comparing the prevalence of MS among native-born Australians and Australian immigrants from the United Kingdom (thereby providing a rough control for genetic background) suggests that rather than being established around age 15, environmental risk factors operate over many years and into early adulthood. Although the migrational studies suggest an environmental correlation with MS, the root cause of this latitude effect is unknown. Differences in diet or sunlight have been proposed, but neither has been supported by rigorous studies. Alternatively, the geographical distribution of MS could result from the migration either of a viral agent or of individuals (perhaps originally Scandinavians) who carried a pool of susceptible genes. Ethnicity is another definite risk factor. MS is more prevalent among Caucasians than other groups. In a study of 5,305 U.S. veterans with MS, Caucasian males had twice the risk of MS as African-American males. Other factors can modulate the effect of ethnicity on risk of MS. MS is almost absent among black Africans. African Americans, however, show a low risk of MS; this might be due to genetic mixing with Caucasian Americans or to an environmental effect. MS occurrence among Asians is also quite low. Again, Asian Americans show an intermediate risk for MS between Asians and Caucasian Americans. A discussion of the role of genetics in MS can be found in the next section. When applied to a complex disorder such as MS, conclusions derived from epidemiologic data of this type must be interpreted cautiously because inapparent explanations may be present. For example, a higher-than-expected incidence of MS observed in South Vietnamese immigrants (a low-risk group) residing in France (a moderate-risk area) superficially suggest a modifying role of the environment on MS. However, this immigrant population was in fact racially mixed and contained substantial numbers of individuals with mixed French and Asian ancestry. Thus, the higher-than-expected MS incidence in these immigrants could have been due to either genetic or environmental factors. Neither factor can be ruled out. A similar argument could explain the incidence of MS in West Indian immigrants residing in Great Britain. On the other hand, the increased incidence of MS observed in Japanese-Americans compared to individuals residing in Japan is not easily explained by racial admixture and does support a role of the environment on MS risk. As in other autoimmune diseases, women are much more likely to get MS than men, suggesting that hormonal or genetic factors are involved. The ratio of women to men with MS is about 2:1. Among both sexes, the age of onset for ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. MS ranges between 10 and 59 years, with the highest incidence occurring among individuals in their mid-20s to early 30s, depending on the population examined. Males tend to have a slightly later mean age of onset than females. This results, at least in part, from an increase in the percentage of males with the primary progressive variant. This form of MS has a later onset than other types and affects approximately 15 percent of patients. The ratio of males to females with primary progressive MS is approximately 1:1. Epidemiological studies have provided conflicting data as to whether an infectious agent (viral or bacterial) either causes or triggers MS. The occurrence of MS epidemics has suggested that an infectious agent might be at work. The two MS epidemics cited most often, one in the Faroe Islands and one in Iceland, were directly preceded by the influx of foreign troops during World War II. Both, however, are open to multiple interpretations. Coincident with the stationing of foreign soldiers, the population of the Faroe Islands received increased medical services and changed its diet. The Icelandic epidemic, on the other hand, began shortly after the arrival of that island's first neurologist. In both cases, the increased prevalence of MS might have resulted from an increased level of detection or a combination of other factors, such as nonspecific immune stimulation resulting from the introduction of a variety of infectious agents into previously unexposed populations. No infectious agent has been associated with either of these MS clusters. Another area of investigation has explored whether environmental factors contribute to the onset of MS or the probability of MS attacks. Some studies suggest that MS attacks are more likely to occur in the spring and fall than in the winter or summer. Such a finding, if true, suggests that a relationship exists between some viral infections and the risk of exacerbations. Many patients with MS are also at heightened risk for urinary tract, pulmonary, or skin infections, yet the relationship between these potentially preventable infections and the course of MS has never been adequately studied. Additional research in this area is needed. Perhaps the most clear-cut epidemiologic link to MS attacks is the effect of pregnancy and the postpartum period. Pregnancy is associated with a decrease in the risk for MS attacks, particularly during the third trimester. The postpartum period is, conversely, associated with a significant increase in risk. An immunosuppressive state in the pregnant mother is created by increased numbers of regulatory T cells (Th2 cells) which, presumably, dampen the autoimmune reaction that produces attacks of MS. The explanation for the increase in attack risk during the postpartum period is less clear but might involve immunostimulation by prolactin, the hormone responsible for milk production. The absence of supporting evidence does not prove that a virus is connected with the disease. Unrelated individuals (in the case of the adoptee and conjugal studies) may differ in their susceptibilities to infectious agents. Researchers have isolated a variety of viruses from individual MS patients, but to ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. date, no one virus has been isolated from all MS patients examined. It might, however, be the case either that MS is not one single disease or that there are multiple ways to trigger it. Researchers continue to look for causative infectious agents. (See section below on infectious causes of MS for further discussion.) The aggregation of MS in some geographic areas, ethnic populations, or families could be explained by a common environmental exposure, a shared genetic background, or a combination of both environmental and genetic susceptibility. It is likely that in MS, as in other complex disorders, both factors contribute. It is also possible that the relative contributions of environment versus genetics might vary in different situations, depending on the degree to which an individual is genetically susceptible and the specific environmental context. The role of genetic factors in MS is discussed in the next section. MS is not considered a genetic disease in the classic sense because it usually occurs sporadically. However, population and family studies are consistent with a principal pathogenic role for genetic risk factors in MS etiology. This genetic component is indicated primarily by the increased relative risk to siblings of affected individuals compared with the general population. Familial aggregation (Î»s) is measured by estimating the ratio of the prevalence (frequency) in siblings versus the population prevalence of the disease. A Î»s of 1 represents no familial clustering of the trait. For MS, the Î»s is estimated to be between 20 (0.02/0.001) and 40 (0.04/0.001). Half-sibling1 and adoption studies confirm that genetic, and not environmental, factors are responsible for familial aggregation. In addition, twin studies from different populations consistently indicate that a monozygotic twin of an MS patient is at higher risk (25 to 30 percent concordance) for MS than a dizygotic twin (2 to 5 percent), providing additional evidence for a significant but complex genetic etiology. Finally, the frequent occurrence of MS in some ethnic populations (particularly those of northern European origin) compared to others (African and Asian groups), irrespective of geographic location, also provides evidence for a complex genetic etiology. Overall, adoption and family studies suggest that being related to a person with MS is a greater risk factor than living with someone with MS. A simple genetic model for the inheritance of MS is unlikely to be valid. Such a single-gene hypothesis is at odds with concordance data in twin and family studies and with the observed nonlinear decrease in disease risk as the genetic distance from the relative with MS is increased. It is likely that susceptibility is determined by multiple independent genetic loci (polygenic inheritance), each with a relatively modest contribution to overall risk. It is also possible that there are different genetic causes of susceptibility to MS (genetic heterogeneity). Finally, the genes that contribute to MS susceptibility are likely to be normal, common variants (or alleles) of genes rather than obviously defective mutations. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Most individuals who carry such susceptibility genes would have no obvious deleterious consequences. For example, the DR2 gene (described below) is the most important genetic contributor to MS susceptibility identified to date. Approximately half of patients with MS have this gene, but so do 15 to 20 percent of healthy Caucasians. Thus, only approximately 1 in 250 people who have DR2 develop MS. The cumulative action of several susceptibility genes, each with weak effects and limited penetrance, is thought to underlie genetic susceptibility to MS. (Penetrance refers to the likelihood that a person carrying an allele will develop specific manifestations caused by that gene.) The effects of individual susceptibility genes may also be influenced by interactions with other genes and by specific environmental exposures. Locus heterogeneity is also likely, meaning that there are different susceptibility genes in different MS patients. The possibility that MS is a heterogeneous disease with different causes or pathological processes adds an additional level of complexity to the analysis. In addition to MS, similar issues are present in other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes mellitus that are genetically complex, and common research tools will be needed to decipher specific disease genes in these different conditions. The genetic region most clearly associated with MS susceptibility is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC, or HLA [human leukocyte antigen] in humans) locus on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21) (). This association has been seen in different population studies that have relied primarily on sporadic patients. Formal genetic linkage to 6p has also been found in several recent whole-genome scans of multiple affected MS families. Many of the MHC genes are extraordinarily variable or polymorphic, reflecting the importance of genetic variation of these critical antigen-presenting molecules in the maintenance of a heterozygous advantage and the need to effectively present a diverse array of antigens if immune homeostasis is to be maintained. Immune homeostasis refers to the capacity of the immune system to respond appropriately to a diverse number of infectious pathogens and tumors without initiating unhealthy responses against self-constituents (auto- The major histocompatibility complex is a chromosomal region that contains more than 100 genes, many of which make proteins involved in the immune system. It is named for the role it plays in rejecting tissue transplants ( means tissue). In humans, this region resides on chromosome 6 and is called the human leukocyte antigen gene complex. The terminology is slightly confusing because ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. MHC and HLA also refer to the proteins that some of these genes make. In this report, the term “MHC molecules” is used to indicate the proteins. The role of the immune system is to differentiate between self and non-self. This allows it to tell the difference between, for example, muscle tissue (self) and an invading virus (non-self) and to respond appropriately. To do this, the immune system relies on several different proteins that specifically bind antigens. This process is analogous to a lock and key. The “lock” is an antibody, a T-cell receptor, or an MHC molecule. The “key” is an antigen, which can be a carbohydrate, lipid, nucleic acid, or protein—anything that binds specifically to a component of the immune system. This discussion focuses on T-cell receptors and MHC molecules. T-cell receptors sit on the surface of T cells and bind to antigens outside the cell. (In the case of T-cell receptors and MHC molecules, antigens are small protein fragments.) Binding to an antigen signals the T cell either to die, to do nothing, or to become active. The signal context, such as whether the antigen is self or non-self, determines which of these signals is relayed. However the T cell cannot bind the antigen alone. It needs the help of an MHC molecule. MHC molecules sit on the surface of other cells. The MHC molecule, like two outstretched arms, holds onto an antigen and presents it to a T-cell receptor. There are two major classes of MHC molecules. MHC I molecules, which are expressed on most cell types, present antigens to CD8+ T cells. MHC II molecules, which are expressed on special antigen presenting cells (APCs), present antigens to CD4+ T cells. In humans, there are three main class I molecules, HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C, and three main class II molecules, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR. Each arm of the MHC molecule is made up of a separate protein. In the case of MHC I molecules, there is an Î±-chain (A, B, or C) that pairs with the protein b2microglobulin. An MHC II molecule is made up of an Î±-chain and a Î²-chain (for example, DP-Î± and DP-Î²), but the story becomes more complex. Each MHC molecule can bind many but not all of the thousands of antigens that confront the immune system. The immune system relies on diversity among the MHC proteins to help stack the odds in its favor. The gene for each MHC protein chain comes in different varieties, or alleles. One of the MHC Î²-chains has more than 150 alleles. Each of these alleles produces a slightly different protein. The proteins vary just enough that although they all function as MHC proteins, they can bind different antigens. Any one person will have two alleles, at most, for a particular MHC protein (there are two copies of each gene in human cells), but across a population of individuals, this variety becomes more important. For example, in Gambia, West Africa, 25 percent of HLA-B genes are the HLA-B53 allele, compared to less than 1 percent in Europe. HLA-B53 is very effective at presenting an antigen from the parasite that causes malaria to CD8+ T cells. Researchers hypothesize that because HLA-B53 can protect people from the most severe forms of malaria, it is more prevalent in Gambia. Having a particular MHC allele can also be a disadvantage, as researchers have shown in the case of HLA-DR2 and MS. (HLA-DR2 actually designates both a specific DR-a chain allele and a DR-b chain allele.) Scientists still do not understand how HLA-DR2 predisposes individuals to MS, but this might have to do with the MHC molecule's ability to present specific antigens (for example, a fragment of myelin basic protein) to T cells.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. immune responses). In Caucasian MS populations of northern European descent, the critical MS-associated genetic region is thought to reside near the class II locus and is comprised of a group of genes with specific polymorphisms (alleles) that tend to occur in certain fixed combinations, termed haplotypes. In molecular terms, the “DR2” haplotype is designated as HLA-DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602. DR molecules are comprised of alpha and beta chains (encoded by A and B genes, respectively), and the polymorphisms are predominantly present in the beta chain. Of the more than 100 beta-chain sequence variations identified in humans, only one (1501, also designated as DR2) is associated with MS. How can the DR2 association with MS be explained? The DR2 molecule itself may have a propensity to bind peptide antigens of myelin and stimulate disease-inducing T cells. DR2 is known to bind with high affinity to a region of MBP (spanning amino acids 89-98) thought to be “immunodominant” in humans. X-ray crystallography of the DR2-MBP peptide complex revealed that the DR2 molecule contains a distinctive hydrophobic pocket in its antigen-binding region, created by a unique alanine residue at the B71 position into which glutamic acid at position 93 of MBP is tightly bound, anchoring the MBP-DR2 complex. In a larger sense, the structure of the antigen-binding domain of DR2 molecules likely facilitates binding of many peptides containing certain amino acid residues, specifically aromatic amino acids. Glatiramer acetate (copolymer 1), a currently available disease-modifying therapy for MS, is a random synthetic protein composed of four amino acids, including tyrosine. The tyrosine residues of processed copolymer peptides likely also bind to the hydrophobic pocket of DR2, perhaps interfering with presentation of this key MBP peptide to encephalitogenic T cells. It is surprising that no data exist on the interaction of DR2 and the response to glatiramer acetate in MS. Another possibility is that the DR2 molecule does not itself predispose to MS but that another nearby gene (perhaps another HLA gene such as DQ) is responsible. DR2 is also linked to other diseases. Besides MS, narcolepsy is the disease most strongly linked to DR2. In various studies, the HLA region has been estimated to confer somewhere between 10 percent and half of the inheritability of MS. To date, no other genes of major effect have been identified in genomic screens. Several studies appear to demonstrate that a deletion mutation in the CCR5 chemokine receptor gene (a coreceptor for HIV) on chromosome 3 confers a later age of onset or a more benign course of MS; this mutation is also associated with protection against HIV. This is particularly important because the expression of CCR5, which is increased in MS brain lesions, is thought to attract inflammatory cells into tissue. Another locus on chromosome 19q22 near apolipoprotein C1 has been linked to MS in several genomic screens, but the estimated Î»s is only 1.4. A polymorphism near the gene for myelin basic protein on chromosome 21 was reported to be linked to MS in a family from Finland, but not in other populations. Some studies have suggested linkages or ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. associations with the TCR beta-chain locus on chromosome 7, the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on chromosome 14, and a region on chromosome 5, but others have not found similar linkages. The inability to confirm some genetic regions as containing MS susceptibility genes might reflect the small genetic contribution of these putative genes or genetic heterogeneity; alternatively, the original claim might have been spurious. As noted above, it is likely that an additive model consisting of multiple independent genes, each with small effects, explains the non-MHC genetic contributions to MS. It should be emphasized, however, that the identification of specific genes that have even very minor genetic effects on MS can have an enormous payoff, both in terms of helping to decipher the underlying biology of MS and in pointing to new potential treatments. For example, the genetic studies discussed earlier that identified a role for the CCR5 chemokine receptor suggest that therapies aimed at this receptor could be investigated in people with MS. Perhaps the strongest indication that MS is a heterogeneous disorder comes from HLA studies showing an absence of DR2 association in particular ethnic groups or perhaps in some clinical variants. In Japanese patients, one form of MS (“Western type”) is characterized by disseminated CNS involvement and is associated with the DR2 haplotype. In contrast, a more restricted form of MS in which optic nerve and/or spinal cord involvement predominate (“Asian MS”) is not associated with DR2. Lesions in the non-DR2-associated condition are frequently more severe and necrotizing than in the disseminated form. In one report, the Asian MS form was genetically associated with an HLA gene named DP (the DPB1*0501 allele). Another area of uncertainty is the strength of the association between primary progressive MS (PPMS) and DR2. A number of (relatively) small studies failed to show any association between PPMS and DR2, although a recent larger study from northern Ireland appeared to show an association; it is possible that PPMS represents more than one underlying disorder. Evidence for genetic heterogeneity is not limited to case-control HLA association studies but is also derived from formal linkage studies. Analysis of the MHC locus in an American multiple affected member MS data set confirmed the significant genetic linkage to this region (lod score of 4.60), and the specific association with the DR2 allele; however 25 percent of the families that were DR2 negative showed no linkage to the HLA region on 6p21. This indicated most likely the presence of locus heterogeneity in familial MS in Caucasians. A related *Lod scores are based on the ogarithm of the ds of linkage between two genes. A score of 3 or more is considered evidence of a genetic linkage between a known gene (or gene marker) and another unknown gene that underlies a trait (such as MS). That information thus indicates that the trait has a genetic basis and localizes the gene to a specific chromosomal region. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. observation in MS-prone Caucasian families is that the phenotypic expression of MS aggregates within families in some cases, suggesting that some clinical manifestations of MS are influenced by an individual's genetic background. The extent to which distinct clinical forms of MS are associated with different susceptibility genes, as may be the case in EAE (see discussion of animal models), is not known. Also unknown is whether specific genes interact with certain causative agents or triggers. Genetic studies have the potential to answer these questions, particularly when the information is analyzed in combination with epidemiologic, clinical, and neuroimaging data. There are several human and animal diseases of known etiology or pathogenesis that resemble either the clinical or the pathological features of MS (). Animal diseases that resemble MS are discussed under animal models. CNS demyelinating diseases include those mediated by immune responses, infection, and toxins, as well as inherited disorders. Infectious agents can induce direct injury of oligodendrocytes and their myelin membranes, as well as indirect injury via the immune system. A variety of toxins, such as diphtheria, lysolecithin, cuprizone, and ethidium bromide, have been associated with demyelinating lesions. Many of these toxins induce lysis of the oligodendrocyte, with demyelination as a secondary effect. In addition, nutritional deprivation can be associated with demyelination in the central and peripheral nervous system. Immune-Mediated and Virus-Induced CNS Demyelinating Diseases Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), also known as post vaccination encephalomyelitis, occurs as a consequence of vaccination with neural antigens. EAE, the most widely used animal model of MS, is the animal counterpart of this human disease. ADEM is characterized pathologically by widespread perivenular inflammation and demyelination. The uniformity of lesions differs from the multi-age lesions found in even the most acute case of MS. Post vaccination immune-mediated damage can also affect the peripheral nervous system. Since there is no standard laboratory-based test to diagnose the human disorder, the most reliable descriptions of the clinical spectrum of the disease are derived from collections of cases in which epidemiologic and statistical studies support the association of a triggering stimulus and disease. Such criteria are best met by cases associated with immunization with CNS tissue containing vaccines, for example, original Pasteur rabies vaccine. This vaccine complication can occur at all ages. A clinical hallmark of the rabies vaccine-associated form of ADEM is its uniphasic course evolving over days to several weeks. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. CNS Demyelinating Diseases That Resemble MS ADEM is characterized pathologically by widespread perivenular inflammation and demyelination. Multifocal CNS lesions can occur as a component of an array of systemic collagen vascular disorders including systemic lupus eryhemtosus and polyarteritis nodosa. The CNS manifestations may be the presenting feature. The peripheral nervous system is also frequently involved. PML is caused by the JC virus, which infects and destroys oligodendrocytes with minimal associated immune response. It typically occurs in immunosuppressed or immunocompromised individuals and is common in AIDS. The disease can feature a subacute progressive or relapsing clinical course. The imaging and pathologic features can be distinguished from classical MS. HTLV-1 (human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I) infection is sometimes associated with a neurological syndrome called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Patients with HAM/TSP have a progressive myelopathy, usually with spastic paraparesis, sensory disturbance, bladder dysfunction, and occasionally, optic neuritis. These inherited disorders are characterized by specific gene defects that result in either inadequate formation or excess breakdown of myelin. There may be a prominent inflammatory response in the region of myelin breakdown, but this is considered to be secondary to tissue breakdown. To date, therapeutic attempts with immunomodulatory agents in the leukodystrophies, specifically, adrenoleukodystrophy, have been ineffective. Toxic optic neuropathy, subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON) Outbreaks of toxic optic neuropathy and SMON have been described in Cuba and in Japan.11,12,99 Sporadic cases of toxic optic neuropathy likely account for the disorder tobacco-alcohol amblyopia. Conversely, one need consider whether deficiency syndromes could underlie development of demyelinating syndromes; deficiency of vitamin B12, a cofactor in myelin formation, has also been implicated.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. ADEM, or postinfectious encephalomyelitis, has been implicated as a consequence of a wide array of viral infections, although for many, the epidemiologic data are not strong enough to support a causal link. Measles virus epidemics have, however, been convincingly linked to ADEM. Postinfectious encephalomyelitis (PIE) is thought to be autoimmune in nature rather than secondary to a direct virus injury for the following reasons: (1) encephalitis appears after the rash clears; (2) there is generally little or no evidence of infectious virus or viral genome in the CNS at the time of the demyelinating disease; and (3) there is evidence of increased reactivity against myelin antigens during the demyelinating disease. Postinfectious encephalomyelitis is generally uniphasic. Immune system disturbances, which are known to occur following measles virus infection, might underlie the immunopathological response of post-infectious encephalomyelitis. A new direction for studies of PIE involves the possibility of establishing a model for this disease in transgenic mice that express the CD46 measles virus receptor. Molecular cross-reactivity, or molecular mimicry, has been demonstrated between myelin antigens and an array of viruses. Homologous sequences from viruses have been used to induce EAE (for example, hepatitis virus antigens). The extent of T-cell receptor degeneracy (meaning that the same receptor can respond to a wide sequence of peptides) and T-cell receptor heterogeneity in humans suggests that a wide array of exogenous agents could induce such a disease mechanism. As in MS, the putative infectious trigger could be different in individual MS patients depending on their immunogenetic makeup and the status of their immune system at the time of infection. A remaining challenge in MS is to determine whether any infectious agents detected in the CNS of such cases also persist in the CNS without causing harm or whether they are responsible for generating a pathogenic immune response. ADEM cases are usually sporadic, and it is sometimes difficult to identify the initiating factor. Relapsing cases of ADEM have been described, especially in younger-age patients. For some cases, characteristic pathologic material has been available. Similarly, the EAE model can be manipulated to produce a relapsing chronic disorder by selecting animals with specific immunogenetic backgrounds and timing their immunizations so that the underlying systemic immune response is amplified or the blood-brain barrier is altered. Such variables could also determine the nature of the response of humans when they are exposed to potential disease-inducing antigens. JC virus, a member of the papovavirus family, is a common pathogen in humans, although the *JC refers to the initials of the individual from whom the virus was isolated in 1970. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. primary disease caused by this virus is not characterized. Common symptoms include hemiparesis, aphasia, focal seizures, and visual disturbances. JC virus is thought to reactivate in immunosuppressed hosts, especially individuals with AIDS, producing the opportunistic infection PML. The disease involves a progressive CNS syndrome with symptoms and signs that suggest white matter involvement. Demyelination is usually most prominent in the occipital lobes of the cerebral hemispheres. The histopathology is characterized by the presence of oligodendrocytes with intranuclear inclusion bodies filled with papovavirus infectious particles, indicating that this disease involves a direct, lytic infection of the oligodendrocyte; that is, the oligodendrocyte is broken apart after being infected with the virus. Enlarged astrocytes are also seen, suggesting that the JC virus can transform these cells. Demyelination is a result of the direct oligodendrocyte infection by JC virus. Thus, in PML the immune response is considered to be protective rather than pathogenic. This retrovirus is common in the tropics as well as Japan, and is usually associated with asymptomatic disease. HTLV-1 infection is infrequently associated with a T-cell leukemia or lymphoma or a neurological syndrome called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Patients with HAM/TSP have a progressive myelopathy usually with spastic paraparesis, sensory disturbance, bladder dysfunction, and occasionally, optic neuritis. The CSF generally shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated IgG and oligoclonal IgG bands directed against HTLV-1. Necrotizing lesions with inflammation in the white matter are present in the spinal cord. HAM/TSP can resemble MS clinically. In fact, a case of HAM/TSP might be diagnosed as MS if it were not for the presence of HTLV-1 antibody and the observation that the HTLV-1 genome can be detected in the CNS. The pathogenesis of HAM/TSP remains unclear. There are numerous CD8+ T cells that recognize the virus, suggesting that this immune response might foster white matter disease. Infected glial cells are a possible source of inflammatory pathogenic cytokines and might also be the target for these cytolytic T cells. In addition, there is some evidence that molecular mimicry plays a role in disease pathogenesis. Host genetic factors, for example, HLA type, might also be important in determining susceptibility to HAM/TSP after infection. It has not been proven that MS is caused by an infectious agent, but various data, including the inflammatory nature of the disease, epidemiological studies, and a heightened immune response against several pathogens, suggest an infectious etiology (reviewed in 1998 by Kastrukoff et al.). Demyelinating diseases that clinically and pathologically resemble MS can be caused by viral agents or ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Koch’s Postulate on Causation of Disease by a Pathogen The pathogen is always present in pathologically affected tissue. It would be rare to consistently isolate a pathogen from all cases of the disease that it causes because of shortcomings in isolation procedures. The pathogen is not present in tissues from controls. Pathogens can have a variety of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic disease to varied diseases. Host restriction may prevent experimental transmission. immunopathological responses (). Infectious agents might be able to cause demyelination either directly, as a result of oligodendrocyte lysis, or indirectly, by means of an immunopathological response. Demyelination mediated by an immunopathological response can occur by a number of mechanisms. For example, the infectious agent can induce a pathogenic cross-reactive immune response (molecular mimicry), or the release of myelin antigens can stimulate an immune response that is directed against white matter antigens and becomes more broad over time (epitope spreading). (See for a summary of autoimmunity and disease.) There are clear limitations to using classical criteria to implicate a pathogen isolated in MS as a causal agent for the disease, as shown in . These issues make it especially difficult to establish the significance of a positive isolation from tissues of a patient with MS. However, all cases in which an infectious agent causes a disease will clearly not fit standard criteria, and individualization of the requirements is sometimes necessary. Because of these limitations, it is prudent to consider criteria that may be more appropriate and realistic. One could consider the following additional guidelines in analyzing disease causation by a pathogen: consistent transmission or isolation of the pathogen; cure or effective treatment of the disease following elimination of the pathogen; absence of the disease in geographic regions where the pathogen is not present. It may also be appropriate to consider particular molecular signatures related either to the genes of the pathogen or to the transcription expression profile associated with a particular pathogen. Many pathogens have been implicated over the years as etiological agents in MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Agents Isolated or Implicated in the Etiology of MS Some of these claims have been doubted for the following reasons: contamination (for example, spirochete), artifacts of isolation methods (for example, simian cytomegalovirus), and normal flora (for example, herpes simplex-1 [HSV-1]). Although some of these agents are clearly capable of inducing a CNS demyelinating syndrome that resembles MS, it remains uncertain whether particular cases in which a pathogen is isolated represent a rare MS-like case or whether the pathogen may actually be a common cause of MS. There are various possible explanations of why so many pathogens have been isolated in MS but no single pathogen has been consistently observed. First, there might be a variety of pathogens that can independently cause MS (i.e., the disease is multifactorial), perhaps inducing heterogeneous forms of the disease. Second, MS might not be an infectious disease. The isolations of different pathogens might all be artifactual or related to rare events associated with a particular pathogen. Third, the relationship of the pathogen to MS might be a relatively minor one, possibly through interactions with genetic factors. Finally, the true pathogen might not yet have been identified. Thus far, there is inadequate evidence to either accept or reject suggestions that any particular pathogen is causally related to MS. A variety of members of the herpes group of viruses (for example, simian cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, HSV-1, and human herpesvirus-6 [HHV-6]) have been implicated in the etiology of MS. Members of this group of viruses remain attractive candidates as etiologic agents in MS since they are common pathogens that are known to persist and reactivate from a latent stage (and therefore could trigger the attacks and remissions seen in MS) and in some cases can induce focal demyelination in animals (see discussion of animal models of virus-induced demyelination). The most recent herpesvirus candidate to generate attention is HHV-6. HHV-6, a common pathogen, is the cause of the childhood disease, roseola (exanthem subitem). This virus is associated with febrile seizures in children, can invade the CNS, and can persist in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the spinal fluid. In some cases, HHV-6 induces an MS-like disease, which raises the issue ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. of its broader involvement in MS. Some recent studies of HHV-6 have found no or rare evidence of HHV-6 genome in MS CSF (as well as little, if any, evidence of genome from several other members of the herpesvirus group). One recent study reported that there was an increased incidence of HHV-6 (as well as HSV and varicella-zoster virus) genome in CNS tissue from MS cases compared to tissues from controls; however, the differences were not statistically significant (see Sanders). Some investigators have argued that the cell type that is infected by HHV-6 differs in MS CNS compared to controls and, therefore, that the virus plays a role in the pathogenesis of MS. The interpretation of HHV-6 studies may be complicated because HHV-6 infection and the localization of the virus may be altered secondary to inflammation associated with MS or to immunosuppressive treatment of MS patients; therefore, a change in localization of HHV-6 in MS CNS compared to control CNS may be unrelated to any pathogenic role of HHV-6 in MS. Although HHV-6 may not induce the white matter lesions of MS, it remains a possibility that HHV-6 contributes to the demyelination seen in some cases of MS. The recent identification of CD46 as a cellular receptor for HHV-6 and the availability of transgenic mice that carry CD46 provide an opportunity to develop an experimental model of HHV-6-induced CNS disease pathogenesis. A recent study found that CSF from MS patients was culture-positive for and PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-positive for this agent more commonly than CSF from patients with other neurological disease. In addition, there was evidence of increased antibody against chlamydia in MS CSF, as well as evidence that MS CSF oligoclonal IgG bands were absorbed by chlamydia antigens. This work clearly needs confirmation. Members of the public awaiting cures for specific diseases often express impatience with the fact that most research on the biological basis of disease is based on animal studies, complaining that the time and money spent on animal studies would be better invested in clinical trials. However, animal studies are not simply interchangeable with clinical studies. Ultimately, every biologically active substance exerts its effects at the cellular and molecular levels, and the evidence has shown that this is remarkably consistent among mammals, even those as different in body and mind as rats and humans. Thus, animals can serve as models for basic biological processes in humans and can provide information about how drugs work that would not be obtainable in clinical studies. Animal models in which both spontaneous and induced disease occur have contributed greatly to our knowledge of the pathogenesis of diseases, and in the future, they will be increasingly used to aid in the assessment of various treatment modalities. A variety of animal models have been used to study the pathogenesis and experimental treatment of diseases that share features with MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Immunization of mice, rats, or primates with myelin proteins (MBP, MOG, PLP) or other autoantigens (PLP). CREAE is a chronic, relapsing type of EAE In contrast to T cells, there is no technology available to routinely clone autoantigen specific B cells. As an alternative approach, B-cell “monoclonal” mice have recently been generated by gene replacement transgenesis Genetic engineering is used to produce animals that express particular human genes hypothesized to be involved in MS A variety of viruses can induce CNS demyelination, including Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and herpes simplex virus Most of our present knowledge of myelin-specific autoimmunity and, more generally, of immune reactivity within the CNS emanates from experimental animal models. It should, however, be noted that there is a diversity of distinct models, defined by the animal species, the target autoantigen, and the mode of induction. Three basic types of animal models have been developed to understand the disease mechanisms underlying MS: EAE, virus-induced demyelination, and genetically modified animals. EAE models have served, in many respects, as the prototype for current thinking on the pathogenesis of MS. This paralytic disease is characterized by the presence of inflammation and demyelination in the CNS. It is an autoimmune syndrome induced in different susceptible strains and species, generally by intradermal immunization with myelin antigens (natural or synthetic) or by adoptive transfer of T lymphocytes reactive against myelin proteins. The antigens capable of inducing EAE vary depending upon the strain and species of animal, the adjuvants employed, and perhaps also the history of environmental exposures experienced by the animal. EAE should be considered not as a single model but rather as a heterogeneous family of related disorders. Each of the EAE variants reflects different aspects of human MS, and conversely, there is no one EAE model that represents the entire complexity of MS (). As is the case in MS, susceptibilities to EAE are determined as complex genetic traits. In both disorders, the most evident susceptibility locus resides within the HLA locus.

Comparison Between Multiple Sclerosis and EAE SOURCE: Larry Steinman, presentation to the committee, November 17, 1999. EAE or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) disease process, influencing severity, recovery, susceptibility to relapse, remyelination, and other elements of the phenotype. Knowledge of the extensive heterogeneity in disease susceptibility and modifier genes in these MS models should provide targets for study in human MS. Even within genetically identical littermates, the immune response following immunization with whole myelin is heterogeneous, with different antigenic targets dominating in different individuals. When groups of genetically identical animals are housed in different facilities, the resulting clinical syndromes can be markedly different, presumably reflecting the effects of different individual microenvironments. Studies of EAE established that the pathogenic agents of the disease are CD4+ T cells, which produce cytokines of the proinflammatory Th1 pattern (IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î±, but no IL-4) upon stimulation. The precursors of these T cells are contained within the normal immune repertoire, but they unfold their pathogenic potential only on activation, by either specific antigens, microbial superantigens, or mitogens. In EAE induced in the Lewis rat strain (and H-2 mice) by immunization ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. with MBP, the encephalitogenic T cells recognize almost exclusively single, circumscript epitope segments of the MBP in the molecular context of MHC class II (clonal dominance). This dominance can be gradually lost over time, a phenomenon referred to as determinant spreading. Furthermore, in these models, the T-cell receptor for most autoreactive T cells is based on a highly simplified repertoire of structural genes, such as the VÎ²8.2 gene for the TCR Î²-chain. These unusual features of antigen recognition have raised hopes with regard to immunospecific therapies. Unfortunately, however, they seem to be limited to only a few experimental models. Most EAE models, as well as the human myelin-specific T cells, do not show either striking epitope dominance or T-cell receptor biases. To date, attempts to identify possible functions of CNS-specific T-cell classes distinct from CD4+ T cells have not led to consistent pictures. Evidence from T-cell transfer models and TCR transgenic mice suggests that CD8+ T cells might help control and limit an ongoing CD4+ dependent EAE process. Most acute EAE models show profuse inflammatory CNS reactions with a conspicuous absence of large-scale demyelination, implying that MS-like demyelination is not caused directly by myelin-specific T cells but must be brought about by other mechanisms. B cells are the best-characterized effectors of this function. Large, confluent inflammatory demyelinated lesions can be produced in rats by transferring encephalitogenic T cells along with a monoclonal antibody against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. The T cells cause inflammation, thereby opening the blood-brain barrier to the autoantibodies, which enter the CNS where they bind to myelin and destroy it via complement- or phagocyte-dependent mechanisms. “Simple” immunization of rodents with MOG can also produce the same result. In addition to producing humoral autoantibodies, brain-specific B cells target and present myelin antigens to specific T cells. During this presentation process, the B cells may stimulate the activation of specific T cells, with a possible tendency to shift them from Th1 (pro-inflammatory) to Th2 cytokine (anti-inflammatory) profiles. The roles of autoreactive B cells in the pathogenesis of EAE are incompletely understood, mostly because of technical shortcomings. In contrast to T cells, there is no technology available to routinely clone autoantigen-specific B cells. As an alternative approach, B-cell “monoclonal” mice have recently been generated by gene replacement transgenesis. The germline repertoire of immunoglobulin genes in these mice has been replaced by the mature, rearranged gene encoding a MOG-specific autoantibody. Most, if not all, of the B cells in these mice express immunoglobulin receptors that are autoreactive to MOG. The mice spontaneously produce high titers of anti-MOG autoantibodies in their blood. There is no natural, spontaneous animal model resembling MS. The immunological conditions leading to relapses ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. and remissions of inflammatory demyelinating disease over time are most commonly examined in chronic relapsing versions of EAE. These episodic courses depend on the modes of immunization as well as on genetic factors innate to the host animals. Although the conditions that trigger relapses in CREAE models are not yet well understood, models are expected to provide clues to these essential aspects of MS, especially when refined by the use of suitable transgenic animals. It has recently been shown that a chronic relapsing EAE in a primate, the common marmoset, is more like MS than other EAE models. This form of EAE, induced in marmosets by immunization with MOG, produces lesions that are almost indistinguishable from fresh, acute human MS plaques. In both the human disease and this animal model, a zone of myelin destruction is seen at the margins of lesions; within the lesions, myelin sheaths are replaced by vesiculated membranous elements. MOG-specific antibodies, thought to be related to the deposition of antigen-specific antibody, are present over the vesiculated myelin. In both settings, oligodendrocytes were spared, and there was some evidence of myelin repair. Axonal pathology, however, was more conspicuous in MS cases than in this animal model. It has been suggested that processes mediated by T-cells initiate the demyelinating lesions and that other effector mechanisms are the principal offenders in damaging the myelin sheath. Mechanisms that initiate the lesion might be immunologically distinct from those that propagate disease. Antibodies might play an important role in these processes. The marmoset EAE model has also confirmed the encephalitogenic potential of autoreactive T-cell clones, whose precursors are preformed in the healthy immune repertoire. At the same time, however, these experiments also show that all T-cell clones are not equally autoaggressive. Experimental animal models of MS are based almost exclusively on the use of rodents, mostly rats and mice. Unfortunately, rodent and human immune systems differ to such a large degree that not all observations made in rodent EAE can be directly translated to human MS. An important disadvantage of animal models is that they do not necessarily mirror the cellular or molecular pathology of MS. Some types of EAE, for example, produce brisk demyelination, whereas others produce little demyelination. Which is the best model? Since these features of MS are not yet fully understood, it is dificult to know how faithfully any given animal model of MS illustrates the human disease. In addition, these models are not very tractable for studies on the electrophysiology and biophysics of neuronal function, a serious limitation in a disease such as MS in which symptoms and signs arise from impaired nerve function. Powerful research methods are now available for studying the physiology and ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. biophysics of normal or injured nerve cells. These methods permit neuroscientists to study electrical signaling in both normal and injured neurons, but they require that these nerve cells, with reproducible abnormalities, be reproducibly located, within fractions of a millimeter, in specific parts of the nervous system so that they can be studied. In MS and in most currently available animal models, the pathology is patchy, and the location of demyelinated and injured neurons varies from case to case. For the electrophysiologist who studies neuronal signaling by precisely placing tiny microelectrodes within neurons, studying the physiology of demyelinated or otherwise injured neurons when their location varies from animal to animal is, indeed, a challenge. A model in which focal demyelination, or axonal injury, can be produced at specific locations that are consistent from animal to animal would be a great improvement. Viruses can cause demyelination in several ways, the most straightforward of which is for viruses to lyse, or break open, oligodendrocytes, the myelinproducing cells. In some cases, however, the immune system is also involved. The mechanism by which virus-induced immune-mediated demyelination is carried out is not clear, but roles for molecular mimicry, bystander damage, and superantigen activation of T cells have all been proposed (see ). The best developed models of virus-induced demyelination are those caused by certain strains of TMEV and the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (reviewed in Kastrukoff et al.). Probably the most fruitful of the remaining models are those of semliki forest virus (SFV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) (). The advantages of SFV are its small, simple genome and ease of mutagenesis. Although the HSV genome is large and complex, the wealth of molecular information related to this virus and the ability to manipulate the viral genome make it an attractive model system, as well. The DA strain of TMEV produces an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord with lesions that resemble MS. A variety of experimental studies of TMEV-induced demyelination suggest that as in MS, the immune system fosters demyelination. The inflammatory, demyelinating, and multifocal lesions of TMEV infection are mediated at least in part by T cells directed against viral antigens. The inflammatory response directly contributes to tissue damage in this MS-like model, since susceptibility is determined in part by immune response genes and immunosuppression abrogates demyelination. One to two weeks after inoculation with the DA virus, there is a brisk inflammatory response in the brain with high levels of virus. This is generally a subclinical process since the mouse usually appears normal. After three weeks, the brain pathology virtually disappears, but mice develop a progressive spastic para- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Animal Viruses That Induce Demyelination The TO subgroup strains of TMEV produces an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord with lesions that resemble MS. A variety of experimental studies of TMEV-induced demyelination suggest that the immune system fosters the white matter disease. The many different strains of MHV lead to a plethora of different diseases, including hepatitis, as well respiratory CNS disorders. The presence and extent of demyelination depend on the viral genotype, dosage, and route of inoculation, as well as the strain, age, and immune status of the infected mouse. Virus persists in glial cells of demyelinated mice. Experimental infection of mice and rats with specific strains of SFV leads to demyelination; other strains induce an encephalomyelitis. Demyelination depends on the specific strain of virus, the mouse strain, and the immune status of the host. Virus persists in the central nervous system. The role of the immune system in the demyelinating disease remains unclear. Many strains of HSV produce a diffuse encephalitis in mice, but certain virus strains induce an inflammatory demyelinating disease in particular strains. Other strains of mice have multifocal demyelination that can relapse or persist in varied areas of the brain. The role of the immune system in this model is unclear but appears to contribute to the destruction of CNS tissue. Maedi visna is found only in sheep. There is no experimental rodent model of maedi visna infection, and therefore one needs to investigate sheep. The absence of markers for the sheep's immune system and of genetically modified sheep with knockouts of different arms of the immune system are clear limitations of the maedi visna model. The pathology of disease varies from an encephalomyelitis to a pure inflammatory demyelination that resembles MS.37 Virus persists during the disease with a restricted expression in microglial cells. It remains unclear whether demyelination is a result of direct viral lysis or is mediated by the immune response. CDV produces a variety of CNS diseases in dogs, including acute and chronic encephalitis and demyelinating disease. Virus persists in the chronic disease and appears to be present in oligodendrocytes in some cases. Work with this model has been limited since dogs are required as the host. The pathogenesis of the demyelinating disease remains unclear. paresis associated with an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord. Although the titers of DA virus decrease over the first few weeks, virus persists in the central nervous system for the life of the mouse. The persistent virus is said to have a restricted, or incomplete, expression. In other words, viral genome is present, but the levels of infectious virus are low, with relatively little viral capsid ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. protein produced. (The capsid is the protein shell surrounding the viral DNA or RNA and is generally required for viral infectivity.) Advantages of the TMEV model include the simplicity of its genome, the detailed structural information about the virus, the ease with which it can be genetically manipulated, and finally, the extensive knowledge about the genes and immune system of mice, the natural host of TMEV (see .). Despite all that is known about TMEV and despite the ease in manipulating this simple virus, the pathogenesis of the demyelinating disease is not yet fully understood. It is clear that viral persistence in the oligodendrocytes and microglia is critical to the development of TMEV-induced demyelination; that is, an ongoing virus infection is always associated with the white matter disease. It is also clear that the immune system contributes to the late demyelinating disease, but exactly how remains poorly understood. Part of the difficulty in dissecting the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of TMEV (as well as some of the other animal models of virus-induced demyelination) is that it changes over time. Early after infection, the immune system controls the virus infection, but later in Advantages of the TMEV Model of Virus-Induced Demyelination The following features of TMEV make it an attractive model for studies of virus-induced immune-mediated demyelination: with only four structural proteins in the infectious particle. The genome is only approximately 8,100 nucleotides in length. Three strains are completely sequenced. The crystallographic structure of three strains of the virus has been solved, so that the location of every amino acid in the infectious particle is known. The B-cell epitopes that are the targets for neutralizing antibody have been identified and located on the infectious particle. Some of the epitopes on the virus that trigger proliferation of immune CD4+ T cells and some that act as targets for an antivirus cytolytic T-cell response are also known. Some components of the receptor for the virus have been identified. Infectious clones of the virus are available so mutations can be quickly engineered into any region of the genome. There is extensive knowledge about mouse genetics and immunology. The mouse, which is the natural and experimental host of TMEV, provides a special benefit in studies of the pathogenesis of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease because so much is known about mouse genetics and the immune system. In addition, many genetically engineered mice are available, including those in which specific genes for different components of the immune system have been “knocked out.” ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. the disease, it contributes to the demyelination. In addition, during the disease there appears to be a critical “balance” of the immune response that is necessary for the induction of demyelination: an inadequate immune response early in the disease can lead to the death of the mouse within the first couple of weeks and before the appearance of demyelination, while a very forceful immune response early can lead to clearance of the virus so that no virus persists and white matter disease fails to develop. In other words, viral persistence and demyelination occur only in association with a certain level of the antiviral immune response. CD4+, as well as CD8+, T cells might be mediators of the late demyelinating disease. DA virus infection induces demyelination in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell knockout mice, suggesting that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells mediate the late demyelinating disease. The targets for these immunopathogenic CD4+ and the CD8+ T cells are unknown. There is some evidence for epitope spreading, in which an increasing number of myelin antigenic epitopes become the target for a CD4+ T-cell response. However, epitope spreading appears to begin after demyelination has become established, so it is unclear how important this mechanism of immunopathology is to DA-induced demyelination, especially early in the white matter disease. Mouse strains that are resistant to DA-induced demyelinating disease mount an antivirus cytolytic T-cell response and clear the virus. Mouse strains that are susceptible to the late disease do not mount this response, presumably allowing for virus persistence. L*, a small protein synthesized by demyelinating strains of TMEV via alternative translation, is critical for TMEV persistence and demyelination. L* inhibits the antivirus cytolytic T-cell response in susceptible mouse strains through an, as yet, unknown mechanism. Certain cells, for example, oligodendrocytes, may have cell-specific RNA-binding proteins that bind to the viral genome (as well as some nonviral messenger RNAs) and regulate whether L* or the viral capsid proteins are synthesized. The more L* that is synthesized, the more the expression of the virus is restricted. TMEV induces apoptosis in certain cells, including neurons and macrophages. The relationship between apoptosis and DA-induced demyelination remains an open question. There are many different strains of mouse hepatitis virus that lead to a plethora of different diseases, including hepatitis as well as respiratory and CNS disorders. JHM, S, and A59 strains of MHV induce demyelination. The extent of demyelination depends on the virus, including its geno-type, dosage, and route of inoculation, as well as on the condition of the infected mouse, including its strain, age, and immune status. Intracerebral inoculation of the JHM strain into weanling mice leads to demyelination in the mice that survive encephalitis. Virus persists in glial cells of demyelinated mice. At present, there are some notable limitations to MHV pathogenesis studies. MHV has a remarkably large viral genome (32 kb), making this a complex ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. pathogen. A system for efficient and rapid mutagenesis has not yet been perfected, and therefore manipulation of the viral genome is not straightforward. Investigators initially thought that demyelination occurred as a result of viral lysis of oligodendrocytes independently of the immune system. More recent studies, however, suggested that it does contribute to the demyelination (reviewed in 1996 by Houtman et al.). For example, investigators found that C57BL/6 mice that are immunosuppressed by gamma irradiation before being exposed to the JHM virus develop less severe demyelination. Adoptive transfer of JHM virus-infected splenic T cells to the infected irradiated mice leads to the development of significant demyelination. Other studies in rats showed that transfer of T cells from rats that have JHM virus-induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis leads to the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis-like lesions. Studies in CD4+ and CD8+ knockout mice demonstrated that both T-cell types are needed for clearance of the virus; however, CD4+ T cells contribute to central nervous system inflammation and demyelination. A suggestion of the latter study was that the CD4+ T cells influenced the expression of cytokines, specifically the RANTES cytokine, and led to macrophage entry into the CNS; treatment of the infected mice with anti-RANTES antibody resulted in a decrease in macrophage infiltration and demyelination. These studies and conclusions require confirmation. The committee notes that the following animal models of virus-induced demyelinating disease are particularly likely to yield clues to the pathogenesis of MS: The HAM/TSP syndrome resembles MS. Because the principles relevant to this human disease might be similar to those in MS, investigating the pathogenesis of this disease could reveal insights into MS pathogenesis. The development of a widely available animal model for HAM/TSP is a high priority. PIE is of special interest since recurrences following this acute inflammatory white matter disease are so similar to MS attacks that the two diseases are indistinguishable, indicating a close relationship between PIE and MS. The availability of transgenic mice that carry a receptor for measles virus might provide an experimental model for the study of PIE. The pathological lesions of TMEV are similar to MS plaques; therefore, continuing delineation of the mechanism by which the immune system contributes to the virus-induced demyelination might lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of demyelinating disease. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Research on the MHV-induced demyelination model is presently limited by difficulties with site-directed mutagenesis methods. A high priority for research with this virus should be the generation of an infectious MHV cDNA clone and a refinement of mutagenesis techniques. Molecular genetic manipulation has become one of the most important tools for evaluating gene function in living organisms. These tools of molecular biology have extended the reach of researchers to a new level of understanding of neurodegeneration mechanisms. The development of animal models for neurodegenerative disorders by means of genetic engineering has revolutionized experimental neurology. The identification and cloning of genes involved in diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and amyotropic lateral sclerosis provided the keys to develop mice that overexpress the human genes involved in these diseases (reviewed in 1999 by Brusa). The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is genetically susceptible to diabetes, and transgenic NOD mice have been developed to allow examination of the role of possible autoantigens in the development of diabetes, which like MS involves an inflammatory autoimmune pathology. The NOD mouse has also identified candidate molecules and processes that have influenced research in EAE and MS. Mutant mice have provided insights into all aspects of biology for generations, but only in the last two decades has it been possible to modify the expression of selected genes, an essential breakthrough for analyzing the role of specific genes in complex processes and diseases such as MS. In addition, identification of the genes that are activated or inactivated in both pathological and repair processes in the CNS will likely reveal new and unexpected targets for uniquely selective disease-modifying therapies in MS. “Reverse genetics” and “forward genetics” offer contrasting approaches to the analysis of gene function. Forward genetics is an approach to identify genes that are not already implicated in a particular disease or process. Reverse genetics is an approach to identify the role of genes whose involvement in the disease or process being studied is already implicated. In forward genetics, large numbers of mice are mutagenized (using techniques that mutagenize genes at random); their resulting phenotypes are analyzed to select mutants that exhibit spontaneous MS. The mutated genes in the selected mutants are then positionally cloned and identified. The homologous human clones can also be identified, a task that is becoming vastly simpler as the human genome project nears completion. The advantage of this approach is that the screen is not biased in any way and can reveal genes beyond those already known to be involved in MS. Another advantage of forward genetics is that once a gene is identified in a disease process, one can quickly do a screen for suppressors and ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. enhancers of the phenotype. This will yield the entire biochemical pathway (as opposed to just one step) involved in disease pathogenesis. One limitation to the forward genetics approach is that only a small percentage of the mutated genes will result in a phenotype relevant to MS. Consequently, large numbers of mutants have to be screened, which is generally expensive, time-consuming, and labor intensive. Yet the rewards—especially for complex diseases and processes that have resisted traditional approaches—are unparalleled. In reverse genetics, mutant strains of mice that either overexpress or lack specific genes are generated through a variety of techniques. The classic approach to creating transgenic mice is to inject a foreign gene (“transgene”) into a fertilized egg, thereby inducing overexpression of the transgene. The egg bearing the transgene is implanted into a host mother. Progeny bearing DNA encoding the transgene are screened, as are the corresponding levels of RNA and protein. This transgene is randomly incorporated into a mouse chromosome and ultimately leads to production of the protein of interest. This approach has been used to transfer human genes (such as those for T-cell receptor, HLA DR2, and CD4) into mice to see if they develop spontaneous MS. One limitation of “knockin” mice is that genes can be inserted in uneven copy numbers in “replicate” animals or might be integrated into disparate sites in the genome. Gene expression can also be altered through knockout experiments. Knockout mice, or null mutants, are created using embryonic stem cells and homologous recombination to produce a cell line in which a certain gene has been removed, or ablated. When transferred into an early mouse embryo, these cells can participate in the generation of all cell lineages including germ cells, thereby transmitting their genotype to the next generation. Alternatively, embryonic stem cells can be used to create so-called knock-in mice by inserting a gene into a particular locus. The transgenic gene-targeting approaches described above all rely on irreversible changes to the genome that are present from the onset of development throughout an animal's life. The function of the gene must be deduced from the phenotype of animals that have been deficient for the product of the disrupted gene throughout development. Yet, many genes play different roles at different stages of development and in different tissues. This presents serious drawbacks (reviewed in 1998 by Gingrich and Roder and in 1999 by Muller). First, an animal with a gene alteration that lethally disrupts development obviously cannot be studied as an adult—even though the gene might play another critical role, for example, in neural repair. This is particularly relevant to MS because many of the genes that regulate embryonic neural development also regulate neural repair in adults. Another limitation of transgenic models is that changes in the regulation of other genes could yield misleading phenotypes, in part because of differences between effects of the gene at different developmental stages, gene redundancy (other genes might also play the role of the missing gene), or adaptive mecha- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. nisms that compensate for the missing gene. Even apparently unaltered phenotypes would thus not prove that the gene was not involved in the disease or process being studied. Another limitation of this approach is that in physiological responses, gene products tend to be produced in waves, whereas in transgenics, expression is usually “on” from the time of development. Alternative approaches in which one gene, or parts of it, can be inactivated or activated in specific tissues or at specific times (“conditional” and “inducible” mutants) have recently been developed in this rapidly expanding array of genealtering techniques (reviewed in Brusa, 1999; Gingrich and Roder, 1998; and van der Neut, 1997). This second generation of transgenic technology derives from the possibility of modulating the suppression of a transgene with external stimuli, by using a “biological switch” that can turn the foreign gene on and off. Gene expression patterns in the nervous system are highly regionalized. For example, the enzymes involved in producing neurotransmitters and their receptors differ from one subpopulation of neurons to another. Other proteins are more widespread, such as the intermediate filament proteins NF (neurofilament) or GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), or are ubiquitous, such as N-CAMs (neural cell adhesion molecules) and integrins. Thus, it would be particularly advantageous to develop tissue-specific mutants for MS research. The development of inducible systems will become an important tool in the many diverse aspects of research on the disease mechanisms and possibilities for repair in MS, including the potential administration of gene therapy. Transgenic overexpression of cytokines or gene targets of cytokines in the CNS offers a relatively non-intrusive mechanism to assess the role of individual cytokines in CNS development, function, and response to insult. A common technique for assessing the effects of a particular cytokine in EAE is to induce its expression directly in the CNS. This allows researchers to ask whether expression of the cytokine induces CNS pathology similar to that seen in MS. Directed expression of transgenes in the CNS relies on promoters that normally control the expression of CNS-specific genes. This includes the GFAP gene promoter, which drives expression in astrocytes, as well as the neurofilament promoter (neurons), and the myelin basic protein promoter (oligodendrocytes). To date, no one has isolated a microglial-specific promoter. Only MBP promoters have been used to overexpress gamma-interferon in the CNS. Phenotypes of transgenic mice range from a lethal, “jimpy”-like hypomyelinating mouse, through progressive demyelinating disease, to mice with no outward phenotype that nevertheless showed progression from EAE to a *A point mutation in the gene coding for myelin proteolipid protein causes male offspring of jimpy mice to have little or no myelination. Affected mice develop severe tremors and die prematurely at approximately 30 days. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. chronic demyelinating disease in contrast to control mice that recovered from EAE-induced demyelination. It is of interest that the same laboratory observed both extremes using the same constructs. This might be because the transgenes were unevenly integrated at different loci, since levels of expression did not obviously correlate with phenotype in one case. Asymptomatic transgenic mice did, however, show enhanced glial responses to CNS injury, and exacerbated ischemic infarction (Lambertsen et al., unpublished). These asymptomatic mice presumably reflect sub-threshold levels of cytokine. Nevertheless, crossing an asymptomatic MBP promoter-driven gamma-interferon transgenic mouse with MBP or MHC class I mice produced a more extreme jimpy phenotype. This might provide a clue to cytotoxic effects of beta-interferon-Î³ on oligodendrocytes, being perhaps dependent on local interferon-Î³ titers becoming sufficiently high to stimulate MHC I induction. It is not known whether similar mechanisms account for oligodendrocyte pathology in TNF-Î± and interferon-Î± transgenic mice. The IL-3 and IL-12 transgenic mice provide a useful counterpart, there being no obvious suggestion of a direct effect on oligodendrocytes., These mice illustrate the potential for direct macrophage and microglial attack on oligodendrocytes, which might occur in TNF-Î± transgenic mice. It is not clear from any of these experiments whether activation of immune cells took place within the CNS or following cytokine exit to the periphery. A systemic effect must account for the fact that overexpression of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 protected animals from EAE in two separate preparations. The fact that IL-4 transgenic mice did not show similar resistance might reflect insufficient expression within the CNS or strain background differences, given that IL-4 knockout exacerbated disease in another study. Most recently, a transgenic mouse has been “constructed” that expresses T-cell receptor genes from a human MBP-specific T-cell clone, along with relevant human MHC class II determinants and MBP. Under certain conditions, this “humanized” mouse developed spontaneous EAE that indeed showed inflammation with some demyelination. In recent years, there have been many advances in the use of transgenes (including gene knockouts), as well as even more sophisticated models that make use of tissue-specific and time-dependent regulators. These models should facilitate the development of rational therapies and the transfer of knowledge from animal models to the prevention and treatment of human disease. However, although temporally regulated targeting controlled by the administration of an environmental inducer has become feasible with high efficiency for some organs, it remains to be further improved for other tissues, particularly the brain. New generations of inducible promoters will more faithfully mimic the in vivo kinetics and dynamics of cytokine production. Knock-in mice, in which ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and often disabling disease of the nervous system, affecting about 1 million people worldwide. Even though it has been known for over a hundred years, no cause or cure has yet been discovered—but now there is hope. New therapies have been shown to slow the disease progress in some patients, and the pace of discoveries about the cellular machinery of the brain and spinal cord has accelerated. This book presents a comprehensive overview of multiple sclerosis today, as researchers seek to understand its processes, develop therapies that will slow or halt the disease and perhaps repair damage, offer relief for specific symptoms, and improve the abilities of MS patients to function in their daily lives. The panel reviews existing knowledge and identifies key research questions, focusing on: Research strategies that have the greatest potential to understand the biological mechanisms of recovery and to translate findings into specific strategies for therapy. How people adapt to MS and the research needed to improve the lives of people with MS. Management of disease symptoms (cognitive impairment, depression, spasticity, vision problems, and others). The committee also discusses ways to build and financially support the MS research enterprise, including a look at challenges inherent in designing clinical trials. This book will be important to MS researchers, research funders, health care advocates for MS research and treatment, and interested patients and their families. 3 Characteristics and Management of Major Symptoms 5 Strategies for Future Research on Disease Mechanisms 7 Building and Supporting the Research Enterprise Appendix D: Kurtze's Expanded Disability Status Scale Appendix F: U.S. Social Security Administration's Criteria for Qualifying as Disabled from MS Appendix G: Treatments That Have Been Claimed to Be of Benefit in MS You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

c5a07942-79c1-4825-8d68-100409990ce1,"Not currently logged in Roche’s Ocrevus boasts positive long-term data in MS After two years of treatment 75% of patients had no evidence of disease activity Swiss pharma company Roche has released new long-term data that shows 75% of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients treated with Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) had no evidence of disease activity after two years. The new data comes from the open-label phase 3b CASTING study and the CONFIDENCE real-world safety study, in which was administered to RRMS patients who had experienced a suboptimal response to a prior disease modifying therapy (DMT). In the CASTING study, patients had prior suboptimal response to at least six months of treatment with up to two DMTs before switching to Ocrevus treatment. Following two years of using Ocrevus twice-yearly, 75% of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients had no evidence of disease activity. In patients who had taken only one prior DMT, 88% reported no disease activity after two years, compared to 70% of those who had taken two therapies prior to switching to Ocrevus. Patients treated with Ocrevus also experienced an improvement in the majority of their symptoms, as measured by the SymptoMScreen outcome tool. The most significant symptom improvements observed in the CASTING study were seen in sensory symptoms, fatigue and vision. In the CONFIDENCE study, a 97% treatment persistence for Ocrevus patients was observed at 18 months, with strong adherence to infusions every six months, in an interim analysis of over 1,600 in the ongoing Germany-based study. “For a wide range of people with MS who experienced a suboptimal response to prior treatment, we continue to see evidence that Ocrevus provides significant benefit in slowing disease progression,” said Levi Garraway, chief medical officer and head of global product development at Roche. “New real-world OCREVUS data shows high persistence and adherence to the only B-cell therapy with a twice-yearly dosing schedule, which we know can be very important to both people with MS and their physicians,” he added. The MS market has long been dominated by Ocrevus, which is approved for use in both relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive MS, although it is facing biosimilar competition in the US and Europe. Although Ocrevus sales climbed again for the half year in 2020, reported that the decrease in hospitalisation and outpatient visits caused by the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted sales of the MS drug, which is administered by infusion.

Multiple sclerosis, often called MS, is a disease that attacks the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the optic nerves (the nerves that transmit visual information from the retina to the brain), brain and spinal cord. People with MS can experience a wide range of symptoms, including weakness, numbness, visual loss, double vision, imbalance and difficulties with memory and multitasking. Nerve fibers are normally surrounded by a protective covering called the myelin sheath. In people with MS, the immune system inappropriately attacks and injures the myelin sheath and the nerve fiber that it’s wrapped around. As a result, communications between the central nervous system and the rest of the body are interrupted, resulting in a variety of symptoms. In the most common form of MS, the immune system strikes the CNS episodically, causing areas or patches of damage, called “lesions,” in the optic nerves, brain and spinal cord. The symptoms a patient experiences during a given episode, or relapse, depend on the location of the lesion. For example, a lesion in the optic nerve causes visual loss, while a lesion in the middle of the spinal cord causes numbness and/or weakness below the waist. Over time, some people with MS develop gradually worsening weakness, imbalance, numbness or cognitive decline, called progressive MS. A subset of individuals experience progressive MS without relapses beforehand. MS is different for each person. Some people may go through life with only minor problems, while others may become disabled. There’s no cure for MS, but there are now drugs, called disease modifying therapies (DMT), that can decrease the risk of relapses and future nervous system damage. Our goal is to help patients reach a state of “no evidence of disease activity” (NEDA), meaning complete stability in neurological function and MRI scans, when possible. - A first episode of neurological symptoms and deficits caused by a typical MS lesion, that may evolve into definite MS in the future if additional inflammatory activity occurs. MRI scans and/or spinal fluid tests can indicate if someone with CIS has a high chance of developing definitive MS. CIS is most frequently caused by inflammation in the optic nerve (causing visual loss in one eye), spinal cord (causing numbness and/ or weakness in one or more limbs, often with bladder control difficulties), or brainstem (causing symptoms such as double vision, vertigo, and gait imbalance). In most cases, doctors will prescribe medicine for people who have CIS with risk factors for future relapses. These medicines, when taken early and even before the diagnosis of MS, may keep the disease from getting worse or extend one’s time without definitive MS. – MS characterized by recurrent, self-limited episodes of new neurological symptoms, or acute worsening of existing symptoms, followed by full or partial recovery. These episodes, which are often referred to as relapses, typically last weeks to months. By definition, they have to last one day or longer, and they’re caused by the formation of new MS lesions or the expansion of existing lesions within the CNS. Patients are generally stable during the periods between relapses, which are called remissions. However, some symptoms associated with MS, such as fatigue and muscle spasms, can persist during remissions, Most people who develop MS have a relapsing-remitting course initially. RRMS occurs 2 – 3 times more often in women than men, and usually is diagnosed in young adulthood (20s to 30s). – This is a phase of MS that follows the relapsing-remitting course in some individuals. It’s marked by steadily and gradually worsening neurological disability, usually in the form of weakness and/or numbness in one or more limbs, gait imbalance, and/or memory difficulties. The secondary progressive phase typically starts after 15 – 20 years of relapsing remitting disease. Not everyone with RRMS develops SPMS. Progressive MS is considered to be active when relapses, or new inflammatory lesions detected on MRI scans, are superimposed on the gradual neurological decline. Active disease is more likely to be responsive to disease-modifying therapy. – This is a form of MS characterized, from its inception, by steadily worsening neurologic disability, without prior clinical relapses and remissions. It resembles SPMS, except for the absence of a history of episodic neurological symptoms before the gradual decline becomes evident. PPMS is equally common in men and women, and it’s generally diagnosed in mid-life (40s to 50s). As in SPMS, some people with PPMS experience relapses and/or new inflammatory MRI lesions, superimposed on the progressive disease course. In those cases, the disease is considered to be active and is more likely to be slowed down by treatment with disease-modifying therapies. Sometimes, people without symptoms of an MS attack who undergo an MRI for other reasons, such as headache or head trauma, are incidentally found to have lesions that resemble the lesions seen in MS. These people should be examined by an MS specialist and may need additional tests. If they have never had symptoms suggestive of an MS attack and their exam is normal, they do not have and cannot be diagnosed with MS. A scenario such as this is called radiologic isolated syndrome (RIS). The diagnosis of RIS is made when MRI pictures look very similar to MS, but there haven’t ever been symptoms of an MS attack. People with RIS should be under the care of an MS specialist and generally are monitored with annual MRI scans to detect future areas of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord, which sometimes don’t cause symptoms. In a five-year period, 34% of individuals with RIS will be diagnosed with MS after they develop symptoms of an MS attack. Modify your home to keep it safe and easy to get around. For example, to help prevent falls, install grab bars in the bathroom and don’t use throw rugs. Try adjusting your daily schedule so that your routine is less stressful or tiring. Be physically active and try to exercise at least five days each week, either on your own or with the help of a physical therapist. Yoga and stretching improve the quality of life for many people with MS. Get help with urination problems. At some point, most people with MS have bladder problems. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to help you. In some cases, you may be referred to a urologist, who specializes in conditions that affect the bladder. Avoid getting overheated. Increased body temperature can temporarily make your symptoms worse. Use an air conditioner, keep your home cool, and avoid heated swimming pools and hot tubs. During warm or hot weather, exercise in an air-conditioned area rather than outdoors, and wear a cooling vest or collar when you go outside. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, cereals, legumes, poultry, fish, lean meats and low-fat dairy products. A balanced diet for a person who has MS is the same as that recommended for most healthy adults. For more advice about coping with MS at home, contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at .

Inflammation can damage or destroy myelin, the fatty protective substance that covers nerve cell fibers. This damage causes scars that interrupt the communication between the nerves in the spinal cord and the rest of the body. Most people affected by transverse myelitis will have only one attack; a small percentage may have more than one attack. Transverse myelitis can appear as the first symptom in conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or (NMO). A person with transverse myelitis who also has an abnormal brain MRI with more than two lesions has an increased chance (as high as 90 percent) of going on to develop MS. If testing and examination does not suggest a specific cause for the condition, the diagnosis is presumed to be . This is the case in 16-60 percent of people diagnosed with transverse myelitis. The exact cause of the damage to the spinal cord has not yet been determined with certainty but it is thought that it may be due to an autoimmune reaction to a viral or bacterial infection. In autoimmune diseases, the immune system mistakes the body’s own tissue as foreign, and attacks it, causing inflammation (swelling) that results in damage to the myelin. An infection precedes the onset of transverse myelitis about 50% of the time. Transverse myelitis often develops following viral infections such as varicella zoster (the virus that causes chicken pox and shingles), herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, influenza, echovirus, HIV, hepatitis A, and rubella. Bacterial skin infections, otitis media (middle-ear infections) and Mycoplasma pneumonia (bacterial pneumonia) have been associated with transverse myelitis. Some cancers may trigger an abnormal immune response that may lead to transverse myelitis. Transverse myelitis occurs in adults and children, in males and females and in all races. Females have a higher risk of transverse myelitis than males. No genetic pattern is known. Transverse myelitis is not related to family history. The highest number of new cases in a given year occur between age 10 and 19 and between age 30 and 39 years. The symptoms of transverse myelitis can appear suddenly, developing over hours to several days or more gradually developing over a period of 1 to 4 weeks. It is estimated that about 1,400 new cases of transverse myelitis are diagnosed each year in the United States. It is estimated that about 33,000 Americans have some type of disability resulting from transverse myelitis. The annual incidence of transverse myelitis ranges from 1.34 to 4.60 cases per million, but increases to 24.6 cases per million if acquired demyelinating diseases like MS and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) are included.

Experts Clarify How to Describe MS to Improve Care and Clinical Trials What Type of MS Do You Have? Experts Clarify How to Describe MS to Improve Care and Clinical Trials An international committee of MS experts has that clarifies how to describe the different courses of multiple sclerosis and disease activity. The statement was prompted by inconsistencies in the way MS descriptors are used by the MS community. These clarifications can improve care and access to treatments, and refine the selection of clinical trial participants so that trial outcomes can be better applied to clinical care.   The statement was an effort by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in Multiple Sclerosis, which is jointly supported by the US and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (). The Committee provides perspective and guidance in areas of interest to planning and implementing clinical trials for new agents for the treatment of MS.   “With this published statement, we’re encouraging the healthcare and regulatory community to use the terms as described for the different subtypes of MS and for describing disease activity,” noted Fred Lublin, MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai), who is senior author of the statement and two previous papers defining MS subtypes that were published in 1996 and 2013 under the auspices of the committee. “It’s critical not just for improving patient care, but also for selecting participants for clinical trials, so you are comparing apples to apples.”   The 2013 paper defined based on current clinical course:  (an initial episode of neurological symptoms), , , and . The paper also recommended adding terms to describe an individual’s current disease state, such as “active” (shown by relapse or changes on MRI) and “progression” (shown by worsening of disability independent of relapse activity). While the time period for the activity was not specified, it was recommended that an assessment be performed at least annually.   Since the 2013 paper was published, there has been confusion in the use of the terms describing a person’s current disease state and the terms have been used without reference to a timeframe. For example, in the prescription indications for recent MS therapy approvals, neither the European Medicines Agency nor the U.S. Food and Drug Administration specified a timeframe for determining disease activity. Moreover, the agencies defined activity differently; the European Medicines Agency defined “activity” as either clinical relapse or MRI-detected inflammation, whereas the U.S. Food and Drug Administration defined “activity” only in terms of relapses.   The recently published statement reiterates the definition of “activity” as clinical relapses or imaging features of inflammatory activity, evaluated annually or over another specified interval. The definition of “progression” is reiterated as clinical evidence of disability worsening, independent of relapses, in individuals in a progressive phase, evaluated annually or over another specified interval. Also, the more general term “worsening” refers to any increase in impairment or disability as the result of residual deficits caused by relapses, or increasing disability during progressive phases of MS.   “As part of its ongoing activities, the committee plans to continue to reevaluate and refine course descriptors, especially when new evidence-based methods enable pathological distinctions between MS phenotypes, said Professor Alan Thompson, Chair of the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in MS and Dean of University College London’s Faculty of Brain Sciences. “This would vastly improve prognosis, treatment choices, and the development of more selective therapies.”   Read the recently published open access statement, “The 2013 clinical course descriptors for multiple sclerosis: A clarification” by Fred D.

Spasticity is a common and often painful symptom of MS that involves feelings of stiffness, tightness or sudden movements caused by a wide range of involuntary muscle spasms. Canbex identified a candidate that alleviates muscle spasticity in mice with an MS-like disease. The molecule – VSN16R – stimulates novel cell docking sites and relieves spasticity in mice without causing side effects such as flaccidity, sedation or mood alteration, which can occur with current treatments. With support from the National MS Society through Fast Forward, Canbex completed toxicity studies in rats, one of the final steps needed before bringing this molecule to human testing. The partnership with Canbex is part of the Society’s relentless research effort to find solutions for everyone affected by MS. This trial, and further phase II and Phase III studies, will help determine whether VSN16R has potential to be developed into a safe and effective treatment for MS spasticity to improve quality of life of people with MS. These results are an example of how, by connecting people, ideas, and resources, the Society is helping promising treatments to break through barriers, move through the pipeline, and enter clinical trials -- faster.

Researchers looked at the outcomes of 178 people who were initially diagnosed with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CIS refers to a first episode of neurologic symptoms and is caused by inflammation or loss of nerve-insulating myelin in the brain, spinal cord or optic nerve. Individuals who experience CIS may or may not go on to develop MS. Fifteen years later, the team looked back at MRI scans taken early on to see whether particular characteristics predicted the clinical outcomes. They found that active inflammation (enhancing lesions) and spinal cord involvement in early MRI scans were linked to eventually developing secondary progressive MS and physical disability. Active inflammation also was associated with developing cognitive dysfunction. The findings that early MRI scans contain clues to future disease activity and progression contribute substantially to growing evidence that will eventually enable clinicians to predict individuals’ expected severity of MS and help direct treatment decisions.

One impediment is the lack of a quick way to detect whether a therapy is working, since progression can occur slowly. The search has been on for biomarkers that can predict disease activity and detect response to therapy. To advance this search, the , a global initiative that includes leadership from the National MS Society, convened a panel of experts to evaluate the potential of “neurofilament light” (NfL) as a fluid biomarker in MS and progressive MS in particular, and to outline research needed to advance the field. The panel has that summarizes what is known about NfL as a potential biomarker, and makes recommendations for further research to refine its potential to predict disease course and detect response to therapy in progressive MS. MORE DETAILS  Amidst a growing list of disease-modifying therapies for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, there is an unmet need for treatments that can stop and prevent disease worsening for those in progressive stages of the disease.   Clinical trials involving people with relapsing MS often rely on counting relapses or MRI-detected lesions to detect disease activity. Progression is less easily measured, and usually happens over longer periods of time. This makes it hard to detect quickly whether a therapy is slowing or stopping progression in early phase 2 proof of concept clinical trials. This is a serious roadblock for developing therapies for progressive MS.   Having objective indicators that detect progression, measure treatment impact, and predict an individual’s course and response to therapy would speed the development of new therapies and improve care for progressive MS.   To consider the current state of research on fluid biomarkers in MS in general and progressive MS specifically, the convened a panel of experts, including people affected by MS, scientists, and MS clinicians, with a view to mobilizing the MS community toward filling key gaps in knowledge and understanding. Under the leadership of Raju Kapoor, FRCP  (then at University College London) and Robert J. Fox, MD (Cleveland Clinic) the panel’s first published paper summarizes the state of knowledge about neurofilament light (NfL), and provides recommendations for next steps to advance NfL as a potential biomarker for MS.   Neurofilaments are important proteins that function to maintain nerve cell structure necessary for proper electrical impulse conduction along axons (nerve wires). NfL is a fragment that is part of the debris that enters the spinal fluid and blood when axons are damaged by MS and other causes. Recent technological advances have enabled the detection of NfL in the blood (serum and plasma), and not just in spinal fluid obtained by spinal tap, which makes it more convenient and practical as a potential biomarker.   Studies of NfL in serum, plasma and spinal fluid have been underway to better define how this biomarker may be employed to help detect and predict disease activity, progression, and response to treatments, not only in MS but in other neurologic disorders. NfL is also detected in healthy individuals, and its concentrations increase with age, so it is important to understand what is normal and what is not.   Recent clinical trials in MS have incorporated periodic monitoring of NfL levels as a possible indicator of treatment effect. The paper and accompanying tables outline how NfL levels behave before and after treatment in the course of clinical trials in both relapsing and progressive forms of MS. Results vary, but generally suggest that on a group level (rather than in individuals), NfL levels can predict relapse rates, brain tissue loss, disability progression, and are indicators of treatment response.   The authors outline additional research needed to establish the value of serum NfL as a biomarker in progressive MS and to have it recognized by drug regulators as a measure of treatment response in clinical trials. These include: Standard protocols should be established for how fluid samples for NfL detection are collected, handled, stored and analyzed, so that findings may be compared across multiple studies. Establishing normal NfL values across a broad age range of individuals with and without known medical issues, and potential confounding factors such as smoking, is a critical next step. Having these “normative” values not only increase the value of NfL as a biomarker in clinical trials, but will also facilitate its use for guiding treatment decisions in individuals, which is not yet understood. Additional studies of prior clinical trial data are needed to further understand how predictive serum NfL levels are of future disease activity and progression, how they correspond with MRI findings, and how they are influenced by inflammation and various therapies. The authors highlight several studies that are already underway that will help establish normative values of NfL, the impact of lifestyle, age and other demographic factors, and help define its predictive value, not just in MS but other disorders. Additional molecules are also under investigation as potential fluid biomarkers.   The International Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Alliance and its partners will continue to advance these initiatives to support its goal of speeding the development of therapies for progressive stages of MS.   The paper, “Serum Neurofilament Light as a Biomarker in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,” was published in the September 8, 2020 online issue of , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, by authors Raju Kapoor, FRCP  (University College London), Robert J Fox, MD (Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis, Cleveland Clinic), and their international collaborators.

878106b4-539f-4c23-ae37-af8faa44c00e,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     Paper Published on Recommendations for Speeding Research on Cell-Based Therapies for MS Paper Published on Recommendations for Speeding Research on Cell-Based Therapies for MS More than 70 experts convened in Lisbon, Portugal in November 2015 for an International Conference on Cell-Based Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis. “Cell-based therapy” here refers to the transplantation, delivery or stimulation of various cell types for treating MS. Cell-based therapy is being explored in MS both for turning down damaging immune responses and for promoting nervous system repair. Conference organizers have now published a paper in the journal (Published online 21 July 2017, and available as open-access) that summarizes results of cell therapy studies and makes recommendations to accelerate the development of cell-based treatment solutions for people with MS. The conference was held under the auspices of the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in MS – jointly sponsored by the National MS Society and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), with additional financial support from the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in MS (ACTRIMS) and the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation (MSIF). The paper reviews progress related to specific cell types, including autologous HSCT (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using cells derived from the person’s own bone marrow or blood), mesenchymal stem cells (derived from many different adult tissues), and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (derived from multiple sources), and makes specific recommendations about next steps for each. Controlled clinical trials were deemed the optimal way to provide answers about which types of cells, which route of delivery, and which types and stages of disease, would be the most promising approach for treating MS.  Over the last several years, progress has been made in innovative research related to the potential of many types of stem cells, both for reducing MS disease activity and for repairing damage to the nervous system. With the urgent need for more effective treatments that can stop all forms of MS, as well as therapies that can reverse disabilities, the potential of of cell-based therapies is being explored. “Cell-based therapy” here refers to the transplantation, delivery or stimulation of various cell types for treating MS.   To help accelerate and coordinate this work on a global scale, an International Conference on Cell-Based Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis was convened in November 2015 in Lisbon, Portugal. The conference was held under the auspices of the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in MS – a group jointly sponsored by the and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), with additional support from the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in MS (ACTRIMS) and the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation (MSIF). Conference Chairs were Jeffrey A. Cohen, MD (Cleveland Clinic, USA, also Chair of the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in MS), Marcelo C. Pasquini, MD, MS (Medical College of Wisconsin, USA) and Neil Scolding, PhD, FRCP (Southmead Hospital Bristol, UK).    More than 70 experts gathered to review progress in the multiple approaches to cell-based therapy – the first conference to focus on all major cell-based therapy possibilities for the treatment of MS.   A scientific paper was written by the conference organizers, based on the conference presentations as well as a review of published and ongoing studies. The paper is now available in the journal , with open access for all (). It reviews results of cell therapy studies published to date, the basic biological activity and interactions of various cells, clinical trial results and safety, future trial designs, ethics, and practical considerations such as regulatory issues and scaling up for high-volume production of therapeutic cells. Highlights, as well as details including top research questions and recommendations for various approaches, are summarized below.   Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (A - One type of procedure that has been explored for many years in MS is called “autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,” following ablation (destruction) of the individual’s immune system, commonly known as HSCT or AHSCT. This procedure attempts to “reboot” the immune system in people with MS. Stem cells from an individual’s own bone marrow or blood are withdrawn, captured, stimulated, and stored. Then the immune system is depleted, usually by chemotherapy. The stored stem cells are then reintroduced to the same person, usually by infusion into a vein. The reintroduced stem cells migrate to the bone marrow and over time produce new cells that should eventually repopulate the body with an immune system that is less likely to attack the central nervous system.   There is more experience using AHSCT in MS than any other cell therapy approach, and the paper describes published results to date, summarized in (page 5). The conference participants suggest: That this approach can be highly effective for people with specific MS characteristics (see next bullet), but it is not clear how it compares in safety or efficacy with other highly effective disease-modifying therapies. That those most likely to benefit are 50 years or younger, have had MS for 5 or fewer years, have active relapsing-remitting MS but are still walking, and whose disease is not adequately treated by available disease-modifying therapies. That a formal phase 3 clinical trial is recommended to be conducted that compares AHSCT to one or more highly effective disease-modifying therapies to fully understand benefits and risks and which individuals might benefit most. (At least one such trial is in planning stages.) That AHSCT may be appropriate for individuals with highly aggressive MS that is not controlled by approved disease-modifying therapies. In those cases where AHSCT is performed outside of a formal controlled clinical trial, it is recommended it should be performed at centers with experience doing the procedure and managing MS, and that safety and effectiveness outcomes be collected and submitted to existing bone marrow transplant registries for future publication.   – The paper also discusses other stem cells found in the body, including mesenchymal stem cells. These are adult cells found in several places in the body, including the bone marrow, umbilical cord blood and fat tissue. These cells have, to date, undergone limited testing in clinical trials that aim to reduce immune activity and to augment nervous system repair in MS. With this approach, an individual’s immune cells are not destroyed or replaced. Instead, an individual’s MSCs are isolated from the bone marrow, blood or other tissues, cultured in the lab to increase their purity and numbers, and then re-introduced into the body by intravenous (into the vein) or intrathecal (by spinal tap) injection. MSCs are thought most likely to work by encouraging the body’s natural repair mechanisms.   The paper describes technical issues related to the source, expansion and preservation of cells, and results of small clinical studies of MSCs in MS (summarized in , page 10). The authors note that larger, controlled phase 2 studies are underway, and suggest that further trials are warranted. Other suggestions made include: There has not been sufficient testing to determine the best dose, source, culture method, or route of delivery of MSCs. Quality and safety controls are a concern because of the potential for contamination and the potential formation of unwanted tissue and cancers. Long-term monitoring for potential adverse effects is important. - Another approach, which hasn’t yet been formally tested in people with MS, focuses on repairing nervous system damage with stem cells that may replace damaged cells (oligodendrocytes) that make myelin. Myelin is the protective coating on nerve wires which is damaged during MS. Stem cells called “oligodendrocyte progenitor cells” (OPCs) reside in the brain and can conduct natural repair to myelin in response to injury. These cells have been grown and expanded in lab dishes as a potential source for transplantation. Another cell source being explored involves using an individual’s own cells from skin or other tissues, which are reprogrammed to turn them into stem cells. These cells are called “induced pluripotent stem cells” or iPSCs. It’s possible such cells would not be rejected by the person’s immune system after transplantation. ( about other research to repair the damage in MS.)   The paper describes a phase 1 clinical trial planned by the New York State Consortium for Cell Therapy to assess the safety and feasibility of injecting OPCs into multiple locations in the brains of people with secondary progressive MS. Given the relative infancy of this cell therapy approach, the authors note many unresolved issues related to safety, regulations, cell sources and route of administration, dosing, and cell production, and also the need to understand the characteristics of people who might benefit. These are outlined in (p. 15).   – The paper outlines questions that are common to all types of cell therapy for MS, including: what are the best doses, routes and frequency of cell delivery; optimal clinical trial designs and study populations for each cell type; the role of cell therapy in relation to the use of approved ; ethical challenges, including the issue of patient-funded studies and the problems of medical tourism and unregulated ; and A past roadblock has been that clinicians often use different treatment protocols, different stem cell types and preparation, and other technical issues, making it hard to compare results. The authors recommend that stem cell therapy be tested by networks of researchers using standardized protocols so that data collection and analysis can be centralized. Several such networks exist or are being planned.   Controlled clinical trials were deemed an optimal way to provide answers about which types of cells, which route of delivery, and which types and stages of disease, would be the most promising approach for treating MS.    about stem cells and MS stem cells, stem cells, stem cells, stem cells, stem cells, stem cells, stem cells, stem cells, stem cells, stem cells, stem cells, stem cells, Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

This mirrors the frequency of seen in other studies of people with MS. Those who developed primary-progressive MS were more likely to be men, were significantly older, and were more likely to have MS-like lesions in the spinal cord compared to those who went on to develop clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or relapsing-remitting MS. This study provides a rare glimpse of a very early stage of disease even before progression begins, and provides additional evidence of the value of research into radiologically isolated syndrome. Finding a way to identify and track primary-progressive MS earlier may help to improve access to care for those who have it. The team (Dr. Orhun Kantarci, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, and national and international collaborators) published their findings in (). can be challenging, and it often happens in stages. The term “clinically isolated syndrome” (CIS) is used to describe a first episode of neurologic symptoms  that lasts at least 24 hours and is caused by inflammation and demyelination in one or more sites in the brain and spinal cord. Individuals who experience a CIS may or may not go on to develop definite MS. However, clinical trials of specific disease-modifying therapies have led to approvals for their use to treat CIS.   Some people have specific, “clinically silent” lesions (areas of inflamed or damaged tissue) on MRI, meaning that they are experiencing no symptoms and only have imaging findings. There has been growing research on this phenomenon, called “radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS),” which like CIS may or may not go on to develop into definite MS. There is debate as to whether people with RIS would benefit from early treatment with disease-modifying therapies.   is a relatively rare form of MS, with about 10% of all people with MS receiving this diagnosis. It is characterized by steady worsening of neurologic functioning, without any distinct relapses (also called attacks or exacerbations) or periods of remission.    This team examined data from 453 people with RIS collected from 22 investigators in five countries; a database of 210 people with MS in Olmsted County, Minnesota; and a cohort of 754 people with progressive MS.    Of the 453 people with RIS, 128 (28%) went on to develop a first neurological event consistent with CIS or relapsing MS. Of these, 15 (11.7%) developed primary-progressive MS. Those who developed primary-progressive MS were more commonly men, and older at diagnosis by approximately 10 years, than the 113 people who developed CIS/MS. The frequency of primary-progressive MS and age comparisons were similar to those identified in other groups of MS. Of the 15 who went on to develop primary-progressive MS, 12 had MRI scans of the spinal cord, and all 12 had lesions in the spinal cord, compared with 64% of those who developed CIS/MS.    The team (Dr. Orhun Kantarci, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, and national and international collaborators) published their findings in ().   This study provides a rare glimpse of a very early stage of disease even before progression begins, and provides additional evidence of the value of research into radiologically isolated syndrome.

bf8eed9b-2548-46ba-9838-d06b4bfde7ae,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     SPMS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Some people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. SPMS can be further characterized as either (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity during a specified period of time) or, as well as  (evidence of disability accrual over time, with or without relapses or new MRI activity) or . This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in SPMS; however each person's experience with SPMS will be unique. Following a period of relapsing-remitting disease, disability gradually increases over time, with or without evidence of disease activity (relapses or changes on MRI). In SPMS, occasional relapses may occur, as well as periods of stability. Disease activity and progression should be evaluated at least yearly by neurologic examination and MRI. Being able to characterize the course of your disease at different points in time helps you and your MS care provider discuss your treatment options and expected outcomes.  For example:   If you have SPMS that is active, you and your MS care provider will want to talk about treatment with a disease-modifying therapy to reduce the risk of a relapse. If you have SPMS that is active and progressing despite the medication you are taking, the conversation with your MS care provider might be about the potential benefits and risks associated with switching to a more aggressive treatment strategy. If your SPMS is not active but there is evidence of progression and accumulation of disability, you and your MS care provider will want to focus on rehabilitation strategies to help improve your function and mobility, and promote safety and independence. If your SPMS is stable without activity or progression, the conversation with your MS care provider could focus on rehabilitation and other symptom management strategies to help you maintain function. How does SPMS differ from the other disease courses? SPMS occurs in people who initially had a relapsing-remitting disease course. In other words, SPMS occurs as a second phase of the disease for many individuals. In SPMS, people may or may not continue to experience relapses caused by inflammation; the disease gradually changes from the inflammatory process seen in RRMS to a more steadily progressive phase characterized by nerve damage or loss. Read more about strategies to help you lead a full life with secondary progressive MS. Prior to the availability of the approved disease-modifying therapies, studies indicated that 50 percent of those diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) would transition to secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) within 10 years, and 90 percent would transition within 25 years. While MS experts agree that the medications have an impact on disease progression, it is too soon to tell the extent to which the disease-modifying treatments alter or delay the transition to SPMS. The National MS Society is pursuing all promising research paths and collaborating worldwide to drive progress in research in progressive MS, for which few therapies exist.

Canbex was one of the National MS Society’s first commercial collaborations through Fast Forward, and the first to advance a specific symptom treatment for MS. Spasticity is a common and often painful symptom of MS that involves feelings of stiffness, tightness or sudden movements caused by a wide range of involuntary muscle spasms. Canbex identified a candidate that alleviates muscle spasticity in mice with an MS-like disease. The molecule – VSN16R – stimulates novel cell docking sites and relieves spasticity in mice without causing side effects such as muscle weakness, sedation, or alteration in mood, which can occur with current treatments. With support from the National MS Society through , Canbex completed toxicity studies in rodents, one of the final steps needed before bringing this molecule to human testing. According to Canbex, a phase I study in 72 healthy subjects showed VSN16R to be safe and tolerable. The phase II trial will be designed to determine the effectiveness of this treatment in people with MS. The phase II and eventual phase III trials are necessary steps before this therapy can be approved for treating spasticity, and will help determine whether VSN16R is a safe and effective treatment for MS spasticity. These results are an example of how, by connecting people, ideas, and resources, the National MS Society is helping promising treatments to break through barriers, move through the pipeline, and enter clinical trials -- faster.

The results announced in a press release concluded that ibudilast was well tolerated and significantly slowed the rate of brain atrophy compared to placebo. Brain atrophy (shrinkage) has been linked to cognitive and physical disability in MS. The trial was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic and 27 other sites across the U.S., and involved 255 people with primary or secondary progressive MS. The study was principally funded by NeuroNEXT Network, a clinical trials initiative of the National Institutes of Health, with additional support by MediciNova, the company that supplied ibudilast. The National MS Society also provided funding support. Further details are schedule to be presented Saturday, October 28 at the MSParis2017 – 7th Joint ECTRIMS-ACTRIMS Meeting. These phase 2 results may lead the way to the testing of ibudilast in larger phase 3 trial(s), which would be needed before the company could apply for marketing approval from the FDA, the European Medicines Agency or other regulatory agencies. Ibudilast was which could speed its future development as a possible treatment of progressive MS.   “These results sound like a very promising step toward a potential new therapy for people with progressive forms of MS, for whom there are few treatment options,” said Dr. Bruce Bebo, Executive Vice President, Research, National MS Society.   DETAILS  Ibudilast (MN-166, MediciNova, Inc.) inhibits an enzyme called phosphodiesterase. While considered a “New Molecular Entity” in the United States and Europe, ibudilast is marketed in Japan and Korea to treat cerebrovascular disorders and asthma. It is also being investigated in the U.S. for its potential to treat ALS and drug addiction. The study was principally funded by NeuroNEXT Network, a clinical trials initiative of the National Institutes of Health, with additional support by MediciNova, the company that will supply ibudilast. The National MS Society also provided funding support because of its focus on progressive MS and because the trial’s design may answer important questions about the best ways to measure the benefits of therapies aimed at protecting the nervous system from MS.   The trial, known as “SPRINT-MS,” was led by Principal Investigator Robert Fox, M.D., M.S., FAAN, Staff Neurologist at the Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis at Cleveland Clinic. It was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic and 27 other sites across the U.S. The trial involved 255 people with primary or secondary progressive MS. The primary outcome measure was change in brain atrophy (as measured by an MRI analysis technique called brain parenchymal fraction) after 96 weeks.  Brain atrophy (shrinkage) has been linked to cognitive and physical disability in MS. Other imaging, safety, clinical and quality of life outcomes were also measured.   The results announced in a press release from MediciNova concluded that ibudilast was well tolerated and significantly slowed the rate of brain atrophy compared to placebo. Further details are schedule to be presented on Saturday, October 28 at the MSParis2017 – 7th Joint ECTRIMS-ACTRIMS Meeting.   These phase 2 results may lead the way to the testing of ibudilast in larger phase 3 trial(s), which would be needed before the company could apply for marketing approval from the FDA, the European Medicines Agency or other regulatory agencies. Ibudilast was designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a “Fast Track Product” which could speed its future development as a possible treatment of progressive MS.

Nearly 13,000 neurologists and other researchers convened to share progress in understanding and treating neurological diseases like MS. scientific summaries (abstracts) on the AAN’s Website. Search specific words, authors or abstract numbers listed below.  Below are a few highlights of MS-related presentations focusing on stopping MS, restoring function, and ending MS forever. In most cases, studies presented are considered preliminary. Many will be analyzed more thoroughly, and likely published in peer-reviewed medical journals. Confidence in a study’s findings is reinforced when it is repeated by others, who attain similar results. Many studies presented showed the continued benefit and safety of available therapies, as well as more evidence that early and ongoing treatment with a disease-modifying therapy has long-term benefits for controlling disease activity, delaying accumulation of disability and protecting quality of life. When is it time to stop MS disease modifying medications? This question was asked by Ilya Kister, MD (New York University) and the international MSBase Registry team. Tracing 181 people who had stopped their MS medication after having no relapses or progression for at least 5 years, the team found that 24% developed relapses, 32% had disease progression, and 10.6% had both. Many (42%) restarted medication again, which was associated with a 59% reduced risk of progression. The authors noted that a larger and better controlled trial would be needed to answer the question of when to safely stop MS therapy. (Abstract P5.192) A trial funded in part by the MS Societies of the U.S. and the U.K., led by Raj Kapoor, MD (University College London) evaluated whether phenytoin, an oral epilepsy therapy, could protect against nerve damage in the retina (light sensitive layer of nerve tissue in the back of the eye). The trial involved 86 people with optic neuritis, an inflammation of the optic nerve and often the first symptom of MS. They received either phenytoin or a placebo for 3 months. On average those who received phenytoin had 30% less damage to the nerve fiber layer compared to those who received placebo. The results need confirmation in a larger study, but raise the possibility of “repurposing” a therapy already on the market with a long track record of successful use. (Abstract PL2.005) In a clinical trial in France, 154 people with primary- or secondary-progressive MS were given experimental MD1003 (concentrated biotin, a B vitamin), or placebo, for 48 weeks. The results suggested that 12.6% of those given MD1003 showed improvement in disability (using either the EDSS scale that measures disability progression, or improvement in a timed walk), versus none of those on placebo, and there were no serious safety issues reported. More research is needed to determine who might benefit from this approach. MedDay Pharma states that another trial is underway with results expected later this year. (Abstract PL2.002) Professor Alastair Compston (University of Cambridge, UK) was chosen by a committee of his peers to receive the National MS Society/American Academy of Neurology’s 2015 John Dystel Prize for Multiple Sclerosis Research. He was honored with the Prize for driving advances in immunology from the laboratory to the clinic, and for his pivotal role in an international collaboration that revolutionized MS genetics research. Fred Lublin, MD (Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for MS at Mount Sinai Med. Ctr., New York) and colleagues conducted a 3-year study involving 970 people with primary progressive MS to test the ability of fingolimod (Gilenya®) to slow progression. The disappointing results suggested that this therapy did not slow MS progression. “We need a different strategy for treating primary progressive MS,” stated Dr. Lublin. (Emerging Science Abstract 006) Why don’t immune therapies work in progressive MS? Mika Komori, MD, PhD (NIH) and team examined spinal fluid samples from 386 people with progressive and relapsing MS and people without MS to determine the numbers and characteristics of various immune cells. They observed indicators of inflammation in the spinal fluid of people with progressive MS, and that their immune cells were more likely to be embedded in the brain and spinal cord, whereas the cells in relapsing MS were circulating in the blood and lymph system. They suggest that treatments for progressive MS need to penetrate the central nervous system in order to work. (Abstract S12.001; recently ) Promising results were reported from a phase 2 clinical trial of the myelin repair strategy called anti-LINGO (Biogen). The study involved IV infusions or placebo every 4 weeks for 20 weeks to 82 people who had a first episode of optic neuritis. Optic neuritis involves inflammation of the nerve that connects to the eye, and it’s often a first signs of MS. After 24 weeks, those who had been given anti-LINGO had faster nerve signals along the optic nerve than before being given the therapy, compared to those on placebo. The speeding up of signals is thought to be an indication of myelin repair. The therapy seemed to be well tolerated except for some infusion reactions. Another phase 2 trial is ongoing in people with relapsing MS. (Abstract S56.008) Previously, a small phase I clinical trial at Cleveland Clinic led by Jeffery Cohen, MD, tested the safety of taking individuals’ own adult mesenchymal from the blood, multiplying and then injecting them in the vein. The idea is to both inhibit immune mechanisms and to augment natural tissue repair processes. Preliminary results last year suggested that this approach was safe. To see whether these cells stimulated myelin repair, the team looked at specific brain lesions before and after the infusions of stem cells using advance imaging called DTI. Compared to before treatment, measures of axon loss stabilized, hinting that the cells may have stimulated repair and/or protected nerve tissue. A follow up clinical trial is now in planning stages. (Abstract P1.152) Researchers from the Tisch MS Research Center of New York presented early findings from their ongoing trial of mesenchymal stem cells. The study involves purifying and expanding neural progenitor cells from the bone marrow and then injecting them into the spinal fluid. They reported no safety issues after treating 7 participants with one dose and 2 participants with three doses. (Abstract P7.200) Benedetta Bodini, MD (Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Paris) and international colleagues used a special method of positron emission tomography (PET) to trace the amount of myelin repair that occurred naturally in 20 people with MS and compared their results to standard measures of disease severity. They were able to define and measure changes in myelin repair and the amount of repair linked to individuals’ disease status. Further research may show PET to be a valuable way to track repair in clinical trials. (Abstract S29.008) Some research suggests that salt may increase immune activity in the brain and spinal cord in MS. A team from the National MS Society-supported Network of Pediatric MS Centers showed that this may not be the case in children. Looking at salt intake prior to diagnosis among 174 children or adolescents with MS, compared with 337 people without the disease, they saw no increased risk of developing MS with excess sodium intake. More research is needed to understand if, when and how salt becomes a factor in MS. (Abstract S38.003)  In a small study, Dr. Rocco Totaro, MD, and team (University of L’Aquila, Italy) tested whether a six-week diet (low in saturated animal fats and high in antioxidants) was associated with positive changes in body composition and fatigue in 17 people with relapsing-remitting MS. In their study, the percentage of body fat decreased, and fatigue lessened significantly. Larger studies are needed to determine how diet may impact MS symptoms and disease activity. (Abstract P2.211) In a small study, 20 people with MS with mild to moderate disability used the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus to do balance exercises 5 times a week for 32 sessions. Francesco Patti, MD (University of Catania, Italy) and team reported improvement in several measures of balance and postural control. (Abstract P3.212)  Having MS along with other health conditions can influence disease course and symptoms. Ruth Ann Marrie, MD, PhD (University of Manitoba) and team tracked 949 people with MS in Canada. Nearly half developed over 2 years of study, and over one-third developed fatigue. Those with the worst pain also had comorbidities including COPD, anxiety or autoimmune thyroid disease. was reported by 29%, and depression made worse over time. Understanding how make symptoms worse should lead to better ways to address them. (Abstract P1.114) Aliza Ben-Zacharia, DrNP (Mount Sinai, New York) examined the relationship between being substantially overweight (obese) and MS disease activity in 150 people with MS. They found the odds of having increased disability progression was 8 times greater in those who were obese versus those who were not. Having new brain MRI lesions was also more likely in those considered overweight or obese. This study does not prove that obesity causes progression, but it may offer additional health incentives to lose weight. about eating well. (Abstract P2.212) Bianca Cersosimo and colleagues (State University of New York, Stony Brook) evaluated behavior problems in 145 kids with MS. They found behavior issues to be apparent in 68% of children, most often attention problems. Those with cognitive impairments reported higher rates of behavior problems in school. Managing these problems early can greatly benefit a child’s experience in school. The Society’s Network of Pediatric MS Centers of Excellence provides a handbook for and .(Abstract P4.025) Jill Settle, MA (VA Medical Center, Washington, DC) and colleagues looked at 2,633 male veterans with MS to determine whether marital status would have anything to do with disease progression. Men who were never married needed to use a cane or wheelchair more quickly following symptom onset than those who were married at any point. This study does not show causation, but since marriage has been associated with quality of life improvements in other chronic diseases, it may show the importance of these improvements. (Abstract P5.199)   Previous studies suggest that caffeine may protect against Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, but there haven’t been definitive studies in MS. An international team led by Ellen Mowry, MD (Johns Hopkins University) looked at coffee consumption in two large data sets – a group of 1,629 Swedish people with MS and 2,807 people without MS, and 584 people with MS and 581 people without MS enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente health plan of Northern California. In the Swedish study, drinking 6 cups of coffee a day was associated with a reduced risk of developing MS, and four cups a day did the same in the American study. Studies like this may help determine how to prevent MS in the future, but don’t speak to whether or how drinking coffee may impact MS in people who already have the disease. (Abstract S45.004) Research into impacts of gut bacteria presents the exciting possibility that probiotic strategies may ultimately be developed to treat MS. A small pilot grant from the National MS Society helped launch the MS Microbiome Consortium of researchers in California, Colorado, and New York. Early findings from an analysis of blood and stool samples from people with MS treated with glatiramer acetate, untreated individuals, and people without MS showed differences in gut bacteria between those treated and untreated, and those with MS and without MS. The team has a new Collaborative MS Research Center Award from the Society to pursue this promising research. (Abstract P2.205) Stephanie Tankou, MD, PhD (Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston) and colleagues looked for a link between gut bacteria and blood levels of vitamin D in 43 people with MS who had not yet begun treatment with a disease-modifying therapy. In this first analysis, they found that higher vitamin D levels were linked to increased amounts of a particular type of bacteria thought to have anti-inflammatory properties (ruminococcaceae). More analyses are under way that should help shed light on these findings. (Abstract P2.206) Smoking has been linked to higher risk of MS and to making MS more progressive. In a pilot research project funded by the National MS Society, Walter Royal III, MD (University of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore) and team exposed mice to cigarette smoke. The smoke increased inflammation and oxidative stress compared to mice that were not exposed. While more work needs to be done, this could be an explanation for the increased risk of MS in smokers (Abstract P2.193) Gilenya is a registered trade mark of Novartis AG Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

Ofatumumab is self-administered as a monthly under-the-skin injection. According to a company press release, the studies met their primary and key secondary endpoints, significantly reducing the annual relapse rates compared to Aubagio. Details about side effects were not provided in the press release. Safety is said to be in line with those observed in a previous phase 2 study, which reported chiefly injection-site reactions as the most common adverse event. Further details will be presented at the 2019 Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS (ECTRIMS) in September. The company plans to apply to drug regulatory agencies by the end of this year.   DETAILS Multiple sclerosis involves an immune system attack on the brain and spinal cord. Ofatumumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a docking site (CD20) on immune B cells (lymphocytes) and depletes them. B cells are among immune cells that have been implicated in causing nervous system damage in MS. One B-cell therapy currently approved by the FDA to treat MS is Ocrevus (Genentech). In an earlier phase II study in people with relapsing MS, ofatumumab significantly reduced disease activity seen on MRI scans -- May 15, 2018; 90 (20).   Two identical phase 3 studies (ACLEPIOS I and II) were conducted for up to 30 months and involved 1,882 people with relapsing MS. Participants were randomly assigned to receive under-the-skin injections of ofatumumab, self-administered once a month, or teriflunomide, 14 mg once daily, for up to 30 months. The primary outcome that was measured was the annual rate of relapses. Secondary endpoints included time to progression of disability, rate of brain volume loss and other measures.   According to a company press release, the study met primary and key secondary endpoints, significantly reducing the annual relapse rate in adults with relapsing MS. It also met the secondary endpoint of delaying the time to disability progression. Details about side effects were not provided in the press release. Safety is said to be in line with that reported from a previous phase 2 study, which reported chiefly injection-site reactions as the most common adverse event.   Further details will be presented at the 2019 Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS (ECTRIMS) in September.

For this reason, they have not been shown to be effective in progressive forms of the disease unless a person demonstrates relapses or MRI activity caused by inflammation. Several of these agents, including and an experimental drug called Rituxan, have been studied in PPMS, but unfortunately without a positive effect on progression. There are several clinical trials either recently completed or ongoing for progressive forms of MS and some are for PPMS. Read more about .

This means people who have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. In a large clinical trial of 1651 people with secondary-progressive MS, fewer people taking Mayzent had confirmed worsening of disability progression compared to those on placebo. Mayzent also decreased the number of relapses. According to the prescribing information, the participants with non-active secondary progressive MS did not show significant benefits. Mayzent is an FDA-approved immune system-modulating therapy, taken by mouth once daily, which was designed to be more selective than Gilenya (fingolimod, Novartis International AG International AG) and potentially have fewer risks. Mayzent is thought to act by retaining certain white blood cells in the body’s lymph nodes, keeping them out of circulation and out of the the central nervous system. Mayzent also enters the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) where it may have direct anti-inflammatory and/or other effects. This approval provides another treatment option for people living with relapsing forms of MS and specifically includes people with secondary progressive MS who are continuing to experience active disease. The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials included headache, high blood pressure, and increases in liver function tests. Mayzent may increase the risk of infections, may cause macular edema (swelling in the back of the eye), and may cause transient decreases in heart rate and a decline in lung function. The prescription label will have advice about tests people should undergo before beginning to take Mayzent.  “This is an important breakthrough for people with secondary progressive MS, a type of MS that follows relapsing-remitting MS and is characterized by a worsening of symptoms and disability over time,” said Kathy Costello, MS, ANP-BC, MSCN, Associate Vice President of Healthcare Access at the National MS Society. “We are grateful that there is a new treatment option for people with active secondary progressive MS, and we are hopeful that this approval will stimulate development of more treatments for progressive MS.”   Download the full prescribing information and Medication Guide (.pdf)   The FDA has approved Mayzent (siponimod - Novartis International AG) for use in the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of MS, including (an initial neurological episode), , and active secondary MS. People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. In the clinical trial, people who had secondary progressive MS and who had experienced at least one relapse within two years before entering the study were considered “active.” Mayzent will be available as a first-line treatment, which means that there are no recommendations in the approved labeling for people to try other MS therapies before taking it. There is no requirement for first-dose monitoring in a health facility except for individuals with pre-existing heart conditions. There are recommendations for several lab and clinical tests prior to the first dose, Mayzent was approved for use in adults, and has not been tested in children with MS.   Secondary progressive MS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Many people who are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function over time. Some people with secondary progressive MS can be characterized as either active (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity) or not active, as well as with progression or without progression. The reason for these distinctions in disease course is that in the U.S., there are many disease-modifying therapies approved by the FDA for use in “relapsing forms” of MS, which includes those individuals who have secondary progressive MS and continue to have relapses and/or evidence of disease activity on MRI.   Mayzent is an FDA-approved immune system-modulating therapy that was designed to be more selective than Gilenya (fingolimod, Novartis International AG International AG). Gilenya is approved for adults and children aged 10 years or older with relapsing forms of MS to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses and to delay the accumulation of physical disability. Mayzent is thought to act by retaining certain white blood cells in the body’s lymph nodes, keeping them out of circulation and from entering the central nervous system. Mayzent also enters the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) where it may have direct anti-inflammatory and/or other effects.   Results of a 60-month, phase III clinical trial of Mayzent, involving 1,651 people with secondary progressive MS, were published in The trial met its primary endpoint of reducing the risk of disability progression compared with inactive placebo. Overall, those taking Mayzent had a 21% reduced risk of disability progression compared to those on placebo. According to the prescribing information, Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of progression in those with active secondary progressive MS, but not in those who had non-active secondary progressive MS. Secondary endpoints suggested that those on active therapy had 23% lower average change in brain volume, reduced relapse rates, and reduced MRI-detected lesion volume.   The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials included headache, high blood pressure, and increases in liver function tests. The serious adverse events reported to be more likely for those taking Mayzent included nervous system disorders and infections. Mayzent is not recommended for people with certain types of heart conditions.   includes several warnings and precautions, including the following. Mayzent: reduces white blood counts, and so may increase the risk of infections, including serious infections may cause macular edema (swelling in the back of the eye) may cause harm to a fetus, so women of childbearing potential should use contraception during and for 10 days after stopping Mayzent.  The Mayzent (pages 22-25 of the document) provides advice about symptoms to be alert to and about which individuals taking Mayzent should inform their healthcare providers.   The prescribing information contains advice to health care providers about tests people should undergo before beginning to take Mayzent. These include: Genetic blood test to determine the person’s CYP2C9 genotype, because people with some variants of these genes would need a different dose of Mayzent or should not take it at all. Other blood tests including a complete blood count and liver function tests, Blood test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus (Shingles virus). In those who are negative, VZV vaccination is recommended. History of current or prior immune-suppressing medications, which may cause Mayzent to further reduce the ability to fight infections.  Most people without pre-existing heart conditions will receive a starter pack of tablets that gradually increases the daily dose over 5 days, before taking the full recommended daily dose. People with certain pre-existing heart conditions will need 6-hour or possibly longer heart monitoring when receiving their first dose of Mayzent.   For people who qualify, Novartis plans to offer patient assistance programs through The Novartis Patient Assistance Foundation: 1-800-277-2254 or https://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/our-products/patient-assistance/patient-assistance-foundation-enrollment.   Download the full prescribing information and Medication Guide (.pdf)   Mayzent is a registered trademark of Novartis International AG. Gilenya is a registered trademark of Novartis International AG     A. The FDA has approved Mayzent for the treatment of adults with (an initial neurological episode), and relapsing forms of MS, including and active secondary MS. People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. In the clinical trial, people who had secondary progressive MS and who had experienced at least one relapse within two years before entering the study were considered “active.”   A. The approval includes clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing forms of MS, including relapsing remitting MS and active secondary progressive MS. According to the prescribing information, Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of progression in those with active secondary progressive MS, but not in those who had non-active (without relapses) secondary progressive MS.   Like all clinical trials, the trial of Mayzent in secondary progressive MS limited the characteristics of people who could participate. The trial only included people who were aged 18 to 60, who had an EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale – a scale to assess neurological functioning used in clinical trials) score of 3.0 (meaning they were fully ambulatory but had  other functional limitations) up to 6.5 (meaning they were able to walk with the help of a walker or bilateral crutches or other devices on both sides). It is not possible to predict how a specific individual will respond to treatment. The use of Mayzent in clinical practice will help determine who is likely to benefit.   A. Mayzent is a tablet administered by mouth once daily.   Q. When will Mayzent be available by prescription? A. According to Novartis, people may talk to their MS healthcare providers now about taking Mayzent. The company expects supplies of the therapy to be available within a week of the approval. Accessing the medication also depends on issues related to an individual’s health insurance.   Q. Are there other therapies available for people with secondary progressive MS? A. Yes, depending on the type of secondary progressive MS they have. Secondary progressive MS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Many people who are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function over time. Some people with secondary progressive MS can be characterized as either active (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity) or not active, as well as with progression or without progression. Many available disease-modifying therapies are approved for use in “relapsing forms” of MS, which includes those individuals who have secondary progressive MS and who continue to have relapses and/or evidence of disease activity on MRI.   Q. Should individuals with relapsing forms of MS switch from their current therapy to Mayzent? A. The decision about whether to take Mayzent should be made in collaboration with the healthcare provider treating your MS, taking into account a variety of factors including the effectiveness of any therapy you are currently using, the potential risks and benefits, as well as costs and lifestyle factors. Important questions to be considered and discussed with your healthcare provider in terms of Mayzent include: What health conditions do I have that might discourage the switch to Mayzent? What is my tolerance for the risk of known side effects? What is my tolerance for the risk of adverse consequences that might emerge with longer-term use? How will my medication choice affect my ability or plans to become pregnant?   Q. If I have been taking another disease-modifying therapy for MS, how long will I have to wait before starting ? A.  Mayzent clears out of the system 10 days after the last dose. A decision to wait or proceed after that time needs to be made in collaboration with your MS healthcare provider   Q. Has Mayzent been proven to be more effective than other disease-modifying therapies? A. There is no evidence yet to answer this question, since Mayzent has only been compared to inactive placebo in clinical trials.   A. There is no specified time limit for taking Mayzent. As with other disease-modifying medications, Mayzent would likely be continued if the person’s MS is stable, and she/he is experiencing no adverse events or new safety issues that could be ascribed to the medication.   Q. Will people taking have to get any special medical tests or monitoring? A. Yes. The prescribing information contains advice to health care providers about tests people should undergo before beginning to take Mayzent. These include: Blood test for genetic testing to determine the person’s CYP2C9 genotype, because people with some variants of these genes would need a different dose of Mayzent or should not take it at all. Blood test for complete blood count and liver enzymes Blood test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus. In those who are negative, VZV vaccination is recommended. History of current or prior immune-suppressing medications, which may cause Mayzent to further reduce the ability to fight infections.  Most people without pre-existing heart conditions will receive a starter pack of tablets that gradually increases the daily dose over 5 days, before taking the full recommended daily dose. People with certain pre-existing heart conditions will need 6-hour or possibly longer heart monitoring when receiving their first dose of Mayzent.   Q. Will Mayzent help my mobility, prevent me from getting worse or reverse my progressive disability? A. Based on results from the clinical trials, Mayzent is likely to help stabilize a person’s disability progression. We do not know if will reverse an individual’s disability. In the phase 3 trial for secondary progressive MS, treatment with Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability. This reduced risk of progression means that as a group, people taking Mayzent were 21% less likely to demonstrate worsening of disability than people taking placebo. However, it is not possible to predict how any one individual will respond to this or any other therapy.   A. The wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of Mayzent is $88,500 per year. However, the price to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs. Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans.

Are there other therapies in development for progressive MS? A. Yes. The National MS Society is closely watching experimental treatments in development for people with progressive forms of MS. In addition, other studies include: Investigators at Oregon Health & Science University are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial to determine if the oral supplement, lipoic acid, is an effective treatment for progressive forms of MS. The trial is co-funded by the Veteran’s Administration and the National MS Society. The SPRINT-MS trial of Ibudilast, an oral anti-inflammatory agent, demonstrated that it was well tolerated and significantly slowed the rate of brain atrophy compared to placebo in people with secondary progressive and primary progressive MS. This trial was a unique collaboration between NIH's NeuroNEXT Network, MediciNova, and the National MS Society. The MS-STAT2 study is underway at University College London, a multicenter trial testing whether a repurposed cholesterol-lowering therapy can slow the course of secondary progressive MS; the Society is providing funding.  The Society is also very interested in wellness research to identify exercise, dietary and other approaches that will help people who have MS live their best lives. The Society supports several clinical trials that are investigating dietary interventions for symptom management and for their potential to modify the disease process.    Based on these trial results, is there still a need to invest in additional research on progressive MS? A: Yes. We need to continue our investment in research to find solutions for progressive MS.  We welcome this development, but we must remain focused on finding more and better solutions for treating progressive MS. We will do this by our continued leadership in the International  and by funding research on progressive MS through our own research programs, and by encouraging other companies to commit to developing treatments for progressive forms of MS.   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

It is designed to hamper movement of potentially damaging immune cells from the bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord. This clinical trial, sponsored by Biogen, involved people with who had not experienced relapses in the two years before enrolling in the study. Of about 85 percent of people who are initially diagnosed with , many will eventually transition to secondary-progressive MS, which means that after a period of time in which they experience relapses and remissions, the disease will begin to progress more steadily, with or without relapses. Although many of the MS disease-modifying therapies are approved for “relapsing forms” of MS, which includes people with secondary-progressive MS who experience relapses, there are few options for those with progressive forms of MS in the absence of relapses.   A total of 889 participants with secondary-progressive MS were recruited in 15 countries worldwide, and were randomly assigned to receive either natalizumab 300 mg or placebo, infused into the vein every four weeks, for a total of 96 weeks. Most of the participants had EDSS disability scores of 6 to 6.5, meaning they required a walking aid. The primary endpoint established for the trial was to determine whether Tysabri could slow the accumulation of disability, as determined by a “composite” measure. This measure combined results from the EDSS scale of disability, the 9-hole Peg Test of upper extremity function, and the Timed 25-Foot Walk test of mobility and leg function. According to the press release, the study did not meet its primary endpoint of slowing progression measured by the composite measure of disability, results from the 9-Hole Peg Test suggested that Tysabri slowed the loss of function in the arms and hands.

The trial, known as the SYNERGY study, did not meet its primary endpoint of improving measures of physical function (including walking, upper limb coordination), cognitive function, or disability. The trial involved 418 people with relapsing MS (including relapsing-remitting and secondary-progressive MS) who were taking interferon beta-1a (Avonex) plus one of several doses of intravenous opicinumab or inactive placebo for 72 weeks.   LINGO is a protein seen in neurons and myelin-producing cells (oligodendrocytes), and blockading this protein with opicinumab has been shown to promote myelin repair in animal models. Another Phase 2 clinical trial of opicinumab was positive. It involved people who had experienced optic neuritis, which is often the first clinical episode of MS.     Extensive testing and monitoring during the SYNERGY study were undertaken to pinpoint the patient population, dosage and outcome measures that would inform the design of future trials. After analyzing results, the team found better treatment responses among individuals who had MS for less than 20 years, and who had specific findings on two imaging techniques (magnetic transfer ratio and diffusion tensor imaging) which might indicate myelin damage with more intact nerve fibers.   Now, a new study is ongoing (finished recruiting), which has enrolled 263 participants with relapsing MS who experienced their first MS symptom within the past 20 years, and met the imaging criteria defined by evaluating data from the SYNERGY trial. involves people who are using a disease-modifying therapy, plus either opicinumab or inactive placebo.

Other terms used to refer to ADEM include post-infectious encephalomyelitis and immune-mediated encephalomyelitis. ADEM is sometimes difficult to distinguish from multiple sclerosis (MS) because the symptoms common to both ""demyelinating"" disorders include loss of vision, weakness, numbness and loss of balance. Both ADEM and MS involve immune-mediated responses to myelin in the brain and spinal cord.   The cause of ADEM is not clear but in more than half of the cases, symptoms appear following a viral or bacterial infection, usually a sore throat or cough and very rarely following vaccination. ADEM is thought to be an autoimmune condition where the body’s immune system mistakenly identifies its own healthy cells and tissues as foreign and mounts an attack against them. This attack results in inflammation. Auto-antibodies directed against a component of myelin called myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) are found in 36-64% of children with ADEM. Most cases of ADEM begin about 4 to 14 days after an infection. In some cases of ADEM, no preceding event is identified. Although ADEM can appear at any age, children are more likely than adults to develop it. More than 80 percent of childhood cases occur in patients younger than 10 years. Most of the remaining cases occur between the ages of 10 and 20 but ADEM is sometimes (rarely) diagnosed in adults. ADEM is thought to affect 1 in every 125,000 to 250,000 individuals in a given year. Five percent of these cases could be associated with vaccination. ADEM appears a little more frequently in boys than girls (about 60 percent of the time) with a male to female ratio of 1.3:1. ADEM occurs in all parts of the world and in all ethnic groups. In most but not all cases, ADEM occurs only once, while patients with MS have further, repeated attacks of inflammation in their brains and spinal cords. In most cases, ADEM patients do not develop new scars on a repeat MRI scan whereas MS patients typically experience new scars on their follow-up MRI scans. Typical symptoms of ADEM such as fever, headache and confusion, vomiting, and seizures are not usually seen in people with MS, although they can be seen in pediatric MS onset especially in patients younger than 11 years. Sometimes the pattern of MRI abnormalities helps differentiate these two disorders. Most patients with MS are treated with ongoing medication to prevent attacks. Patients with ADEM generally do not require such medication. ADEM occurs more frequently in males; MS more frequently in females. ADEM is more common in children; MS is more common in adults.

Within the CNS, the immune system attacks myelin — the fatty substance that surrounds and insulates the nerve fibers — as well as the nerve fibers themselves. When myelin is damaged or destroyed, the ability of nerves to conduct electrical impulses to and from the brain is disrupted, producing the various symptoms of MS. Learn more about what MS is and its impact on the CNS. There are 4 disease courses, each of which might active or not active, and with or without progression. The exact cause of MS is unknown. Most researchers believe that the damage to myelin is immune-mediated, that is, it results from an abnormal response by the body’s immune system. Normally, the immune system defends the body by attacking foreign invaders such as viruses or bacteria. But in an immune-mediated response, the body attacks its own tissue.  In MS, the body attacks myelin. Scientists do not yet know what triggers the immune system to do this.  Most agree that several factors are involved, including genetics, gender, and environmental factors. Learn more about the potential .   Approximately 2.3 million people worldwide have MS. Worldwide, MS occurs with much greater frequency in areas farther from the equator.  However, prevalence rates may differ significantly even within a geographic area, where latitude and climate are fairly consistent.  These differences demonstrate that geographical factors are not the only ones involved. Learn more about .  At this time, no single test is available to identify or rule out MS.

In a pooled analysis of both phase III studies, ozanimod was not shown to slow disability progression significantly more than Avonex. According to the press release, the company will present detailed results from both studies at an upcoming medical meeting, and plans to submit a New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by the end of 2017. DETAILS Ozanimod is a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator. It is thought to act by retaining certain white blood cells in the body’s lymph nodes, keeping them out of circulation and from entering the central nervous system. In an earlier phase II trial, in 258 participants with relapsing MS, disease activity on MRI scans was reduced in people taking two different doses of ozanimod, compared to people taking placebo. (Lancet Neurology, 2016 Apr;15(4):373-81) The company reported on results from a (the SUNBEAM study) in February.   For the second phase III trial, all 1,313 participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups, taking either daily oral ozanimod (.5 mg) and an inactive placebo injected into muscle once weekly; daily oral ozanimod (1 mg) and inactive placebo injected into muscle once weekly; or Avonex and an oral placebo daily for 24 months.   The study met the primary endpoint in reducing the relapse rate over two years, as well as the secondary MRI measures of disease activity. In a pooled analysis of both phase III studies, ozanimod was not shown to slow disability progression significantly more than Avonex. A very low rate of disability progression was observed in all three treatment groups. There were significant reductions in the loss of brain tissue volume with ozanimod treatment in both studies compared with Avonex.   According to the press release, the overall safety and tolerability profile was similar to the other phase III and phase II study, but no further information was provided. The most common adverse events reported from the phase II study were respiratory infections, headache, and urinary tract infections.   The results of the RADIANCE trial were announced in a May 22, 2017 press release from Celgene Corporation. According to the press release, the company will present detailed results from both studies at an upcoming medical meeting, and plans to submit a New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by the end of 2017.   Avonex is a registered trademark of Biogen, Inc.

Lead investigator Rhonda Voskuhl, MD (University of California, Los Angeles) and colleagues reported these findings today at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology. This study was funded by the National MS Society, additional private donors, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Synthetic Biologics, a Maryland pharmaceutical company, provided the estriol for the trial at no charge. MS affects women two to three times as often as men. This demographic observation along with a series of other gender differences prompted the National MS Society to launch a special five-year, $10 million research initiative to explore the importance of the meaning behind these observations as they apply to the MS disease process. Among the findings from the 50 projects supported through this initiative was the possibility that the female hormone estriol may help protect against the immune attacks that underlie MS. Read more about this success. Estriol levels naturally rise significantly during later pregnancy, a time when many women’s MS disease activity declines. This led some to suspect that estriol may be responsible for this easing of symptoms during pregnancy. Dr. Voskuhl and others explored this lead in mice with an MS-like disease. Later, with National MS Society support, Dr. Voskuhl conducted a small, early-phase trial of estriol in 12 women with relapsing-remitting MS. Results suggested that estriol might decrease disease activity. The phase 2 study of estriol combined with Copaxone that was reported today was a direct result of this initiative. Phase 2 trials such as this one are designed to provide information about a therapy’s safety and potential effectiveness, but longer, larger Phase 3 studies are needed to confirm potential benefits and risks and to gain approval from drug regulators such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Estriol is one of several estrogen sex hormones in the body. Some forms of estrogen are available for prescription as methods of birth control and for the treatment of symptoms associated with menopause. Estriol has been used in Europe and Asia as a treatment for symptoms of menopause. The oral form of estriol used in this trial is not available in the United States. Investigators recruited 164 women with relapsing-remitting MS between the ages of 18-50 at 16 sites across the U.S. All participants were on standard Copaxone therapy (injected daily under the skin) and were randomly assigned to also take estriol in pill form, or inactive placebo, for two years. The primary outcome measured was the effects of the treatment combination on relapse rates. Secondary outcomes included several clinical and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), measures of disability progression and cognitive function. There were also  laboratory and gynecological tests built into the study to monitor for potential safety issues associated with the use of estriol and other estrogen hormones, including breast and endometrial (uterine) cancers. The preliminary results showed that the combination of Copaxone and estriol appeared safe over the two-year trial period, and there were no severe adverse events experienced by those in either treatment group. After the first year of the study, those on the combined therapy had a significant reduction in relapse rates compared to those on Copaxone plus placebo, and secondary cognitive testing suggested possible benefit for those on the combined treatment. However, after the second year of the study, there was no statistical difference in relapse rates between those on Copaxone combined with estriol versus those on Copaxone combined with placebo. Since these are preliminary results that were presented at a medical meeting, without peer review as of yet, we are likely to learn more about the significance and implications of the study’s results when the full findings are published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. “These preliminary results are intriguing and invite further research,” noted Timothy Coetzee, PhD, Chief Advocacy, Services, and Research Officer of the National MS Society. “We look forward to seeing the full data when it is published in a medical journal, which should help determine next best steps for the possible development of estriol as a potential therapy for women with MS.”   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

Most showed signs of clinical or MRI inflammatory activity in the year prior to the procedure. Five years after the procedure, 42% of participants were stable with no further progression of disability that was reduced to 30% 10 years after transplant. No relapses or inflammatory activity occurred on MRI scans after treatment. These results suggest that HSCT might be appropriate in a subgroup of people with SPMS that have significant inflammatory activity as measured by MRI. Further study in larger numbers are needed to understand who among those with secondary progressive MS might benefit from HSCT.  attempts to “reboot” the immune system, which is involved in damaging the brain and spinal cord in MS. In HSCT for MS, hematopoietic (blood cell-producing) stem cells, which are derived from a person’s own (scientifically referred to as “autologous”) bone marrow, are collected and stored, prior to depleting much of the immune system using chemotherapy drugs. Then the stored hematopoietic stem cells are reintroduced to the body and over time reconstitute the immune system. The primary outcome of this study was absence of further disease progression, which was achieved in 42% of participants at 5 years, and 30% at 10 years. In another 10 participants, disease progressed once, and then stabilized. The other 6 experienced disease progression to severe disability. No deaths or life-threatening complications occurred. Two people developed autoimmune thyroid inflammation, and one person who had previously been treated with cell-inhibiting therapies developed myelodysplastic syndrome (a type of cancer). The most common adverse events were fever, gastrointestinal effects, and viruses/infections. In HSCT, conditioning (immunosuppressive) regimes can vary from low to medium to high intensity. This study used an intermediate-intensity regimen known as BEAM. A new HSCT trial using the BEAM regimen is with relapsing-remitting MS.

Ofatumumab is self-administered as a monthly under-the-skin injection. According to a company press release, the studies met their primary and key secondary endpoints, significantly reducing the annual relapse rates compared to Aubagio. Details about side effects were not provided in the press release. Safety is said to be in line with those observed in a previous phase 2 study, which reported chiefly injection-site reactions as the most common adverse event. Further details will be presented at the 2019 Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS (ECTRIMS) in September. The company plans to apply to drug regulatory agencies by the end of this year.   DETAILS Multiple sclerosis involves an immune system attack on the brain and spinal cord. Ofatumumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a docking site (CD20) on immune B cells (lymphocytes) and depletes them. B cells are among immune cells that have been implicated in causing nervous system damage in MS. One B-cell therapy currently approved by the FDA to treat MS is Ocrevus (Genentech). In an earlier phase II study in people with relapsing MS, ofatumumab significantly reduced disease activity seen on MRI scans -- May 15, 2018; 90 (20).   Two identical phase 3 studies (ACLEPIOS I and II) were conducted for up to 30 months and involved 1,882 people with relapsing MS. Participants were randomly assigned to receive under-the-skin injections of ofatumumab, self-administered once a month, or teriflunomide, 14 mg once daily, for up to 30 months. The primary outcome that was measured was the annual rate of relapses. Secondary endpoints included time to progression of disability, rate of brain volume loss and other measures.   According to a company press release, the study met primary and key secondary endpoints, significantly reducing the annual relapse rate in adults with relapsing MS. It also met the secondary endpoint of delaying the time to disability progression. Details about side effects were not provided in the press release. Safety is said to be in line with that reported from a previous phase 2 study, which reported chiefly injection-site reactions as the most common adverse event.   Further details will be presented at the 2019 Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS (ECTRIMS) in September.

f1a85ab5-944d-4ecf-af53-1ebbd882f6c3,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS       Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, progressive disease that leads to increasing disability in many individuals. Approximately 85 percent of individuals initially present with a  relapsing-remitting course of the disease (). Most people with relapsing remitting MS transition to a more progressive course called secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) that is characterized by accumulation of disability with fewer relapses. About 10 to 15 percent of people with MS begin the disease with a progressive course, without relapses, known as primary progressive MS (PPMS). In 2013, the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS identified four MS  (. In 2020 this group further clarified the concepts underlying these disease courses, highlighting the need for time framing the disease course modifiers “activity” and “progression” (). The Committee also clarified the terms “worsening” and “progression” and provided guidance for their use. Although not considered a course of MS, radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) has been used to describe asymptomatic individuals who have MRI clinical features that are suggestive of MS and are therefore at an increased risk of developing MS (). In a global study of 451 people with RIS, 51.2% went on to develop MS within ten years and several predictive factors of future clinical events were described (). Research to further define these predictive factors could inform clinical management of RIS. Trials are now underway in people with RIS to determine if disease-modifying therapies will prevent or delay the development of MS, including: Randomized, Double-Blinded Study of Treatment: Teriflunomide, in Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (TERIS) Assessment of Tecfidera® in Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS) (ARISE) Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) Vaccine in Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS) Diagnosis & Management Healthcare Professional App Download this FREE tool and resource that provides a concise compilation of current, easy-to-reference, evidence-based information.

This page focuses on research related to “mesenchymal stem cells” and “induced pluripotent stem cells” in MS. “Mesenchymal stem cells” are adult stem cells found in several places in the body, including the bone marrow, skin and fat tissue. “Induced pluripotent stem cells” or iPSC. These are adult stem cells such as skin cells which are “induced” or programmed in the laboratory to become stem cells. Research on Adult Mesenchymal Stem Cells to Reduce MS Disease Activity and Augment Repair Adult mesenchymal stem cells are being tested in clinical trials in MS. A person’s own mesenchymal stem cells are isolated from the bone marrow or blood stream and multiplied in the lab, and then re-introduced in greater numbers into their body. Alternatively, the cells are sometimes treated prior to transfer to potentially enhance their ability to suppress nervous system-damaging immune responses and/or promote myelin repair. Only when the results of clinical trials are available will it be possible to determine what the optimal cells, delivery methods, safety and actual effectiveness of this experimental approach might be for people with MS.   Mesenchymal stem cells are being tested in several clinical trials including:   • in February 2018 from a small, open label, phase 1 stem cell trial at the Tisch MS Research Center of New York. This trial used 20 individuals’own mesenchymal stem cells to derive more specific stem cells called “neural progenitor cells.” The cells were expanded in the laboratory and then injected into the space around the spinal cord (intrathecal). The goal was to inhibit immune mechanisms and to augment tissue repair. The team reported mild to moderate headache and fever as the most common side effects, and for the primary outcome of the study, which was safety, they reported no serious adverse events. Although the study was not designed to determine potential benefits of this therapy, the team reported clinical observations including some improvements in EDSS scores, strength in some muscle groups, walking speeds and bladder symptoms. Larger, longer-term, controlled studies are needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of using this approach to treat MS.  The Tisch Center team has launched a phase II trial of this therapy. The National MS Society has agreed to partially support this trial of intrathecal stem cells in progressive MS. THIS TRIAL IS RECRUITING PARTICIPANTS. READ MORE AT CLINICALTRIALS.GOV      • A team from Israel’s Hadassah University Hospital has been conducting a phase 2 clinical trial to establish the optimal way to administer mesenchymal stem cells in active, progressive MS. Participants are people with progressive MS with moderate to more severe disability (EDSS scale 3.5-6.5). They are administering the cells into the vein or the spinal fluid and then monitoring patients with various measures to try to detect a benefit and to find the best route for administering these cells. As of a given at a medical conference (ECTRIMS) in September 2016, of 39 enrolled people, they have not found serious adverse events, with the most common side effect being headache. .  • A phase 1/2 trial of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells in 60 participants with MS is underway at the University of Jordan. Participants receive intrathecal injection of cells with or without the addition of physical therapy, or receive physical therapy alone.   • A clinical trial involving IV infusion of participants’ own mesenchymal cells is taking place at the Health Sciences Centre in Winnepeg, Manitoba, and at the Ottawa Hospital in Ontario. The trial involves 40 participants with active MS.   • A phase 1/2 clinical trial is testing IV infusion of participants’ own mesenchymal cells. The trial involves 30 people with active MS, and is taking place at three sites in Spain: University Hospital Reina Sofia in Córdoba, University Regional Hospital Carlos Haya in Málaga, and University Hospital Virgen Macarena in Sevilla. . • A small, open-label, phase 1  at Cleveland Clinic tested the ability of an individual’s own mesenchymal stem cells to both inhibit immune mechanisms and to augment intrinsic tissue repair processes in people with relapsing forms of MS. They were given intravenously (infused into the vein). This study was led by Dr. Jeffrey A. Cohen and supported by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs. The National MS Society provided support for a pilot study related to this trial to compare stem cells from people with MS and controls without MS, looking at how the cells survive and function, to enhance understanding from this stem cell trial. This trial, which was designed to evaluate safety and not designed to determine benefits, was completed and preliminary results were  in April 2017, suggesting that this approach was safe and warrants longer, larger trials. A phase 2 followup study has just begun. It is an open-label study of repeated intrathecal administration of NurOwn (Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells Secreting Neurotrophic Factors, MSC-NTF) at Cleveland Clinic and Stanford University in people with progressive MS. The study is being sponsored by BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. THIS TRIAL IS  RECRUITING PARTICIPANTS IN CALIFORNIA   • A Phase 1 trial allogenic human neural stem cells in secondary progressive MS is underway in Italy and Switzerland. The trial is testing four different dosages injected into the brain.   • A phase 1/2a open label study of escalating doses of intrathecal SCM-010 (adipose derived expanded mesenchymal cells) in secondary progressive MS at the Tel Aviv Medical Center in Israel. • A small, open label, phase 1  of stem cells derived from placenta (known as “PDA-001” manufactured by Celgene Cellular Therapeutics) was completed in 2014, and results suggested this approach was safe. The study involved 16 people with relapsing-remitting or secondary-progressive MS at sites in the U.S. and Canada. This study was designed to evaluate safety and not designed to show effectiveness. Larger, longer-term, controlled studies are needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of using stem cells to treat MS. When the results of these and subsequent clinical trials are available, it should be possible to determine what the optimal cells, delivery methods, safety and actual effectiveness of these current experimental therapies might be for different people with MS.    Research on Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) for Nervous System Repair and Disease Modeling Another line of stem cell research in MS relates to efforts to repair nervous system damage directly with stem cells that may replace the cells that make myelin, the protective cover on nerve wires which is damaged during MS, and nerve cells that have been destroyed. One exciting avenue being explored in early stages is the concept of taking samples of a person’s skin cells or other cells and turning them into stem cells. These cells are called “induced pluripotent stem cells” or iPSC. The potential advantage of this approach is that it’s possible such cells would not be rejected by the person’s immune system, and this approach bypasses possible ethical concerns connected with human embryonic stem cells. Research using iPSCs is still in its infancy as studies proceed to determine whether any types of stem cells can reverse MS damage and restore function. Read more about efforts to repair the nervous system. Researchers are also beginning to explore the usefulness of iPSCs for furthering our understanding of MS disease processes. In this approach, stem cells are created by reprogramming skin or other types of cells from people with MS. These are then grown in lab dishes to create “MS in a dish,” enabling close study of possible abnormalities in various types of cells. This approach also holds potential for testing possible therapies.

The results demonstrated that ibudilast was well tolerated and significantly slowed the rate of brain atrophy compared to placebo. Brain atrophy (shrinkage) has been linked to cognitive and physical disability in MS. The trial was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic and 27 other sites across the U.S., and involved 255 people with primary or secondary progressive MS. The study was principally funded by the NIH’s NeuroNEXT Network, a clinical trials initiative of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, with additional support by MediciNova, Inc. and the National MS Society. These phase 2 results may lead the way to the testing of ibudilast in larger phase 3 trial(s), which would be needed before the company could apply for marketing approval from the FDA, the European Medicines Agency or other regulatory agencies. Ibudilast was  which could speed its future development as a possible treatment of progressive MS.   “These results are a promising step toward a potential new therapy for people living with progressive forms of MS, for whom there are few treatment options. It is gratifying to see our investments in progressive MS starting to pay off.” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research, National MS Society.    Ibudilast (MN-166, MediciNova, Inc.) inhibits an enzyme called phosphodiesterase, and has been shown to regulate immune pathways that can damage the central nervous system, promote myelin repair, and help protect nerve cells from damage in MS. While considered a “New Molecular Entity” in the United States and Europe, ibudilast is marketed in Asia to treat post-stroke vertigo and asthma. It is also being investigated in the U.S. for its potential to treat ALS and drug addiction. A previous clinical trial of ibudilast in relapsing MS suggested that while it did not prevent new brain lesions, it appeared to slow the progression of brain atrophy (shrinkage). The current ibudilast trial was principally funded by the NIH’s NeuroNEXT Network, a clinical trials initiative of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, with additional support by MediciNova, Inc., the company that supplied ibudilast. The National MS Society also provided funding support because of the focus on progressive MS and because the trial’s design had potential to answer important questions about the best ways to measure the benefits of therapies aimed at protecting the nervous system from MS.   The trial, known as “SPRINT-MS,” was led by Robert Fox, MD, Staff Neurologist at the Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis at Cleveland Clinic. It was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic and 27 other sites across the U.S. The trial involved 255 participants; about half had primary progressive MS, and the other half had secondary progressive MS. Participants were randomly assigned to be administered oral ibudilast or inactive placebo. About one-third of the participants continued their treatment with an injected disease-modifying therapy (either glatiramer acetate or interferon beta) during the trial.   The primary outcome measure was change in brain atrophy (as measured by an MRI analysis technique called brain parenchymal fraction) after 96 weeks. Brain atrophy has been linked to cognitive and physical disability in MS. Other outcomes measured including additional advanced imaging, safety, clinical and quality of life outcomes.   After 96 weeks, those who were taking ibudilast had a slower rate of brain atrophy compared to those on placebo. The difference was statistically significant, with a 48% reduction in the rate of atrophy in the treated group compared to the placebo group. There were no major safety issues reported.

Top-line results were announced in August 2019, and details have now been published in the peer-reviewed New England Journal of Medicine. Novartis has applied for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Ofatumumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a docking site (CD20) on some immune B cells and depletes them. B cells are among immune cells that have been implicated in causing nervous system damage in MS. One B-cell therapy currently approved to treat MS is Ocrevus (Genentech). Two identical phase 3 studies (ACLEPIOS I and II) were conducted for up to 30 months. Participants were randomly assigned to receive ofatumumab, self-injected once a month, or daily oral teriflunomide for up to 30 months. As a control, the groups also received placebo versions of ofatumumab or teriflunomide. The primary outcome measured was the annual rate of relapses. Secondary endpoints included time to progression of disability, rate of brain volume loss and other measures. The studies achieved the primary outcome, meaning that ofatumumab reduced annual relapses significantly more than teriflunomide. Disability worsening at three and six months, and disease activity on MRI scans, were also reduced significantly more in the groups receiving ofatumumab. Brain tissue loss was not reduced significantly more in the ofatumumab group. Adverse events that occurred in at least 10% of participants in groups taking ofatumumab included injection-related reactions, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection. Appendicitis occurred in 8 people in ofatumumab groups and 2 in the teriflunomide groups; this had not occurred in previous studies. Novartis has applied to the FDA for approval of ofatumumab to treat MS, and a decision is expected in September 2020. “Ofatumumab versus Teriflunomide in Multiple Sclerosis” is published by Stephen L.

HAM is also referred to as chronic progressive myelopathy or tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP). An estimated 5-20 million people in the world are infected with HTLV-1. Although the HTLV-1 virus is present throughout the world, infection with the virus is endemic in some geographical areas — the Caribbean, southern Japan, areas of Africa that are near the equator, and the Seychelles. Other areas that have a high rate of infection include Central and South America, Melanesia and southern Africa. The HTLV-1 virus is transmitted (passed) from an infected person to a non-infected person through bodily secretions and blood. It can be transmitted by sexual contact, via the blood through fresh blood transfusions or through re-use of contaminated needles or passed from mother to child through breast-feeding. You spread HTLV-1 by casual contact, such as shaking hands, hugging, and sharing homes and workplace, including bathrooms. The transmission of the virus can be decreased through safe sex practices (i.e. condoms or abstinence from intercourse) and avoiding needle sharing. Women who test positive for the virus should not breast feed. Healthcare practitioners should use caution when handling sharp instruments or handling bodily secretions from an infected person. The great majority people who test positive for the HTLV-1 virus do not go on to get active disease; these individuals are called carriers.   Of the 5-20 million people infected with the HTLV-1 virus worldwide, approximately 0.25 to 3 percent of the infected individuals will develop HAM/TSP. (An additional two percent of people infected with the HTLV-1 virus will develop a serious blood cancer (adult T-cell leukemia or lymphoma).) The great majority of individuals infected with the HTLV-1 virus will never exhibit signs or symptoms of disease. However, in some people who are infected with the HTLV-1 virus, inflammation (swelling) occurs in the spinal cord; the immune system's attack on the virus involves sending cells called lymphocytes to the affected area. These lymphocytes release chemicals called cytokines, which not only kill the infected cells but can also cause damage to the nerves. When the immune system's response to the virus causes nerve damage in the spinal cord, the legs gradually lose strength and flexibility. The symptoms of HAM/TSP usually appear between the ages of 30 and 50 but may occur earlier. The disease has been known to appear in childhood, but this is very rare. The disease may remain undetected for years after infection begins but can still be transmitted to another person during this time.   Many of the symptoms of HAM/TSP are also found in people who have been diagnosed with MS. The clinical course of HAM/TSP is most similar to the primary-progressive form of MS (PPMS) in that there is a steady worsening of neurologic functioning without any distinct relapses (also called attacks) or periods of remission.

Some of the twins with no MS symptoms showed some signs of MS-like brain lesions on MRI, and their immune profiles mimicked those of people in early stages of MS. These findings add to mounting evidence that the onset of MS is preceded by “silent” disease activity. Understanding these early signals can yield new strategies for treating and preventing disease. There is mounting evidence that MS begins below the surface, often long before any signs or symptoms emerge. Defining the constellation of hidden signals and biological markers of this MS “prodrome” will eventually enable earlier detection and treatment to prevent full-blown MS, and can also provide clues to the underlying causes of MS. This team studied a unique population of 43 sets of identical (monozygotic) twins, in which one twin had MS and the other did not. Using advanced technology allowing researchers to analyze numerous immune cells at high resolution simultaneously, they found that the so-called “immune signatures” – the pattern of immune cells – was remarkably similar between twins affected by MS and those unaffected. The team also studied twins who did not have symptoms of MS for the presence of disease activity on MRI scans, indicating increased risk of developing MS. In the subgroup of people with this activity, the researchers identified a subtle, but distinct pattern of immune cells (CD4+ T cells) known for launching immune attacks, which matched immune profiles of an unrelated group of people in early stages of MS. This study yields important clues to what might be the earliest signals of MS. Understanding these signals is the first step toward addressing them with treatment and prevention strategies.   “Immune signatures of prodromal multiple sclerosis in monozygotic twins” was published by Lisa Ann Gordes (Ludwig-Maximilians Universität München) and Luisa Klotz (University Hospital Münster) and colleagues in (published online August 17, 2020).

Even though there are few or no relapses at this point in the disease, a gradual worsening of symptoms over time is common; this worsening is known as disease progression. The term “secondary-progressive” comes from the fact that (SPMS) can only be diagnosed in a person who has previously experienced RRMS.   Because the transition from a relapsing-remitting course to a more progressive one is a gradual process, the healthcare provider will not be able to tell exactly when it is happening. If a person’s are worsening, the challenge for the provider is to determine whether: The worsening is left over from the last (in other words, permanent but stable damage that remains after the inflammatory attack has ended) — which would mean that the person is experiencing an RRMS disease course; or The disease is continuing to worsen even though the person is no longer experiencing inflammatory relapses — which would mean that the person has transitioned to a SPMS disease course.

This is the first therapy specifically approved to treat primary progressive MS. Potential safety issues identified by the FDA include infusion reactions and infections. There may be an increased risk of malignancy in people taking Ocrevus. More information about Ocrevus is available from Genentech:  1-844-OCREVUS (9am-8pm Eastern) Additional details and Frequently Asked Questions below DETAILS The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab - Genentech, a member of the Roche Group) for use in the treatment of and , making it the first therapy for the treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Ocrevus will be available as a first-line treatment, which means that there are no recommendations in the approved labeling for people to try other MS therapies before taking it. Ocrevus has not been tested in children.    “As the first therapy specifically approved to treat primary progressive MS, this represents a significant milestone,” said Kathy Costello, MS, ANP-BC, MSCN, Associate Vice President of Healthcare Access at the National MS Society.   “We are grateful that there is finally a disease-modifying treatment for people with primary progressive MS, and also an important new option for people with relapsing MS,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research, at the National MS Society. “We hope this is just the first of many new treatments approved for people with progressive MS.”   Ocrevus is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule (CD20) on the surface of immune cells called B cells, and reduces the numbers of certain B cells that are circulating in the blood. B cells have several functions including making antibodies, and they are believed to play a role in immune-system-mediated damage to brain and spinal cord tissues in MS. Ocrelizumab is administered by intravenous infusion every 6 months. The first dose is given in two infusions, two weeks apart. Subsequent doses are given as a single infusion.   The ORATORIO study involving people with primary progressive MS, which compared Ocrevus to inactive placebo, met its primary endpoint, showing treatment with Ocrevus significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability by 24% compared with placebo in 732 people. Compared to placebo, Ocrevus also reduced the time required to walk 25 feet by 29%, and decreased the volume of brain lesions.   In the OPERA I and OPERA II studies involving people with relapsing MS, which compared ocrelizumab to interferon beta-1a (Rebif,® EMD Serono and Pfizer), Ocrevus significantly reduced the annualized relapse rate by up to 47% compared with Rebif over two years in a total of 1,656 people with relapsing MS. In addition, Ocrevus significantly delayed confirmed progression of disability on the EDSS scale by 40% compared with Rebif. Ocrevus also significantly reduced active inflammation observed on MRI scans by up to 95%, and total damage on MRI scans by up to 83% compared with Rebif.  (.pdf) for Ocrevus includes several warnings and precautions. Ocrevus can cause a wide variety of infusion-related reactions, the most frequent being itchy skin, rash, irritation in the throat, flushed face or fever, headache or other symptoms. In rare cases, these can be life-threatening. Infusion reactions occur most frequently with the first infusion, and they can occur up to 24 hours after the infusion. As a precaution, people are administered a steroid and antihistamine before their infusion and monitored at least one hour after infusion. Ocrevus increases the risk of infection, including respiratory tract infections and herpes infections. Ocrevus administration should be delayed in people with an active infection, and vaccination with live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment and not until B cells have been repopulated following treatment. There may be an increased risk of malignancy (cancers), including breast cancer, in people taking Ocrevus. Individuals using Ocrevus should follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines.The clinical trial results and ongoing monitoring of trial participants indicate an imbalance in the number of cancers that occurred in individuals treated with Ocrevus compared to those who were on interferon in the relapsing remitting trial and those on placebo in the primary progressive trial.The numbers are too small to know for sure if this is related directly to Ocrevus. This imbalance will require continued careful observation, evaluation, and data in larger numbers of individuals. PML: Although no cases of PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), a serious brain infection, occurred in clinical trials, PML has been observed in people taking related medications for other conditions. Typical symptoms are diverse, progress over days to weeks and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness, vision disturbances, and changes in thinking, memory, orientation and personality. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation: Although no cases of hepatitis B virus reactivation have been reported in people taking Ocrevus, they have occurred in people taking similar medications. Before initiating treatment with Ocrevus, individuals should have a blood test to detect hepatitis B virus.  For more information, people with MS can contact Genentech at: 1-844-OCREVUS (9am-8pm Eastern)   For people who qualify, Genentech plans to offer patient assistance programs through Genentech Access Solutions: (866) 4ACCESS/(866) 422-2377 or http://www.Genentech-Access.com.   The approval of Ocrevus is an exciting milestone for people with primary progressive MS and an encouraging new option for people with relapsing forms of the disease. The National MS Society applauds Genentech for their leadership in setting the wholesale acquisition cost (or list price) of Ocrevus at $65,000 per year -- nearly 20 percent below the current market average for an MS treatment. The continually escalating prices of MS disease-modifying therapies are creating barriers to people with MS getting these life-changing medications. Through its action on Ocrevus, Genentech is changing industry dynamics so that more people can access the life-changing treatments they need to live their best lives. We encourage other companies to follow suit, creating a drug pricing trend that keeps patients first.    - - -Read the FDA ""Snapshot"" describing the clinical trials of Ocrevus -Read details of the clinical trials of Ocrevus in two papers published in the December 21, 2016 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine: “Ocrelizumab versus Placebo in Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis” (Dr. Xavier Montalban and others) “Ocrelizumab versus Interferon Beta-1a in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis” (Dr. Stephen Hauser and others)   Ocrevus is a trademark of Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. Rebif is a registered trademark of Merck KGaA and EMD Serono, Inc. FAQ About FDA Approval of Ocrelizumab – brand name Ocrevus™ – for Primary Progressive and Relapsing Forms of MS A. Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab - Genentech, a member of the Roche Group) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule (CD20) on the surface of immune cells called B cells, and reduces the numbers of certain B cells that are circulating in the blood. B cells have several functions including making antibodies, and they are believed to play a role in immune-system-mediated damage to brain and spinal cord tissues in MS.   A. The FDA has approved ocrelizumab for the treatment of adults with  and with .   Q. Will everyone who has primary progressive MS benefit from Ocrevus? A. We don’t know, since like all clinical trials, the Ocrevus trial in primary progressive MS limited the characteristics of people who could participate. The trial only included people who were aged 18 to 55, who had an EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale – a scale to assess neurological functioning used in clinical trials) score of up to 6.5 (meaning they were able to walk with the help of a walker or bilateral crutches or other devices on both sides), and who had evidence of immune proteins in a test of their spinal fluid (“oligoclonal bands”). It is not possible to predict how a specific individual will respond to treatment. The use of Ocrevus in clinical practice will help determine who is likely to benefit.   Q. Will Ocrevus help people with secondary progressive MS who are no longer experiencing relapses? A. We don’t know. So far, the clinical trials of Ocrevus have involved people with relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive MS. Results were announced as positive for the trials in these populations. There is no data yet on whether Ocrevus may be effective in those people with secondary progressive MS who are no longer experiencing relapses.   A. Ocrevus is administered by intravenous (into a vein) infusion every 6 months. At the beginning of treatment there are two doses separated by 14 days. After that, there is a single infusion every 6 months.   Q. When will ocrelizumab be available by prescription? A. According to Genentech, people may talk to their MS doctors now about taking Ocrevus. The company expects supplies of the therapy to be available in about two weeks (around the week of April 4, 2017). Accessing the medication also depends on issues related to an individual’s health insurance.   Q. How effective is Ocrevus in primary progressive MS? A. The ORATORIO study involving people with primary progressive MS, which compared Ocrevus to inactive placebo, met its primary endpoint, showing treatment with Ocrevus significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability by 24% compared with placebo in 732 people. Compared to placebo, Ocrevus also reduced the time required to walk 25 feet by 29%, and decreased the volume of brain lesions.   A. In the OPERA I and OPERA II studies involving people with relapsing MS, which compared ocrelizumab to interferon beta-1a (Rebif,® EMD Serono and Pfizer), Ocrevus significantly reduced the relapse rate by up to 47% compared with Rebif over two years in a total of 1,656 people with relapsing MS. In addition, Ocrevus significantly delayed confirmed progression of disability on the EDSS scale by 40% compared with Rebif. Ocrevus also significantly reduced active inflammation observed on MRI scans by up to 95%, and total damage on MRI scans by up to 83% compared with Rebif. Q. Should individuals who have relapsing MS switch from their current therapy to Ocrevus? A. The decision about whether to take Ocrevus should be made in collaboration with your MS doctor, taking into account a variety of factors including the effectiveness of any therapy you are currently using, the potential risks and benefits, as well as costs and lifestyle factors. Important questions to be considered and discussed with your doctor in terms of Ocrevus include: What is my tolerance for the risk of known side effects? What is my tolerance for the risk of adverse consequences that might emerge with longer-term use? How will my medication choice affect my ability or plans to become pregnant?  Q. If I have been taking another disease-modifying therapy for MS, how long will I have to wait before starting the Ocrevus? A.  There is no wash-out or waiting time currently established or recommended for switching from another therapy to Ocrevus. Therefore a decision to wait or proceed needs to be made in collaboration with your MS doctor.   Q. What are the potential side effects of Ocrevus? A.  (.pdf) for Ocrevus includes several warnings and precautions. Ocrevus can cause a wide variety of infusion-related reactions, the most frequent being itchy skin, rash, irritation in the throat, flushed face or fever, headache or other symptoms. In rare cases, these can be life-threatening. Infusion reactions occur most frequently with the first infusion, and they can occur up to 24 hours after the infusion. As a precaution, people are administered a steroid and antihistamine before their infusion and monitored at least one hour after infusion. Ocrevus increases the risk of infection, including respiratory tract infections and herpes infections. Ocrevus administration should be delayed in people with an active infection. Vaccinations need to be administered at least 6 week prior to starting Ocrevus and vaccination with live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment and not until B cells have been repopulated following treatment. PML: Although no cases of PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), a serious brain infection, occurred in clinical trials, PML has been observed in people taking related medications. Typical symptoms are diverse, progress over days to weeks and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness, vision disturbances, and changes in thinking, memory, orientation and personality. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation: Although no cases of hepatitis B virus reactivation have been reported in people taking Ocrevus, they have occurred in people taking similar medications. Before initiating treatment with Ocrevus, individuals should be given a blood test to detect hepatitis B virus.  Although there is long-term safety data available on other medications that work in a similar fashion (those medications that deplete B cells), the long-term safety of Ocrevus is unknown at this time.   A. There may be an increased risk of malignancy (cancers), including breast cancer, in people taking Ocrevus. Individuals using Ocrevus should follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines. The clinical trial results and ongoing monitoring of trial participants indicate an imbalance in the number of cancers that occurred in individuals treated with Ocrevus compared to those who were on interferon in the relapsing remitting trial and those on placebo in the primary progressive trial. The numbers are too small to know for sure if this is related directly to Ocrevus. This imbalance will require continued careful observation, evaluation, and data in larger numbers of individuals.   Q. Has Ocrevus been proven to be more effective than other disease-modifying therapies? A. Ocrevus has only been compared to Rebif® (interferon beta-1a, EMD Serono and Pfizer). In two phase III studies in a total of 1,656 people with relapsing MS (people with relapsing-remitting MS and those with secondary-progressive MS who were experiencing relapses), Ocrevus significantly reduced relapse rates after two years compared to Rebif. Ocrevus has not been compared in clinical trials to other disease-modifying therapies.   A. There is no specified time limit for taking Ocrevus. Like with other disease modifying medications, Ocrevus would likely be continued if the person’s MS is stable, and is experiencing no adverse events or new safety issues that could be ascribed to the medication.   Q. Will people taking Ocrevus have to get any special medical tests or monitoring? A. Your doctor will need to run a blood test prior to starting this medication to test for hepatitis B infection. For individuals with relapsing MS, some MS doctors might like to have a new “baseline” MRI prior to starting a new medication. This will be at the discretion of your doctor. Individuals using Ocrevus should follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines.   Q. Will Ocrevus help my mobility, prevent me from getting worse or reverse my progressive disability? A. Based on results from the clinical trials, Ocrevus is not likely to significantly reverse an individual’s disability, but may help stabilize it. In the ORATORIO trial for primary progressive MS, treatment with Ocrevus significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability. This reduced risk of progression means that people taking Ocrevus in the trial were 24% less likely to demonstrate worsening of disability than people taking placebo. Ocrevus also reduced the time required to walk 25 feet, and decreased the volume of brain lesions. This means that as a group, people taking Ocrevus in the trial had a lower risk of progression, improved in their 25-ft walk speed and had reduced volume of brain lesions. However, it is not possible to predict how any one individual will respond to this or any other therapy.   Q. Will Ocrevus reduce disease activity in relapsing MS? A. As a group, people taking ocrelizumab in the trial had fewer relapses, fewer new or enlarging lesions on MRI and less risk of disability worsening than people who were taking Rebif (interferon beta-1a). However, it is not possible to predict how any one individual will respond to this or any other therapy.   Q. Can I continue to take supplements while on Ocrevus, such as Biotin, vitamin D, vitamin B12, etc.? A. Yes. However, it is essential that your MS doctor knows all of the prescription and over-the-counter medications, supplements and vitamins you are taking. Q. What about vaccinations and Ocrevus? Can I have a flu shot, the pneumonia shot, and the vaccine for shingles? A. Individuals should wait 6 weeks after being vaccinated before beginning therapy with Ocrevus. Any vaccination with live or live-attenuated viruses is not recommended during treatment with Ocrevus, and not until B cells have been repopulated following treatment. Individuals should speak to their doctors about whether the shot they are considering is available in an inactivated form.   Q. How often should I have an MRI while on Ocrevus? A. Your MS doctor will guide you on how often an MRI is needed. The 2015 Revised Recommendations of the Consortium of MS Centers’ Task Force for a Standardized MRI Protocol and Clinical Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Follow-Up of Multiple Sclerosis suggest a brain MRI approximately 6 months after switching to a new treatment and then routine brain MRI every 6 months to 2 years for all of those with relapsing MS. Currently there are no recommendations regarding the frequency of MRI in primary progressive MS.   Q. Will my immune system be suppressed or compromised if I take Ocrevus? Will I be more likely to “catch” ordinary infections if I take this medication? A. Ocrevus increases the risk of infection, including respiratory tract infections and herpes infections.   Q. Can I continue my other medications while I am on Ocrevus, such as Ampyra,® baclofen, and bladder medications? A. You can continue to take all of your MS symptom management medications. However, it is essential that your MS doctor knows all of the prescription and over-the-counter medications, supplements and vitamins you are taking.   Q. Will I need to have a spinal tap before starting Ocrevus? A. No.   Q. What if I no longer live in my own home. Can I still get Ocrevus if I live at an assisted living facility or a nursing home? A. Whether you live at home or in a facility should not affect your ability to be on Ocrevus. However, insurance coverage may impact access to the medication.   Q. What are the differences between relapsing-remitting MS, secondary progressive MS and primary progressive MS? A. Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is characterized by clearly defined attacks of new or increasing neurologic symptoms. These attacks – also called relapses or exacerbations – are followed by periods of partial or complete recovery (remissions). Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Many people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to an SPMS course in which there is progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) is characterized by worsening neurologic function (accumulation of disability) from the onset of symptoms, without early relapses or remissions. “Relapsing forms” of MS is a phrase that includes RRMS as well as progressive MS in those individuals who continue to experience relapses.   Q. Is Ocrevus more likely to help me if my disability from primary progressive MS is mild versus severe? A. It is not known who will benefit most from the use of Ocrevus. The study involving people with primary progressive MS only included individuals between the ages of 18 and 55, who had scores on the EDSS disability scale between 2.0 (minimal disability) to 6.5 (able to walk with the help of a walker or bilateral crutches or other devices on both sides). It is not possible to predict how a specific individual will respond to treatment.   Q. Is it better to take it earlier than later for treating progressive MS? A. In the ORATORIO trial for primary progressive MS, the average time from diagnosis in participants was 3.3 years. It is not known how the medication will work in people who have had primary progressive MS for longer periods of time.   Q. Is it better to take Ocrevus earlier than later for treating relapsing MS? A. In general, early and consistent treatment with a disease-modifying therapy is recommended. () However, it is not yet specifically known whether it is better to use Ocrevus earlier or later, and it is not known whether it is better to use Ocrevus before or after other disease-modifying therapies.   Q. Is there a point at which Ocrevus does not work? A. There is no known point in time when this or any MS therapy may stop working effectively. Each individual will respond differently to any given therapy, and response to treatment must be assessed regularly by your MS doctor.   A. The list price has been announced as $65,000 per year. However, the price of Ocrevus to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs.   Q. What is the National MS Society’s response to the posted price of Ocrevus? A. The approval of Ocrevus is an exciting milestone for people with primary progressive MS and an encouraging new option for people with relapsing forms of the disease. The National MS Society applauds Genentech for their leadership in setting the wholesale acquisition cost (or list price) of Ocrevus at $65,000 per year — nearly 20 percent below the current market average for an MS treatment. The continually escalating prices of MS disease-modifying therapies are creating barriers to people with MS getting these life-changing medications. Through its action on Ocrevus, Genentech is changing industry dynamics so that more people can access the life-changing treatments they need to live their best lives. We encourage other companies to follow suit, creating a drug pricing trend that keeps patients first.    A. Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans. For people who qualify, Genentech plans to offer patient assistance programs through Genentech Access Solutions: (866) 4ACCESS/(866) 422-2377 or http://www.Genentech-Access.com.   Q. Where can I get information about the support that Genentech will provide to help people gain access to Ocrevus? A. Physicians and people with MS can contact Genentech for information about access at Genentech Access Solutions: (866) 4ACCESS/(866) 422-2377 or http://www.Genentech-Access.com.   Q. Is Ocrevus the same as rituximab, which is a therapy used to treat some cancers? A. No, and Ocrevus is not a derivative of rituximab. Both rituximab and Ocrevus work by depleting B cells. However, the two medications are not the same. Based on published reports, Ocrevus is manufactured differently than rituximab. Ocrevus is mostly human, and rituximab is equal parts mouse and human. These monoclonal antibodies bind to specific, but overlapping, areas of a molecule on immune B cells (called CD20 cells). There are also differences in the ways that rituximab and Ocrevus induce the death of CD20 B cells. Whether these differences are meaningful in terms of potential effectiveness in MS, or in terms of safety, is difficult to say at this time.    Q. Are there other therapies in development for progressive MS? A. Yes. The Society is closely watching clinical trials that could lead to treatments for people with progressive forms of MS. For example, positive results were recently announced from a trial of BAF-312 (Siponimod) in secondary progressive MS.  In addition, other studies include: The MS-SMART trial is testing three therapies that may have nerve-protecting properties in secondary progressive MS (with the MS Society of the U.K.). The SPRINT-MS trial of Ibudilast, an oral anti-inflammatory agent, is ongoing in people with secondary progressive and primary progressive MS thanks to a unique collaboration between NIH's NeuroNEXT Network, MediciNova, and the National MS Society. The MS-STAT2 study getting underway at University College London is a multicenter trial testing whether a repurposed cholesterol-lowering therapy can slow the course of secondary progressive MS; the Society is providing funding.The Society is also very interested in wellness research to identify exercise, dietary and other approaches that will help people who have MS live their best lives. The Society supports several clinical trials that are investigating dietary interventions for symptom management and for their potential to modify the disease process.  Q: Based on these trial results, is there still a need to invest in additional research on progressive MS? A:  Yes. We need to continue our investment in research to find solutions for progressive MS.  This trial is the first success after many disappointments. We welcome this development, but we must remain focused on finding more and better solutions for treating all forms of progressive MS. We will do this by our continued leadership in the International  and by funding research on progressive MS through our own research programs, and by encouraging other companies to commit to developing treatments for progressive forms of MS.   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

(MS) is a chronic, inflammatory disease of that involves an immune-mediated attack on the central nervous system. Myelin and the oligodendrocytes that form myelin appear to be the primary targets of the inflammatory attack, although the themselves are also damaged. The inflammatory attack on CNS white matter is associated with T lymphocyte activity (Th-1 and Th-17), impairment of regulatory T cell function and B lymphocyte activity (antibody and complement). Gray and white matter are targeted by the abnormal immune response. The collective damage to white and gray matter results in a broad spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms. The disease is thought to be precipitated by a combination of one or more environmental triggers acting in a genetically susceptible individual. In approximately 85 percent of patients, MS begins with a . In a much smaller percentage of patients, the disease is progressive from onset (primary-progressive MS). Most people with RRMS have fewer relapses and less inflammatory activity over time, eventually transitioning to a more progressive course -- secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). The onset of SPMS appears to be a dominant determinant of long-term disease prognosis (). Male sex, older age at disease onset, and a higher number of early relapses are associated with a higher probability of progressive disease and shorter time to SPMS (, ). A prediction model based on age, cortical lesion load, and cerebellar cortical volume has been offered to explain the probability of evolving to SPMS (). There is growing evidence that gray matter damage plays a pivotal role in MS disease progression (, , & ). Preventing the onset of SPMS is a primary target of treatment at this time (). Much of the CNS damage in MS is believed to result from an immune-mediated process that includes components of the innate immune system as well as adaptive immune system activation of certain lymphocyte populations in peripheral lymphoid organs.

1c12fa19-2819-4abc-8837-56776bf37e52,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     Results Reported from Innovative “MS-SMART” Clinical Trial in Secondary Progressive MS Presented at Results Reported from Innovative “MS-SMART” Clinical Trial in Secondary Progressive MS Presented at ECTRIMS UPDATE, February 3, 2020: have now been published in the , along with an . Dr. Jeremy Chataway (University College London) presented first results of the MS-SMART Trial at the ECTRIMS conference in Berlin. MS-SMART is an innovative phase 2 clinical trial that compared three potential therapies against placebo to determine their ability to slow brain atrophy (shrinkage) in people with secondary progressive MS. A total of 445 individuals in the United Kingdom with secondary progressive MS were enrolled in the 96-week trial. Each was randomly assigned to receive amiloride, fluoxetine, riluzole, or placebo. The therapies each target different pathways thought to contribute to progressive tissue damage and worsening (progression) in MS. They are also FDA-approved for treating other conditions. Although none of the therapies slowed brain atrophy, the results confirm the feasibility of this innovative multi-arm trial design, enabling much quicker assessments of potential therapies for progressive MS in the future. The clinical trial was investigator-initiated and funded by University College London and multiple other sponsors and agencies including the UK Multiple Sclerosis Society and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (USA).    Watch results explained to trial participants in this video “While these results are disappointing, we can learn a lot from well-controlled clinical trials like MS-SMART that will help fuel new approaches for finding desperately needed solutions for people living with progressive forms of MS,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research, at the National MS Society. “Learnings from this study and others will help inform the Society’s research priorities and those of other research funders like the International .” There are few therapies that have shown benefits for people living with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, a stage of MS that follows an initial relapsing-remitting course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function and accumulation of disability over time. Because progression usually occurs over many years, there is a need for innovative clinical trial designs that can more quickly test therapies for their potential to protect the nervous system from harm and slow or stop progression. Dr. Jeremy Chataway (University College London) and colleagues set out to conduct an innovative, multi-arm trial that would permit testing of three oral drugs at the same time, all of which had shown promising neuroprotective properties. Amiloride is a drug that reduces the influx of calcium and sodium into cells and is used to treat high blood pressure; fluoxetine is a treatment for depression that increases production of a chemical that may have beneficial effects on brain cells; and riluzole is a treatment for ALS (motor neuron disease) that blocks glutamate, a neurotransmitter that may build up and cause nerve cell damage. Each of these are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for other conditions. A total of 445 individuals in the United Kingdom with secondary progressive MS were enrolled in the 96-week trial. Each was randomly assigned to receive amiloride, fluoxetine, riluzole, or placebo, and the participants and healthcare professionals were not aware of their assignment. The main outcome measure was percentage brain volume change from the beginning of the study to the end, measured with MRI imaging. Additional outcomes were measured, including numbers of new or enlarging MS brain lesions; cognitive tests; physician and patient perceptions of effectiveness; and confirmation of whether the multi-arm strategy was successful.   At 96 weeks, none of the drugs showed evidence of slowing brain atrophy or other significant benefits. However, the results confirm the feasibility of this innovative multi-arm phase 2 trial design, which in the future will likely enable much quicker assessments of potential therapies for progressive MS. Dr. Chataway reported results on October 12, 2018 at the meeting of the European Committee for Treatment and Research into Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) in Berlin. The clinical trial was investigator-initiated and funded by University College London and multiple other sponsors and agencies including the UK Multiple Sclerosis Society and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (USA). Other sponsors included the University College London, the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation Programme, Medical Research Council, and managed by the National Institute for Health Research.

Those who took 80 mg of simvastatin, versus those who took placebo, showed 43% less brain atrophy. In their paper, the investigators, led by Dr. Jeremy Chataway (University College London), suggest that a phase III trial of simvastatin is warranted (, early online March 19, 2014). The safety and benefit of statins in MS would need to be confirmed in phase III studies; previous results have been mixed. While there are therapies available for people with relapsing forms of MS, there are few options for people with primary-progressive MS or for those who have transitioned from relapsing MS into the secondary-progressive form of the disease. In addition to lowering cholesterol, statins can dampen immune responses that are involved in MS, and they have shown benefits in mouse models of MS. There have been suggestions that statins have cell-protecting qualities, and so may protect against nervous system damage in MS. For these reasons, statins have previously been tried, alone or in combination with interferon beta, in relapsing MS, with mixed results. In some studies, treatment has worsened disease activity. The usual dosage to treat high cholesterol is 5 to 40 mg per day, versus the high dose of 80 mg tested in MS. This was an investigator-initiated study at three centers in the United Kingdom which was funded through a number of government and foundation sources in the UK, and did not involve sponsorship from any pharmaceutical company.  This study involved 140 people aged 18-65 years old with secondary-progressive MS. They were randomly divided into two groups, one to receive simvastatin for two years, and one to receive placebo for two years. The study was double-blinded, meaning that none of the participants, doctors, or assessors knew whether the participants were on active therapy or placebo. Participants underwent yearly MRI scanning to record whole-brain volume, as well as various tests of disability including the EDSS, a standard outcome measure of MS progression.  After two years, those on simvastatin showed less brain atrophy than those on placebo. Those on simvastatin had an average brain atrophy rate of 0.288% per year versus 0.584% in those on placebo.  This represents 43% less atrophy in the simvastatin group, which was found to be statistically significant. This was the primary outcome measure of the trial. Simvastatin also had small but statistically significant impact on some measures of clinical progression. Both groups were found to have similar rates of adverse events, suggesting that simvastatin was well tolerated. This phase II clinical trial found that simvastatin may hold promise for treating people with secondary-progressive MS, for whom there are few treatment options. The investigators caution that even though brain atrophy has been linked to disability in MS, the benefit against brain atrophy shown in this trial may not translate into clinical benefit. This and other potential benefits and risks could be further discovered in a phase III clinical trial of simvastatin in secondary-progressive MS, which the investigators believe is warranted. At this point there is insufficient evidence to recommend statins for the treatment of MS.  Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

The standard of care for an initial attack of NMO includes the following: Intravenous (into the vein) high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone) Plasma Exchange (PLEX) if no improvement occurs with corticosteroids. The goal of PLEX is to lower the level of NMO-IgG in the blood. PLEX involves removing blood from the body through a needle and tubing. Through a series of steps, the plasma (the liquid part of the blood) is separated from blood cells and replaced with an artificial plasma substitute; the plasma substitute and blood cells are combined and returned to the body through an intravenous line. The procedure lasts several hours and may be repeated multiple times over a number of days. Because the likelihood of recurrence is greater than 90 percent and attacks are generally severe, ongoing treatment to suppress the immune system is considered necessary. Three drugs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for treatment of anti-AQP4 positive NMO: Soliris (eculizumab) Uplizna (inebilizumab) Enspryng (satralizumab-mwge) Other drugs used off-label to prevent attacks include: about the benefits and risks of these medications.

According to a company press release, the study met primary and most secondary endpoints, significantly reducing the annual relapse rate in adults with relapsing MS. Side effects were said to be similar to those reported from previous studies of ponesimod and for this class of therapy. These include potential to cause a temporary slowing of heart rate, anxiety, dizziness, breathlessness, raised liver enzymes, influenza, sleeplessness and swelling of the lower legs.  Further details will be presented at the 2019 Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS in September. A second Phase 3 trial is underway, and the company plans to apply to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seeking approval to treat relapsing MS later this year.  DETAILS Multiple sclerosis involves an immune system attack on the brain and spinal cord. Ponesimod is a compound that binds to a docking site (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1, or S1Preceptor) on immune cells, including T cells and B cells (lymphocytes) that have been implicated in causing nervous system damage in MS. The pill induces immune cells to remain in lymph nodes, inhibiting their migration into the brain and spinal cord. Similar therapies are approved by the FDA to treat MS—Gilenyafingolimod, Novartis International AG) and Mayzent (siponimod, Novartis International AG), and one is under review by the FDA (ozanimod, Celgene Corporation).  In an earlier phase II study in people with MS, ponesimod significantly reduced disease activity seen on MRI scans ( 2014 Nov; 85(11): 1198–1208).   Participants were randomly assigned to receive oral ponesimod 20 mg once daily or teriflunomide 14 mg once daily for 108 weeks. The primary outcome that was measured was the rate of relapses. Secondary endpoints included fatigue, disease activity on imaging scans, and disability accumulation.   According to a company press release, the study met primary and most secondary endpoints, significantly reducing the annual relapse rate in adults with relapsing MS. Side effects were said to be similar to those reported from previous studies of ponesimod and for this class of therapy. These include potential to cause a temporary slowing of heart rate, anxiety, dizziness, breathlessness, raised liver enzymes, influenza, sleeplessness and swelling of the lower legs. Also in phase 2 studies, an initial temporary slowing of heart rate was minimized by starting people on low doses and gradually increasing over several days.   Further details will be presented at the 2019 Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS in September. A is ongoing, evaluating ponesimod in people with MS who are still experiencing relapses while taking Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate, Biogen, Inc.).   The company plans to submit an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seeking approval to treat relapsing MS later this year.   Aubagio is a registered trademark of Sanofi Genzyme Mayzent is a registered trademark of Novartis International AG Gilenya is a registered trademark of Novartis International AG Tecfidera is a registered trademark of Biogen Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

Having more refined definitions of different types of MS would greatly facilitate research studies, communications between people with MS and their healthcare providers, and treatment decisions. For these reasons, a recent effort to fine-tune descriptions of MS was undertaken by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in MS. This committee is comprised of international leaders in MS research and clinical care and is jointly supported by the National MS Society and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS (ECTRIMS). A summary of the deliberations, including recommendations for more research, has just been published and can be read or downloaded without fees (). In 1996 the Committee had developed consensus around descriptions, or “phenotypes,” of the to facilitate research in MS and so that researchers and clinicians around the world would have a common understanding of the types of MS discussed in publications and in the clinic. This consensus highlighted four courses of MS -- relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, primary progressive, and progressive relapsing. While these descriptions of MS have become well-established, our understanding of MS and the course of the disease has advanced since that time, prompting a re-evaluation of the course of MS and any biological signposts (such as blood markers or imaging) that might help refine these definitions. After a thorough search of the medical literature and convening an international workshop,* the Committee has now reviewed advances in what we know and don’t yet know in terms of identifying different types of MS in individuals, and has made recommendations that modify prior clinical course descriptions. In the resulting , the Committee recommended retaining much of what we consider the courses of MS – relapsing-remitting, secondary-progressive and primary progressive, but has recommended categorizing progressive relapsing as an active form of primary progressive MS. Importantly, they recommended that clinicians not just determine a person’s course of MS, but further sub-categorize that course as “active” or “not active” (depending on the presence of clinical relapses or activity on MRI scans) or as progressing (worsening) or not progressing, based on clinical evidence of changes in disability. This, the Committee believes, provides a truer picture of what an individual experiences, can better inform treatment decisions, and refine clinical trial design and recruitment. Ultimately these recommendations will advance better care for people with MS by: • raising awareness that people with all forms of MS should be monitored for signs of disease activity and progression, which may open up additional treatment options; • improving outcomes of clinical trials, which could bring new therapies faster. The Committee pointed out areas for further needed research to help find additional solutions to the unpredictable nature of MS, including: • Long-term studies that track people affected by MS over time; • Assessing whether the degree of recovery from relapses has an impact on long-term outcomes; • Imaging studies of tissue damage and its relation to disease course; • Advanced imaging techniques such as those that measure brain atrophy or optic nerve thinning; • Studying large datasets for fluid-borne biomarkers to better asses their ability to help define clinical phenotypes; • Incorporating information reported by people who have the disease (“patient-reported outcomes”) in refining the courses of MS. Researchers funded by the National MS Society and others worldwide are already working toward these goals, in efforts to help people with MS live their best lives. In addition, this information will be considered by the Society’s leadership as it develops future research strategies. *Workshop supported by the National MS Society, ECTRIMS, the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in MS, the MS International Federation, and the MS Society of Canada.

It’s never too soon or too late to think about how to access high quality care. Knowing what to look for, where to find it, and how to work effectively with your doctor and other health professionals is essential to your health and quality of life.  While there is no way to predict with any certainty how an individual’s disease will progress, four basic MS disease courses (also called types or phenotypes) have been defined by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS in 2013: clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting, secondary progressive and primary progressive. In 2020, the same committee published a , highlighting the need for time framing the modifiers “activity” and “progression” and guidance for using the terms “worsening” or “progression” to describe the disease. Although not considered a course of MS,  has been used to classify those with abnormalities on MRI of the brain and/or spinal cord consistent with lesions of MS - not explained by another diagnosis - and who also have no past or current neurological symptoms or abnormalities found on neurological exam. Often these individuals have had an MRI because of other symptoms, such as headache, and were found to have lesions that appear similar to those seen in MS. A found a little over half of people with RIS go on to develop MS within ten years. There are no specific treatment guidelines for RIS and additional research is needed to further define what factors increase the likelihood that someone with RIS will develop MS. Monitoring of MRI and neurological symptoms, and neurological examination are generally recommended to quickly identify changes. If the diagnosis is MS, treatment can be started early. Research interest in RIS is high and , which could provide more guidance for monitoring and treatment. CIS is a first episode of neurologic symptoms caused by inflammation and in the central nervous system. The episode, which by definition must last for at least 24 hours, is characteristic of multiple sclerosis but does not yet meet the criteria for a because people who experience a CIS may or may not go on to develop MS. When CIS is accompanied by lesions on a brain MRI () that are similar to those seen in MS, the person has a high likelihood of a second episode of neurologic symptoms and diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS. When CIS is not accompanied by MS-like lesions on a brain MRI, the person has a much lower likelihood of developing MS. The make it possible to diagnose MS in a person with CIS who also has specific findings on brain MRI that provide evidence of an earlier episode of damage in a different location and indicate active inflammation in a region other than the one causing the current symptoms. As MRI technology improves, the diagnosis of MS will be made more quickly and easily. In the meantime, individuals with CIS who are considered at high risk for developing MS may now be treated with a that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that purpose. Early treatment of CIS has been shown to delay onset of MS. RRMS – the most common disease course – is characterized by clearly defined attacks of new or increasing neurologic symptoms. These attacks – also called relapses or exacerbations – are followed by periods of partial or complete recovery (remissions). During remissions, all symptoms may disappear, or some symptoms may continue and become permanent. However, there is no apparent progression of the disease during the periods of remission. RRMS can be further characterized as either (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity over a specified period of time) or , as well as (a confirmed increase in disability following a relapse) or . Approximately 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS. This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in RRMS over time; however each person's experience with RRMS will be unique. Following a relapse, the new symptoms may disappear without causing any increase in level of disability, or the new symptoms may partially disappear, resulting in an increase in disability. New lesions on MRI, as shown by the arrows, often occur as part of a relapse. However, new MRI lesions indicating MS activity may also occur without symptoms of which the person is aware.  SPMS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Some people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. SPMS can be further characterized as either (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity during a specified period of time) or, as well as  (evidence of disability accumulation over time, with or without relapses or new MRI activity) or . This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in SPMS over time; however each person's experience with SPMS will be unique. SPMS follows after relapsing-remitting MS. Disability gradually increases over time, with or without evidence of disease activity (relapses or changes on MRI). In SPMS, occasional relapses may occur, as well as periods of stability. PPMS is characterized by worsening neurologic function (accumulation of disability) from the onset of symptoms, without early relapses or remissions. PPMS can be further characterized as either (with an occasional relapse and/or evidence of new MRI activity over a specified period of time) or , as well as  (evidence of disability accumulation over time, with or without relapse or new MRI activity) or . Approximately 15 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with PPMS.

Symptoms range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis. The progress, severity, and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in research and treatment are moving us closer to a world free of MS. Most people living with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, with more than twice as many women as men being diagnosed with the disease. There are an estimated 8-10,000 children under the age of 18 who also live with MS. Studies indicate that genetic factors could make certain individuals more susceptible to the disease, but there is no evidence that MS is directly inherited. It occurs more commonly among Caucasians, especially those of northern European ancestry, but people of African, Asian, and Hispanic backgrounds are not immune. More than 2.3 million people are affected by MS worldwide. Because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not require U.S. physicians to report new cases, and because symptoms can be completely invisible, the prevalence of MS in the U.S. can only be estimated. The Society continues to advocate for the establishment of a national registry that will track the number of people living with MS and has made a commitment to re-evaluate the current prevalence estimate and investigate the process by which an updated estimate can be identified. The progress, severity, and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted. The disease varies greatly from person to person, and from time to time, in the same person. For instance, one person might experience abnormal fatigue, another might have severe vision problems, and another could develop attention and memory issues. Even severe symptoms could disappear completely and the person could regain lost functions. In the worst cases, however, people can have partial or complete paralysis. In MS, symptoms result when inflammation and breakdown occur in myelin, the protective insulation surrounding the nerve fibers of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). The nerve fibers themselves are also damaged. Myelin is destroyed and replaced by scars of hardened ""sclerotic"" patches of tissue. Such lesions are called ""plaques,"" and appear in ""multiple"" places within the central nervous system. This can be compared to a loss of insulating material around an electrical wire, which interferes with the transmission of signals. Life expectancy for people with MS has increased over time. We believe this is due to treatment breakthroughs, improved healthcare and life style changes. Recent research however, indicates that people with MS may live an average of about seven years less than the general population because of disease complications or other medical conditions. Many of these complications are preventable or manageable. Attention to overall health and wellness can help reduce the risk of other medical conditions, such as heart disease and stroke, that can contribute to a shortened life expectancy. In some rare instances, there are cases of MS that progress rapidly from disease onset and can be fatal. No. The majority of people living with MS do not become severely disabled. Two-thirds of people who have MS remain able to walk, though many will need an aid, such as a cane or crutches. No. MS is neither contagious nor directly inherited, although studies indicate that genetic factors might make certain individuals more susceptible to the disease. Not yet. However, advances in treating and understanding MS are being achieved daily and the progress in research to find a cure is very encouraging. In addition, many therapeutic and technological advances are helping people manage symptoms and lead more productive lives. Several FDA-approved medications are now available and have been shown to impact the underlying course of MS. What medications and treatments are available for MS?  The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people living with MS begin treatment with one of the disease modifying drugs, Avonex®, Betaseron®, Copaxone®, or Rebif® as soon as you are diagnosed with a relapsing form (the most common kind) of MS. Those drugs help to lessen the frequency and severity of MS attacks, reduce the accumulation of lesions in the brain, and slow progression of disability. Novantrone® (mitoxantrone) is approved for reducing disability and/or frequency of relapses in patients with worsening relapsing MS. This is the first therapy approved in the United States for individuals with secondary progressive MS or who are experiencing a rapid worsening of the disease. In addition, approved by the FDA for return to market, is Tysabri®, which is generally recommended for patients who have had inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, other approved disease-modifying MS therapies for relapsing forms of MS. Many therapies are available to treat symptoms such as spasticity, pain, bladder problems, fatigue, and weakness. People should consult with a knowledgeable physician to develop the most comprehensive approach to managing their MS. In early MS, elusive symptoms that come and go might indicate any number of possible disorders. Some people have symptoms that are very difficult for physicians to interpret, and these people must ""wait and see."" While no single laboratory test is yet available to prove or rule out MS, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a great help in reaching a definitive diagnosis. In an effort to develop a common language when discussing, evaluating, and treating MS, the Society conducted an international survey among scientists who specialize in MS research and patient care. Analysis of the responses resulted in the publication of four disease courses in 1996. In 2013, the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS updated the based on advances in the understanding of the disease process in MS and in MRI technology: : a first episode of neurologic symptoms caused by inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system that may or may not go on to become MS. a disease course characterized by clearly defined flare-ups (relapses) or episodes of acute worsening of neurologic function followed by remissions (with partial or complete recovery) during which no disease progression occurs. Frequency: Approximately 85% of people are diagnosed with RRMS. a disease course characterized by nearly continuous worsening from the onset of symptoms, with or without occasional relapses. The rate or progression varies over time, with occasional plateaus. Frequency: Approximately 15% of people are diagnosed with PPMS. a disease course that follows after an initial RRMS course. Following an initial period of time with RRMS, the disease becomes more steadily progressive, with or without occasional relapses.  Frequency: If left untreated, 50% of people with relapsing-remitting MS develop this form of the disease within about 10 years of initial diagnosis. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

Physiotherapy, occupational therapy and nutritional support in the later stages are commonly employed. Corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in some patients. Additional treatment could include IVIG, rituximab and/or immunosuppressive drugs. Prognosis of Schilder’s disease is variable. The clinical course is usually progressive, but significant improvement and remissions have also been described. Survival has been reported to be less than ten years after the onset. Patients with a good response to corticosteroids and those with smaller lesions may have a better prognosis. If the course is progressive, larger and larger patches of demyelination occur, interfering with motor movement, speech, personality, hearing and vision. Ultimately, the vital functions of respiration, heart rate and blood pressure are affected, leading to the individual’s death.

Treatment of transverse myelitis could include: Intravenous (IV — into the vein) corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone may be given to help decrease the swelling in the spinal cord.  In some cases, prednisone, taken by mouth, is used for a period of time after the IV therapy is completed. Plasma exchange (PLEX) may be ordered if no improvement occurs with corticosteroid therapy. Plasma exchange involves removing blood from the body through a needle and tubing. Through a series of steps, the plasma (the liquid part of the blood) is separated from blood cells and then replaced with an artificial plasma substitute; the plasma substitute and blood cells are combined and returned to the body through an intravenous line. The procedure lasts several hours and may be repeated multiple times over a number of days. Aggressive immunosuppression may be required for those who continue to experience active inflammation of the spinal cord, despite treatment with steroids and/or PLEX. Cyclophosphamide, a chemotherapy drug that is often used to treat lymphomas or leukemia, is sometimes used. Patients receiving this treatment are carefully monitored for potential complications that may arise from immunosuppression. Some people affected by transverse myelitis recover with minor or no problems, others suffer permanent impairments that affect their ability to perform ordinary tasks of daily living. Permanent neurological deficits could include severe weakness, spasticity (painful muscle stiffness or contractions), or paralysis; also incontinence or chronic pain. Aggressive physical therapy/rehabilitation is indicated after an episode of TM, to aid with recovery.

Researchers looked at the outcomes of 178 people who were initially diagnosed with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CIS refers to a first episode of neurologic symptoms and is caused by inflammation or loss of nerve-insulating myelin in the brain, spinal cord or optic nerve. Individuals who experience CIS may or may not go on to develop MS. Fifteen years later, the team looked back at MRI scans taken early on to see whether particular characteristics predicted the clinical outcomes. They found that active inflammation (enhancing lesions) and spinal cord involvement in early MRI scans were linked to eventually developing secondary progressive MS and physical disability. Active inflammation also was associated with developing cognitive dysfunction. The findings that early MRI scans contain clues to future disease activity and progression contribute substantially to growing evidence that will eventually enable clinicians to predict individuals’ expected severity of MS and help direct treatment decisions. This study, led by Dr. Wallace Brownlee, was funded by the United Kingdom MS Society and others.

The conference was held under the auspices of the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in MS – a group jointly sponsored by the National MS Society and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), with additional support from the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in MS (ACTRIMS) and the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation (MSIF). Cell-based therapy is being explored in MS both for turning down damaging immune responses and for promoting nervous system repair. Progress was reviewed related to the value of specific cell types, including hematopoietic stem cells (derived from the bone marrow), mesenchymal stem cells (derived from many different adult tissues), and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (derived from multiple sources). Controlled clinical trials were deemed the optimal way to provide answers about which types of cells, which route of delivery, and which types and stages of disease, would be the most promising approach for treating MS. A review of the findings and consensus on next steps will be published by the conference organizers, with recommendations to help speed the development of new cell-based treatment solutions. Over the last several years, there has been mounting progress in innovative research related to the potential of many types of stem cells both for slowing MS disease activity and for repairing damage to the nervous system. At present, there are no approved stem cell therapies for MS, and stem cell therapy is still in the experimental stage.   With the urgent need for more effective treatments for MS, particularly for those with more progressive forms of the disease, the potential of all types of cell-based therapies is being explored. “Cell-based therapy” refers to the transplantation, delivery or stimulation of various cell types for the purpose of treating MS. To speed and coordinate this work, the International Conference on Cell-Based Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis was convened in November 2015 in Lisbon, Portugal.   The conference was held under the auspices of the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in MS – a group jointly sponsored by the National MS Society and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), with additional support from the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in MS (ACTRIMS) and the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation (MSIF). Conference Chairs were Jeffrey A. Cohen, MD (Cleveland Clinic, USA, also Chair of the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in MS), Marcelo C. Pasquini, MD, MS (Medical College of Wisconsin, USA) and Neil Scolding, PhD, FRCP (Southmead Hospital Bristol, UK).    More than 70 experts gathered to review progress in the multiple approaches to cell-based therapy – the first conference to focus on major cell-based therapy possibilities for the treatment of MS. Topics ranged from basic biological activity and interactions of various cells, clinical trial experience and safety, future trial designs, ethics, and practical considerations such as regulatory issues and scaling up for high-volume production of therapeutic cells.    One type of procedure that has been explored for many years in MS is called “hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,” or HSCT. This procedure attempts to “reboot” the immune system in people with MS. Stem cells from an individual’s own bone marrow or blood are stimulated, captured and stored. Then the immune system is depleted by chemotherapy, radiation or both. The stored stem cells are then reintroduced, usually by infusion into a vein. The new stem cells migrate to the bone marrow and over time produce new cells that eventually repopulate the body with an immune system that is less likely to attack the central nervous system.   There is more experience using HSCT in MS than any other cell therapy approach. Participants heard from investigators about results from their recent and ongoing clinical trials; and about treatment protocols, different approaches to depleting the immune system, safety issues and determining outcomes. Discussion focused on current knowledge, next steps and additional studies needed to fully understand benefits and risks of HSCT in MS, and who might benefit most from this approach.   - Mesenchymal stem cells are adult cells found in several places in the body, including the bone marrow and fat tissue. These cells have undergone limited testing in clinical trials to reduce immune activity and to augment nervous system repair in MS. With this approach, an individual’s immune cells are not destroyed or replaced. Instead, an individual’s mesenchymal stem cells are isolated from the bone marrow, blood or other tissues and cultured in the lab to increase their purity and numbers, and then re-introduced into the body by intravenous (into the vein) or intrathecal (by spinal tap) injection. Mesenchymal stem cells have potential for turning into different types of tissues, but they are thought most likely to work by encouraging the body’s natural repair mechanisms.   Participants heard about MSC approaches in autoimmune diseases other than MS and technical issues encountered, as well as possible sources of MSCs, methods of expanding and preserving them, and safety questions such as the potential formation of unwanted tissue and cancers. Several investigators presented brief summaries of early-phase clinical studies of mesenchymal cells in MS.    Another approach, which hasn’t yet been tested in people with MS, focuses on repairing nervous system damage with stem cells that may replace damaged cells (oligodendrocytes) that make myelin. Myelin is the protective coating on nerve wires which is damaged during MS. Stem cells called “oligodendrocyte progenitor cells” (OPCs) reside in the brain and conduct natural repair in response to injury. These cells have been grown and expanded in lab dishes as a potential source for transplantation. Another cell source being explored involves using an individual’s own cells from skin or other tissues, which are reprogrammed to turn them into stem cells. These cells are called “induced pluripotent stem cells” or iPSC. It’s possible such cells would not be rejected by the person’s immune system after transplantation. ( about other research to repair the damage in MS.)   Presentations at the conference focused on the biology of OPCs and iPSCs, their potential for transplantation, methods for growing iPSCs in the lab, and their use for screening compounds for their potential as therapies. Discussion focused on several safety, regulatory, cell-source and production issues that will need to be addressed before this approach is ready for clinical trials in people with MS.    Controlled clinical trials by investigators were deemed an optimal way to provide answers about which types of cells, which route of delivery, and which types and stages of disease, would be the most promising approach for treating MS.   A past roadblock has been that clinicians often use different treatment protocols, making it hard to compare results. Participants heard potential solutions to standardizing protocols and creating networks for centralizing data collection and analysis.   There are outstanding questions about how to track transplanted cells within the body, how to determine if cell therapy is working, and ethical challenges for cell-based therapies, including the issue of patient-funded studies and the problems of unregulated .   Breakout sessions focused on developing consensus about future clinical trial designs for each cell type, including the appropriate study populations for each cell type, the role of cell therapy in relation to the use of approved , dosing, route and frequency of delivery, and determining appropriate efficacy outcomes and safety monitoring steps.   : Conference organizers are already at work summarizing ideas and findings to publish a review of the field, which will help drive researchers and funding organizations toward activities that are most likely to provide answers around the best approaches for cell-based therapies for improving treatment options for people with MS. The National MS Society and other conference sponsors will continue to update constituents on progress related to this important work.  about stem cells and MS Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

3a72eb78-7495-48bc-83dd-863fb337f8f8,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     PPMS is characterized by worsening neurologic function (accumulation of disability) from the onset of symptoms, without early relapses or remissions. PPMS can be further characterized as either (with an occasional relapse and/or evidence of new MRI activity over a specified period of time) or , as well as  (evidence of disability accrual over time, with or without relapse or new MRI activity) or . This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in PPMS; however each person's experience with PPMS will be unique. PPMS can have brief periods when the disease is stable, with or without a relapse or new MRI activity, as well as periods when increasing disability occurs with or without new relapses or lesions on MRI. Disease activity and progression can be evaluated by neurologic examination and MRI. Monitoring your disease course at different points in time helps you and your MS care provider have important conversations about your treatment options and prognosis. For example: If you have PPMS that is active, with new MRI activity or relapses, your conversation with your MS care provider could be about starting treatment with a disease-modifying therapy to reduce the risk of a relapse, as well as rehabilitation to help improve function and mobility. If you have PPMS that is stable without activity (no new MRI activity or relapses) or progression, the conversation with your MS care provider could include the role of rehabilitation to help you maintain function, as well as other symptom management strategies that you may need. If you have PPMS that is not active (no new MRI activity or relapses) but is progressing with increasing accumulation of disability, the conversation with your MS provider could focus on the rehabilitation strategies that can help you maintain function and keep you safe and independently mobile. How does PPMS differ from the other disease courses? Although there is a lot of variability among people with PPMS, we know that as a group, they differ in several ways from people with relapsing forms of MS: Relapsing forms of MS (including relapsing-remitting MS, and secondary progressive in those individuals who continue to experience relapses) are defined by inflammatory attacks on myelin. PPMS involves much less inflammation of the type seen in relapsing MS. As a result, people with PPMS tend to have fewer brain lesions (also called plaques) than people with relapsing MS and the lesions tend to contain fewer inflammatory cells. People with PPMS also tend to have more lesions in the spinal cord than in the brain. Together, these differences make PPMS more difficult to diagnose and treat than relapsing forms of MS. In the relapsing forms, women are affected two to three times as often as men; in PPMS, the numbers of women and men are approximately equal. The average age of onset is approximately 10 years later in PPMS than in relapsing MS. People with PPMS tend to experience more problems with walking and more difficulty . In general, people with PPMS may also require more assistance with their everyday activities. The National MS Society is pursuing all promising research paths and collaborating worldwide to drive progress in research in progressive MS, for which few therapies exist.

Spasticity (muscle stiffness) may be treated with medications, including baclofen or tizanidine. Urinary symptoms such as frequency, urgency or nocturia (the need to get up at night to urinate) may be treated with any one of a number of bladder medications including oxybutynin, darifenacin, tamsulosin, terazosin, onabotulintoxinA, and others — which reduce the activity of the bladder muscle. Bladder infections are treated with antibiotics. Constipation can be treated by increasing the amount of fiber in the diet and, if needed, by laxatives, suppositories and enemas. Pain is treated with medications to reduce nerve pain or with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Corticosteroids are sometimes used to decrease the inflammation of the spinal cord. HAM/TSP is a progressive neurological disorder that is rarely fatal. Most people live for decades after the diagnosis. Complications of the disease — such as severe urinary tract infections and/or pressure sores on the skin — can lead to a poorer prognosis. Adequate bladder management, good skin care and rehabilitation strategies (including physical and occupational therapy) can improve a person's prognosis. The course of the disease is variable but most change occurs during the first couple of years following the appearance of the first symptoms. After this, the condition is more stable and worsens more slowly. Some individuals have mild disability that does not interfere greatly with their lives. Up to half of all people with HAM/TSP may eventually need to use a wheelchair after many years with the disease.

The trial, known as the SYNERGY study, did not meet its primary endpoint of improving measures of physical function (including walking, upper limb coordination), cognitive function, or disability. The trial involved 418 people with relapsing MS (including relapsing-remitting and secondary-progressive MS) who were taking interferon beta-1a (Avonex) plus one of several doses of intravenous opicinumab or inactive placebo for 72 weeks.   LINGO is a protein seen in neurons and myelin-producing cells (oligodendrocytes), and blockading this protein with opicinumab has been shown to promote myelin repair in animal models. Another Phase 2 clinical trial of opicinumab was positive. It involved people who had experienced optic neuritis, which is often the first clinical episode of MS.     Extensive testing and monitoring during the SYNERGY study were undertaken to pinpoint the patient population, dosage and outcome measures that would inform the design of future trials. After analyzing results, the team found better treatment responses among individuals who had MS for less than 20 years, and who had specific findings on two imaging techniques (magnetic transfer ratio and diffusion tensor imaging) which might indicate myelin damage with more intact nerve fibers.   Now, a new study is ongoing (finished recruiting), which has enrolled 263 participants with relapsing MS who experienced their first MS symptom within the past 20 years, and met the imaging criteria defined by evaluating data from the SYNERGY trial. involves people who are using a disease-modifying therapy, plus either opicinumab or inactive placebo. The study is expected to be completed in 2022.

For some, these treatments reduce the number and severity of attacks and slow disease activity.   We are making significant progress in stopping MS: The Society joined with NIH to launch a therapy trial of the re-purposed therapy ibudilast in primary-progressive and secondary-progressive MS. suggest that ibudilast significantly slowed the rate of brain atrophy (shrinkage), which has been linked to cognitive and physical disability in MS.This therapy has been designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a “Fast Track Product” in terms of its development as a possible treatment of progressive MS. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the expansion of the use of the oral MS therapy Gilenya® (fingolimod, Novartis AG) and adolescents 10 years of age or older with relapsing MS. This is the first therapy specifically approved to treat pediatric MS. The Alliance is an unprecedented global collaboration of MS organisations, researchers, health professionals, the pharmaceutical industry, companies, trusts, foundations, donors and people affected by progressive MS, working together to address the unmet needs of people with progressive MS ─ rallying the global community to find solutions. The mission is to accelerate the development of effective treatments for people with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis to improve quality of life worldwide. There is increasing understanding that malfunctioning mitochondria, the tiny energy producers of cells (like battery packs), may contribute to nervous system damage in MS, opening up possibilities for preventing that damage.  An international team has reported the feasibility and safety of using a patient’s own altered blood cells to reduce immune responses against specific components of myelin. The National MS Society-launched MS Outcome Assessments Consortium and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration continue to clear a pathway for a new tool for improving and speeding clinical trials in MS. This team already has generated a new database containing nearly 2500 patient records from the placebo arms of nine MS clinical trials is now available for research by qualified investigators.  Identifying the causes of MS, and the underlying mechanisms and biological pathways involved in MS injury to the brain and spinal cord, will expose new targets for the development of treatments to stop the damage that causes disability. Diagnosing progressive disease based on biomarkers, in addition to clinical presentation would enable the testing of therapies earlier, promising better ways of protecting the nervous system from MS injury. High impact research areas include: Clarifying the destructive and protective roles of the adaptive and innate immune system, including both infiltrating and compartmentalized cells Determining the causes of tissue injury at different stages of disease, and whether neurodegeneration and demyelination can be independent events in MS Determining how evolving MRI sequences relate to pathological changes in the central nervous system Leveraging big data and transformative technologies to identify and interrogate relevant biological pathways and clinical/demographic features that influence disability progression Ensuring access to human central nervous system tissues/cells from MS patients and healthy controls for the purpose of gaining a thorough understanding of the neuropathology of MS Determining the specific pathologic underpinnings of MS progression Identifying objective indicators of disease activity that mark the transition to progression, measure treatment impact, and predict an individual’s course and response to therapy Determining mechanisms underlying the causes of progression in the absence of acute inflammation or relapses, the transition from relapsing to secondary progressive MS, and whether primary progressive and secondary progressive MS have similar biological underpinnings Developing better animal models that recapitulate human pathology to inform the study of the mechanisms underlying MS and progression Developing tools that allow better treatment decision making and personalized medicine, including therapy risks/benefits Testing approaches for the prevention and treatment of MS progression including repurposed/repositioned FDA-approved therapies, impact of early aggressive treatment vs. step therapy, and cell-based therapy  Read more about our successes and goals for stopping MS. Understanding and stopping MS in its tracks requires a better understanding of the role that the immune system plays in the inflammatory attacks on myelin and, very possibly, in the injury to axons (the wire-like nerve fibers) that contributes to longer-term disability. We Support academic and commercial research leading toward clinical trials of new therapies to stop damage and progression of disability; we are feeding the pipeline in several ways and pursuing therapies for EVERYONE with MS. Understanding the processes that lead to tissue damage in MS is crucial to our focus on reversing this damage to regain function through nervous system and myelin repair.

In HSCT for MS, hematopoietic (blood cell-producing) stem cells, which are derived from a person’s own (scientifically referred to as “autologous”) bone marrow or blood, are collected and stored, prior to depleting much of the immune system using chemotherapy drugs. Then the stored hematopoietic stem cells are reintroduced to the body. The new stem cells migrate to the bone marrow and over time reconstitute the immune system.  Is HSCT an FDA-approved therapy option for people with MS? The medications and procedures used in HSCT are already approved by the FDA. Publication of the outcomes from well controlled clinical studies of HSCT therapy will encourage greater acceptance and use by the medical community. The goal of HSCT is to reset the immune system and stop the inflammation that contributes to active relapsing MS.  The National Medical Advisory Committee of the National MS Society has written an article reviewing evidence related to the optimal use of autologous HSCT for the treatment of specific types of relapsing multiple sclerosis. The committee’s findings are published in () . There is growing evidence that aHSCT is not for everyone with MS but may be highly effective for people with relapsing MS who meet very specific characteristics. While the general approach is the same, there are different treatment protocols that vary depending on the medical center and doctors performing the procedure. In general, these are some of the steps involved: A person undergoing autologous HSCT to treat MS is given some form of chemotherapy, usually by infusion in the vein, for 1-2 days, and also another type of treatment for up to 10 days to stimulate the production of bone marrow stem cells and promote their release into the blood. Then some blood is drawn from a vein and the stem cells in the blood are stored for later use. Then the individual is usually hospitalized, and given a powerful mix of chemotherapies for several days to kill or suppress immune cells throughout the body. The stored stem cells are then infused into the bloodstream through a vein. The individual is usually given medicines such as antibiotics to help combat possible infection. The person remains in the hospital for an additional period of time while the immune system begins to rebuild itself. Sometimes individuals are discharged from the hospital in two to four weeks, but this can be longer.  The immune system gradually rebuilds itself within 3 to 6 months.   Read more frequently asked questions about HSCT and MS National MS Society Releases Recommendations for aHSCT-Bone Marrow Transplant for MS November 11, 2020 Investigators Recruiting Nationwide for Study Comparing AHSCT to Other Therapies in Active Relapsing MS January 7, 2020 Results Published from Study of Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplants (HSCT) in Relapsing-Remitting MS January 15, 2019 Results Published from Australian HSCT Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation Trial in MS December 13, 2018 Paper Published on Recommendations for Speeding Research on Cell-Based Therapies for MS July 24, 2017 ""Combined Analysis of Previously Published HSCT/Bone Marrow Transplantation Studies"" May 4, 2017 ""Large Study Showed Long-Term Benefits of Bone Marrow-Derived Stem Cell Transplantation in Some People with MS"" February 21, 2017 ""Final 5-Year Results Published from Study of Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation in Relapsing MS"" February 3, 2017 ""International Conference Held by National MS Society and ECTRIMS to Assess Progress and Define Research Directions for Cell-Based Therapies for MS""  December 9, 2015 “Positive Results from Study of Bone Marrow-Derived Stem Cells in People with Aggressive, Relapsing MS”  June 9, 2016 Additional research is focusing on figuring out who might benefit from this procedure and how to reduce its risks.

The Society has been engaged with the team conducting the trial and is helping with recruitment.  • A clinical trial is getting underway at medical centers in Denmark, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. The trial is testing treatment with HSCT compared with alemtuzumab in people with active relapsing-remitting MS.   • A phase 3 trial at Northwestern Medical in Chicago launched by Dr. Richard Burt to determine the optimal protocol for safety and benefit is ongoing and no longer recruiting participants. According to Northwestern, Dr. Burt will be going on a planned research sabbatical at the end of 2019. • In December 2020, a team from Lithuania published results of a study assessing cognitive dysfunction and physical disability after autologous HSCT. Thirteen people who did not respond to conventional therapies for highly active relapsing MS underwent autologous HSCT and completed 24 months of follow up. Disability progression was measured by the EDSS scale. Two people had one relapse during the first year and three people had one relapse during the second year. EDSS improved in 11 participants (84.6%). Information processing speed and verbal learning improved significantly at 12 months. No transplant-related deaths occurred. Fever was the most common side effect. • Researchers from Florence, Italy report on a small, open-label study involving 26 people with moderate to severe secondary progressive MS who underwent HSCT. Most showed signs of clinical or MRI inflammatory activity in the year prior to the procedure. Five years after the procedure, 42% of participants were stable with no further progression of disability that was reduced to 30% 10 years after transplant. No relapses or inflammatory activity occurred on MRI scans after treatment. These results suggest that HSCT might be appropriate in a subgroup of people with SPMS that have significant inflammatory activity as measured by MRI. Further study in larger numbers are needed to understand who among those with secondary progressive MS might benefit from HSCT.

Burt, MD (MD (going on research sabbatical late 2019 from Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) published results of the first randomized, control trial of bone marrow stem cell transplant (HSCT) in people with aggressive relapsing-remitting MS. They enrolled 110 people whose MS was not controlled by available disease-modifying therapies. Half received immunosuppressant therapy followed by hematopoietic (blood cell-producing) stem transplant. The other half were switched to a different disease-modifying therapy. Significantly fewer people experienced MS progression in the group that underwent HSCT, compared with the group who were switched to a different MS disease-modifying therapy. There were no deaths or life-threatening adverse events in either group. The investigators consider this study to be preliminary and recommend that further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine longer-term outcomes and safety. or in JAMA. • In December 2018, Drs. John Moore, David Ma (St. Vincent’s Hospital, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia) and colleagues reported results of a small clinical trial of HSCT conducted at a single medical center in Australia. This trial enrolled 35 people with relapsing-remitting MS or secondary progressive MS whose disease had not responded well to disease-modifying medications. There was no control group or blinding; all participants underwent the HSCT procedure. The team reported on results after following participants from 12 to 66 months after transplantation. After 12 months, 82% remained free of relapses, MRI-detected new or enlarging lesions, and progression (called “Event-Free Survival” or EFS). At two years after transplant, 65% of the group had EFS, and at three years 60%. EFS was better in those who had relapsing MS. Of 8 who experienced MS progression after transplantation, 2 had relapsing-remitting MS and 6 had secondary progressive MS. Twelve of thirteen whose disability scores improved after transplantation had relapsing-remitting MS. At this center, which has a long experience with bone marrow transplants, there were no transplant-related deaths. Many experienced complications expected from the chemotherapy cocktail (called “BEAMS”) used to deplete their bone marrow cells in preparation for the transplant. or in the JNNP. • In April 2017, researchers in Italy combined and analyzed results from 15 previously published studies of HSCT (Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation) involving 764 people with various forms of MS. They found that overall, the procedure showed a significant benefit against disease activity and progression. Two years after transplantation, about 83% of all participants had not progressed; overall, studies involving more people with relapsing-remitting MS had lower progression rates. The pooled results showed an overall transplant-related mortality rate of 2.1%. There were fewer deaths in later studies as researchers gained more experience with the procedure. here or the ​• In February 2017, results of an international study were published. The study evaluated long-term outcomes from HSCT in 261 people with different forms of MS. The transplants took place between 1995 and 2006, with a follow-up period of up to 16 years. Several different transplant protocols were followed. After 5 years, 46% still had not experienced any progression or worsening of symptoms, including 73% of those with relapsing MS and 33% of those with secondary progressive MS. Eight deaths (2.8%) occurred within 100 days of the transplant. Most of these occurred during the early development of the procedure; improvements in patient selection and transplant techniques have significantly reduced the mortality. Those with the best outcomes tended to be younger, had relapsing MS, lower accumulation of disability and had used fewer MS therapies prior to the transplant procedure. Additional research is needed to better understand who might benefit from this procedure and how it compares to the benefits of powerful immune-modulating therapies now available.  or the • In February 2017, results were published from a multi-center, 5-year trial called the HALT MS Study. It tested HSCT in 24 people with MS and active relapsing-remitting disease that was not controlled by disease-modifying medications. Results suggest that after five years, 69.2% of participants experienced no new disease activity after the procedure and did not need disease-modifying therapies to control their disease. All participants experienced severe and/or life threatening adverse events. Most of these occurred within the first 30 days after transplant and were related to low white blood cell counts and infections. This trial, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health, is an important addition to research needed to determine whether this approach to stem cell transplantation is safe and effective in people with MS. A larger, phase 3 study is in the process of launching (see""Ongoing Research in HSCT"" above).   or the  • In June 2016 researchers in Canada published results of a long-term HSCT trial involving 24 people with aggressive relapsing-remitting MS whose disease was not controlled with available therapies. Three years after the procedure, 70% remained free of disease activity, with no relapses, no new MRI-detected inflammatory brain lesions, and no signs of progression. None of the surviving participants experienced clinical relapses or required MS disease-modifying therapies to control their disease, and 40% experienced reductions in disability. One participant died and another required intensive hospital care for liver complications.

According to a company press release, the study met primary and most secondary endpoints, significantly reducing the annual relapse rate in adults with relapsing MS. Side effects were said to be similar to those reported from previous studies of ponesimod and for this class of therapy. These include potential to cause a temporary slowing of heart rate, anxiety, dizziness, breathlessness, raised liver enzymes, influenza, sleeplessness and swelling of the lower legs.  Further details will be presented at the 2019 Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS in September. A second Phase 3 trial is underway, and the company plans to apply to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seeking approval to treat relapsing MS later this year.  DETAILS Multiple sclerosis involves an immune system attack on the brain and spinal cord. Ponesimod is a compound that binds to a docking site (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1, or S1Preceptor) on immune cells, including T cells and B cells (lymphocytes) that have been implicated in causing nervous system damage in MS. The pill induces immune cells to remain in lymph nodes, inhibiting their migration into the brain and spinal cord. Similar therapies are approved by the FDA to treat MS—Gilenyafingolimod, Novartis International AG) and Mayzent (siponimod, Novartis International AG), and one is under review by the FDA (ozanimod, Celgene Corporation).  In an earlier phase II study in people with MS, ponesimod significantly reduced disease activity seen on MRI scans ( 2014 Nov; 85(11): 1198–1208).   Participants were randomly assigned to receive oral ponesimod 20 mg once daily or teriflunomide 14 mg once daily for 108 weeks. The primary outcome that was measured was the rate of relapses. Secondary endpoints included fatigue, disease activity on imaging scans, and disability accumulation.   According to a company press release, the study met primary and most secondary endpoints, significantly reducing the annual relapse rate in adults with relapsing MS. Side effects were said to be similar to those reported from previous studies of ponesimod and for this class of therapy. These include potential to cause a temporary slowing of heart rate, anxiety, dizziness, breathlessness, raised liver enzymes, influenza, sleeplessness and swelling of the lower legs. Also in phase 2 studies, an initial temporary slowing of heart rate was minimized by starting people on low doses and gradually increasing over several days.   Further details will be presented at the 2019 Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS in September. A is ongoing, evaluating ponesimod in people with MS who are still experiencing relapses while taking Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate, Biogen, Inc.).   The company plans to submit an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seeking approval to treat relapsing MS later this year.   Aubagio is a registered trademark of Sanofi Genzyme Mayzent is a registered trademark of Novartis International AG Gilenya is a registered trademark of Novartis International AG Tecfidera is a registered trademark of Biogen Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

1ebeead9-ee60-4a85-8c8f-8d5032ccbb54,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS       Unlike relapsing forms of MS, primary-progressive MS (PPMS) is characterized by a fairly steady, gradual change in functional ability over time — most often related to walking — without any relapses. Due to this basic difference in the disease course, different criteria are used to make an accurate diagnosis of PPMS. The criteria for a diagnosis of PPMS are: One year of disease progression (worsening of neurological function without remission), A type of lesion in the brain that is recognized by experts in as being typical of MS Two or more lesions of a similar type in the spinal cord Evidence in the spinal fluid of oligoclonal band or an elevated IgG index, both of which are indicative of immune system activity in the central nervous system Meeting these criteria can sometimes take a fairly long time, particularly if the person has only recently begun to experience neurologic symptoms. Several studies have suggested that the PPMS may take two to three years longer to diagnose than relapsing-remitting MS.

371a2ef6-8c50-477a-9701-75e61afb8278,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and NMO Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD), also known as Devic's disease, is an autoimmune disorder in which white blood cells and antibodies primarily attack the optic nerves and the spinal cord, but may also attack the brain. The damage to the optic nerves produces swelling and inflammation that cause pain and loss of vision; the damage to the spinal cord causes weakness or paralysis in the legs or arms, loss of sensation, and problems with bladder and bowel function. NMO is a relapsing-remitting disease. During a relapse, new damage to the optic nerves and/or spinal cord can lead to accumulating disability. Unlike MS, there is no progressive phase of this disease. Therefore, preventing attacks is critical to a good long-term outcome. The cause of NMO in the majority of cases is due to a specific attack on the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channel located within the optic nerves and spinal cord. Aquaporins (AQPs) are proteins that transport water across cell membranes. More than 70% of NMO and NMOSD patients test positive for an antibody biomarker in the blood called the NMO-IgG or anti-AQP4 antibody. In people with NMO who test negative for anti-AQP4 antibodies, up to a third may be positive for auto-antibodies directed against a component of myelin called myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). People with anti-MOG related NMO similarly have episodes of transverse myelitis and optic neuritis, but recovery after attacks appears to be better than anti-AQP4 related disease.   There are an estimated 4,000 people with NMO in the United States and a quarter-million people worldwide. NMO is more common in women (greater than 80 percent) than men; NMO occurs in all parts of the world and may be the most common form of demyelinating disease in certain populations such as Africans, Asians and Native Americans. NMO can occur at any age — in children as young as 3 and adults as old as 90 — but appears most often between ages 40 and 50. NMO is considered to be an autoimmune disease (where the immune system reacts against healthy tissue as if it was a threat). In the majority of cases of NMO, the immune system recognizes the AQP4 water channel as foreign and develops antibodies (NMO-IgG or anti-AQP4 antibody) to attack AQP4 on the surface of astrocytes, which in turn damages the astrocytes. Astrocytes are supportive cells in the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves, and damage to astrocytes is believed to lead to demyelination. In cases associated with anti-MOG antibodies, it is considered that anti-MOG antibodies may trigger an attack on the myelin sheath resulting in demyelination. Symptoms are generally more severe after an NMO attack than an MS attack. NMO rarely has a secondary progressive stage as in MS; disabilities accumulate from repeated acute attacks. NMO is present across the world, especially among non-Caucasians; MS has a higher incidence in temperate climates and Caucasians. Fatigue in NMO is usually an indirect result of living with the disease and its symptoms (secondary fatigue); in MS, fatigue is both primary (caused by the disease process itself) and secondary. NMO usually affects only the optic nerve and spinal cord at the beginning of the disease, although there may be lesions present in other specific areas of the brain. MS typically affects the brain as well as the spinal cord and optic nerve. NMO-IgG (anti-AQP4 antibody) is not found in people with MS but is found in 70 percent of those with NMO. In MS, individual episodes are usually mild; their cumulative effect over time may or not not cause progressive disability. In NMO, the opposite is true and therefore early diagnosis is critical; acute episodes are usually severe and – if untreated – can have devastating, irreversible effects on function. Some people with NMO also have other autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren’s Syndrome or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).

It is designed to hamper movement of potentially damaging immune cells from the bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord. This clinical trial, sponsored by Biogen, involved people with who had not experienced relapses in the two years before enrolling in the study. Of about 85 percent of people who are initially diagnosed with , many will eventually transition to secondary-progressive MS, which means that after a period of time in which they experience relapses and remissions, the disease will begin to progress more steadily, with or without relapses. Although many of the MS disease-modifying therapies are approved for “relapsing forms” of MS, which includes people with secondary-progressive MS who experience relapses, there are few options for those with progressive forms of MS in the absence of relapses.   A total of 889 participants with secondary-progressive MS were recruited in 15 countries worldwide, and were randomly assigned to receive either natalizumab 300 mg or placebo, infused into the vein every four weeks, for a total of 96 weeks. Most of the participants had EDSS disability scores of 6 to 6.5, meaning they required a walking aid. The primary endpoint established for the trial was to determine whether Tysabri could slow the accumulation of disability, as determined by a “composite” measure. This measure combined results from the EDSS scale of disability, the 9-hole Peg Test of upper extremity function, and the Timed 25-Foot Walk test of mobility and leg function. According to the press release, the study did not meet its primary endpoint of slowing progression measured by the composite measure of disability, results from the 9-Hole Peg Test suggested that Tysabri slowed the loss of function in the arms and hands.

If the other approved disease-modifying medications are helpful in relapsing MS, why don’t they work in PPMS? My MS just keeps getting worse. Does everyone with PPMS become severely disabled? I’ve read about all the different symptoms that MS can cause, but since my diagnosis with PPMS my biggest problem has been with my walking. Will I develop all the other symptoms as well? What medications are available to treat primary progressive MS (PPMS)? One medication – ® has been approved by U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to treat primary progressive MS as well as relapsing forms of MS, which include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease (RRMS) and active secondary progressive disease (SPMS with relapses).  In addition to this disease-modifying therapy, a wide range of symptomatic medications and rehabilitation strategies are used to manage PPMS. If the other approved disease-modifying medications are helpful in relapsing MS, why don’t they work in PPMS? The other we currently have available primarily target inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). They have all been shown to reduce the number of acute relapses (also called attacks or exacerbations) and number of new lesions (also called plaques) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. PPMS involves much less inflammation and more gradual destruction and loss of nerve fibers. As a result, people with PPMS tend to have fewer brain lesions than people with relapsing MS, and the lesions tend to contain fewer inflammatory cells. The available disease-modifying medications are not effective in slowing the nerve damage that occurs in PPMS.   My MS just keeps getting worse. Does everyone with PPMS become severely disabled? MS is a variable and unpredictable disease. Although PPMS is characterized by fairly steady progression, one person’s symptoms may progress differently or more rapidly than someone else’s symptoms. Because spinal cord lesions (also called plaques) are more common than brain lesions in PPMS, problems with walking are very common, but other symptoms may occur as well. The medication, ®, has been approved to treat PPMS as well as relapsing forms of MS. This medication may slow the progression you are experiencing. At the same time, ongoing and can help you stay active, maintain your safety and independence, and enhance your quality of life.  I’ve read about all the different symptoms that MS can cause, but since my diagnosis with PPMS my biggest problem has been with my walking. Will I develop all the other symptoms as well? Because people with PPMS tend to have more spinal cord lesions than brain lesions, problems with walking are very common. In fact, the onset of PPMS is usually characterized by gradually increasing walking problems and fatigue. Lesions in the brain could cause other symptoms to develop, including visual disturbance, cognitive changes, mood changes, balance problems, and tremor, among others. However, there is no way to predict this ahead of time, and your primary challenge may continue to be with walking.

The results were announced in a February 17 press release from Celgene Corporation. According to the press release, the company expects data from an additional phase III study to be available later this year.   Ozanimod is a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator. It is thought to act by retaining certain white blood cells in the body’s lymph nodes, keeping them out of circulation and from entering the central nervous system. In an earlier phase II trial, in 258 participants with relapsing MS, disease activity on MRI scans was reduced  in people taking two different doses of ozanimod, compared to people taking placebo. ()   For the phase III trial, all 1,346 participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups, taking either daily oral ozanimod (.5 mg) and an inactive placebo injected into muscle once weekly; daily oral ozanimod (1 mg) and inactive placebo injected into muscle once weekly; or Avonex and an oral placebo daily for 12 months.   The primary outcome was relapse rate, measured at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included disease activity as observed on MRI scans. Results related to the time to onset of disability progression, as measured by the EDSS disability scale, will be evaluated in combination with results from another phase III trial still underway.   The study met the primary endpoint in reducing the relapse rate, as well as the secondary MRI endpoints. According to the press release, the overall safety and tolerability profile was similar to the phase II study, but no further information was provided. In the phase II study, the most common adverse events were respiratory infections, headache, and urinary tract infections. Three serious adverse events occurred (optic nerve inflammation, a psychological disorder, and non-cancerous cervical cell changes) but were not considered to be related to treatment.    According to the press release, the company expects data from a second phase III trial to be available later this year.   “We look forward to seeing the full results of this study,” said Bruce F. Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research at the National MS Society. “We hope these results lead to a treatment advance for people living with relapsing MS.” Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in and are leading to better understanding and moving us closer to . An estimated 1 million people live with MS in the United States. Most are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, and it affects women three times more than men. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

Schilder’s disease is thought to be a variant of MS. As the disease progresses, larger and larger patches of demyelination occur, interfering with motor movement, speech, personality, hearing and vision, ultimately affecting the vital functions of respiration, heart rate, blood pressure. Schilder's disease is also known as diffuse cerebral sclerosis, diffuse cerebral sclerosis of Schilder and myelinoclastic diffuse sclerosis. Schilder’s disease is the same as Addison-Schilder disease (adrenoleukodystophy), a rare inherited disease characterized by a biochemical abnormality in the myelin. The underlying cause of Schilder’s disease is unknown. Schilder’s disease often occurs shortly after an infectious illness and may begin with headache, a general feeling of discomfort or illness, and fever. Symptoms are caused by widespread patches of demyelination throughout the brain and spinal cord, resulting in slowed transmission of nerve signals. Schilder’s disease resembles MS in both its pathology (widespread demyelination of the brain) and some of its symptoms (difficulties with movement, speech and memory, among others).
