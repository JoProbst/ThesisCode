Whether you give monthy, or make a one-time donation, your donations help. Sadly, the creep of pseudoscience – as manifested in the legitimization of unproven alternative approaches to health – continues. Ontario naturopaths are pushing hard to become a self-regulating profession, with expanded rights to prescribe drugs and order tests.  Thankfully, the Ontario Medical Association is pushing back. This is not a turf war – there are more than enough patients out there.  Nor is the resistance from the medical community founded on a fear of a loss of professional status. This is about patient safety and, more fundamentally, the role of science in the Canadian health care system.  Naturopathic medicine, despite claims to the contrary, is not an evidence-based approach.  Given this reality, provincial health ministries need to carefully consider the long-term implications – including the legal and ethical challenges – of formally legitimizing the pseudoscientific. If naturopathic medicine were governed by science, as practitioners increasingly claim, they would not provide: detoxification services, homeopathic remedies, most herbal remedies, and .  But these types of services are, as evidenced by , the core of naturopathic medicine.  If you don’t believe me, I invite you to Google “detoxification and naturopath”.  You will get a list of clinics offering things like colon cleanses (useless, potentially harmful, and a bit disgusting), that create an “energy field similar to that found in the human body” (so scientifically ridiculous that it borders on parody), and (ditto). Lucky for naturopaths they are not bound by science.  I do not mean that the laws of physics do not apply to the things that happen within the walls of naturopathic clinics. I am fairly certain an apple will still fall, the Earth still orbits the Sun, and the application of the scientific method would still nudge us closer to the truth about the therapies they deploy. Rather, I mean that the profession is not wedded to a scientific worldview. It is a practice built around a philosophical framework based on the alleged “healing power of nature” or, to quote , the “principle of healing through the cooperative power of nature” and the “individual’s inherent self-healing mechanisms.”  This kind of rhetoric may sound inviting, particularly since it plays to eternally popular and consistently unsupportable idea that “natural” is always better (try consuming some arsenic, tar sand, or mercury). It is, however, scientifically meaningless. What naturopaths – and, for that matter, other alternative practitioners – increasingly suggest is that they are in a position to the best of both conventional and alternative practices. They can, or so they claim, between the worlds of pseudoscience and science. They can offer ionic footbaths and, at the same time, provincial governments for the right to provide patients with more conventional, and potentially harmful, procedures and drugs. Putting aside the boatload of conceptual and patient care issues associated with legitimizing magical thinking (the of a 7-year-old Alberta boy who was given homeopathy instead of real medicine is a tragic example), there are many profound, and often overlooked, legal and ethical challenges associated with seeking to integrate a pseudoscience-based practice into our health care system. To cite just one example, how will the informed consent process work?  In Canada, health care providers must tell patients anything a reasonable person in the patients’ position would want to know.  As such, a science-based approach to the provision of a homeopathic remedy would, for instance, require the practitioner to tell a patient that other than a possible placebo effect the treatment does not work and that it is scientifically implausible.  Any other approach would be both unethical and fail to meet the legal standard of informed consent. A similar approach, by the way, would be required for the ionic footbath. I call this the . A naturopath can’t, from the perspective of the patient, switch between wearing a “science hat” and “pseudoscience hat.” If you are a science-informed profession, than this is the standard to which you should be held. If naturopaths are given the opportunity to provide potentially , what approach to informed consent will they use? Will they put on their “science hat” (as would seem to be required by some )? Of course, there are also problems associated with naturopaths’ knowledge about and approach to science. Studies have found that naturopaths view the value of evidence differently than conventional practitioners.  For example, a US found that only 24% of naturopaths found the “results of randomized controlled trials as ‘very useful.’” I am fully aware of the many deficiencies of conventional medicine, including the perverting influence of commercial forces and the lack of good evidence to support many common practices and therapies.  Also, many Canadians are obviously not satisfied with their interactions with conventional practitioners – which, it seems, are too brief, mechanical and impersonal. These issues need to be addressed. But the response to the problems of conventional medicine should not lead us to the embrace of pseudoscience. On the contrary, it should push us toward better, independent and rigorously executed health care research.  It should push us toward a science-informed approach for all therapies and preventative strategies. As nicely summarized by well-known science advocate, Ben Goldacre, a flaw in aircraft design does not mean we should turn to magic carpets. The Oxford University Press recently that “science” was the top word of 2013.  I took this as a positive sign that we were collectively moving away from our embrace of pseudoscience.  I hope that in 2014 science continues its ascension, particularly in the realm of health policy and in hallways of provincial and territorial health ministries. Timothy Caulfield holds the Canada Research Chair in Health Law and Policy at the University of Alberta, is a Trudeau Fellow and is the author of The Cure for Everything: Untangling the Twisted Messages about Health, Fitness and Happiness (Penguin, 2012). Follow Tim on Twitter Enter the debate: reply to an existing comment Science is but one worldview. We who are the high priests of science would of course like the worldview to prevail (I am a practicing MD). If I didn’t believe in the general principles of science, I probably wouldn’t have risen within the priestly ranks to my current status. This seems pretty self evident and likely pretty innocuous. On the other hand my priestly powers give me a lot of power, prestige and by extension money. Can I really be objective as either an individual or as a collective priesthood when that power is challenged? Of course I can and should make arguments but should they simply be taken as valid because I say so or even because science says so. Let’s be honest, medicine is a long way from a science. Ask any physicist what she thinks of the science of medicine. Sheldon Cooper’s dismissal of neuroscience is a perfect example of the response you might get (yes I know it’s fictional but I think it is pretty close to accurate on this point). We can’t very well hold up science as our right to power when we routinely ignore many of sciences basic principles. Even if medicine is a science and we as it’s practitioners can be seen as upholding those principles, there is nothing to say that society as a whole accepts or understands those principles. I would suggest that a brief survey of the things that drive our societies decisions would quickly give one pause in any belief that science drives either individual or collective human decision making. Supposedly paternalism went out of medicine decades ago but this kind of dismissal of any belief but our own and more specifically our patient’s belief when it conflicts with our own suggests it is alive and well. This is an important debate to be sure but we in the hallowed high halls of medicine need to start from the realization that we are failing our patients and therefore need to question and reevaluate all of our basic beliefs and see if they still serve us and more importantly serve our patients. To do this we must collectively try to define health in real terms that have meaning to our patients but then always be reay to reevaluate that definition in the context of the individual. Only then can we determine the tools that will allows us to achieve our collective desire of health and hopefully happiness. Clinging to dogma and doctrine without examination is unlikely I serve anyone’s purpose. You are as misinformed as the practitioners you attack. Every single ND that I know (and I know a lot of them) has at the very least a BSc, and most have an MSc. Naturopathy is based in science and ALL interventions are scientifically proven, if not in a pharm-sponsored study. %featured%Your kind of misinformed vitriol is doing more damage to the health of Canadians than any “psuedo-science” could ever hope to.%featured% “As such, a science-based approach to the provision of a homeopathic remedy would, for instance, require the practitioner to tell a patient that other than a possible placebo effect the treatment does not work and that it is scientifically implausible.” Exactly. So all MDs should be telling their patients that the antibiotics they just prescribed for a cold or a flu will be absolutely ineffective, considering the ailment is not bacterial in nature. But they don’t. I would argue that the majority of MDs do not provide scripts for viral illnesses. Obviously it is not always possible to tell the difference between a viral and a bacterial illness (sinusitis and pharyngitis being some of the more common offenders) however we have guidelines based off research which aid the management of these common illnesses. The majority of MDs I have trained under always provide teaching around viral vs bacterial illness and the risk of antibiotics (including the risk that we’re simply treating a virus and there will be no effect). I have continued this into my practice. It only takes one or two training “sessions” that take an extra 2-3 minutes. After that patients get the difference and are usually quite happy to wait out a sinusitis or AOM before representing for antibiotics. I realize that not all practices run this way but I would argue the majority do. Yes. As much as astrology and alchemy are based in science. You might not want your compatriot Laurie down below to see that. Lest she attack you too for “scientism”. It isn’t based in science. You won’t find me wasting my time and money going to a naturopath! I had to double-check the date of this website, for these comments sound an awful-lot-like the scare-mongers of the 1960’s-70’s, before naturopathy was mainstream. Western medicine used to be the only avenue for a patient and it came up woefully short. People wanted alternative medicine and got it. Mostly everyone who uses alternative medicine knows it’s alternative – it is complimentary to, not instead of, western medicine. Many people have been cured of ailments because of the holistic nature of naturopathy, instead of just waiting for the band-aid to be applied by western medicine. While I will always agree to regulations of any health-practice, let’s not throw out the baby with the bathwater… Probably because there are things worth being scared about. If you read the draft regulations, you will see that naturopaths are asking to be allowed to prescribe and compound (ie. mix themselves) IV potassium chloride. Potassium chloride is one of the deadliest chemical compounds we have. It is so deadly that it is the poison of choice for US states who execute their prisoners by lethal injection: %featured%Self-regulation is about protecting the public. Clearly Ontario’s naturopaths have yet to grasp this. They are not ready, and will probably never be ready, for self-regulation. Time to dissolve the transitional council.%featured% Jill I have to disagree. The majority of advertising I see around complementary and alternative medicine is around being an “alternative” to conventional medicine. For example, look at “thermal breast scans” which have not been validated whatsoever. I have several patients who are not undergoing regular screening as they feel protected by the “thermal scans.” If you take a good look at these thermal scans they describe themselves as a “natural” and “safe radiation free” screening method. Seems to me that these folks are indeed offering “complete alternatives” to conventional medicine. Furthermore, your description seems to completely disregard the profession of family medicine. A significant portion of my day, and each patient encounter, is spent on preventative medicine. The issue is that the “prevention” and “holistic” advice of most naturopaths is not based in the least bit of science. I am grateful when a patient comes back on a healthier diet that their naturopath recommended. I am not so grateful when they come back saying they require this or that vitamin test because their naturopath ordered it and then refuse to take a statin (even if they have a very high risk of ACS) because their naturopath said they can avoid MIs completely with diet and exercise. Allowing naturopaths to prescribe and order tests simply legitimizes them in a laypersons eye. This is both dangerous and irresponsible as naturopaths are not trained to manage potentially dangerous situations. On the contrary, every physician, regardless of the current specialty has at least some emergency experience and knows of the red flags to look for. One such example is a patient I saw with multiple co-morbidities and some abdominal gas. Of all the the chronic issues they had (DMT2, HTN, etc.) the gas issues would cause them less morbidity in the end. However, DMT2 and HTN rarely cause symptoms. Gas is symptomatic and uncomfortable. They saw a naturopath who then charged $250 for an “allergy test” where the patient held an ionized rod. They were subsequently diagnosed with an allergy of some sort and started on a $80 q2weeks supplement. As this was expensive for a fixed income patient they decided to skip the dispensing fees of their meds for the month so get all of this done. When they returned to me they were off medication with uncontrolled HTN and DMT2, $330 less and the same amount of abdominal gas. The naturopath ended up causing the exact opposite of the preventative medicine. Well in response to your anecdote about your gassy patient, my mother had the same problem. Her Naturopath advised her to cut out dairy and gluten and voila — no more gas. So, folks, if you’re willing to get a second opinion from another MD when things aren’t working out don’t be afraid to get a second opinion from another Naturopath, Homeopath, whatever. With all the controversy over the high adverse risks of statins patients should do whatever it takes to stay away from them. This is becoming a polarized debate when the issue is not about “naturopathy”, but one about select individuals. This distribution is not unique to any field of medicine as they all have quacks and schemers and those individuals should never be ignored. The fact remains that any school of thought has diversity of opinion, various degrees of gullibility, greed, altruism, diligence, etc. My wife is a naturopathic doctor, has a BSc in molecular biology and is entirely evidence based in her practice. I know enough to know what I *don’t* know about medicine, but I do know a lot about what she goes through. She routinely gets results outside of established medical norms, not by magic, but by staying current. She often finds herself at odds with (fewer lately) MDs looking for dated tolerances in test results, while her information is more current with sometimes hundreds of studies (in varying degrees of quality) to back them up. Her protocols are aligned with current information and THAT is why she is a good doctor. Science itself, is curious and doubtful without evidence, but humble and open to self improvement through hard work and discovery. Sometimes that takes the form of a new branch of medicine, sometimes that turns out to be a bad idea, sometimes not. Welcome to life and taking care of your health, we’re just not there yet. Some MDs are readily open to new supplement or diet based studies, many are closed because of a rigid bias against “naturopathic medicine”. A good study raises interest, but consensus between many good studies should be paid attention to when possible and no one who treats the public, is entitled to actively ignore years of consistent, rigorous data, be they ND or MD, in the spirit of automatic bias. It’s frustrating that some ND’s offer unproven treatments without a clear, unambiguous explanation, particularly for the NDs who are evidence based. People can pay for whatever they want, but a doctor can’t say something “works” without evidence in my book. It’s equally frustrating that many MDs turn a blind eye to significant findings coming from naturopathic sources due to lazy / automatic bias, or getting the majority of their info from pharma. This is particularly troubling for image concious MDs who are interested in integrative medicine and don’t want to be seen as dinosaurs. (This is how some stubborn MDs are seen sometimes by evidence based NDs if you wonder what goes on in their heads) This debate has heated up and has deteriorated from concerns about integrity and into forceful branding of naturopathy. This is symptomatic of either agenda or second order ignorance (ignorance of being ignorant) and is ultimately up to the patients to choose their doctor. In the end, you can’t get around trusting someone, you can only decide who that is. Ask your ND if they are evidence based, ask for studies and how they form their opinions. If they can’t answer the question more often than not, there may be a problem. I also tend to trust those who don’t make polarization their focus as they tend to look in one place to get their answers. Indeed Jill. Indeed on a daily basis Western Medicine comes up short on many levels including; listening to the client, providing reasonable visit time as opposed to jam in as many 15 minute billings as one can, considering what else besides the almighty prescription, to name just a few. I enjoy a very positive and productive relationship between my Naturopath and my family physician. I am fortunate. Family physicians jam as many appointments they can into their clinic hours for two reasons: 1 – they get paid roughly $40 per encounter from the provincial government. That is not take-home pay, that is revenue for the clinic that must pay rent, equipment, and salaries for ALL clinic staff. Therefore in order to stay afloat they must make enough revenue. They are not ethically allowed to charge more, and the Alberta provincial government actually tried to DECREASE the amount they pay doctors just this past year. 2 – There are currently not enough family doctors to go around, so wait lists and waiting rooms are stuffed to the gills and people complain when they have to book appointments far in advance and often say “can’t you just fit me in?”. And then people complain that doctors cannot take the time! Naturopaths, however, do not have either of these problems. They charge whatever they like straight from the patient, as well as making money from the products and supplements that they sell. Some people claim that doctors benefit from pharmaceutical companies, but this is not the case. Family doctors are often frustrated by this situation, and it is a strong deterrent for medical students choosing a specialty as they graduate. Is the answer to turn to a naturopath to receive questionable and decidedly NOT evidence-based care? Or to pressure your local government to reform the primary care system? Thank you Carol. I entirely agree and would go further. I was a dual educated ‘MD’ and CBT psychologist with extra training in such areas as physiotherapy, dietetics and even acupuncture in chronic pain relief. I should be the perfect holistic practitioner but I was prevented administratively from using half of my knowledge. Using the other half, really bare minimum diagnosis and therapy, was so time consuming that I burned out and have not gone back into mainstream medicine since but work on my own terms as a general psychologist mainly in education and the corporate world and as a personal developer. I have also learned and worked on the other side of the fence with alternative health and am frankly insulted that those who know nothing about body or mind call themselves holistic practitioners. Shane’s wife sounds like the exception but far too many ‘alternative practitioners’ are hairdresser dropouts with their ethics, psychological skills and anatomical understanding of the body. They simply do not have the scientific background to handle information, mainly because of their passive aggressive use of language in which words are meaningless and used on the basis of being pretty or a manipulative in the worst way, the incomprehensible use of jargon as a weapon to disempower the receiver. They are disinterested in any form of truth except their definition that is dictated by popularity, book sales and Facebook likes. In fact, they are just lowest common denominator salespeople using all the lose/win, win/lose strategies used in the corporate world to sell worthless trinkets and unhealthy foods. I have written various articles on these themes in my blog, cilnicalarts.blogspot.com. My experience is that when used knowledgeably and objectively, particularly in conjunction and consistently with the principles of physiotherapy, lifestyle changes and evidence based psychology, they can act as a ‘super-placebo’ but the vast majority of ‘healers’ do not have the knowledge or morality to get anything positive out of their therapy. So I would be quite happy for ‘healers’ to be registered so long as the same standards were applied to them as to doctors, including examinations in statistical understanding and critical reading skills as well as holistic health knowledge! Dear Mr. Caulfield: Congratulations on a courageous and excellent column. It reminds me of the warnings issued by Carl Sagan in his 1995 book, “The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a candle in the dark.” His words ring even truer today: “I worry that, especially as the Millennium edges nearer, pseudo-science and superstition will seem year by year more tempting, the siren song of unreason more sonorous and attractive. Where have we heard it before? Whenever our ethnic or national prejudices are aroused, in times of scarcity, during challenges to national self-esteem or nerve, when we agonize about our diminished cosmic place and purpose, or when fanaticism is bubbling up around us – then, habits of thought familiar from ages past reach for the controls. The candle flame gutters. Its little pool of light trembles. Darkness gathers. The demons begin to stir.” You, and Sagan, have stirred them and they do not like it. You will be vilified and attacked. The quackyologists and their adherents will be apoplectic. I especially enjoyed the comment you attributed to Ben Goldacre regarding magic carpets. %featured%As as a friend of mine said, “When I have to fly somewhere, I always hope the pilot is trained in “traditional” aeronautics rather than “alternative” aeronautics. I am more likely to arrive at my destination with the former.”%featured% Equating aeronautics to Western medicine is “illogical, Captain”. I assume you are referring to surgery when you make this comparison. As more and more hospitals close or consolidate in large urban centres, however, the role of the hospital is changing to be focussed on emergency and acute care. What about all the other aspects of healthcare which do not depend on expensive diagnostics and surgical procedures? Western medicine has accomplished a great deal; however, it has been concerned with sickness, rather than with health. Science begins with scepticism, and that also needs to be applied to the medical establishment and the private health insurance industry that feeds of it. One of the other issues which the author touched on, but didn’t fully go into, is that of accountability. As the author mentioned, a seven year old boy in Calgary lost his life due to these complementary and alternative medicine As an MD, if I assessed the child and the same outcome occurred I would be in under investigation with the College and potentially liable for a civil lawsuit, regardless of whether or not an error was made on my part. However, instead we have a mother (who in all likelihood meant the best for her son) being charged while the “professional” who gave her medical advice is free to cause the same harm to someone else. Accountability is a key part of medicine which is lacking in the alternative and complementary medicine. If I do a history, physical or investigation of some sort I am obliged to follow this through to the end whether this requires extra reading, PubMed searching or a referral to a specialized colleague. Even if I can’t nail down a diagnosis, I make sure to rule out all the “red flags” and possible diagnoses to ensure that I’m not going to cause any morbidity or mortality to the patient. Unfortunately I just don’t see the same level of accountability with the alternative medicine crowd. A seven year old boy in Calgary lost his life because his mother mistakenly believed he had the flu. She did not take him to any health care provider. The establishment of a College of Naturopathy provides the same public accountability as the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Why would you be against it, unless you’re of the opinion (as many are) that the College of Physicians and Surgeons is more of a CYA organization. I disagree with your statement that you would be under any sort of investigation unless a complaint was made against you and if you were following the guidelines of the College and your medical association it would be futile for a patient to launch a civil lawsuit. You might also want to investigate why malpractice insurance for non-mainstream medical practitioners is so much lower than it is for drug-based medicine practitioners… probably has something to do with the fact that it doesn’t kill people or land them in Emerg. with adverse reactions. This is the worst journalistic effort and badly researched article by a purported Health ethicist. Irresponsible at best. %featured%Citizens will make up their mind without your consent. Integrative medicine is here to stay, like it, or not.%featured% I see you will be opting for the magic carpet route. Very bold. Yep. A sucker is born every minute and there are enough of those around for these “naturopathic doctors” to suck dry. Interesting that someone who obviously thinks that he possesses a “scientific worldview” can be so unscientific in substituting opinions for facts. It also appears that Mr. Caulfield is attempting to make it appear that his opinions are those of the Ontario Medical Association, yet I see no evidence that he has credentials for membership (let alone as appointed spokesperson). Medical ethicists in mainstream medical journals are increasingly questioning the veracity and scope of corporate sponsored drug and medical device trials. All readers need do is Google “health technology assessments” to find that all is not rosy in mainstream medicineland — less than 50% of current treatments are considered “effective”. Regulation is not preventing the estimated 35,000 deaths that occur annually in Canada from prescription drugs and medical error. Perhaps attempting to libel and lampoon Naturopaths using examples of non-drug based treatments that may or may not be used and falsely claiming that there is no research supporting these therapies etc. makes him feel more qualified to comment than those who actually take responsibility for patient outcomes. What Mr. Caulfield is promoting with his “scientific worldview” is a philosophy most of us classify as Scientism. It’s vitriolic, narrow-minded, and relies entirely on perception. Yes. Damn that scientism! Why should we rely on science to treat illnesses? Who says we shouldn’t use made up interventions to treat disease? Scientism is not science, it’s philosophy. And it looks like you’ve got a good dose of it. I only hope the naturopaths will stick to the treatments they give to other people when they themselves get sick. Thanks for a great column. This needs saying, and saying often: but, as the comments show, it won’t convince those who believe in the powers of integrated/ alternative/ complementary therapies, because theirs is a faith-based conviction. Also a timely commentary, with the publication of the editorial “Enough Is Enough: Stop Wasting Money on Vitamin and Mineral Supplements”, Ann Intern Med. 2013;159(12):850-851. Looking for proof of your starting assumption is not science. Your reverence for conventional medicine shows that you also have a faith based conviction. Unfortunately he confused homeopathy which is poorly supported by evidence with naturopathy which is well supported by evidence. As chair in health law and policy he should know better. Michael, the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine lists six branches of treatment central to the Naturopathic approach (): acupuncture/Asian medicine botanical medicine physical medicine (massage, hydrotherapy, etc.) clinical nutrition lifestyle counselling … and the CMA speciality profile list includes plastic surgery among emergency medicine and medical oncology. We know there is a difference, whether it be ‘speciality profile’ or ‘branch of treatment’, and that the terms shouldn’t be used interchangeably. I agree with Michael and am disappointed that Mr. Caulfield chose to disregard the fact that they are different. Or perhaps he just didn’t notice the difference, which happens in conventional medical practice more than it should (e.g. medication errors). I agree with the comments made by R. Kirschner, particularly regarding the conceit of the author. Obviously you do to know much about science. Your definition of what is science is deeply flawed, as it is limited. Science includes experimentation as much as it includes mathematics and physics. Most medicine is not science based anyway as it is narrowly defined. What works works regardless of how you categorize and label it. As Einstein said: “Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts” This sums it up. Do some research and reading, and actually learn about wht science is, what health is versus disease. Let’s be frank. Tim. Pseudoscience is putting 4 or 5 pharmaceutical products into an unhealthy system and assuming they will work out to the patient’s advantage, while there is no actual data on the real world consequences. Pseudoscience is allowing drug companies to conduct research and write the journal articles on their own products. Pseudoscience is believing you are right without testing your assumptions, and calling that science. The claims of this writer are nothing more than a conceit. He is defending a system that has been opposed to change (often brutally opposed to change) throughout its existence. And if you put the track record of harm done by Naturopathic doctors up against the harm done by conventional doctors, the evidence is clear which is the more harmful. The facts speak for themselves. If his concern is that someone will delay proper treatment because of bad information, the fact is that this happens in all medical systems. That’s why it’s called ‘practicing medicine.’ Nobody’s perfect. This author seeks to handily dismiss the failings of conventional medicine with a hint of regret, then wave them away while amplifying the shortcomings of a competing system of medicine in order to justify the conceit. I agree with him about this: Natural medicine is not always science based. But neither is conventional medicine. The writer of the op-ed is projecting the failings of the system he defends onto the system he seeks to undermine. I wouldn’t expect him to see that or be able to change his mind, because he clearly does not approach the issue as a scientist, though he claims to be championing science. Instead, he is blinded by his cognitive biases and blind spots, and has become the pot calling the kettle black. The real issue here isn’t science, which conventional medicine holds no special claim to, but instead, freedom of choice. Should people have the right to choose the kind of health care they want to receive? Or should that choice be made for them by a near monopoly pretending to be a benevolent big brother while feeding profits to a few at the expense of the many? In the USA, naturopathic medical schools are recognized and accredited by the Department of Education through the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education. The professionalism of naturopaths can no longer be denied or easily dismissed, so this is their best line of defense. In a time of doctor shortages and a bloated and inefficient disease care system that comes with extravagant cost while doing little to advance human health (unless you call keeping people alive and suffering for longer life spans ‘human health’), at a time when nature itself is increasingly under assault by private industry regardless of impact on human health, naturopathic doctors can be a valuable resource for citizens of Ontario. Please don’t let his misleading argument stand in the way of doing what is best for Ontario, who should have the right to choose a better way. Sorry for posting it twice in the same comment, I’m on vacation! 2nd half is edited and includes a link on the loss of credibility in scientific journal articles, thanks to the influence of the pharmaceutical industry. Hi Richard, Thanks for your comment – I’ve removed the duplication to make it more readable. Best, Jeremy Petch Thought it may be useful to look at the definition of ‘science’. Maybe we are collectively reflecting our own backgrounds, training and philosophical values in our various positions. The net result is confusion – particularly for those seeking solutions to very real health and wellness concerns. Defintiion: Science (from Latin scientia, meaning “knowledge”[1]) is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.[2][3] In an older and closely related meaning, “science” also refers to a body of knowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably applied. A practitioner of science is known as a scientist. Since classical antiquity, science as a type of knowledge has been closely linked to philosophy. In the early modern period the words “science” and “philosophy of nature” were sometimes used interchangeably.[4] By the 17th century, natural philosophy (which is today called “natural science”) was considered a separate branch of philosophy.[5] In modern usage, “science” most often refers to a way of pursuing knowledge, not only the knowledge itself. It is also often restricted to those branches of study that seek to explain the phenomena of the material universe.[6] In the 17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature such as Newton’s laws of motion. And over the course of the 19th century, the word “science” became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself, as a disciplined way to study the natural world, including physics, chemistry, geology and biology. It is in the 19th century also that the term scientist was created by the naturalist-theologian William Whewell to distinguish those who sought knowledge on nature from those who sought other types of knowledge.[7] However, “science” has also continued to be used in a broad sense to denote reliable and teachable knowledge about a topic, as reflected in modern terms like library science or computer science. This is also reflected in the names of some areas of academic study such as “social science” or “political science”. I wish to express my support for Timothy Caulfield’s December 16 article on the danger of naturopathy. Some of the expression intended to ridicule naturopathy in the piece are so over-the-top that they may reduce the credibility of the article for some readers, but I believe that such statements are justifiable. My late wife died of metastatic bone cancer eleven years ago, before she reached the age of 60. What follows is an account of our involvement with naturopathy. It was written a few months after her death, and revised today to remove names and improve clarity. Desperate to try anything that might postpone her death, we accepted the recommendation of a friend who had had decided to forego “conventional” treatment and put all her confidence in naturopathy. We continued conventional treatment, but tried naturopathy as well. At our first appointment, I brazenly asked the naturopath if I could be present during his diagnostic procedure. He agreed, and I witnessed him performing bizarre swirling motions over my wife’s body; I listened to his comments about auras and force fields, and the need to get her system into balance. He prescribed a course of dietary precautions and “remedies” (he did make the required statement that these are not approved as medicines), and spoke with great confidence about the value of his treatment for persons suffering from cancer. The cost of the remedies, which of course were not covered by our drug insurance, was usually well over $1000 at each visit. During later visits, he declared her system to be in “excellent balance,” and modified the remedies accordingly. Our confidence was not enhanced when my wife’s friend died, but we reminded ourselves that she had refused chemotherapy, and we wanted to believe that the naturopathic remedies could be complementing the conventional treatment, and were not likely doing any harm. Our GP recommended against naturopathy, but agreed that it probably wasn’t harmful. The worst moment during the course of the naturopathic “treatment” came when my wife strode out of one appointment with great energy in her eyes, thumbs up, declaring, “He says that my body is entirely free of cancer.” My face must have betrayed my horror, because I knew that it wasn’t true. Doubtless, the tactic was to support healing by offering optimistic reports (our GP used the same strategy, but made statements that were credible), but I found that declaration to be particularly cruel. In any case, we continued naturopathic treatment until the end of her life, at a total expense of more than $30,000. When we discussed the cost, I always said, “You’re worth it, and I’m willing to pay just for the hope that it may work.” Perhaps the treatment and the encouragement did help to extend her life somewhat. We will never know. I do know that I won’t be pursuing naturopathic treatment when my turn comes to face debilitating disease. I’m truly sorry to hear of the experience you and wife had in this case and for your loss. As someone who sees cancer patients daily, your post is deeply disturbing to me. So much of the experience you’ve had is highly questionable and perhaps most is the faith based claim made that your wife was cancer free without any recourse to diagnostic imaging. I can’t help but wonder if the naturopath in question was trained at one of the accredited colleges; I.e. the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine or Boucher Institute (a requirement for regulation in those provinces that do regulate the profession). If so, and there are regulations in your province for naturopathic medicine (see ) , then i think cause for complaint to the regulatory board is more than justified. If not, then it’s possible that you were not seeing a naturopathic doctor but someone with any possible level of education and no means of ensuring their qualifications. This situation for example is rampant in Quebec where there are no regulations and with all kinds of practitioners who have varying levels of education calling themselves naturopaths. I can’t but help to hope the situtation is the latter (i.e. case of being a non-ND) but if not, then i sincerely apologize on behalf of all NDs for your experience and hope you carry the situation forward more formally. I hope you dont find this disrespectful in any way, but to me this confirms the need for regulations and a process whereby the public can take action when mistreated. Dugald Seely, ND, MSc, FABNO Ottawa Integrative Cancer Centre Try this on for size Mr. Science: I agree the Cochrane Collaboration provides a very useful resource for synthesizing our collective knowledge on specific health issues. The Cochrane Library contains thousands of systematic reviews with the participation of over 13,000 consumers, policy makers, clinicians and researchers involved in the various review teams which undertake to rigorously and systematically evaluate the available evidence. (1) Most Cochrane review groups target specific clinical areas whereas some also review specific interventions intended to improve health care delivery and health care systems. It would be useful to bring some of the same discipline associated with the Cochrane Collaboration to some of the specific health and wellness issues and perspectives identified in this debate to help evaluate and synthesize the evidence and claims for consumers, policy makers, clinicians and researchers. (1) Grimshaw, J. M., Santesso, N., Cumpston, M., Mayhew, A. and McGowan, J. (2006), Knowledge for knowledge translation: The role of the Cochrane Collaboration. J. Contin. Educ. Health Prof., 26: 55–62. doi: 10.1002/chp.51 The properly prescribed, “evidence-based”, conventional medical care you speak so highly of in terms of safety relative to alternative medical practices accounts for approximately 1/6 of annual deaths in the United States each year. The last annual report I saw showed ZERO deaths from all forms of nutritional supplements consumed by the same US public in 2008, including vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and herbal medicines. You say this is not a turf war or fearful resistance by a medical community worried about its own popularity, but instead a question and concern about patient safety. How could ANY LOGICAL PERSON argue that conventional medicine is safer? The “war on cancer” by the conventional medical community is currently being lost as they utilize a litany of unproven, unsafe, barbaric treatment methods to treat a wholly misunderstood health condition. The conventional treatment of diabetes and heart disease is pathetic at best and only to be spoken of highly for the fact that it can slightly prolong the (typically drugged, side-effect riddled, miserable) lives of the patients who stick to conventional treatment only. You call such approaches “evidence-based”? Evidence of what? Ineffectiveness? Blind faith in a broken system? You call only for treatment that is research based? Have you read this? http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/27/business/la-fi-hiltzik-20131027 I can only conclude one thing from your article. You have not had a loved one faced with a chronic disease for which conventional medicine had no other answer save pills that mask symptoms as the condition itself continues to progress, and/or procedures that try to burn or cut out the problem area, leading to their own severe side effects and/or a resurfacing of the same problem somewhere else. Properly prescribed, thorough, responsible, naturopathic medical treatments could result in side effect-free cures in at least some of these types of diseases. Conventional medicine occasionally results in “cures” as well. The only difference is that the cures brought about via naturopathic medical care happen BECAUSE of the treatments prescribed, not IN SPITE of them. I am not an MD nor an ND, but I am a worried citizen when slanderous articles such as this are published. I can only hope that someone at CCNM OAND or CNDA (or any of the boards for that mater) stand up and puts you in your place sir. As a member of the faculty of law and self proclaimed scholar you must assume allegations and reference to a specific school will not go unnoticed. I mean, really, defamation suit anyone? I feel sorry for the schools you attended that have to call you ‘Alumni’. These doctors are working for the greater good, ‘alternative’ is simply to have the option. Western medicine absolutely has its place, in 2000 I had my appendix removed, and being the son in-law of pharmacists modern drugs also have their appropriate time of use. 2 years ago I had a persistent cough, I sought the advice of an MD, who qualified for a fraction of a moment prescribed a steroid that did absolutely nothing (but I’ve heard, science has proven steroids are phenomenal for the body). Enough about me, back to you. I propose that you have a healthy debate with a naturopath. I would also like to see YOUR research that has brought you to this conclusion. One more thing, how dare you bring an Alberta family into your misguided article. Again, draw your conclusion on facts. I read the article, and our law indicates innocent until proven guilty by a jury of her peers which has not happened, yet you are convicting. SHAME ON YOU. Beyond that there was no evidence that a naturopath was treating the child or family. With a few clicks of my mouse, I could produce thousands of articles of malpractice by “Science Doctors”. Naturopaths in my view, have been too patient, allowing bullies like you to speak freely, slander, criticize, and misguide those who do not question loudest speaker. This is probably the calm environments in which they live their lives, free of collusion. I have not met a Naturopath who works for the pay cheque, they work and spread their KNOWLEDGE for the good of their patients. Tim, I fear that your place in this world is a union rep and you missed your calling. I am not sure what strings you need to pull to have an unfounded article such as this published. Perhaps it was a slow week at the star? To inhabit a human body is science. I will go ahead and make the assumption the timing of your article is based on naturopaths across the country rising up for prescribing rights, excluding B.C. (they already have that right). And how dare they curb the kick backs of Pharma from the MD’s, because I am sure the ND’s will not be receiving them. In your article you mentioned that there are contraindications between Herbal and Pharma. Please, could you tell me what these are? Considering herbal plant based medications are natural, should a draw the conclusion that the phrama brand is bad for my health? Some of the smartest humans in the world once thought the world was flat! I was shocked to read in the Winnipeg Free Press this person’s rather dogmatic diatribe against naturopaths and their trade. I hold no brief for naturopaths, but a few fundamental questions have to be asked of this perso. Among them are: 1. What exactly are his qualifications to even comment on naturopaths? 2. Why are there no specifics offered, but only generalizations? 3. As he seems preoccupied with the word pseudoscience, does he hold the same narrow views abiut chiropractic, accupuncture, accupressure, healing touch and other oriental or homeopathic approaches? They all seem to work though none can be scientifically explained. Charles Phelan Winnipeg If I’ve understood correctly, Mr. Caulfield takes issue with allowing naturopathy to become self-regulated and for practitioners to have expanded rights because 1) this would put patients at risk, and 2) it would would displace the, supposedly, fundamental role of science in the Canadian health care system. I can’t speak to the risks of naturopathy; that’s beyond my area of expertise. I can certainly speak to the risks associated with end-of-life medical care in hospital. Through the course of doing so, I’d also like to challenge the dichotomy the author drew between a scientific worldview and a philosophical framework, implying that medicine and medical practitioners are somehow safe-housed from ideology, culture, and environment. From my vantage point, in sanctioning and regulating what is “appropriate” medical treatment, the state provides a basis upon which the physician and patient alike can be punished by law if that boundary is breached. What is often missed in this binary is how terminally ill patients can be punished irrespective of whether they actually breach the law. This punishment comes in the form of being held hostage by an illness, prognosis, and treatment that contravene a person’s core values. In other words, our bureaucratic structures and systems of regulation not only serve as a form of social control, they also define the parameters of human life (and by virtue of community values – i.e. what the dominant culture wants to preserve and what they want to legitimate and validate by “treating,” if not “curing.”) Presently, we bear witness to the state pedaling the idea that life-sustaining interventions and palliative care are morally obligatory and standard courses of treatment that express due care and respect for the value of human life and health in terminally ill patients. However well-meaning, experience and testimony show that these seemingly morally sound decisions and standard courses of treatment can actually serve as the foundation for continuing degradation, suffering, and indignity of those who stand to “benefit” from them. Finally, I’d also like to note that we’re living in a culture characterized by access to information, proactive patients, and thereby many lenses through which those who live in liberal-democratic nations look through when regarding their prognosis and treatment options. I suspect Mr. Caulfield’s Op-Ed would benefit from looking through another lens. “I am fully aware of the many deficiencies of conventional medicine, including the perverting influence of commercial forces and the lack of good evidence to support many common practices and therapies. ” === What are your sociopolitical assumptions and evaluations behind this statement? Do commercial forces (health provision or more indirect influences) affect conventional Canadian Health Care policy and provision decisions? How does that (often policy weighted) decision process play out in our real world? Try including education of professionals, politicians, and those students who are aiming for either keeping in mind what can change to enhance the evidence. How is “evidence based” defined differently in the political & policy realm as opposed to an academic health centre? —– “Also, many Canadians are obviously not satisfied with their interactions with conventional practitioners – which, it seems, are too brief, mechanical and impersonal. These issues need to be addressed. ” ==== So what is the scientific clinical evidence to back up this statement? What about the socio-political evidence? How do you propose to “address” this concept and move what we know about health and wellbeing in relation to the body of good scientific *medical* care and maybe *health* evidence, move it from what we know to what we **all** do, and how the doing can also stay accountably current and effective and in a single patient as well as their community? ——— “But the response to the problems of conventional medicine should not lead us to the embrace of pseudoscience. On the contrary, it should push us toward better, independent and rigorously executed health care research. It should push us toward a science-informed approach for all therapies and preventative strategies.” ===== Maybe this is an opportunity to scientifically evaluate changes in health and wellbeing (OECD, etc) in the two approaches and examine the ways conventional Health Care and the so-called complimentary medicine is taught, regulated and protected by each college and Provincial and federal legislation? A more integrated systems oriented evaluation so as to **synthesize evidence** on how to keep and get folks in an overall state of well-being and health according to **all** the the current and emerging evidence; socio-politically, medically, and systematically. Tim Caulfield brings up an important point, in that no medical profession should allow pseudoscience to creep into the practice. As a board certified MD, in internal medicine who has grown my practice into a science based integrative, Functional Medicine practice, I have worked with many MD’s who have NO clue of how to make a patient healthy, i.e. facilitate self-healing in the body by making dietary changes, lifestyle changes and using directed nutritional/nutriceutical supplement recommendations. In addition I have worked with very skilled ND’s who have helped many patients get healthy. Yes, there are always fringe ND’s who are way out there when it comes to belief systems and practices. Not that long ago, traditional medicine did not believe in “leaky gut” which is now being recognized by mainstream medicine or the concept of blood type affecting one’s health because of the science of glycobiology as it relates to the immune system. Peter D’Adamo, ND first proposed The idea of the Blood Type Diet years ago, and so many mainstream MD’s (including myself) looked askance at this concept as it did not fit into our preconceived mental paradigm. Today we now know that Dr. D’Adamo’s Blood Type DIet is based in hard science and it can help in a number of medical conditions. All too often I see Canadians crossing the border to seek medical help with me, because their Canadian doctors throw their collective hands up in the air because they don’t know what is going on and can’t help simply using ONLY a pharmacologic approach. I have successfully treated many patients using approaches that a traditionally trained doctor might look upon as “pseudoscience” medicine. As a doctor in the trenches taking care of sick people, I want as many tools in my black bag as possible to help people. This concept is not black magic, it is actually good medicine, so long as the doctor using these tools takes into account the risk/benefit ratio of the treatment(s), and knows when to use an elephant gun (toxic pharmacologic medicine) or use a feather (homeopathy, vitamins, etc) to help a sick patient regain health. The practice of medicine is both an art and a science. As for an “individual’s inherent self-healing mechanisms.” , this is not rhetoric, it is a very real phenomenon. Or as Voltaire said, “God heals the patient and the physician collects the fee” and “Doctors pour drugs of which they know little, to cure diseases of which they know less, into human beings of whom they know nothing” This is a wonderfully pithy critique of the pseudoscience of naturopathy, homeopathy and the like. Practitioners in these fields deceive themselves and their patients with factually unsupported therapies promoted with fallacious claims that their “natural” treatments are superior to conventional, presumably unnatural, approaches. Anything more than casual scrutiny of these claims should be enough to discredit them. I urge our goverments to stop pandering to those making these baseless claims. These approaches are not harmless. Let’s put patient safety ahead of politics. I am extremely critical of the practice of naturopathy, and entirely dismissive of the quackery of homeopathy. The main issue, however, is not that naturopaths work their sorcery on unsuspecting, foolish, or desperate patients. It is that naturopaths want to be granted the privilege of using allopathic, scientifically valid medicine without having adequate training to do so, which seems to be motivated by greed. In other words, naturopaths want to stop practicing naturopathy and start practicing the medicine they so deem themselves an alternative to, all in the name of the almighty dollar. Medical diagnosis and treatment is not easy, and can certainly cause a massive amount of harm if not used properly. Proper tutelage in its use takes anywhere from six to twelve years. Naturopathy school is not proper tutelage. Furthermore, the academic standards of naturopathy schools are far less stringent than that of medical school. Less talented, less motivated and less intelligent people can be admitted into naturopathy. To allow them to practice true medicine is a hazard to society! Speaking as a naturopathic doctor and someone who has been active in clinical research and in caring for patients over the past ten years, I emphatically disagree with the tone and content of this opinion piece delivered from Mr. Caulfield. Naturopathic Doctors (NDs) receive their training during an intensive full time four year post graduate program delivered in one of seven colleges accredited by a council recognized by the US federal government. The two Canadian Colleges, the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine (CCNM), and Boucher Institute of Naturopathic Medicine (BINM) are located in Toronto and Vancouver respectively. For anyone with serious questions about the naturopathic medical profession, I urge you to review the curriculum at one of these colleges to see the basis of training NDs have in order to be qualified and licensed to practice. This includes a series of cumulative examinations (knowledge based and practical) whose scope is equal to the medical licensing exams that our MD colleagues go through. Mr. Caulfield rightly points out that NDs can speak the language of science as it is applied through clinical research and in our understanding of physiology and pharmacy. However, he criticizes this as a ‘two hat fallacy’. The fundamental problem with Mr. Caulfield’s argument lies in the premise that there are only two options available, science and pseudo-science, right and wrong. What is missed is that in the practice of medicine, most often there is no single therapeutic solution available but rather a mix of approaches that can help and which differ depending on context and the history each person presents with. Indeed some of the fundamentals to good health: stress reduction, exercise, and nutrition provide the backbone of naturopathic practice. Rigorous clinical research on the system of naturopathic medicine is still limited, yet research to date does support the hypothesis that we provide added value to patients particularly with chronic conditions. A recent publication in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) attests to this. The study, using a randomized pragmatic clinical trial design found that care delivered by naturopathic doctors provided in addition to conventional care significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease and incidence of metabolic syndrome. The study is published and freely available for review. The concept that medicine can be classified as either science or pseudo-science is simplistic at best and completely misses the point of medical practice. Medicine is an art and a practice and where possible scientific principles are used to test the ability of therapies to have benefit and limit harm. While excellent at establishing causality for a tightly prescribed intervention there are serious limitations to the typical randomized controlled trial (RCT) when it comes to real practice and particularly when therapies are complex and individualized, based on treating the person and not a population as a whole. RCTs are most effective when used to test highly controllable medications, really a design suited most to the pharmaceutical industry. An exploration of the research available in the medical literature will quickly disillusion anyone to the fact that there is no evidence on which to base naturopathic practice. Mr. Caulfield referenced the website for the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine to support his claims, to look further and explore the research section of the website he would have come across a series of peer reviewed publications outlining some the work the department and college faculty have done. The idea that conventional Western medicine is the only true harbor for evidence based medicine and that all practices from this discipline are truly evidence based is simply not true and nor should it be. Well-applied evidence-based medicine judiciously includes available evidence with clinical experience. What NDs provide is an inclusive way of perceiving health and providing treatment that allows for individualized care for our patients while respecting informed consent, real choice, and an interaction that educates people on how to better care for themselves. I encourage an open, skeptical approach to medicine (conventional and complementary) without approaching the idea from a stark ‘with us or against us’ attitude that is too easily promoted. Negative rhetoric does little to explore the issue in any depth and making contrasts that relegate medicine to a mechanistic scientific approach versus a magical holistic approach serve little purpose beyond the inflammatory. Medicine and human health in whatever it’s form is rather difficult to fully quantify and options for care that are rational, safe and varied provide a more robust and versatile system that can only benefit the health of Canadians. The move by provincial governments to regulate the profession of naturopathic medicine increases public assurance that the care they receive from NDs is provided by someone with the training to recognize and deal with serious health conditions and to know when to refer effectively when something is beyond their scope. It is surprising and unfortunate to see the tragedy in Alberta used by Mr. Caulfield to support his argument and create fear when regulations and perhaps a more supportive environment for integration of care could perhaps reduce the likelihood for such a tragedy. I greatly respect the work that my MD colleagues do and am encouraged by an increasingly respectful and open attitude that GPs and specialists have when it comes to naturopathic medicine and the value NDs can provide in supporting people’s health. A stronger regulatory environment can only strengthen public safety and trust and ultimately a more effective collaboration between naturopathic and conventional doctors that is in such demand. The movement towards integrative medicine is one that is progressing and is truly a patient led phenomenon. This is perhaps best demonstrated in the field of integrative oncology which has brought together clinicians of all stripes that recognize the need for a more inclusive approach to care for people living with cancer. Demand for this level of care is growing and I hope we can use the energy of this debate to help the process work for the people we are trying to serve. Rather than raise walls and entrench biases, we need to work towards improving a health care system that is stumbling and moving rapidly towards unsustainability. The rise of naturopathic medicine is based on informed choice made by people every day. In fact, this offers an opportunity for engagement towards a more proactive approach to health care that is so desperately needed. Dugald Seely, ND, MSc, FABNO Director, Research & Clinical Epidemiology; Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine Executive Director; Ottawa Integrative Cancer Centre There are numerous examples of integrative programs/centres across N.A. . In the US, there are some very well known institutions like Dana Farber in Boston, Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York and MD Anderson in Texas which have integrative programs. Other even more integrated examples in the States include the Block Centre in Chicago and the Cancer Treatment Centers of America. In Canada, there are two principal places providing and researching integrative cancer care, these include InspireHealth in BC which now has funding from the BC government and the Ottawa Integrative Cancer Centre (OICC) in Ottawa where i work. Each of these integrative centres have their own unique model, however an underlying common thread is patient focused whole person care where a number of modalities and disciplines are used to help treat the whole person hopefully in a coordinated way. Within the field of integrative oncology, complementary medicine is recognized as adding real value to the patient’s experience and the ability to support health and quality of life. Examples of this include naturopathic medicine, nutrition, acupuncture, yoga therapy, exercise, massage therapy, physiotherapy, and counseling. Another major goal within an integrative cancer setting is to enhance communication between all health care practitioners involved in patient care, this includes both complementary and conventional so as to improve care overall and reduce patient’s anxiety and sense of being torn between two disparate types of medicine. Ideally integrative oncology brings what is best from complementary medicine to the table, eventually moving towards less of a division recognizing issues of safety with an emphasis of potential for negative therapeutic interactions and relevant contraindications. If you are interested in more information on the OICC, this can be best found on our website at . I recommend watching the video on the home page in particular. There is not much to add that has not been already said, however, this article reeks of bias to me. Bias against ways that have not had the time, money or support to be evidence-based. Tim’s major premise is that because they have not been proven, they are pseudo-science. We should not forget that evolution is only a theory, as it has not been proven…but widely accepted. I am a user of homepathic medicine. I have seen it work. I have used it as our first line of defense in my family since my daughter is born, for non-threatening illnesses. She has, what I consider, an incredibly strong immune system thanks to this. I can’t explain it, nor do I need to. I feel it works. But that doesn’t make it pseudo-science because we can’t explain it. It’s too bad that modern medicine feels threatened by other complementary and alternative medicines. Tim mentioned one death of homeopathy, but I think it would be much easier to find how many deaths were due to negligence and malpractice. Should we through modern medicine under the bus then? No. I believe there is a place for everyone at the table. This mentality of and/or is only polarizing the situation further, and is demeaning for all those other professions, who are treated with respect in many European countries. Remember…we are unable to explain all science either. Take a look at metaphysics as one example. We know it’s happening, but can’t explain why. Doesn’t make it less true. I’ll keep using alternative forms of therapy, knowing they aren’t reimbursed by the health system, not because I believe only in alternative therapies, but because they are a great complement to antibiotics, and other conventions of modern medicine that treat the manifestation of the problem and not the underlying symptoms. Police were called into the OICC last Thursday in Ottawa after the coroner attended to the death of a cancer patient who was treated with some i.v. therapy. It was reported by the Ottawa SUN on April 4th. I don’t think naturopaths should be considered health care providers. A few weeks ago the head of the College of Naturopathic Doctors of Alberta said that vaccines are a ‘grey area.’ The last thing we need are people who are considered health care providers sayings things like that, which are totally false. It is settled science: vaccines are safe and effective. Now, no drug is every 100% safe and effective, but in terms of a risk-benefit ratio, the risks of serious adverse events due to vaccination are around one in a million, while they potentially benefit everyone who gets a vaccine. The “theoretical” bases of naturopathy are ludicrous and DEMONSTRABLY false. For example, the idea that water has memory and can remember every molecule it has come in to contact with and thereby adopts the properties of every molecule it has contacted with is clearly false. If the “water-memory” hypothesis were correct, then every drop of water on earth would have the properties of any drug that ever existed, so long as at least one molecule of that drug came into contact with water (which is surely would). This is clearly absurd and demonstrably false. Also, since this hypothesis of naturopathy says that dilution increases the potency of the ‘water-memory’ effect, then even a drop of water should result in a fatal overdose of every drug ever produced. I think those who like naturopathy are largely ignorant of the hypothetical ideas that serve as the foundation of naturopathy. I think they also generally like the idea of an approach to health care which emphasizes avoiding drug use because of the mistaken belief that ‘natural is always better.’ re: “We should not forget that evolution is only a theory, as it has not been proven…but widely accepted.” This statement confuses a scientific hypothesis with a scientific theory. Theories will never become law, and laws were never theories to begin with. Theories are worded explanations of a fact, while laws are simple mathematical equations. So laws are not theories that has been proven. Since there’s no math in evolution, there will never be a law of evolution. Evolution has been proven. An obvious example is the evolution of bacterial resistance. I agree with Timothy completely on this one. While there are definitely a lot of problems with science-based medicine, it is still the best bet. The fact that these practitioners believe in homeopathy, raises a lot of concerns. For those who think naturopathic medicine is credible, they can go to Science-Based Medicine, Respectful Insolence by Dr. David Gorski, a.k.a., ORAC, and check out the science. Even people who profess to believe in CAM, will always without fail, go to a doctor educated in the Western-based medical system for treatment. While I have to take some pharmaceuticals for my hypertension, I always work on changing my diet, getting more exercise, and to distress. All of this comes from science-based medicine. I think it is high time to challenge this foolishness and call this for what it should be called–quackery!!!!!!!! The amount of misinformation and name calling in anything your write about Naturopathic Doctors upsets me. First of all Naturopathic Doctors or Naturopathic Physicians (Not “Naturopaths”) are already a registered, self governing health profession under the health professions act. I suggest that your cursory overview of what ND’s are about was not enough and you should do your homework. I am insulted that you suggest it is not possible to wear two different hats when sitting down with a patient, I do it all the time. For instance, I will first outline the evidence based treatments that have proven efficacy for a treatment (medications, exercise, lifestyle changes) and then I will also outline other treatment options that have limited evidence such as botanical remedies, certain types of diets, or perhaps certain physical therapies. I am very clear with patients as to what treatments have good evidence, which ones have refuting evidence, and which ones have no evidence. I also include the evidence in the risk benefit discussion so they can weight both the upside and downsides of these treatments when possible. I was taught that the practice of evidence based medicine takes into account scientific evidence as well as patient values; that’s what I do, and I think its what most of my colleagues do. The generalizations and assumptions you make about anyone that is not an MD are embarrassing, you should stop this behaviour. If you are an equal opportunity skeptic, why are not going after every physio, MD, or psychologist, out there for practicing acupuncture, homeopathy, EMDR, thought field therapy, and other weak evidenced therapies as well? If you were truly equal opportunity I suspect you might not have anyone that wants to sit at the bar with you at the end of the day…that’s assuming anyone does right now. I am fully aware that there are a lot of therapies out there that people are wasting their time and money on, and that these treatments are possibly causing harm. I also want these practices to stop, but I think a more inclusive and productive approach is needed if you want to move forward without alienating the very people that you are trying to help. Dr Ryan Oughtred Naturopathic Physician (Not Naturopath, not Homeopath) Naturopathic medicine is not pseudo-science. You can treat the symptoms of autism with naturopathic medicine, it’s called the DAN! protocol. I wouldn’t put the two in the same boat! Creep must always be a concern, but embedded is usually more dangerous. When the overwhelming majority of treatment for Americans, and I assume Canadians, has degraded to be little more than drugs, one has to wonder what kind of evidence medicine is being based on. If people want to pay for “pseudoscience” then let them…no one is holding a gun to their heads to pay out of pocket for it. In a socialized medicine state like Canada it’s the only alternative short of going south of the border. Me thinks you complain too much considering MD’s have a differential advantage at attracting patients over ND’s…they don’ have to charge the patient anything for the visit. Also, there are not enough MD’s to go around…took me 18 months to find one after my MD moved to the States. I know a good handful of ND’s who are extremely science based and would make most MD’s look like bumbling idiots. Medicine is an Art not a science. Naturopathy is neither. nature pathic care herbs vitamins have there place here they work just as often or beter then main line practice just because you don’t under stand yet doesn’t mean a thing remember when you people drained blood out of when we wre sick remember when you didn’t wash your hands when you operated remember thylidamide remember smoking cant hurt you curing is being replace by maintaining staying sick cant turn in to a industry Naturopathic Doctors and alternative medicine saved my life. I went from a healthy 120lbs to 89lbs and dying of an intestinal issue (couldn’t walk, hair falling out, skin covered in rashes, chronic diarrhoea, etc) and the conventional medical doctors and specialists were stumped. They were going to remove my colon and put me on medication that has nasty side effects. I said no….I had to try something different. And I’m so grateful that I listened to my intuition. I worked with a holistic nutritionist and homeopath who turned my health around within 2 weeks. I worked for 3 years with a naturopath, acupuncturist, and continued with a special diet (that the registered dietician was clueless about). My digestion, hormones, energy and overall health improved greatly with natural medicine. One more thing (and it’s gross)…..when I initially became ill and had chronic diarrhoea and cramping I had 12 stool tests and blood tests done by my GP and they came back “normal”. I told this to the homeopath who gave me homeopathic parasite remedies. I filled the toilet with worms every day for 10 days. Then all my cramping and diarrhoea stopped and I started feeling better. In my German community, who rely on homeopathy, I hear stories like this all the time, over the last 15 years. A lot of my neighbors are farmers and parasite infections are common. The O-T-C pin x remedy at the pharmacy doesn’t work. It doesn’t kill parasites it only paralyzes them and they often don’t get eliminated with a bowel movement. If you haven’t had a terrible illness and resorted to alternative medicine to find out that it actually works then you shouldn’t speak about it. I’ve met hundreds of people who have had similar experiences as mine. How do you think we survived for thousands of years? How do you think indigenous populations continue to survive. Herbs! If evidence based medicine is as profit driven and power hungry as a few of the commenters suggest, then why wouldn’t it simply take any and all alternative therapies and treatments and offer them in their own practice? I suggest mainstream medicine does take those practices that have convincing data to support their inclusion into publically funded medicine while leaving the remainder for incredulous ripoff artists. There are many researchers who make their careers on testing therapies that exist outside of mainstream medicine precisely because doctors are constantly seeking to offer more and better treatments to patients. I believe selling ineffective treatments and therapies (same or worse outcomes than placebo) to suffering and sometimes desperate people should be considered assault and fraud and dealt with under the law accordingly. Ignoring the harms of pseudoscience is a dangerous stance for society to take on an issue as important as the healthcare of our families and friends. Effective and evidence based alternative medicine is just called medicine. Reply to Unconvinced by jargon and finger pointing Timothy Caulfield is hiding behind a wall of obliviousness and a bombardment of idiocies. I shared them with colleagues. None of them accepted to dignify them with a single comment Forgive my frankness, butI respond to the aggressiveness of what i just read above: with all due respect a rather immature and limited view. Science is so limited and so arrogant, should not be the axis upon which our health rests, On top of that, the now corrupt and decaying moral of allopathy/big pharma are obviously skewing research, using armies of hospital lawyers to cover up lethal mistakes and so on. Hospitals are il places offering fast food, fluorescent lighting and course, abusive nursing staff, chasing around arrogant whimsical doctors’ orders. I ask, how often has this sort of thing happened to you?: …a doctor raced into your own hospital room, ignored the charts and said “so, are you ready for us to open up your left leg?”..”uh-it’s the right ;e.g.” – “oh yeas, err, at any rate….’ Personally the last time I had an operation, I was told I’d receive several rounds of calming drugs in a 45 minute period before the operation. I sat wile listening to a nurse dicuss her vacations for 35 minutes than came in to my area. I reminded her about the drugs thing she looked at her instructions and said OMG okay here take all these right away, then rushed me into the pre-op area…not an unusual situation. I think. This is the culture of medicine, in general. Meanwhile the general level of care at a TCM, Massage, Ayurveda, or Homeopathic clinic is ten times better, with actual healing-feeling environments, long appointments, an interest in the full story of the patient and an understanding of how all these parts fit together – from heart, with humility. A knowing that much of what happens with healing is not linearly quantifiable nor controllable by man. Vast and profound, sacred things are at work that require a balance of compassion and insight, methodology and intuition to address. Sometimes a person isn’t supposed to get better. Mostly they do get better by us getting out of the way, with gentle support – it isn’t us doing it. These are things that only personal humility and training by yielding to thousands of year old lineages (and some personal meditation/devotional work can begin to uncover. Naturopathy is similarly missing this, as allopathy is. But //naturopathy seems to have a fresher, broader brush to paint with. They could both learn from yoga, TCM , Ayurveda, and so on. “science” and “Medicine” are in toddler stages, wit the self-absorbed nature of a pouty teen ager. It’s a bit like why the governments and big business of the West have done to Africa and the East and what they have done to the native population in North America – ignore their wisdom, dehumanize them in our hearts, grab their resources, yank them from the hearings and safety they rely on, and force the West’s low-quality ways upun them, claiming it is infinitely better. Yoga has eight limbs of study and practice – the postures is only one of them. What it knows about breath, ethics, mind-body health and an individual’s relationship with the cosmos is a hugely deeper and massive amount of information than a jargon-laden tunnel vision medical degree. It;s like comparing a lovingly prepared and organic homegrown meal to a frozen TV Dinner. And, yoga understand that these principles cannot be purely cognitively argued/memorized/imitated. It requires practices that open up the intuition, the heart and the body, to work with the mind in “understanding” and applying healing. -a joint effort of assisting healer and client. Yoga also has simple trainings to open up to the natural healing that is surging through our bodies, in the west, interrupted by poisonous and misinformed interventions. So yoga is one example of something science has not much understanding of. Look to Taoism, Tibetan Medicine and all the others – there’s a diasporic canon of understanding that makes “science” and Western medicine look like a child, even if a bratty one! Have a little respect for 5,000 years of loving and intelligent development! Stop protecting your little turf and learn to (truly) breathe – learn to listen. Give up the monopoly and take a back seat. Mr Caulfield is not a medical doctor of any kind and has never participated in clinical trials of any kind so his opinion is just that, certainly not based in fact. I know this article is old, but it is still wrong. For people with chronic health conditions but with no identifiable pathology, or none that conventional medicine is willing to look into, naturopathic doctors have been a lifeline. My doctor gave me sleeping pills for insomnia. My naturopath advised me to quite drinking coffee. Guess which suggestion worked, was safer and had no side effects? Doctors are so quick to give pills that they barely even look at you. I think many more people die a year from conventional medicine since their methods are so much harsher. Just look at the opioid epidemic. By the way, if you check out this link you can see that research is being done between naturopathic community and conventional medicine. Hopefully this will help to heal this silly (and frankly sexist) divide. Questions? Pitches? Feedback?

ba72ad13-5ad8-40f4-a83c-4c3743c7fade,"The holistic model of health treats the whole person, focusing on the mind, body, emotions and spirit. According to this model of health, a person can achieve optimal health by having the proper balance in life. A holistic practitioner believes that all parts of the body are interdependent and if one is not working properly, then the rest do not work properly. Holistic doctors use all treatment options available, even modern medications. The goal of holistic health is not to treat the condition solely with medications, but to find out why it is happening. If a person goes to a holistic doctor with complaints of a headache, the doctor may prescribe a medicine to temporarily ease the pain. But a holistic doctor will then examine all other aspects of that person's life to see if they need to make some changes to keep the headaches from occurring in the first place, according to WebMD. Some changes a holistic doctor may recommend are changes to diet, sleep habits, exercise, stress and personal problems. Holistic medicine is based on the belief that unconditional love and support is the best medicine. Some forms of treatment that a holistic doctor may recommend are self-care, acupuncture, massage, psychotherapy, spiritual and relationship counselling, chiropractic care, homeopathy and western medications.

e64aa8a2-f5e5-4a3a-980a-eb2e3ec98c42,"WebMD describes the holistic perspective in medicine as an alternative approach to healing that takes into account the person as a whole as opposed to just one specific ailment. Practitioners of holistic medicine believe that a person's body, emotions, mind and spirit are all dependent upon one another and that the achievement of optimal health results from the achievement of the correct balance in life. WebMD states that in the holistic perspective, an imbalance in one part of a person affects the other parts of the person, causing a negative overall impact on the person's quality of life. Holistic doctors are not solely practitioners of alternative therapies. They may also employ conventional medication to address one of the imbalances that they identify. A holistic doctor may prescribe a drug to relieve the symptoms of a headache that a patient suffers from, but holistic doctors also tend to suggest changes in lifestyle and habits to prevent the headaches from becoming a chronic condition. According to WebMD, holistic doctors emphasize the humanity and personhood of the patient instead of the patient's disease or illness. Practitioners also focus on addressing medical conditions at the fundamental level of the cause of the ailment rather than on the symptoms alone.

What Is a Holistic Gynecologist—and Should You See One? Should your vagina have a preference? Here's the lowdown. By Arielle Franklin June 13, 2018 You've probably heard the buzzy wellness term ; it refers to an approach to health that takes the whole body into account, rather than looking into symptoms afflicting one body area only. Holistic MDs consider overall physical health, mental health, and lifestyle factors to diagnose illness—and they often use alternative therapies like herbal remedies to help a patient heal. So when we noticed what seems like an uptick in the number of holistic gynecologists, we were curious. Gynos by definition focus on conditions that affect the vagina, uterus, ovaries, and breasts, handling everything from infections to fertility to sex issues. But would it be better for your reproductive and sexual health to see a holistic ob-gyn rather than a conventional doctor? RELATED: 5 Things Your Gynecologist Is Really Thinking During Your Checkup To find out, spoke to Eden Fromberg, ACOOG, a holistic ob-gyn in New York City, to break down the term and discuss what a holistic gyno can do for you. According to Dr. Fromberg, one main difference has to do with treatment. A mainstream ob-gyn relies on ""pharmaceutical drugs, synthetic hormones, and surgical procedures to solve women’s health problems,"" she says. Holistic gynecology, in her opinion, chooses treatments such as botanical medicine, nutrition, and mindfulness. “I use techniques that are in concert with the body’s natural processes and rhythms,” says Dr. Fromberg. She takes into account trauma, illness, and injuries, among other factors, and tries ""to restore balance and connection instead of severing it or giving people drugs that make it hard to get back on track from,” she explains. Why do some women choose a holistic gynecologist? Patients often turn to a holistic approach when their needs haven’t been met by their conventional doctor, says Dr. Fromberg. Other people simply lead a holistic lifestyle in general and want to have a connection with their gynecologist, says Dr. Fromberg. “Patients also just want to be heard,” says Dr. Fromberg. “They know from the beginning that I will spend a lot of time with them,” she says. RELATED: 3 Ways Your Gynecologist Can Help Boost Your Sex Life Instead of the rushed, 10-minute window many doctors give to their patients, Dr. Fromberg says a holistic gynecologist will try to make each appointment as pleasant and comfortable as possible. She also dedicates an hour or two to each patient. “We’ll start by discussing everything to make you feel comfortable,” she says. “I don’t rush people through their exams—I give them the time that they need.” What is the most common reason women go to a holistic gyno? Fertility issues are the most common concern, says Dr. Fromberg. However, many of her patients come to her with chronic pelvic pain—which mainstream medicine often treats with antidepressants and painkillers, she explains. Instead of treating the pain only, a holistic gynecologist evaluates the patient’s lifestyle as a whole, addressing a variety of concerns like stress, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. All of these could be behind chronic pain, which is a serious problem that can also make it difficult to enjoy sex. Not exactly. ""In reality, some of my patients who come to me are already on two or three different medications,” says Dr. Fromberg. That said, a holistic gynecologist makes thoughtful decisions about what medications are necessary for the patient. “If somebody just needs regular prescriptions, I might not be the doctor for them,” she adds. RELATED: Like many holistic gynecologists, Dr. Fromberg strongly believes in the right of a patient to make her own reproductive choices and is against imposing her personal beliefs on her patients. Instead of telling her patients what choice to make, she informs them of side effects and risks. “So if they chose to take the pill, it’s done in the context of true, informed consent.” Unfortunately, most holistic gynecologists do no accept insurance, given the amount of time they lend to their patients, she says. To keep costs down many people will also keep contact with their mainstream doctor (who is likely covered by their health insurance policy) so they can make an appointment for a birth control refill or a Pap test. RELATED: Do holistic gynecologists have the same credentials? Just like a regular gyno, a holistic gynecologist must be certified by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Beyond that, they should also have board certification for integrative holistic medicine and ideally should have some other experience in osteopathy or naturopathic medicine. If you're thinking of going to one, Dr. Fromberg has some advice. “It’s important that they acknowledge the emotional, spiritual, and psychological component of women’s health,” she emphasizes. “Look for a holistic gynecologist that shows appreciation for that aspect.” About Us Subscribe Contact us Advertise Content Licensing Sitemap Other Meredith Sites Better Homes & Gardens Entertainment Weekly Rachael Ray Magazine Health.com is part of the Meredith Health Group. © Copyright 2021 Meredith Corporation.

A co-founder of the group, Emeritus Professor John Dwyer, of the University of NSW, who is also a government adviser on consumer health fraud, said it was distressing that 19 universities were now offering “degrees in pseudo science”. “It's deplorable, but we didn't realize how much concern there was out there for universities' reputations until we tapped into it,” Professor Dwyer said. “We're saying enough is enough. Taxpayers' money should not be wasted on funding [these courses] … nor should government health insurance rebates be wasted on this nonsense.” Professor Dwyer said it was particularly galling that such courses were growing in popularity while, at the same time, the federal government was looking at ways to get the Therapeutic Goods Administration to enforce tougher proof-of- criteria for complementary medicines, following the release of a highly critical review by the Australian National Audit Office last September. Of particular concern to the group is the increase in chiropractic courses, following the recent announcement of a new chiropractic science degree by Central Queensland University. German and British medical insurance providers are also in the process of removing alternative therapies from the list of treatments they will cover. Australia's vice-chancellors will meet in March and Professor Dwyer said his group was aiming to get a commitment from them to endorse health courses only with evidence-based science. The spokesman for Universities Australia said tertiary institutions were self-accrediting. “[They have] the autonomy … to ensure the quality and relevance of the courses they offer,” he said. The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, a government body set up to regulate higher education, refused to comment.

Does smoking increase risk of COVID-19 hospitalization? Higher BMI linked to increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection Could Vitamin D be an effective adjuvant to help mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic? Bioactive tea compounds show potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity Could the keto diet help prevent or mitigate severe COVID-19? Could Ivermectin be an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2? Compounds in traditional Chinese medicine herbs may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection Using medieval medicine to find new treatments for modern-day infections Evidence-based medical research is manipulated. Poor quality research does not make for good medical practice. Expert opinions of current research is only as good as the methodology and conclusions. Both of which are subject to human bias, error and lack of will to design studies which test CAM realistically. James Geiger MD I was diagnosed with very high blood pressure, so i went to my doctor and he put me on coversil blood pressure pills, the ones you have to take for the rest of your life( i'm 50 years old ). Not wanting to do this for life i came across EDTA an artery cleaner and 8 months later i have normal blood pressure and good circulation. It's all natural, so no more chemicals. Placebo effect is amazing. You proved that. Not one single time in history has 'woohoo' medicine been the reason for a cure. It is either your body doing its job or your wishful thinking that helped. Ask yourself why is so called ""Quackery"" becoming so popular. A shift in human consciousness to the awareness of a God whom has provided us with all the tools in nature at our disposal and the human beings to produce the natural remedies from them. Why did we think we could do better than God to produce artificial chemicals as our medicine which has done more damage to us and our environment.There is just as much quackery within the medical fraternity mis-diagnosing and prescribing medication which do more harm than good. Accept and learn from each other as each has its place in the care of humanity The only quackery going on here is coming from the big pharma-backed establishment, doing everything it can to protect its precious profits. These people are apparently the award-winning ""authorities"" on medicine, and yet they apparently don't have an understanding of some of the most elementary medical concepts, namely that vaccines are, by definition, used to stimulate an immune response to pathogenic diseases by introducing small parts of the pathogen into the body. Since cancer is not pathogenic (ie. not caused by bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms), and is characterized by an excessive production of otherwise normal cells, the whole idea of producing a ""vaccine for cancer"" is simply absurd. What are these lauded geniuses doing? Injecting cancerous cells into cancer patients to stop the cancer? Who are the real quacks in this story, I wonder. I agree James, research is manipulated and what comes to mind is profit, money and multi-national companies. Wow, what a step back this would be for an industy that is growing in Australia in its thousands. Alternative and complementary health has a place in the modern world, the results speak for themselves. There is room in the 'health' world for all options to be accessed by people, their choice, their health. First of all the type of treatments that people choose, and study is their god given right. Secondly I cannot help but think that this is coming from insurance companies and drug companies that pay these Doctors that are in the group for research. If the Doctor that is in this group invented the vaccine I am sure he is a millionaire from doing that work, and has made millions for the drug companies. When you look deeper, and go beyond what what is being written, you will see that it is all about money. There is not a lot of capitalist profit in alternative medicine. It is a fact that there is a financial connection with doctors that research, drug companies, and insurance companies. Lets be honest doctors, why else would you make a big deal of the small minority of professionals that teach, learn, and practice alternative health...that has worked for 5000 years. The reason is that the companies funding your vested interested have urged you to do so because alternative healthcare puts the onerous on lifestyle rather than drugs that profit companies. I suggest looking to your own practices before belittling and discrediting holistic medicines. It is because of doctors such as yourselves that people are misdiagnosed and that the symptom is treated instead of the cause. I suggest that you look at your patient as a whole as natural therapist do.  Also if you were at all good at research which obviosuly you are not due to the biased nature of almost all of your supposed 'evidence based practices' than you would know that natural therapies are efficient in the treatment of many ailments and they do not use drugs which attack the system of the patient. Antibiotics are extremely bad for the immune system yet you proceed to prescribe drugs without thinking of the implication for the patient. If you feel that natural therapist are 'quaks' and it's therapies are fake than i suggest you get your extremely arrogant, ignorant and over confident noses out from your very narrow minded books and prescription pads.   I do not understand the concept. If anything that the scientists are unable to prove by their hypothesis is considered miracle, superstitious etc. Alternative therapy has been in use even before modern medicine had ever been in existence. Why gulp in Metformin when a simple breathing exercise in yoga can help diabetes?? Why dependent too much on chemicals with lot of adverse events on trials and not to forget the money minded business men. when millions of people are getting benefit out of alternative therapy how come they demand such a ban for it?? Let's be real here people... the only reason these doctors are saying this is because they are losing money left and right... they want everyone to be healthy and eat right, don't they? Well we are starting to realize and use the natural medicine that wont do more harm than good. I don't care what you professional say. Id rather be putting and using natural herbs in my body than putting the toxins that can be come highly addictive and destroy many lives in my body and my family.. just because some of you are pissed that were finding ways to be healthier without artificial drugs, don't stop others from learning how use whats been growing since the beginning of time! Alternative medicine saved me from conventional medicine. It's really unfortunate to hear that science believes There is only one way to heal. The biggest problem most of these people who make these decisions Have not really gotten sick yet nor do they care to test out  these alternative therapies to see if they work. Well I have definitely experienced both sides, as a patient and I also worked in mediicine for twelve years. The huge problem I see in conventional medicine are Lots of mistakes. I have never encountered so much Miscommunication between doctors and nurses who Consistently make mistakes, at the expense of the patient. Just in the last two months my mother who was hospitalized had 3 severe allergic reactions, because of wrong drugs Being mixed. The sad thing is there are no repercussions On the doctors that made these mistakes unless the patient dies. As a patient myself, I had no other choice than to seek out Alternative medicine, as conventional medicine failed me. I had Lyme disease for twelve years and not one Specialist could diagnose my illness. I didn't get treated Until just two years ago. Fortunately, through word of mouth By another Lyme patient I found an infectious Disease doctor who treated Lyme and offered alternative Medicine. It was the combination of Chinese Medicine, acupuncture, and IV Rocephin that saved me. The right meds and strengthening the immune system Via Chinese medicine is what cured me of Lyme disease. The Chinese medicine was key in Helping the Overall weaknesses endured by the medication and dieff Reactions of the Lyme. Overall, I  can't imagine tossing alternative medicine out of the loop. If only These scientists need to wake up and smell the roses and not be so Closed minded as to believe that alternative medicine is not quackery. It's what Is needed to fill in the missing pieces to the puzzle and are crucial to completely Healing the human body of illness. Like it or not there are plenty of patients, including Physicians that can Confirm the benefits and great results of these therapies, especially when combined together. I understand why some doctors would want to end holistic medicine but after I understand why some doctors would want to end holistic medicine but after 6 months of being in pain and having doctors refuse to do surgery and want to keep me on narcotics until I am 40, I would welcome any alternative. Very common situations that drive people to seek something else; you're not old enough or bad enough to treat, and so frustrating. If you find an answer elsewhere, who are these doctors to take it away. I hope you did find an answer, by the way Interesting how the medical field goes straight for removing holistic therapies. why dont they seek reform? The holistic field is often under-regulated and some therapists give everyone a bad name. It would be better to ensure the practitioners out there are qualified and professional, than stamping out useful therapies altogether! They think its the mark of stupidity to trust natural therapies, while I think depending on antibiotics is reckless. I wont beat them over the head with my opinion, and they neednt beat me over the head with theirs. I was diagnosed with hashimoto back in 2011.  It is a disease where your antibodies destroy your thyroid for no good reason, and your thyroid gets noduals on it.  The docs said there is no cure, and wanted me to go on thyroid medicine for the rest of my life.  I researched alternative ways, and cut out gluten, dairy and soy out of my diet.  I also take anti inflammatory herbs for my condition.  Results - No thyroid medicine and my thyroid numbers are normal.  My antibodies have stopped attacking my thyroid and all my noduals are gone.  If I were to stick to the docs approach, they simply would have let my antibodies continue to destroy my thyroid until it was gone, and let meds keep my thyroid balanced forever.  There is nothing quacky about the natural approach.  In my opinion, there is MUCH MORE QUACK to what the doctors wanted to originally do with me.  It is high time Americans research and learn about their own health and conditions and take control over their own bodies.  Stop simply believing everything the medical field tells you, and use judgment. Carole Vick on End alternative medicine degrees say scientists The best possible medical treatment would be to draw from conventional and alternative medicine; emphasizing which ever provides the best results for the patient. Both fields of medicine have a tremendous amount to contribute; but neither approach should be discounted.

The fresh or dried herb in an unprocessed form. Measurements are expressed by weight. An aqueous preparation of hard and woody herbs, which are made soluble by simmering in almost boiling water for 30 minutes or more. If the active ingredients are volatile oils, it is important to cover the pan to prevent vaporization. The decoction is then strained while hot and either stored or consumed as needed. Volatile oils, usually mixtures of a variety of odoriferous organic compounds of plants. Concentrated form of natural products obtained by treating crude herb with solvent and then discarding the solvent to result in a fluid extract, solid extract, powdered extract, or tincture. Strength is expressed as the ratio of the concentration of the crude herb to the extract (e.g., 5:1 means five parts crude herb is concentrated in 1 part extract, and 1:2 means one part of extract is comparable to 0.5 parts herb). Concentrated tinctures with a strength of one part solvent to one part herb. A clean cloth is soaked in an herbal infusion or decoction and applied over injured or inflamed areas. The preferred method used for soft plant parts such as leaves, flowers, or green stems, an infusion is prepared just like making a tea.

The mixture is soaked for about 2 weeks. Then the herbs are strained out and the liquid is saved in a dark, well-stoppered bottle. Tinctures are much stronger volume-for-volume than infusions or decoctions. Strengths are typically 1:5 to 1:10. Made by steeping herbs in hot water (The same as an ).

Mind and body are simply two aspects of a whole individual. The mind is no less medically real and significant than the body. Each person is unique, and must be responded to as such. To be most effective, the treatment program must be individualized for each person. Each person is an integration of physical, psychological, intellectual, and spiritual aspects. All aspects are equally important. All must be addressed in the approach to health. Patients' healing abilities are strongly affected by their expectations and beliefs. The expectations, attitudes, beliefs, and words of practitioners strongly influence the expectations of their patients. Mainline medicine does not have a monopoly on the search for health. Patients need to be actively involved in their own healing and in the decision making concerning their treatments.

A form of hydrotherapy. Immerse the full body in a bath with 500 mL or 1 pint of infusion or decoction. The full-strength herbal infusion or decoction is used for foot or hand baths. Powdered herbs may be enclosed in gelatin capsules or pressed into a hard pill. The powder can also be rolled into a pill with bread or cream cheese. This is one of the most common ways herbs are supplied and used. A clean cloth is soaked in an herbal infusion or decoction and applied over injured or inflamed areas. Also called a fomentation. The fresh or dried herb in an unprocessed form. Measurements are expressed by weight. An aqueous preparation of hard and woody herbs, which are made soluble by simmering in almost boiling water for 30 minutes or more. If the active ingredients are volatile oils, it is important to cover the pan to prevent vaporization. The decoction is then strained while hot and either stored or consumed as needed. Volatile oils, usually mixtures of a variety of odoriferous organic compounds of plants. Concentrated form of natural products obtained by treating crude herb with solvent and then discarding the solvent to result in a fluid extract, solid extract, powdered extract, or tincture. Strength is expressed as the ratio of the concentration of the crude herb to the extract (e.g., 5:1 means five parts crude herb is concentrated in 1 part extract, and 1:2 means one part of extract is comparable to 0.5 parts herb). Concentrated tinctures with a strength of one part solvent to one part herb. A clean cloth is soaked in an herbal infusion or decoction and applied over injured or inflamed areas. The preferred method used for soft plant parts such as leaves, flowers, or green stems, an infusion is prepared just like making a tea. In the case of volatile oils or heat-sensitive ingredients, soaking in water or milk for 6 to 12 hours in a sealed earthenware pot makes a cold infusion. Usually a mixture of herbs and alcohol or vinegar to be applied topically over muscles and ligaments. Dissolvable tablet often used for upper respiratory and throat problems. It is made by combining a powdered herb with sugar and viscous jelly obtained from either an edible gum or mucilaginous plant. An herb or mixture of herbs in a semi-solid mixture such as petroleum jelly. This is applied externally for injuries or inflammation. If made with volatile oils, it can even be used as a respiratory anticatarrhal. Also known as a salve. A solid extract which has been dried to a powder. A raw or mashed herb applied directly to the body or wrapped in cheesecloth or other clean cloth. It is used either hot or cold for bruises, inflammation, spasm, and pain. An herb or mixture of herbs in a semi-solid mixture such as petroleum jelly. This is applied externally for injuries or inflammation. If made with volatile oils, it can even be used as a respiratory anticatarrhal. An alcohol-based preparation. Alcohol is a better solvent than water for many plant ingredients, so mixing herbs in alcohol such as vodka or wine with a specific water/alcohol ratio is a common method of extraction. The mixture is soaked for about 2 weeks. Then the herbs are strained out and the liquid is saved in a dark, well-stoppered bottle. Tinctures are much stronger volume-for-volume than infusions or decoctions. Strengths are typically 1:5 to 1:10. Made by steeping herbs in hot water (The same as an ). Place 1 tsp dried herb or 2 to 3 tsp fresh herb into 1 cup (250 mL) hot or boiling water. Steep for 5 to 15 minutes. For larger quantities, use 1 oz (30 g) of herb in 1 pint (500 mL) of hot water. Bruise or powder seeds before making an infusion or tea. The shelf life of these bioactive fluids is short, even in the refrigerator. Discard them after 8 to 12 hours.SOURCE: Sierpina, VS: Integrative Health Care: Complementary and Alternative Therapies for the Whole Person, F.A. Davis, Philadelphia, 2001. Mind and body are simply two aspects of a whole individual. The mind is no less medically real and significant than the body. Each person is unique, and must be responded to as such. To be most effective, the treatment program must be individualized for each person. Each person is an integration of physical, psychological, intellectual, and spiritual aspects. All aspects are equally important. All must be addressed in the approach to health. Patients' healing abilities are strongly affected by their expectations and beliefs. The expectations, attitudes, beliefs, and words of practitioners strongly influence the expectations of their patients. Mainline medicine does not have a monopoly on the search for health. Patients need to be actively involved in their own healing and in the decision making concerning their treatments.

Medicine concerned primarily with repair, such as microsurgery for limb reattachment. A health care delivery system in which the provision of services is controlled by the government. The branch of medicine concerned with the physiological and pathological problems encountered by humans who enter the area beyond the earth's atmosphere. It includes investigation of effects of zero gravity (weightlessness), sensory deprivation, motion sickness, enforced inactivity during lengthy travels in space, and the heat and decelerative forces encountered at the time of reentry into the earth's atmosphere. With prolonged flights into space, a number of medical problems have arisen, including anemia, loss of blood volume, loss of bone, and loss of muscle mass. These changes also make adjustment to gravity after returning to earth difficult. The branch of medicine concerned with the physiology, psychology, and pathology of athletes. Important aspects of sports medicine are the prevention of injuries; their diagnosis and treatment of injury, and the rehabilitation of the athlete. Emergency medical care that is provided during battlefield, terrorist, or police operations.

A form of hydrotherapy. Immerse the full body in a bath with 500 mL or 1 pint of infusion or decoction. The full-strength herbal infusion or decoction is used for foot or hand baths. Powdered herbs may be enclosed in gelatin capsules or pressed into a hard pill. The powder can also be rolled into a pill with bread or cream cheese. This is one of the most common ways herbs are supplied and used. A clean cloth is soaked in an herbal infusion or decoction and applied over injured or inflamed areas. Also called a fomentation. The fresh or dried herb in an unprocessed form. Measurements are expressed by weight. An aqueous preparation of hard and woody herbs, which are made soluble by simmering in almost boiling water for 30 minutes or more. If the active ingredients are volatile oils, it is important to cover the pan to prevent vaporization. The decoction is then strained while hot and either stored or consumed as needed. Volatile oils, usually mixtures of a variety of odoriferous organic compounds of plants. Concentrated form of natural products obtained by treating crude herb with solvent and then discarding the solvent to result in a fluid extract, solid extract, powdered extract, or tincture. Strength is expressed as the ratio of the concentration of the crude herb to the extract (e.g., 5:1 means five parts crude herb is concentrated in 1 part extract, and 1:2 means one part of extract is comparable to 0.5 parts herb). Concentrated tinctures with a strength of one part solvent to one part herb. A clean cloth is soaked in an herbal infusion or decoction and applied over injured or inflamed areas. The preferred method used for soft plant parts such as leaves, flowers, or green stems, an infusion is prepared just like making a tea. In the case of volatile oils or heat-sensitive ingredients, soaking in water or milk for 6 to 12 hours in a sealed earthenware pot makes a cold infusion.

An herb or mixture of herbs in a semi-solid mixture such as petroleum jelly. This is applied externally for injuries or inflammation. If made with volatile oils, it can even be used as a respiratory anticatarrhal. An alcohol-based preparation. Alcohol is a better solvent than water for many plant ingredients, so mixing herbs in alcohol such as vodka or wine with a specific water/alcohol ratio is a common method of extraction. The mixture is soaked for about 2 weeks. Then the herbs are strained out and the liquid is saved in a dark, well-stoppered bottle. Tinctures are much stronger volume-for-volume than infusions or decoctions. Strengths are typically 1:5 to 1:10. Made by steeping herbs in hot water (The same as an ). Place 1 tsp dried herb or 2 to 3 tsp fresh herb into 1 cup (250 mL) hot or boiling water. Steep for 5 to 15 minutes. For larger quantities, use 1 oz (30 g) of herb in 1 pint (500 mL) of hot water. Bruise or powder seeds before making an infusion or tea. The shelf life of these bioactive fluids is short, even in the refrigerator. Discard them after 8 to 12 hours.SOURCE: Sierpina, VS: Integrative Health Care: Complementary and Alternative Therapies for the Whole Person, F.A. Davis, Philadelphia, 2001. Mind and body are simply two aspects of a whole individual. The mind is no less medically real and significant than the body. Each person is unique, and must be responded to as such. To be most effective, the treatment program must be individualized for each person. Each person is an integration of physical, psychological, intellectual, and spiritual aspects. All aspects are equally important. All must be addressed in the approach to health. Patients' healing abilities are strongly affected by their expectations and beliefs. The expectations, attitudes, beliefs, and words of practitioners strongly influence the expectations of their patients. Mainline medicine does not have a monopoly on the search for health. Patients need to be actively involved in their own healing and in the decision making concerning their treatments.

A form of hydrotherapy. Immerse the full body in a bath with 500 mL or 1 pint of infusion or decoction. The full-strength herbal infusion or decoction is used for foot or hand baths. Powdered herbs may be enclosed in gelatin capsules or pressed into a hard pill. The powder can also be rolled into a pill with bread or cream cheese. This is one of the most common ways herbs are supplied and used. A clean cloth is soaked in an herbal infusion or decoction and applied over injured or inflamed areas. Also called a fomentation. The fresh or dried herb in an unprocessed form. Measurements are expressed by weight. An aqueous preparation of hard and woody herbs, which are made soluble by simmering in almost boiling water for 30 minutes or more. If the active ingredients are volatile oils, it is important to cover the pan to prevent vaporization. The decoction is then strained while hot and either stored or consumed as needed. Volatile oils, usually mixtures of a variety of odoriferous organic compounds of plants. Concentrated form of natural products obtained by treating crude herb with solvent and then discarding the solvent to result in a fluid extract, solid extract, powdered extract, or tincture. Strength is expressed as the of the concentration of the crude herb to the extract (e.g., 5:1 means five parts crude herb is concentrated in 1 part extract, and 1:2 means one part of extract is comparable to 0.5 parts herb). Concentrated tinctures with a strength of one part solvent to one part herb. A clean cloth is soaked in an herbal infusion or decoction and applied over injured or inflamed areas. The preferred method used for soft plant parts such as leaves, flowers, or green stems, an infusion is prepared just like making a tea. In the case of volatile oils or heat-sensitive ingredients, soaking in water or milk for 6 to 12 hours in a sealed earthenware pot makes a cold infusion. Usually a mixture of herbs and alcohol or vinegar to be applied topically over muscles and ligaments. Dissolvable tablet often used for upper respiratory and throat problems. It is made by combining a powdered herb with sugar and viscous jelly obtained from either an edible gum or mucilaginous plant. An herb or mixture of herbs in a semi-solid mixture such as petroleum jelly. This is applied externally for injuries or inflammation. If made with volatile oils, it can even be used as a respiratory anticatarrhal. Also known as a salve. A solid extract which has been dried to a powder. A raw or mashed herb applied directly to the body or wrapped in cheesecloth or other clean cloth. It is used either hot or cold for bruises, inflammation, spasm, and pain. An herb or mixture of herbs in a semi-solid mixture such as petroleum jelly. This is applied externally for injuries or inflammation. If made with volatile oils, it can even be used as a respiratory anticatarrhal. An alcohol-based preparation. Alcohol is a better solvent than water for many plant ingredients, so mixing herbs in alcohol such as vodka or wine with a specific water/alcohol is a common method of extraction. The mixture is soaked for about 2 weeks. Then the herbs are strained out and the liquid is saved in a dark, well-stoppered bottle. Tinctures are much stronger volume-for-volume than infusions or decoctions. Strengths are typically 1:5 to 1:10. Made by steeping herbs in hot water (The same as an ). Place 1 tsp dried herb or 2 to 3 tsp fresh herb into 1 cup (250 mL) hot or boiling water. Steep for 5 to 15 minutes. For larger quantities, use 1 oz (30 g) of herb in 1 pint (500 mL) of hot water. Bruise or powder seeds before making an infusion or tea. The shelf life of these bioactive fluids is short, even in the refrigerator. Discard them after 8 to 12 hours.SOURCE: Sierpina, VS: Integrative Health Care: Complementary and Alternative Therapies for the Whole Person, F.A. Davis, Philadelphia, 2001. Mind and body are simply two aspects of a whole individual. The mind is no less medically real and significant than the body. Each person is unique, and must be responded to as such. To be most effective, the treatment program must be individualized for each person. Each person is an integration of physical, psychological, intellectual, and spiritual aspects. All aspects are equally important. All must be addressed in the approach to health. Patients' healing abilities are strongly affected by their expectations and beliefs. The expectations, attitudes, beliefs, and words of practitioners strongly influence the expectations of their patients. Mainline medicine does not have a monopoly on the search for health. Patients need to be actively involved in their own healing and in the decision making concerning their treatments.

Usually a mixture of herbs and alcohol or vinegar to be applied topically over muscles and ligaments. Dissolvable tablet often used for upper respiratory and throat problems. It is made by combining a powdered herb with sugar and viscous jelly obtained from either an edible gum or mucilaginous plant. An herb or mixture of herbs in a semi-solid mixture such as petroleum jelly. This is applied externally for injuries or inflammation. If made with volatile oils, it can even be used as a respiratory anticatarrhal. Also known as a salve. A solid extract which has been dried to a powder. A raw or mashed herb applied directly to the body or wrapped in cheesecloth or other clean cloth. It is used either hot or cold for bruises, inflammation, spasm, and pain. An herb or mixture of herbs in a semi-solid mixture such as petroleum jelly. This is applied externally for injuries or inflammation. If made with volatile oils, it can even be used as a respiratory anticatarrhal. An alcohol-based preparation. Alcohol is a better solvent than water for many plant ingredients, so mixing herbs in alcohol such as vodka or wine with a specific water/alcohol ratio is a common method of extraction. The mixture is soaked for about 2 weeks. Then the herbs are strained out and the liquid is saved in a dark, well-stoppered bottle. Tinctures are much stronger volume-for-volume than infusions or decoctions. Strengths are typically 1:5 to 1:10. Made by steeping herbs in hot water (The same as an ). Place 1 tsp dried herb or 2 to 3 tsp fresh herb into 1 cup (250 mL) hot or boiling water. Steep for 5 to 15 minutes. For larger quantities, use 1 oz (30 g) of herb in 1 pint (500 mL) of hot water. Bruise or powder seeds before making an infusion or tea. The shelf life of these bioactive fluids is short, even in the refrigerator. Discard them after 8 to 12 hours.SOURCE: Sierpina, VS: Integrative Health Care: Complementary and Alternative Therapies for the Whole Person, F.A. Davis, Philadelphia, 2001. Mind and body are simply two aspects of a whole individual. The mind is no less medically real and significant than the body. Each person is unique, and must be responded to as such. To be most effective, the treatment program must be individualized for each person. Each person is an integration of physical, psychological, intellectual, and spiritual aspects. All aspects are equally important. All must be addressed in the approach to health. Patients' healing abilities are strongly affected by their expectations and beliefs. The expectations, attitudes, beliefs, and words of practitioners strongly influence the expectations of their patients. Mainline medicine does not have a monopoly on the search for health. Patients need to be actively involved in their own healing and in the decision making concerning their treatments.

Strength is expressed as the ratio of the concentration of the crude herb to the extract (e.g., 5:1 means five parts crude herb is concentrated in 1 part extract, and 1:2 means one part of extract is comparable to 0.5 parts herb). Concentrated tinctures with a strength of one part solvent to one part herb. A clean cloth is soaked in an herbal infusion or decoction and applied over injured or inflamed areas. The preferred method used for soft plant parts such as leaves, flowers, or green stems, an infusion is prepared just like making a tea. In the case of volatile oils or heat-sensitive ingredients, soaking in water or milk for 6 to 12 hours in a sealed earthenware pot makes a cold infusion. Usually a mixture of herbs and alcohol or vinegar to be applied topically over muscles and ligaments. Dissolvable tablet often used for upper respiratory and throat problems. It is made by combining a powdered herb with sugar and viscous jelly obtained from either an edible gum or mucilaginous plant. An herb or mixture of herbs in a semi-solid mixture such as petroleum jelly. This is applied externally for injuries or inflammation. If made with volatile oils, it can even be used as a respiratory anticatarrhal. Also known as a salve. A solid extract which has been dried to a powder. A raw or mashed herb applied directly to the body or wrapped in cheesecloth or other clean cloth. It is used either hot or cold for bruises, inflammation, spasm, and pain. An herb or mixture of herbs in a semi-solid mixture such as petroleum jelly. This is applied externally for injuries or inflammation. If made with volatile oils, it can even be used as a respiratory anticatarrhal. An alcohol-based preparation. Alcohol is a better solvent than water for many plant ingredients, so mixing herbs in alcohol such as vodka or wine with a specific water/alcohol ratio is a common method of extraction. The mixture is soaked for about 2 weeks. Then the herbs are strained out and the liquid is saved in a dark, well-stoppered bottle. Tinctures are much stronger volume-for-volume than infusions or decoctions. Strengths are typically 1:5 to 1:10. Made by steeping herbs in hot water (The same as an ). Place 1 tsp dried herb or 2 to 3 tsp fresh herb into 1 cup (250 mL) hot or boiling water. Steep for 5 to 15 minutes. For larger quantities, use 1 oz (30 g) of herb in 1 pint (500 mL) of hot water. Bruise or powder seeds before making an infusion or tea. The shelf life of these bioactive fluids is short, even in the refrigerator. Discard them after 8 to 12 hours.SOURCE: Sierpina, VS: Integrative Health Care: Complementary and Alternative Therapies for the Whole Person, F.A. Davis, Philadelphia, 2001. Mind and body are simply two aspects of a whole individual. The mind is no less medically real and significant than the body. Each person is unique, and must be responded to as such. To be most effective, the treatment program must be individualized for each person. Each person is an integration of physical, psychological, intellectual, and spiritual aspects. All aspects are equally important. All must be addressed in the approach to health. Patients' healing abilities are strongly affected by their expectations and beliefs. The expectations, attitudes, beliefs, and words of practitioners strongly influence the expectations of their patients. Mainline medicine does not have a monopoly on the search for health. Patients need to be actively involved in their own healing and in the decision making concerning their treatments.

A form of hydrotherapy. Immerse the full body in a bath with 500 mL or 1 pint of infusion or decoction. The full-strength herbal infusion or decoction is used for foot or hand baths. Powdered herbs may be enclosed in gelatin capsules or pressed into a hard pill. The powder can also be rolled into a pill with bread or cream cheese. This is one of the most common ways herbs are supplied and used. A clean cloth is soaked in an herbal infusion or decoction and applied over injured or inflamed areas. Also called a fomentation. The fresh or dried herb in an unprocessed form. Measurements are expressed by weight. An aqueous preparation of hard and woody herbs, which are made soluble by simmering in almost boiling water for 30 minutes or more. If the active ingredients are volatile oils, it is important to cover the pan to prevent vaporization. The decoction is then strained while hot and either stored or consumed as needed. Volatile oils, usually mixtures of a variety of odoriferous organic compounds of plants. Concentrated form of natural products obtained by treating crude herb with solvent and then discarding the solvent to result in a fluid extract, solid extract, powdered extract, or tincture. Strength is expressed as the ratio of the concentration of the crude herb to the extract (e.g., 5:1 means five parts crude herb is concentrated in 1 part extract, and 1:2 means one part of extract is comparable to 0.5 parts herb). Concentrated tinctures with a strength of one part solvent to one part herb. A clean cloth is soaked in an herbal infusion or decoction and applied over injured or inflamed areas. The preferred method used for soft plant parts such as leaves, flowers, or green stems, an infusion is prepared just like making a tea.

An herb or mixture of herbs in a semi-solid mixture such as petroleum jelly. This is applied externally for injuries or inflammation. If made with volatile oils, it can even be used as a respiratory anticatarrhal. An alcohol-based preparation. Alcohol is a better solvent than water for many plant ingredients, so mixing herbs in alcohol such as vodka or wine with a specific water/alcohol ratio is a common method of extraction. The mixture is soaked for about 2 weeks. Then the herbs are strained out and the liquid is saved in a dark, well-stoppered bottle. Tinctures are much stronger volume-for-volume than infusions or decoctions. Strengths are typically 1:5 to 1:10. Made by steeping herbs in hot water (The same as an ).

Discard them after 8 to 12 hours.SOURCE: Sierpina, VS: Integrative Health Care: Complementary and Alternative Therapies for the Whole Person, F.A. Davis, Philadelphia, 2001. Mind and body are simply two aspects of a whole individual. The mind is no less medically real and significant than the body. Each person is unique, and must be responded to as such. To be most effective, the treatment program must be individualized for each person. Each person is an integration of physical, psychological, intellectual, and spiritual aspects. All aspects are equally important. All must be addressed in the approach to health. Patients' healing abilities are strongly affected by their expectations and beliefs. The expectations, attitudes, beliefs, and words of practitioners strongly influence the expectations of their patients. Mainline medicine does not have a monopoly on the search for health. Patients need to be actively involved in their own healing and in the decision making concerning their treatments.

A form of hydrotherapy. Immerse the full body in a bath with 500 mL or 1 pint of infusion or decoction. The full-strength herbal infusion or decoction is used for foot or hand baths. Powdered herbs may be enclosed in gelatin capsules or pressed into a hard pill. The powder can also be rolled into a pill with bread or cream cheese. This is one of the most common ways herbs are supplied and used. A clean cloth is soaked in an herbal infusion or decoction and applied over injured or inflamed areas. Also called a fomentation. The fresh or dried herb in an unprocessed form. Measurements are expressed by weight. An aqueous preparation of hard and woody herbs, which are made soluble by simmering in almost boiling water for 30 minutes or more. If the active ingredients are volatile oils, it is important to cover the pan to prevent vaporization. The decoction is then strained while hot and either stored or consumed as needed. Volatile oils, usually mixtures of a variety of odoriferous organic compounds of plants. Concentrated form of natural products obtained by treating crude herb with solvent and then discarding the solvent to result in a fluid extract, solid extract, powdered extract, or tincture. Strength is expressed as the ratio of the concentration of the crude herb to the extract (e.g., 5:1 means five parts crude herb is concentrated in 1 part extract, and 1:2 means one part of extract is comparable to 0.5 parts herb). Concentrated tinctures with a strength of one part solvent to one part herb. A clean cloth is soaked in an herbal infusion or decoction and applied over injured or inflamed areas. The preferred method used for soft plant parts such as leaves, flowers, or green stems, an infusion is prepared just like making a tea. In the case of volatile oils or heat-sensitive ingredients, soaking in water or milk for 6 to 12 hours in a sealed earthenware pot makes a cold infusion. Usually a mixture of herbs and alcohol or vinegar to be applied topically over muscles and ligaments. Dissolvable tablet often used for upper respiratory and throat problems. It is made by combining a powdered herb with sugar and viscous jelly obtained from either an edible gum or mucilaginous plant.

If made with volatile oils, it can even be used as a respiratory anticatarrhal. Also known as a salve. A solid extract which has been dried to a powder. A raw or mashed herb applied directly to the body or wrapped in cheesecloth or other clean cloth. It is used either hot or cold for bruises, inflammation, spasm, and pain. An herb or mixture of herbs in a semi-solid mixture such as petroleum jelly. This is applied externally for injuries or inflammation. If made with volatile oils, it can even be used as a respiratory anticatarrhal. An alcohol-based preparation. Alcohol is a better solvent than water for many plant ingredients, so mixing herbs in alcohol such as vodka or wine with a specific water/alcohol ratio is a common method of extraction. The mixture is soaked for about 2 weeks. Then the herbs are strained out and the liquid is saved in a dark, well-stoppered bottle. Tinctures are much stronger volume-for-volume than infusions or decoctions. Strengths are typically 1:5 to 1:10. Made by steeping herbs in hot water (The same as an ). Place 1 tsp dried herb or 2 to 3 tsp fresh herb into 1 cup (250 mL) hot or boiling water. Steep for 5 to 15 minutes. For larger quantities, use 1 oz (30 g) of herb in 1 pint (500 mL) of hot water. Bruise or powder seeds before making an infusion or tea. The shelf life of these bioactive fluids is short, even in the refrigerator. Discard them after 8 to 12 hours.SOURCE: Sierpina, VS: Integrative Health Care: Complementary and Alternative Therapies for the Whole Person, F.A. Davis, Philadelphia, 2001. Mind and body are simply two aspects of a whole individual. The mind is no less medically real and significant than the body. Each person is unique, and must be responded to as such. To be most effective, the treatment program must be individualized for each person. Each person is an integration of physical, psychological, intellectual, and spiritual aspects. All aspects are equally important. All must be addressed in the approach to health. Patients' healing abilities are strongly affected by their expectations and beliefs. The expectations, attitudes, beliefs, and words of practitioners strongly influence the expectations of their patients. Mainline medicine does not have a monopoly on the search for health. Patients need to be actively involved in their own healing and in the decision making concerning their treatments.

58f35ef3-64d0-4ed8-9d7a-85298b4517d1,"?     Not a member? › › › Hi online family... I hope each and everyone of you are safe, happy, and feeling good today! ; ) Also, I had some questions regarding ""holistic medicine/doctors"" and ""juicing so... (and I am asking all of these questions for my mom recent post titles: ""My Family Letter -is my mom dying everyone?"") - would you consider the ""holistic"" approach another alternative if nothing else has worked? - is this considered ""another opinion""? - does insurance cover this type of medicine? - how does someone with hardly any money coming in approach a medicine like this? - can anyone refer me to a dr. like this in WI? - is juicing something we should also try? OKAY... I am officially of my question/answer soapbox (sorry!) ha! ha! But any information any one of you can provide for me on this would be just awesome! - would you consider the ""holistic"" approach-yes there are many benefits to this approach. some on this board are all natural and I am sure you will hear from them. I do a combination of juicing, food and vits and minerals. also I limit the drugs in me. I still am testing the kill the beast with wine theory from time to time. - is this considered ""another opinion""? Alternative medicine I have found is not considered as a 2nd opinion in the medical community. my experience is no. I spent mucho $ in Mexioc doing alternative therapy. I am currently waiting to see what insurance will pay if any. so far it has been 4 months of waiting and harrassing them to get in gear. - how does someone with hardly any money coming in approach a medicine like this? Honey it is hard. I spend over 100.00/month just on natural meds. plus organic food is quite expensive. look for co-ops in your area. sometimes you can share in the cost and pay with part of your tme. - can anyone refer me to a dr. like this in WI? - is juicing something we should also try? YES YES YES. firm believer in Juicing here. Good Luck. ps i travel to Beloit often to see family, It sound like your from that area - Madison Limey I think $ioo.oo/month is great! My costs were much higher when I was trying the naturopathic approach. Mary I'm a believer in trying whatever you can, within reason and not the hocus pocus stuff. However, if you are referring the the post about the dying mother letter....my feeling is this: When you have active cancer in stage 4, no amount of juicing or alternative stuff will probably work. The juicing and nutrition method is a good healthy way to get your body and immune system in shape to ""help"" ward off cancer in the future. Once the cancer is set in your body, then you should bring out the BIG GUNS with medical technology. Several folks here have had the initial surgery to remove cancer and then proceeded to protect their bodies with nutritional power that helps their immune system fight cancer cells from forming. Starting the nutritional path and juicing after the fact with no previous chemotherapy is like closing the barn door after the horses have already escaped. I am all in favor of juicing (I have a great juicer) and eating organic fruits, veggies, and other food products. I shop at Whole Foods market and try to eat wisely, but it is not a cancer cure. It is a body helper to maintain a healthy body. Hence, it is a personal choice and insurance will probably not support buying your juicer, organics and herbs and potions. Now, before I get knocked down and barraged with emails and testimonials about the virtues and healing power of nature, I want to reiterate my SUPPORT of juicing, vitamins, healthy eating, less beef, lots of fish and many many veggies and fruits and exercise. I am an advocate of carrot juice shots....but for someone in stage 4 with tumors to the liver, lungs, bones or whatever else - bonifide medical help is necessary. Some folks here have been very lucky to have had surgery only and be completely cancer free, others have taken the holistic approach only to find at stage 4 it is not enough alone. I wholeheartedly agree, extremely well said Kerry. I'm not opposed to the natural methods at all either, but I believe as you do that if it's advanced cancer, medicinal treatment is generally necessary. That is my own personal opinion of course and everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I respect others right to dissent. Everyone has to do what they feel to be the best for themselves. Unfortunately, I don't believe most insurance companies pay for holistic treatments. Kerry really makes a fine statement here. It's not that natural etc methods are bad. But there is a difference between preventing the development of metastatic disease and actually treating metastatic disease. Once you are Stage IV, I think good nutrition, vitamins, juicing etc, etc all still matters, but that can't be a substitute for more standard treatments. As Kerry says, the big guns are needed (and these big guns are usually chemo)! Lisa P - please forgive me - I know you have had wonderful success with alternatives, but I also know that you are the first (I think - don't let me put words in your mouth) to say that your 8 cycles of chemo were the ""kick start"" to your successful outcome.) I would not rely as Stage IV on ""alternative / complementary med"" only, even though I would not at all discount the benefits of that. Of course you can try these things, juicing etc. If you do not have the money, maybe you can find a used juicer at the Salvation Army. Some juicers are superior to others, but of course any juicer is better than none. If at all possible you should use fruits and veggies that are organic, and/or grown at home. If nothing else, having your own garden plot can help save money too. I don't think that it is ever too late to take charge of your health. There will always be some benefit. If at all possible try finding a N.D. (naturopathic physician) who deals with cancer patients in your area. They can help you to get started on a plan for taking supplements that will not interfere with other standard treatments. Explain to them your financial situation. It is usually not too expensive at least for just a couple of visits to get you all pointed in the right direction. You can also find a wealth of information at your local bookstore as well about beating cancer with nutrition. Best wishes, Susan There is a great book that has been mentioned many times on this site called ""Beating Cancer With Nutrition."" I didn't buy the book, but my husband found it at a local library. I read the whole book in a couple of days. The author talks about nutrition, vitamins and supplements that are used to boost the immune system. I would highly recommend this book. Also, I have a list of things that my dad's naturopath told him to do and supplements that she recommended. If you'd like me to e-mail it to you, please let me know. some very good posts. I read the book how to prevent and treat cancer with natural medicine. very informative book, not only do the recommend natural medicine but they also recommend conventional medicine. good luck and god bless.

cd20e122-1b89-48ba-8d78-a925eb3b5db9,"Evaluation of a Web-Based Holistic Stress Reduction Pilot Program Among Nurse-Midwives Purpose: Work-related stress among midwives results in secondary traumatic stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, and job attrition. The purpose of this pilot project was to evaluate the effectiveness of a holistic, web-based program using holistic modalities for stress reduction and improved coping among certified nurse-midwives. Design and Method: A convenience sample of 10 midwives participated in a web-based holistic stress reduction intervention using yoga, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and meditation for four days each week over 4 weeks. Participants completed pre- and postintervention questionnaires (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS] and the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale [CSES]) for evaluation of effectiveness. Findings: The PSS means showed improvement in midwives’ stress (16.4-12.3). The CSES means showed improvement in coping (174.8-214.5). Improvement was shown in each subscale of the CSES (“uses problem-focused coping”: 19.2%; “stops unpleasant thoughts and emotions”: 20.3%; and “gets support from family and friends”: 16.6%). Conclusion: Findings suggest the potential for stress reduction and improved coping skills after using holistic techniques in a web-based format within a cohort of nurse-midwives. Further research of web-based, holistic intervention for stress reduction among midwives is warranted.

Mmonu, Sara Berdy, Kim Barnas, Jens Krombach, Benjamin N. Breyer OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of Lean in urology at Zuckerberg San Francisco General, a community safety-net and trauma hospital that serves as a major teaching site for the University of California San Francisco. METHODS: We examined our process improvement activities from 2016 to 2018. Our Lean Daily Management System (DMS) includes a 15-minute team huddle (“urology Lean work”) of service residents, faculty, clinic and operating room nursing staff, and anesthesia liaisons. Our DMS also includes a 5-minute preoperative huddle. Besides team-building, urology Lean work surfaces logistics, safety or equipment improvement ideas, and ensures progress and completion of initiated projects. RESULTS: Over a 2-year period we developed and completed 67 projects. Projects impacted the outpatient setting (57%), followed by the operating room (22%), the Urology service (12%), and inpatient setting (9%). We completed projects in the following domains: safety (26%), quality (22%), care experience (21%), workforce care and development (13%), equity (11%), and financial stewardship (7%). Urology Lean work reduced new patient clinic access time (119-21 days) and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin in clinic treatment time (180-105 minutes). The average proportion of urology on-time surgeries was better than the overall surgery on-time surgeries (71% v 61%). CONCLUSION: Urology Lean work successfully applied DMS in a service specific yet holistic approach.

Main Outcome Measures: Characteristics of MBM users, prevalence of MBM use, and characteristics of exclusive MBM users compared to exclusive non-vitamin natural product users. Results: Among CAM users (N = 83,013,655), 21.8% of the adult population (age 18 or older) reported using exclusive MBM therapy. In multivariate models, exclusive MBM use was associated with female gender, higher educational attainment, younger age, residing in Northeast US, being Asian or black race, and a current smoker compared to those using exclusive non-vitamin natural products. Using bivariate comparisons, individuals that exclusively used MBM were more likely to be white females (60.5%), in a younger age category (18-39 years), educated beyond high school (68.3%), and more likely from the Southern US (32.4%).

4ea9a391-c181-4999-8d0d-0c97df2f8a2a,", is a field  that emphasizes alternative approaches to dental care that take into consideration the dental health of the patient involved and the overall effect of this on the whole body. There is also a body that was formed on this called Holistic Dental Association that provides guidance to holistic practitioners and other alternative dentistry. The body also informs the public on the benefits of going for holistic dentistry for their overall health and well-being. Holistic dentistry practitioners have the very same educational background and license as traditional dentists.  Holistic practitioners exceed traditional realms of thought by also learning of more general physical and mental fields of health.  This may include a diversity of subjects ranging from general nutrition to basic psychology.  An extended body of knowledge makes holistic dentists cognizant of the “big picture” of health.  Practitioners understand that a cavity does not merely need filled; rather, the underlying cause of the cavity must be found and alleviated to prevent future decay from occurring.   In this way, holistic practitioners have a view of contemporary dentistry that is refined by larger principles of physical and mental wellness.  A few noteworthy differences include the following:   Holistic dentistry is strongly against the use of amalgam as a material in dental fillings as this is known to contain mercury and some other potentially toxic materials. Although the mercury is enclosed into the filling, it is found that mercury vapor escapes and this is then absorbed into the body. This is mostly the case when consuming hot foods and this increases due to the friction involved in chewing.   The mercury released then accumulates in some organs and this can also find its way into the maternal milk of a lactating mother. The accumulated levels will be low at first but these will increase with time and this eventually leads to some health problems more so when the immune system is compromised. Some of these health problems include: 1) Decreased kidney function 2)  Increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria present in the intestines 3) Muscle aches and dizziness among others   Inside a tooth is a dental pulp and this contains the nerves, veins, arteries and lymph vessels. This is a very major part of the tooth and when it is injured, the body tries to repair it but failure for the pulp to heal will see it die. This can happen if your tooth is fractured or if it has a deep cavity as this will expose the pulp to the bacteria found in the saliva. Root canal therapy is used to remove the affected nerve and the pulp from the tooth through drilling.   Holistic dentistry argues that after drilling out the affected nerves, there are some microscopic tubules that are left and these are impossible to fill. The bacterial in these tubules therefore continue to survive after the root canal therapy and they can escape from the tooth to other parts of the body where they can cause infections. This is why holistic dentistry recommends tooth extraction as an alternative to canal treatment.   Many toothpaste companies will advertise about the wondrous health benefits of fluoride in their toothpaste but holistic dentists are very much against this. They argue that there are no studies supporting this and also say that fluoride is a toxic substance that can cause harm to the body.   Generally, there are other dental practices that holistic dentistry is against and all these are meant for the general body health of the human being. One should also understand that the condition of your teeth and gums greatly affects your body health. Ensure that you have regular dental exams, brush and floss at least twice every day more so after meals.

He is a graduate of Georgetown University as well as the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. Dr. Herrmann is currently a diplomat of the International Congress of Oral Implantology. In 1989, he started Assure a Smile to provide a more engaging and enlightening dental experience for South Florida residents. While most children had dreams of becoming astronauts and movie stars, Dr. Ted Herrmann decided to become a dentist at the age of 6! After visiting the dentist, he felt a calling to pursue teeth and gum care as a professional and this passion escalated throughout his childhood. Dr. Herrmann is not only a skilled and wise dentist, but he has many handicraft abilities and enjoys a variety of hobbies. Dr. Herrmann is a Network Administrator, a sailing boat captain, pilot, and a professional photographer. A Renaissance man, Dr. Herrmann pays attention to detail and seeks perfection in all of his endeavors, as illustrated in the smiles of his patients! Diplomat of the International Congress of Oral Implantology Dr. Herrmann got into the mercury removal side of dentistry early before becoming a holistic dentist. He suffered from mercury poisoning in the past and his wife urged him to see a nutritionist upon taking notice. The nutritionist informed Dr. Herrmann about the toxic levels of the mercury contained in fillings, an insight that would change his life and career path permanently. Under the recommendation of his nutritionist, he changed his diet and began prudent research on mercury poisoning and other aspects of traditional dentistry. He now applies this knowledge and research on an everyday basis to his practice. International Congress of Oral Implantologists (ICOI) World Clinical Institute of Clinical Lasers (WCLI) International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology (IAOMT) International Association of Mercury Free Dentists (IAMFD) International Academy of Mercury Safe Dentists (IAMSD) International Academy of Biological Dentistry & Medicine (IABDM) Dr. Herrmann has changed his own lifestyle to be more holistic, realizing that inherent in an allopathic lifestyle is an overuse of medication and an under consumption of healthy foods. He preaches consistently good nutrition and is a advocate of organic foods. Additionally, he practices yoga and meditates regularly. Dr. Herrmann now lives by holistic principles and leads a very healthy, balanced lifestyle. Dr. Herrmann diligently informs all of his patients about the benefits of a holistic lifestyle, which can not only significantly improve your teeth, but better your health and lifestyle as well!

Yoga has split into several unique sects of ideologies over the years.  Each has a common ancestry, however, having been born in ancient India.  References to yoga poses and practice have been discovered on tapestries dated as early as 1700 BC.  Despite its revolution into so many different styles, most yoga practice still has a common goal:  to unite the mind and body as one. The mind-body connection is at the root of yoga practice.  Yogis, avid yoga practitioners, believe that uniting the mind and body is the key to overall spiritual wellness.  In this way, yoga seeks to combine the tangible body with the mysterious and intangible mind. Modern medicine supports this seemingly strange idea that our minds have a profound affect over our bodies.  Researchers at the University of Illinois, for example, write of a link between high levels of stress and the immune system.  Their research indicates that as physical stress increases, the ability of the immune system to function decreases (i).  Mental stress, it seems, has the ability to affect physical change. shares a common ground with yoga.  Yoga sees the mind as an integral part of overall health, with mental problems being manifested through the body.  By the same token, sees the overall health of the patient as being intricately linked to both their mental and physical wellness.  A stressed and anxiety-prone patient, for example, may exhibit stress fractures, poor diet, and a corresponding predisposition to tooth decay.  While traditional dentists view a patient with these symptoms as an individual who needs a filling or two, holistic dentists see something different.  They see a patient who needs help with stress management, eating well, and oral hygiene education. Of course, just because you enjoy yoga does not mean you will enjoy visiting a .  There is a significant overlap in ideology, however, so you may want to consider it!  At Assure a Smile, we refer to our approach to dentistry as .  The professionals at Assure a Smile are primarily concerned with the overall wellness of the patient, just as Yogis are concerned with the overall well being of their mental and physical bodies.

To understand , and holistic dentistry in particular, we must first look at the origin of the word itself.  comes from the Greek word , a term that means . , like other holistic practices, looks at an individual as if they were a puzzle.  Like a puzzle, patients are an intricate system of different pieces that are interconnected, each one affecting the next. This also reflects the idea that a single system, like a human being, is more than the sum of several individual parts.   Holistic medicine uses this concept when treating patients.  For this idea means looking at much more than simply the teeth and gums.   At Assure a Smile, we like to think of as being ; an examination of the entire patient. Dental cleanings for example, begin with a full scan to better understand the entire head, neck, and jaw area of a new patient.  This is important because a patient may experience pain or discomfort in their mouth that is actually caused by a problem located outside of their mouth.  These problems are often overlooked by that do not inspect the head, neck, and jaw.  Patients are often referred to other specialists as a result, prolonging diagnoses of the problem. also seeks to preserve teeth in the most natural state possible.  Excessive drilling, grinding, and tooth removal are avoided and typically reserved as a measure of last resort.  Instead, non-invasive procedures are used to straighten, strengthen, and enhance oral health. is one such system Assure a Smile recommends to patients with gum disease.  are another non-invasive treatment Assure a Smile offers, specifically to patients who wish to realign their teeth for both aesthetic and hygienic reasons.  These treatments are safe relative to other traditional chemical and invasive treatments, respectively, helping to preserve long term oral health.

8ce5fa95-5057-4a33-955f-1dbfd5461071,"seems to be just another part the fad that’s been building momentum over the last decade.  Many mistakenly categorize the idea of holistic health with the likes of organic veggies, overpriced antioxidant super drinks, and trendy yoga studios.  However, is not a mere fad.  Holistic ideals predate the advent of modern medicine, illustrating a timeless concern for the interconnected nature of the human body. Assure a Smile was built upon the idea that information is power.  The more a patient knows, the more he or she can take proactive steps towards keeping their teeth and gums healthy for life.  Much of this ideology stems from the principles of holistic medicine.  Holistic medicine, and in our case , views the body as a complex but unified system.  If there is a problem with one piece, that problem may manifest itself through another piece.   To illustrate, consider a patient who has very good oral hygiene but a few minor fillings.  Despite their regular brushing and flossing, the patient continues to develop minor cavities that need correcting.  There are two ways may approach this problem: tends to be reactive.  When a patient has a cavity, the plaque is drilled away from the enamel of the tooth and the cavity is filled.  The patient is given brief instruction on proper brushing and flossing techniques, but much of this is already known.  Further, the patient leaves with little additional knowledge to help protect themselves from future cavities. looks at the very same patient and asks .  What is the big picture?  Why does this person—who takes relatively good care of their teeth—continuing to develop cavities?  Assure a Smile thinks of this approach as , and we help patients identify the causal factors that contribute to their oral health problems.  The patient described above may habitually grind their teeth, slowly weakening their tooth enamel over time.  The pH balance in their mouth may be naturally acidic, and they may benefit from avoiding drinks like orange and grapefruit juices.  There may be several underlying factors that contribute to a patient’s oral problems—and aims to identify, explain, and diffuse each one individually.

466fc801-5cdb-4bd0-b896-7ada32bf8093,"Energy Medicine, Teeth Meridians, and Electro-Acupuncture According to Voll Energy Medicine, Teeth Meridians, and Electro-Acupuncture According to Voll Energy Medicine, Teeth Meridians, and Electro-Acupuncture According to Voll At Assure A Smile, we take a holistic approach to dentistry that remains aware of how the teeth and gums are intricately connected to the entire body. Diagnosis, treatment, and care is based on patients’ needs given these connections. One way the body demonstrates its interconnected essence is through its natural energy flow. Far from outdated mysticism, energy medicine is an ancient approach which has been brought into the 21 Century through extensive studies and technological advancements. In the field of holistic dentistry, we use energy medicine to connect issues with dental health with other potential health problems. This involves examining the body’s “meridians” and can include the use of a technique called “Electro-Acupuncture According to Voll,” named after the renowned German doctor and engineer who pioneered this innovative testing method. Energy medicine studies the nature and impact of the human body’s natural energy flow. In ancient China, enlightened practitioners began to draw parallels between an individual’s energy and the manifestation of certain body ailments. Over centuries of diligent study, the Chinese eventually mapped the flow of energy through the human body in what became known as the meridian chart. Chinese practitioners have used their understanding of the body’s meridians and energy flow in the practice of acupuncture, now widely accepted as a way of identifying and addressing numerous ailments. Each of our teeth is connected to an acupuncture meridian which is related to various organs, tissues, and glands in our bodies. The Meridian Tooth Chart was developed to explore how the oral cavity is related to the rest of the body. Our helps to demystify the complex connections between oral cavity and total body, enabling you to select a single tooth to learn more about the other organs and body systems that are connected to it via energy meridians. Patients can use their “problem teeth” as a starting point to uncover additional organs and body systems that might also be at risk. According to energy medicine, imbalances in the flow of energy may cause disturbances along that meridian in the body. When a certain tooth (or teeth) are suffering, the corresponding organs and body systems that share that meridian are likely to suffer as well. Electro-Acupuncture According to Voll and Holistic Dentistry Since energy meridians and the corresponding use of acupuncture are windows into our body’s overall health, it is no surprise that more and more holistic doctors and dentists are using these ancient techniques – supplemented by modern technological advancements – to identify health problems. One such technique is called “Electro-Acupuncture According to Voll” (EAV). Developed by Dr. Reinhard Voll after extensive research throughout the 20 Century, EAV is widely used throughout Europe by over 25,000 physicians and is growing in acceptance among holistic practitioners in the United States. EAV offers a quick, non-invasive screening method for identifying health imbalances that can complement other, more common testing procedures. Learn More About Energy Medicine, Meridians, and Holistic Dentistry At Assure A Smile, the use of energy medicine and techniques to identify health problems is in keeping with our holistic approach to dentistry, premised on the idea that oral health cannot and should not be viewed in isolation from other aspects of our health.  Diagnosis, treatment, and care is based on patients’ needs given these connections.

918ee524-567e-4fcd-a0ed-9d32facaf063,", , Health experts recognize that insulin-related diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, are a global epidemic. By the year 2020, it’s been estimated that 1 in 2 Americans will suffer with obesity, pre-diabetes, or diabetes (i). Although traditional medicine recognizes each of these diseases as separate, recognizes that they are each symptoms of a single underlying condition: an inability of the body to produce enough insulin. In this article, we explore how insulin-related diseases can cause a rise in blood sugar levels that ultimately harms the holistic health of the body. We then examine how these conditions accelerate the development of gingivitis, periodontal disease, tooth decay, and undermine oral surgeries, like dental implants. Faulty insulin production makes it very difficult for the metabolism to convert glucose into energy. As a result, men and women who suffer with an insulin condition may also experience weight gain. Because the conversion of glucose into energy is essential to maintaining a healthy body mass index (BMI), individuals with an insulin-related disease may also have a hard time losing weight. All of this leads to . As the body’s resistance to insulin increases, the next disease to develop is . At this stage, insulin production might shut down altogether, depending on the severity of the individual’s condition. Many diabetics must wear blood sugar monitors and administer insulin injections throughout the day, just to sustain normal body function. The progression of insulin-related diseases has lead Dr. Mark Hyman to coin a new term to describe the pervasive problem faced by an estimated 1.7 billion people worldwide: (ii). As an integrated medical professional, Dr. Hyman believes such conditions may be treated by proactively making better lifestyle choices. This includes proper nutrition, exercise, and oral hygiene. Individuals who suffer with obesity, type 1 diabetes, or type 2 diabetes all have one thing in common: It is difficult for their bodies to manage blood sugar levels. As blood sugar levels rise, the risk of heart disease, stroke, dementia, and cancer all increase. High blood sugar levels also wreak havoc on the teeth and gums. If plaque is not thoroughly removed from the gum line, it can irritate the gums and causes . Insulin-related diseases, like diabesity, make is more difficult for the body to ward off bacterial infections, thus allowing gingivitis to develop and spread at a higher rate. Gingivitis will eventually develop into periodontal disease, or gum disease, when left untreated. Individuals with diabesity often experience more severe gum disease, as insulin-related diseases make it extremely difficult for the body to resist infection and heal. According to the American Academy of Periodontology, “diabetic patients are more likely to develop periodontal disease, which in turn can increase blood sugar and diabetic complications,” (iii). Tooth decay occurs when food debris and oral bacteria combine to create plaque, which sticks to the teeth and damages the enamel. An insulin-related disease can speed the process, adding more sugar and starches to the mouth because of naturally higher blood sugar levels. Insulin-related diseases make it more difficult for the body to heal and recover from oral surgeries, like dental implant procedures. Moreover, high blood sugar levels the procedure can make it more difficult for the implant to heal properly, which may compromise long-term function, strength, and integrity. If you or a loved one suffers with an insulin-related disease, it is vital that you find a holistic dentist who understands how blood sugar affects treatment, healing, and care.

One reason for poor oral hygiene may be stress.  To illustrate, consider that individuals with high stress levels seek various different comforts to alleviate that stress.  This can lead to excessive sugar intake, going to sleep without brushing and flossing, teeth grinding, and jaw clenching.  These things slowly break down tooth enamel, making teeth more susceptible to cavities.  Stress is just one example of a mental state that can alter a physical state.  Anxiety, paranoia, fear, and different emotions can likewise affect the physical being of a person.   To care for your oral health in the best way possible, consider visiting a professional.  experiences are more comprehensive than traditional ones.  Cleanings at Assure a Smile, for example, provide a thorough insight into specific oral conditions, including jaw bone density, mouth acidity, and more.  If you are interested in a more inclusive and insightful visit to the dentist, take advantage of our New Patient Cleaning Special and schedule a online!

For example, bad gums can be related to heart problems, while teeth problems can lead to or be caused by kidney problems. Holistic dentistry in Miami, Florida is becoming increasingly popular. Here is a look at some reasons why holistic dentistry is capturing the attention of those seeking quality oral care: One reason people are looking with more interest towards holistic dentistry is the use of bio compatible materials. At Assure a Smile, we believe that you should not need to add any more toxins to your body when you are already exposed to so many on a daily basis. These materials are less toxic as compared to traditional materials that may cause sensitivities or other troublesome reactions. Bio materials can be found in filings, crowns, and orthodontics. Holistic dentists do not believe in using toxic fillings made of mercury. It is not surprising, then, that safe mercury removal is a very important procedure. However, to perform safe mercury removal there are special precautions that have to be taken to ensure that you do not breathe in or swallow the metal particles. Many Miami holistic dentists also utilize filters to prevent metal from entering into the public water system. It is thought that as much as 14% of the pollution in the ocean is caused by dental waste.  At Assure a Smile, we utilize these filtration methods to do our part in waste reduction. Research has shown that the same bacteria that leads to gum disease can also lead to other problems throughout the body, including heart disease. This makes sense as your mouth is the opening to the rest of your body. Comfortable gum treatment is of paramount importance when trying to protect your body from bacteria and infection. Your Miami, Florida will try to use his or her knowledge of integrative dentistry to find a way to naturally treat your gum disease with as little pain as possible. When treating TMJ and bite problems, h  olistic dentistry also realizes that the structure of your mouth is important to your overall health. Because of this they look at the entire picture. A Miami holistic dentist will use specially designed splints, muscular adjustments, and a chiropractor to help you achieve the best results. While holistic dentistry knows the importance of brushing and flossing, it also focuses on a healthy diet. Your Miami dentist may talk about issues of particular importance such as having an alkaline and sugar free diet to help reduce bacterial growth and acidity of saliva, both of which are major causes of tooth decay. Homeopathic dentistry also looks at drug free options for treatment. You may find that the Miami holistic dentist uses homeopathic pellets and gels to help calm anxiety, alleviate pain, and reduce the effects of anesthesia after a treatment. Old metal fillings can create cracks and fractures in your teeth, and they therefore need to be removed before they cause the tooth to break. Holistic dentistry uses bonding techniques that can eliminate the need for caps and crowns and allow the dentist to save more of the natural tooth. Besides being more conservative, this bonding also looks more natural. Holistic dentists believe in educating their patients. This includes teaching you about the benefits of a good diet, what ingredients to avoid, and how to choose organic alternatives for your dental care. Your holistic dentist can even help you to identify toxins in the food you eat, the cleaning products you use, and medicine you take. By doing this and teaching their patients to live a balanced lifestyle, a holistic dentist is able to provide an important education service to the community.

I encourage you to check out previous posts on the , the connection of cytokine storm to the current , the connection of cytokine storm to cancer and how chemotherapy can induce metastatic spread via the same cytokine storm. Enough pointing out the problems, now for some evidence-based holistic treatment solutions from an Integrative cancer perspective. First a quote from Moliere: Physicians are people (clarification added) “who poured medicines of which they know little into bodies of which they know less” I give you the holistic cancer treatment artesunate. Some of you may be thinking, what???? Never heard of it?  Artesunate has become one of my favorite holistic therapies in the treatment of cancer at An Oasis of Healing. Not quite to the level of vitamin C, but getting close. In fact, artesunate and vitamin C have tremendous synergy against cancer. More on that later. Also, it turns out that artesunate is effective in calming the   which is how chemotherapy can cause metastasis. Artesunate had its birth on the global stage in 2015 with the award of the Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine to Dr.Youyou Tu for the treatment of malaria with sweet wormwood ; well, not sweet wormwood, but artemisinin which is a component of sweet wormwood. Sweet wormwood is the parent plant originally from China. Artemisinin is the main active ingredient and artesunate is the derivative for intravenous delivery . Dr. Tu’s lab was the first to extract artemisinin from the sweet wormwood plant in 1972 in her research of  > 2,000 year old Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) therapies in search for new treatments against malaria . How about a little Botany journey with the plant—sweet wormwood? The shrub sweet wormwood is an annual that is native to parts of Europe, parts of Africa and Asia, such as the countries of, China, Vietnam, Madagascar and Pakistan. Many artemisinin and artesunate supportive industries are major economic contributors in these countries of original origin. Approximately 70% of the worlds artemisinin currently originates out of China, India, and Vietnam. Due to its wide distribution and cultivation, sweet wormwood now grows wild throughout the world, even including parts of the U.S. Traditional medicine is the term often use to describe the current allopathic medicine model. However, this current model only dates back to approximately 100 years. In contrast, TCM and Ayurvedic medicine date back > 2,000 years to > 6,000 years respectively. According to the , traditional medicine can be defined as: “knowledge, skills and practises based on the theories, beliefs and experiences indigenous to different cultures, used in the maintenance of health and in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness…is often termed alternative or complementary medicine in many countries.” I wonder who at the World Health Organization (WHO) is referencing in the statement “…often termed alternative or complementary medicine”? Interesting statement, because according to the same WHO, 70-80% of the world’s population rely on the same non-conventional therapies . It is almost as if the WHO disclaimer is an attempt to try and discredit their definition of traditional medicine. Why make the statement of definition at all? Just an interesting question to ponder. Conventional should be the tag left to describe the current allopathic model. Leave the traditional tag to accompany the historically traditional therapies, which by the way were conventional at the time. Sweet wormwood, known as Artemsia annua, is known as Qinghaosu in TCM. Dr. Tu’s initial work was with the primary active component of sweet wormwood—artemisinin. As wonderful as artemisinin’s discovery and accolades were, the low bioavailablity and short half-life of oral artemisinin has limited its clinical benefits . According to Merriam-Webster, can be defined as “the amount of the administered compound (in this case, artemisinin for clarification) that reaches the systemic circulation that can reach the target tissue to elicit an effect”. The low bioavailability of artemisinin means that very little orally administered artemisinin reaches the intended target tissue. This is not too different than that similar low bioavailability of oral vitamin C. It is the low bioavailability and the short half-life of artemisinin that limits its clinical usefulness. To overcome the limited bioavailability of artemisinin, additional derivatives such as artesunate, dihydroartemisin, artemether, arteeter, and artemisone were developed. The artemisinin derivatives collectively are called artemisinins . These derivatives increase the bioavailability, half-life, and thus clinical effectiveness beyond that of artemisinin . There are many additional useful components of sweet wormwood and derivatives of artemisinin, but that is beyond the scope of this specific post. Artesunate’s delivery with the intravenous route ensures 100% bioavailability and improves half-life, over that of oral artesunate, due to its rapid conversion to the active metabolite dihydroartemisinin to overcome the limitations of oral artemisinin . As a result, artesunate has now become the #1 Artemisia annua derivative used today. Efferth T, Zacchino S, Georgiev MI, Liu L, Wagner H, Panossian A.

51c49408-2edd-4114-b68f-646463d14346,"Holistic Cancer Treatment: Low Dose Chemo – Part 3 by | | Low Dose Chemo Part 3 – Holistic Cancer Treatments – An Oasis of Healing   “.” —Hippocrates Low-dose chemotherapy is a vital component of any holistic, integrative cancer treatment program. But, what constitutes a holistic, integrative cancer treatment? I have previously written on the topic of . Integrative cancer is slightly different. Unfortunately, there are many conventional physicians masquerading as integrative physicians, which creates a lot of confusion amongst conventional doctors and the general public at large. Integrative, as a term, is more than just a marketing term; it is a whole different way of thinking. An integrative approach to cancer treatment involves four levels of integration: Simultaneous goals of the elimination of cancer and healing of the body Use of holistic cancer and conventional cancer treatments Therapies that integrate (work with) with the body’s physiology Integration of the evidence into the use of holistic, natural, integrative cancer therapies Low-dose chemotherapy is an integral treatment option in any holistic, integrative cancer treatment strategy. Contrary to what so many may think, this paradigm shift has its timeline origin well-published in the science. The concept of low-dose chemotherapy began with the search to find more effective, safer therapies to block the process of  angiogenesis. is the abnormal blood vessel growth that is so characteristic and critical to the cancer process. The important contribution of angiogenesis to the carcinogenic process was first described back in 1971 . The concept of low-dose chemotherapy’s anti-angiogenesis effect predates cancer. A 1989 study on rheumatoid arthritis found low-dose chemotherapy with methotrexate reduced angiogenesis and symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis . The big break with cancer came with the publication of two landmark studies. The fateful month was April of 2000. The first study, Continuous low-dose therapy with vinblastine and VEGF receptor-2 antibody induces sustained tumor regression without overt toxicity , was published by Giannoula Klement and colleagues in April 2000. In this study, low-dose continuous chemotherapy with vinblastine significantly reduced tumor angiogenesis leading to tumor regression. The second study, Antiangiogenic Scheduling of Chemotherapy Improves Efficacy against Experimental Drug-resistant Cancer , published by Timothy Browder and colleagues was published in April 2000. In this study, the ‘anti-angiogenic’ dose scheduling of the chemotherapy drug, cyclophosphamide, overcame chemoresistance to inhibit angiogenesis and trigger programmed cell death (called apoptosis). The most commonly used term for the less is better approach of low-dose chemotherapy is metronomic chemotherapy. Metronomic chemotherapy was first described by Douglas Hanahan, Gabriele Bergers, and Emily Bergsland in the same April 2000 in the article, Less is more, regularly: metronomic dosing of cytotoxic drugs can target tumor angiogenesis in mice . This article was the first to define the concept of ‘metronomic’ dosing as either “continuous infusion or frequent administration without extended rest periods.” The authors advocated a fundamental shift in approach away from the tumor’s sole emphasis as the primary target. Yes, you did read that right. The idea that the tumor is the target, let alone the only target needs to change. Why? I will leave it to the author’s words to summarize: “Drug regimens have been designed to kill as many tumor cells as possible by treating with ‘maximum tolerated doses’ (MTDs) of these cytotoxic agents” “…however, responses are short-lived, with relapses often marked by aggressive cancers that are resistant to the cytotoxic drug.” “Furthermore, the standard MTD regimen as a rule seriously impairs quality of life.” No summary is required. The author’s words say it all. It is the next step in the movement cancer treatment. It follows in the footsteps of less surgery and lower dose radiation in the treatment of cancer. Most importantly, it follows in the footsteps of science. To be specific, fractionated, metronomic dosing, insulin potentiated targeted low-dose chemotherapy (IPTLD), low-dose metronomic dosing, and multiple low-dose chemotherapy is defined as dosing of 10-30% of the maximum tolerated to toxicity chemotherapy dosing. Ten to thirty percent of the maximum tolerated dose to toxicity seems like a good thing when the treatment involves toxic therapies like chemotherapy. Don’t forget that these drugs are designed and prescribed to kill. This point seems particularly obvious when the anti-cancer efficacy, due to the lower dose of chemotherapy, is maintained and even expanded. As quoted to Owen Barfield: “The obvious is the hardest thing of all to point out to anyone who has genuinely lost sight of it.” The obvious is obvious to everyone, except for those that it is not obvious too, but, is in fact, oblivious to. Insulin Potentiated Targeted Low-Dose chemotherapy (IPTLD) Metronomic chemotherapy is probably the most recognized, so I will use it to help provide a working definition for low-dose chemotherapy. According to a 2016 Nature Reviews in Clinical Oncology article, “The term ‘metronomic chemotherapy’ (MTC) is currently used for frequent and regular administration of lower doses of chemotherapeutic drugs with minimal drug-free time intervals, or only “lower doses, longer times”, to establish a prolonged and lower albeit an active range of plasma concentration enabling a favorable side-effect profile.” Fractionated chemotherapy is merely a fraction of the maximum tolerated dose of chemotherapy. Low-dose is…well, lower dose. Chemotherapy that is lower in dose, lower in side effects, yet maintains efficacy…now that is something every physician should be able to get behind. Insulin Potentiated targeted low-dose chemotherapy (IPTLD) is low-dose chemotherapy augmented by the biologic addition of insulin to take advantage of the increase in insulin receptors and binding affinity on cancer cells. Collectively, the combination targeting with insulin and a lower dose of chemotherapy gives insulin-potentiated targeted low-dose chemotherapy . Insulin-potentiated targeted low-dose chemotherapy is like so many Integrative cancer treatments—it is misrepresented and misunderstood because of a general lack of understanding of the science. I don’t want to spend too much time here on IPTLD because I will discuss IPTLD in greater detail in future posts. The purpose of fractionated, metronomic dosing, IPTLD, low-dose metronomic dosing, and multiple low-dose chemotherapy is to administer low-dose, non-toxic chemotherapy at close, regular intervals without significant interruptions and complications , yet preserve anti-cancer treatment efficacy even in chemoresistant tumors . Anti-cancer effects with less toxic effects would appear to be an obvious goal in the treatment of cancer. Instead, conventional medicine has circled the wagons around maximum tolerated chemotherapy. They just can’t let go of the war mentality that bore the very idea of chemotherapy. The obstinance in the face of the undeniable need for progression highlights the advocacy confusion prevalent in medicine today. In short,—yes! Fractionated , metronomic dosing , low-dose metronomic dosing , multiple low-dose chemotherapy , and IPTLD   are recognized as effective, low-dose chemotherapy dosing modification options in the treatment of cancer. These supportive articles are not published in some throw-away medical journals but are mainstream, well respected, conventional oncology journals. One just needs to take a little time to read. The obvious seems… well… obvious. But, this appears to be lost on those who have lost sight of the obvious. Without getting into the specific mechanisms in this post, some of the obvious reasons for low-dose chemotherapy versus the maximum tolerated chemotherapy to toxicity approach includes: reduction in toxic side effects The mounting accumulation of data on low-dose chemotherapy points to a significant reduction in unintended consequences compared to the maximum tolerated to toxicity chemotherapy approach. If that wasn’t enough, except for those blind to the obvious, low-dose metronomic chemotherapy is equivalent to even more effective than the conventional maximum tolerated to toxicity approach . Did I hear a mic drop? Even the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) President Monica Bertagnolli, MD, of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, is quoted as saying “’’ is becoming a common refrain in some areas of cancer treatment, and one that is paying off for patients’ quality of life.” I believe that is a double mic drop. This discussion of the broad benefits of low-dose metronomic chemotherapy could go on and on and on. At some point, one has to recognize the obvious evidence and…move on. In the coming posts, I will highlight the specific, evidence-based mechanisms of action of low-dose metronomic chemotherapy and even pull in an older article or two from the founder of An Oasis of Healing, Dr. Thomas Lodi, on Insulin Potentiated Chemotherapy.

More often than not, conventional medicine’s ‘war’ against cancer can become too strenuous for a patient, as even the healthy cells are attacked, thus causing the immune system to be weaker. It’s a double-edged sword that further devastates patients and their families. And it’s a dilemma that holistic cancer treatment centers, like , are trying to eliminate. A holistic cancer treatment approach means that a patient’s treatment program focuses on attacking only the affected cells and boosting the immune system. In the case of , this approach is rooted in three pillars set forth by its founder, Dr. Thomas Lodi: through medically approved therapies and nutritional programs that enable the body to stop making cancer-causing cells; through effective therapies that do not cause further harm to the body; and through immuno-oncology therapies and modalities such as yoga, meditation and juice feasting/fasting. Why should you consider a holistic cancer treatment center? In , the customized treatment program has a holistic goal. Healing is just the first step. The bigger goal is to change the biochemistry of the body to a state of health where cancer cells will no longer thrive. A holistic approach to cancer treatment means that patients are provided with tailor-fit support to heal, repair and recover—physically, emotionally and mentally. This approach to cancer treatment is not new. In fact, as a holistic cancer treatment center, has helped hundreds of patients reclaim their health through a comprehensive cancer care program. Abu Dhabi-based Christine was cleared of colorectal cancer by her conventional doctors after a traumatic experience with chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. In less than 12 months, her cancer returned. She was now dealing with Stage 4 lung cancer. Not wanting to go through the same ordeal with conventional treatments, she went to Switzerland and researched more about alternative treatment centers. And then she discovered . The experience was literally, and figuratively, life-changing. Christine felt a sense of agency—that the treatment was a journey towards taking control of her own health, instead of something being forced upon her. At , she met highly skilled medical professionals and good people who listened to her and managed to make her feel “loved and welcome,”—a simple yet powerful feeling for cancer patients. Learn more about Christine’s journey here www.anoasisofhealing.com/how-to-recover-from-cancer/. In 2013, Edie of Tucson, Arizona, was diagnosed with breast cancer. She underwent conventional cancer treatments but two years later, her cancer marker numbers went up again. She tried ‘safe chemo’ but with no success—her markers remained high. Finally, she decided to go to a holistic cancer treatment center after watching Dr. Lodi’s videos. Edie was almost hopeless when she arrived at Healing but that quickly changed. Three weeks into treatment, her cancer markers dropped. She is determined to continue her personalized treatment program and is learning ways to, not just defeat cancer, but change her life for the better. Learn more about Edie’s journey here www.anoasisofhealing.com/cancer-marker-numbers/. What can you expect at a holistic cancer treatment center? Depending on your unique health situation, doctors and experts at will recommend scientifically proven and advanced treatments or integrative healing modalities that work naturally with the body, and that is based on a deep respect for nature. These can include chelation therapy, ozone treatments, intravenous hydrogen peroxide, intravenous vitamin C or metabolic medicine. The first step is to open your mind to possibilities beyond conventional treatments. Watch the videos. Read the testimonials. Ask questions. Reach out to us now and let’s find out how we can help.

c2e4ed7f-06b3-458b-9f47-067f11f189af,"Holistic Cancer Treatment: Low Dose Chemo – Part 1 by | | Holistic Cancer Treatment: Low Dose Chemo – Part 1   This particular post is going to be a little different than previous posts. I want to lay some philosophical and historical groundwork for this new blog post series on low-dose chemotherapy. Low-dose chemotherapy goes by many names: Is it chemo, or is it chemotherapy? Does it even matter? These terms are used interchangeably by both patients and medical professionals. Is there a difference, or is it just semantics? Or is it just grumblings of a physician that thinks words matter. I need to travel back in history to the work of in the late 19th and early 20th century to get a better understanding of these two words. Paul Ehrlich was a brilliant biochemist that lived from 1854 to 1915. He won the in 1908 for his work in understanding antibody production by the immune system in response to bacterial toxin production. “In order to pursue chemotherapy successfully we must look for substances which possess a high affinity and high lethal potency in relation to the parasites, but have a low toxicity in relation to the body, so that it becomes possible to kill the parasites without damaging the body to any great extent. We want to hit the parasites as selectively as possible. In other words, we must learn to aim and to aim in a chemical sense. The way to do this is to synthesize by chemical means as many derivatives as possible of relevant substances.” The phrase “magic bullet” origins is credited to Paul Ehrlich in the late 19th century. That time-date alone should provide solid enough evidence that there is no such thing as a magic bullet to treat any dis-ease. Initially, there were good intentions with this phrase and its intended goal of treating dis-ease states such as syphilis and cancer. However, with time, money, and power, this phrase and many others have become a way to marginalize thoughts and people to preserve and control money streams and centralize medical power. This medical Marxist movement has been ongoing in medicine for decades, all under the radar, of course. The goal is power over physicians and power over patients. Don’t question dogma. Don’t question the status quo. Don’t debate science in the arena of ideas for the betterment of patients. Physicians are now more advocates for the industry of medicine, than advocates for the purpose of medicine—the patient. Many brilliant people have been looking for the magic bullet for centuries now and yet, nothing. When it comes to dis-ease, especially cancer, there is no magic bullet. There is no magic bullet that causes cancer. There is no magic bullet that treats cancer. This statement does not belittle the work by Paul Ehrlich, and others in the search for the magic bullet. Research and time have just proven the process of cancer to be more complicated than a magic bullet. Check out my previous posts on to see just some of the complex and diverse changes that must come together for cancer to start, survive, and thrive. No magic bullet there. As there is no magic bullet in the genesis of cancer, there is no magic bullet available to eradicate cancer either. “Cancer is not a sentence. It is a word”. —Thomas Lodi, MD, MD(H) This statement makes me think of sentencing diagraming back in the elementary day. Oh, the nightmare! Some people have nightmares about going to school and forgetting to dress for the occasion. Mine is having to diagram a sentence. A sentence consists of subjects, nouns, verbs, and adjectives–it is complex. Comparatively, a word appears simple. But, words can be complex in origin, complex in meaning, and complex in use. In the same, cancer seems simple but is complex in origin, complex in type, and complex in treatment. Why do Dr. Lodi and myself always reference dis-ease and not disease? Dis-ease means the absence of wellness or the lack of ease. Disease results from two root words ‘dis’, meaning without, and ‘aise’, meaning ease, which literally gives the meaning ‘without ease’. Further discussion on this topic can be found in a previous post entitled ‘.’ Disease is a disease in name only. Take any named disease, for example, i.e., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease. For most, this diagnosis is a one-way road, the beginning of many prescription drugs, the beginning of the “disease state of mind,” the beginning of the end. In every way, a dis-ease is a label. It is the team of disease that each new patient becomes a member. With the diagnosis of team cancer, you receive a team jersey, team position, and lose all control; the loss of control of decisions, loss of control of treatment, loss of control of time, and loss of control of the future. Remember, dis-ease means a lack of ease or better—lack of wellness. Take diabetes, for example. Diabetes (or any other disease for that matter) is a disease in name only. It is a name. It is a label, a way to categorize people into a group. The individual diagnosed with diabetes has not become diabetes, but, instead, has had been labeled. Diabetes is just a word. Once the person is labeled and appropriately grouped, they can now be controlled; controlled by insurance and by the medical industry. At issue is not “Diabetes,” but the physiology of collective inflammation, insulin, and glucose dysregulation that results in the label of diabetes. At the core of this problem is a severe dysregulation of insulin and glucose. The elevated glucose is simple the smoke of the fire. It is the result of the underlying problem(s). The same applies to the other dis-eases associated with diabetes, i.e., cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s. Disease does not beget disease. Dis-ease, lack of wellness, begets them all. It is only through the restoration of wellness that all dis-eases can be treated. With the diagnosis of diabetes, doctors and the patient have fallen into the trap of the “disease state of mind”. Which to me, seems to be a dis-ease in and of itself. The body just wants to heal to reach a state of homeostasis. This fact is seen in how the body can heal from diabetes from lifestyle changes. This is how the body can heal from cancer through natural, holistic therapies that address cancer’s root causes. See, no matter how much dysfunction or dis-ease exists, the body wants and works to heal itself. The body is designed to heal itself. Isn’t it interesting that the root word of physician, rāphè, in Hebrew, means healer. Food for thought: under the current paradigm of conventional medicine, is the body given the opportunity to heal itself? Want to find a good physician? The next time you visit your physician, ask them if they are a healer, and see their response. The goal of every physician should be to connect the healer with the body’s ability to heal. Novel concept! This lock and key opens the door of hope to stir the healing potential of the body for every patient with whatever named dis-ease is labeled. Any breakdown in this, i.e., lack of hope, lack of body’s healing potential, use of non-healing therapies, will result in the absence of healing. How about a little word origin work? The words chemo and chemotherapy are relatively new as history goes. The words chemo and chemotherapy origins date back to the early 20th century. Chemo means chemical. Chemotherapy is the use of chemicals in the treatment of dis-eases. Chemo is the chemical, and therapy is the treatment of dis-ease, thus chemotherapy. Originally, chemotherapy was first referenced for the treatment of syphilis . Its origin of use has no reference to cancer at all. It wasn’t until the middle of the 20th century that the treatment of cancer became synonymous with chemotherapy . It is vital to know history. History is time recorded teaching moments. History is full of different people, supposedly smarter than their predecessors, making the same series of mistakes over and over again. We can look back in history on the with condemnation, yet fail to recognize the same process and behavior in the current cancel culture today. History is essential to know, not to re-write it, but to learn from it. History that is forgotten or re-written destines that culture or profession to the same mistakes. Essentially, the culture becomes a prisoner of the past, instead of learning from past to avoid mistakes in the future. Join me in the coming weeks as I review the history of chemotherapy in cancer treatment, define and discuss low-dose chemotherapy, and review the efficacy and additional benefits of low-dose chemotherapy.

9fd67cb6-97d4-48fc-bb30-b4d05891e3ca,"Before we can discuss , we must speak the same language, so a few definitions are in order. The word ‘integrate’ means: . While the word ‘medicine’ in this context, is broadly defined as: Therefore, the term ‘integrative medicine’ should mean: the combining and unification of different systems of diagnosing and treating diseases. The ‘different systems’ referred to include, alternative, naturopathy, homeopathy, allopathy, osteopathy, and traditional medicine. includes: herbal, Ayurvedic, Siddha, Unani, Native American healers, Islamic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, Hawaiian kahunas, Polynesian, African, South American rain forest shamans and indigenous peoples from all over the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines traditional medicine as follows: “The health practices, approaches, knowledge and beliefs incorporating plant, animal and mineral-based medicines, spiritual therapies, manual techniques and exercises, applied singularly or in combination to treat, diagnose and prevent illnesses or maintain well-being.” The roots of these venerable systems reach back far in advance of antiquity, predating science, the child born of ignorance and atheism, by untold millennia. The term ‘‘ (allos = other) was actually coined by Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy. It was a pejorative term, meaning that the “regular doctors” who administer chemical toxins to their patients are employing treatment modalities that are unrelated to the condition (disease) and are dangerous. It, now, generally refers to conventional, mainstream, orthodox, scientific or Western medicine. It is a clear sign of ignorance when the term is used when referring to conventional medicine. refers to any and all healing practices that fall outside the scope of conventional medicine. This category is, therefore, extremely diverse, encompassing everything from true shamanic healers to naturopaths to homeopaths to yogis to chiropractors to acupuncturists to charlatans selling footbaths; hence it is often thought of as non-evidenced based, non-scientific and ineffective. Quite often now, it is grouped with the term, complementary medicine, which actually refers to these very same alternative practices when used only as an adjunct to conventional medicine. (CAM) was defined by the CAM office of the National Institute of Health in 1995 as: “a broad domain of healing resources that encompasses all health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period.” The operative word in that statement is political. Although not appropriate to the present discussion, it should be kept in mind that often, political power is achieved and maintained by force. When, in 1993, it was found that one out of three Americans had been to an alternative practitioner, the banks opened their coffers and an explosion of CAM practices furiously and enthusiastically spread throughout the United States. According to the American Hospital Association, the percentage of U.S. hospitals that offered CAM in 2004 was 20% and another 24% of hospitals are actively incorporating these therapies in order to compete.

And once we understand nature’s transformative powers, we see that it is our powerful ally, not a force to feared our subdued.” History repeats many themes. That is the one constant among the variables of history. One repetitive theme throughout history is revolution. The word revolution evokes memory of prominent revolutions thought out world history: the Scottish insurrection, the French Revolution, and of course the American revolution come to mind. Isn’t it interesting that most revolutions are equated with war? Revolutions are not just confined to war though. They are found throughout all aspects of culture. Revolutions are found in the world of art, the world of literature, the world of the physical sciences, and the world of medicine. Revolutions in the world of science or medicine are called paradigm shifts. Alternative medicine or the Holistic, Integrative treatment of cancer are examples of one such paradigm shift in motion. The term paradigm shift was first credited to the American philosopher Thomas Kuhn in his 1962 book, . According to the , a paradigm shift is “a fundamental change in approach or underlying assumptions”. If a paradigm shift is a shift between paradigms, what is a paradigm? Thomas Kuhn described a paradigm as the “conceptual scheme theory prevalent of the time”. Restated, it is the prism of the time through which every problem is evaluated, debated, and practiced. It is what everybody is doing. Today, it is called the standard of care. Paradigm shifts occur when the prevailing theory of thought cannot answer the questions generated by and in the prevailing paradigm theory. Huh? A paradigm shift occurs when what everybody is doing (standard of care) cannot meet the challenge of the questions of the time. Essentially, paradigm shifts are created by problem solvers when a problem cannot be properly evaluated or solved under the current paradigm. When new questions arise that cannot be answered according to the current paradigm, a paradigm shift occurs, leading to the birth of a new paradigm. A paradigm shift is a revolution of thought that leads to a revolution in action, not necessarily a revolution of war. In a , I discussed how low-dose chemotherapy has broad, overarching anti-cancer effects. In this post, I want to wade more into some of the specifics how low-dose chemotherapy inhibits the pro-cancer process called angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is different, but similar, to a few terms you may read or hear about—vasculogenesis or neovascularization. Angiogenesis is the production of new blood vessels from pre-existing rapidly dividing endothelial cells. Vasculogenesis is the production of new blood vessels from circulating endothelial progenitor cells that originate from bone marrow. The difference may seem like semantics, but angiogenesis and vasculogenesis are distinct, but separate processes that are critical to the support of a growing tumor. Neovascularization refers to new vascular growth, which can include both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Angiogenesis is vital to the genesis, progression, growth, and the metastatic spread of cancer. Angiogenesis is the new, rapid vascular growth that is essential to meet the high metabolic demand of the rapidly growing tumor. It is also the means to spread. This new vascular growth, called neovascularization, helps to deliver nutrients required to meet the high metabolic demand of cancer growth and eliminate the waste products that are a byproduct of the same growth. Needless to say, the targeting of angiogenesis with treatment provides a means to disable the process of cancer at a multitude of levels. The specific target of low-dose, metronomic chemotherapy in the process of angiogenesis are endothelial cells. Endothelial cells line the new vessel growth that is a part of this new, rapid vascularization process inherent to angiogenesis. In contrast to maximum to tolerated toxicity chemotherapy (MTTC), endothelial cells have shown to be particularly vulnerable to the repeated, low-dose exposure of chemotherapy . In contrast, cancer cells are particularly prone to the development of chemo-resistance from the delivery of maximum to tolerated toxicity (MTTC) approach of conventional chemotherapy. I must confess, I love biochemistry! I am a nerd for all things biochemistry, especially when it comes to the process of cancer and the mechanisms of natural therapies in the treatment of cancer. A beautiful article published in the journal in May 2020 entitled Inducing Angiogenesis, A Key Step in Cancer Vascularization, and Treatment Approaches highlights the balance of promoter and inhibitor signals vital to the process of angiogenesis : Angiogenesis is the result of the balance of signals that promote angiogenesis versus the balance of signals that inhibit angiogenesis. The primary battle of these signals occurs in the tumor microenvironment. These signals are produced by the tumor cells and other cells present in the tumor microenvironment. The point here is not to highlight the specific details in the signaling balance that favors or inhibits angiogenesis. In fact, the balance of the signals that favors angiogenesis are well known. The point here is that this signaling balance knowledge lends itself for direct targeting with treatment. The pro-angiogenic balance of promoters to inhibitors leads to what is called the “angiogenic switch” . The angiogenic switch is required for the transition of a premalignant tumor cell to a malignant tumor. It supplies the necessary vascular support to meet the metabolic demands required for rapid growth and metastatic spread.  In many ways, the angiogenic switch is the beginning of the snowball rolling down the hill. As cliché as angiogenic switch may appear, at least as much as I have used it already, the contribution of angiogenesis to carcinogenesis may even occur prior to the angiogenic switch. The target is the tumor microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment was first likened to a chronic wound that won’t heal in 1986 publication . It has been estimated that over 15% of cancer result from infections (bacterial, viral, and parasitic) and 25% of cancers are the result of chronic inflammation . It is the chronic immune activation that is the result of chronic infections and chronic inflammation in a chronic wound that doesn’t heal that can trigger angiogenesis prior to the angiogenic switch . Isn’t that a paradox, but that is so cliché. Does low-dose, metronomic chemotherapy inhibit tumor angiogenesis? Numerous studies have shown that lower, more frequent dosing of chemotherapy inhibits or suppresses tumor angiogenesis . The evidence on this point is very, very strong. Did, I mention the evidence is very strong? Many individuals, conventional doctors included, look at Holistic, Integrative cancer therapies as unscientific; but, in actuality, it is the science that forces a move to Holistic, Integrative cancer therapies. That is if the reader first reads and then can be honest with themselves. Low-dose, metronomic chemotherapy is the perfect example. The logical next question should be does maximum to tolerated toxicity chemotherapy (MTTC) induce angiogenesis? The short answer, is no, not really. The published literature does not provide positive evidence on this point here. In fact, additional angiogenic inhibitor therapies must be added to conventional MTTC to inhibit angiogenesis . A 2009 publication title said it all, “It takes two to tango…” . The two being MTTC and additional angiogenic inhibitor drugs. But, what about conventional MTTC without angiogenic inhibitors? The literature shows that the MTTC approach shrinks the primary tumor while causing the metastatic spread at the same time? A 2015 article published in the journal Cancer Research, entitled metastasis highlights the paradox of MTTC induction of metastasis even while shrinking the primary tumor . The specific chemotherapy drugs implicated here were paclitaxel, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, cyclophosphamide (CTX), and cisplatin. Another article, Paclitaxel therapy promotes breast cancer metastasis in a TLR4-dependent manner, points to local recurrence and metastasis as a result of the chemotherapy paclitaxel . Neither local recurrence or metastasis can occur without active angiogenesis. I have written and discussed previously on how the conventional approach to the use chemotherapy induces , which leads to metastasis. There, in part, lies the answer of how MTTC induces angiogenesis. It is important to remember that cytokine storm is associated with an increase in IL-6 cytokine signaling. Research has shown that MTTC stimulates a storm of cytokines in the tumor microenvironment. Interleukin-6 secretion is one such cytokine. A 2004 article, Changes in plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines in response to paclitaxel chemotherapy, found that IL-6 was increased with higher dose chemotherapy every 3 weeks compared to lower doses administered weekly . This really was a study that was contrasting conventional MTTC given every 3 weeks, and lower-dose, metronomic chemotherapy given weekly. The conventional MTTC, IL-6 stimulation of metastasis cannot occur without angiogenesis. A 2015 article, highlights how IL-6 is similar to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in the stimulation not only of angiogenesis, but defective angiogenesis . That is exactly what occurs in cancer. Vascular endothelial Growth Factor will be discussed in greater detail in part II of this post. It is one thing for lightening to strike once; But twice or even three times? Eventually the repetitive lightening strikes become a storm of evidence. Following the first lightening strike via the 2004 study above, the second lightening strike was a 2017 publication, Neoadjuvant chemotherapy induces breast cancer metastasis through a TMEM-mediated mechanism and the third was another 2019 publication, Suppression of chemotherapy-induced cytokine/lipid mediator surge and ovarian cancer by a dual COX-2/sEH inhibitor . The conventional MTTC metastasis lightening storm only continues . There is really only one determination to be taken from these studies: the fact that conventional MTTC stimulates metastasis. This can only occur with the co-existent stimulation of angiogenesis. Eventually, one must recognize the winds of change that accompany this lightening storm; or one denies and hides from the evidence of the storm. It is not enough to say that the published evidence shows that low-dose, metronomic chemotherapy inhibits tumor angiogenesis; the evidence points to the details of how.

a279a658-01dc-4f8a-ba52-6d900979e1fa,"Holistic Cancer Treatments – Causes of Cancer – Part 1 by | | Holistic Cancer Treatments – Causes of Cancer – Part 1 Aristotle said it first, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Christian Smutz brought the concept of holism to the modern era with his book Holism and Revolution. This background was highlighted in greater detail in my previous post on Wholistic vs Holistic Cancer Treatment. The general concept is that the whole transcends the individual parts. Holistic medicine is a non-compartmentalized approach to healthcare. With less information, the ancients were more holistic in their approach than the experts of today, who have significantly more information. A holistic approach to cancer is no different. A holistic approach to cancer is found in causation, testing, treatment, and in maintenance therapy. It is holistic in the whole sense of the word. This post will look at a holistic approach to some of the causes of cancer. A holistic approach to the causes of cancer include: There are and can be many more contributors, but this post is going to be long enough. To condense the quantity of information in this post, I will break up into a series of posts. I want to highlight each point in detail individually. Conventional medicine continues to push denial on the connection between lifestyle, particularly diet and cancer. The science is precise on the matter. In contrast to the opinion often espoused by physicians, including conventional Oncologists, we are products of our collective environment, and it is our lifestyle choices that dictate much of our cellular environment. No matter the denial, the evidence points to the contrary. What we put in our mouth effects cancer risk and cancer healing. Our nutrition choices, or lack there of, can benefit the whole of the body or damage the whole of the body. Lifestyle can include diet, stress, sleep/wake cycles, relationships, exercise/activity level, weight, home, and many others. A highlighted the connection between diet and cancer . In this study model, dietary choices increase the toxicity of chemotherapy up to . The mechanism, by researchers at the University of Virginia, was found to be through the dietary alterations in the gut microbiome. I have often said that diet is love language, or not, with our DNA. This study shows that diet is the means to alter the gut microbiome to increase or possibly decrease chemotherapy toxicity. In essence, the lifestyle choice of what we put in our mouth lays the groundwork for toxicity from chemotherapy. So much for the idea that nutrition plays no role in cancer treatment. In fact, If doctors are telling patients with cancer to eat whatever they want, i.e. hamburgers, steak, sugar… they are in effect increasing the toxicity and morbidity of treatment in patients. Their is an important phrase that should be on the tongue of every physician—“first do no harm”. This study just focused on diet. This point doesn’t take into account all the other individual lifestyle choices. Lifestyle choices do not exist in a bubble, but instead, exist as a collective combination to impact our body for health or for dis-ease. They are our choices. Epigenetics is an exciting new science that is making tremendous progress and promise in the treatment of dis-eases like cancer. Epigenetics means “above genetics”. The epigenome is the total number of modifications of the DNA (genome) in response to the environment (i.e., diet, stress…). This is the body’s attempt to regulate the activity and expression of all the genes (epigenetics) within the genome in response to its environment. While DNA is the different pieces of the puzzle that is the body, epigenetics is the directions for how those genes, the “pieces,” are used in response to the environment. This process of adaptation occurs throughout life. These adaptations are inheritable. These adaptations can be passed from generation to generation for generations. This inheritable epigenetic modifications is called Transgenerational Inheritance . Epigenetic alterations can and will occur at any time, including conception, pregnancy, puberty, stress, and beyond. These are normal processes that take place throughout this existence we call life and control how a body changes and adapts to its environment. In addition to these normal processes, it is apparent that environmental factors and life events can affect each individual’s epigenome as well, which means you have a significant amount of control over your health now and your health potential in the future. Epigenetics brings each individual’s healing potential within their grasp. Scientists are evaluating and testing new therapies that will use the epigenome to fight cancer. Just look at chemotherapy alone. Maximum tolerated chemotherapy is associated with significant, serious side effects.  Instead of using high doses of toxic chemotherapy to attack the cancer cells, patients in trials are receiving lower doses of medication as a result of epigenomic targeting, explicitly directed towards the cancer cells while bypassing healthy cells . These patients are showing positive results and are suffering from fewer side effects from the treatments. Now there is a novel concept, target the cancer and not the patient. Oxygen is essential to life on earth. Hypoxia is the lack of oxygen. Without oxygen, life in its current form would not exist. Hypoxia is present at the genesis stage of cancer—called carcinogenesis . As critical as oxygen is to life, the absence of oxygen is equally essential to the development of cancer. The whole body cannot be hypoxic. This would equal no life. Hypoxia is critical to the Tumor Microenvironment (TME). The TME specifically will be discussed later in this series. Hypoxia induces signaling, such as Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1alpha, to promote and propagate cancer . Hypoxia in the TME alters energy production via the Warburg effect . The hypoxic effect increases lactate production to increase the acidic environment that is so characteristic of the cancer TME . In addition, hypoxia alters the immune system in the TME to protect and preserve the growing tumor from the immune system , all at the expense of the body. Hypoxia even promotes cancer treatment resistance to conventional radiation and chemotherapy . Beyond the driving force that is hypoxia in the genesis of cancer, hypoxia is the major push behind the spread of cancer via metastasis . Hypoxia drives the production of blood vessel growth (angiogenesis) . that is so critical to the physical cell escape in metastasis. Hypoxia is also essential in how cancer can escape the immune system, both locally and systemically, in the process of metastasis. Inflammation is the bed that cancer lies in. Inflammation is not de-facto the enemy of the body and is an over-simplified view of inflammation. Inflammation is, in fact, a critical, necessary component of the healing process. Just look at a paper cut. Immediately, the site is painful, red, swollen, and hot. These are the cardinal signs and symptoms of inflammation that prevent secondary infection and initiate the healing process. However, in the described setting of the paper cut, the inflammation subsides once the threat of secondary infection is gone, and the healing process is in full motion. In cancer, inflammation does not turn off, but in fact, turns on the body. In many ways, cancer uses the immune system and inflammation signaling to co-opt the immune system against the body. Cancer requires chronic inflammation, yet cancer stimulates the production of inflammation. Inflammation is a by-product of immune system signaling. Immune system signaling and inflammation can inhibit cancer initiation, growth, and spread. Likewise, Immune signaling and inflammation can promote cancer initiation, growth, and spread. In many ways, NF-kappaB sits at this crossroad of inflammation and cancer . NF-kappaB is a critical genetic transcription factor that stimulates inflammation in cancer to promote tumorigenesis . Disordered immune function and Inflammation are present in the Tumor Microenviroment (TME) . An Inflammatory TME promotes NF-kappaB activation. It is the activation of NF-kappaB that further stimulates the production of inflammatory signals, called cytokines, that also increase pro-carcinogenic inflammation and even immune suppression . The result is dysfunction of the immune system, evasion of the immune system, and even suppression of the immune system, which leads to growth , survival , invasion and metastasis of cancer . Look for the remaining articles of this series on the holistic causes of cancer to post in the coming weeks.

fa028f59-43b1-468d-a07d-6757e7d4bac5,"by | | , Holistic is the more accepted correct spelling in academics Wholistic predates holism, but is a more modern, non-academic spelling Most may wonder if that even matters. Or, who would even think to ask such a question? Ok, fair enough. However, I think the historical meaning of words is significant. Words have meanings. They make up our language, our means to communicate. If words have no meaning, then how do we communicate? Can communication occur through meaningless words? Words have stood the test of time through history because of their meaning. The perseveration of the importance of words preserves their history and their context within history. Words are born from history. An easy way to know history is to know words and their context in time. Likewise, an easy way to change history is to change the meaning of words, which changes their historical context to then alter history itself. More recently, words are used to marginalize and discredit different thoughts and viewpoints. Historically, it is accepted that Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) were the first wholistic or holistic forms of the practice of medicine. After all, they date back 2,000+ and 5,000+ years, respectively. Holistic appears to be the first on the map. The first credit for the historical use of the term, holistic, has been given to Christian Smuts. Christian Smuts introduced the concept of holism in his 1926 book entitled . Interestingly, Christian Smuts had no significant connection with medicine at all. Christiaan Smuts was a prominent South African Academic, British Commonwealth statesman, military leader, philosopher, and Prime Minister of South Africa. Turn to the modern father of holism—Christian Smuts. Holism is the practice of the holistic theory, as defined by Smuts . Holism or Holistic has no reference to what appears to the be origin word–hole. That, of course, is another rabbit hole that we want to avoid. Christian Smuts defined holism as “the ultimate principle of the universe…the operative factor in the evolution of wholes” . This definition of holism applied to both organic and inorganic as well as biological and non-biological. Holism, according to Smuts, was a counter to the scientific dominance of the time of reduction in research. It was a challenge to how the current scientists evaluated systems. Reduction was a compartmentalization view of how things relate to each other. The idea of reduction compartmentalization was that systems are best studied through their compartments or individual parts– top-down, almost unrelated perspective in how things in the biological versus non-biological were constructed and related to each other. In contrast, Christian Smuts discarded the compartmentalization view and pursued the bottom-up approach that the whole transcends the individual parts. The individual parts support and point to the whole. His idea was that systems, whether biological or non-biological, are best served and evaluated through the focus on the parts only to benefit the whole. The whole is more important than the individual parts. The spelling of whole in the previous sentence is not a typo. Holism is from the original Greek word holo meaning whole. History sometimes gets the award of credit for discovery or use of term wrong. It happened with Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla in honor of the creation of the light bulb and with Alexander Graham Bell and Antonio Meucci in the credit for the invention of the telephone. It also appears to have happened with Christian Smuts and the Greek philosopher Aristotle. Aristotle seemed to have gotten a historical jump on Smuts with his credited quote of “the whole is more than the sum of its parts.” Of course, he used the Greek word holo, meaning whole, from which we get the word hole. The first modern medical use of holistic with medicine likely has its origin sometime in the early 1970s. It appears likely it was first used as an adjective in an attempt to describe the “alternative medicine” movement of Functional/Integrative medicine. This alternative medicine movement stands in contrast to the conventional allopathic medicine model. This contrast makes perfect sense. Allopathic medicine is a compartmentalized model of medicine i.e., pathology, oncology, psychiatry… that focus’ more on the parts, and less, often neglecting, the whole of the body. Just look at the referrals in between the individual compartments. One must hope that there is communication between the parts. Most experiences show that this is unfortunately, not the case. In contrast “holistic medicine” focus is on the whole. The individual parts are only a means to improve the whole. Without the whole, there are no parts. Whole as a word has its origin back to the 14th century, predating holistic. That is going back just a few centuries. The origin definition of whole is “the entire body” or “full amount.” As with holism, wholism use is best as a descriptive adjective i.e., wholistic medicine, though, it can be used as a noun i.e. wholism. The word whole actually can translate to mean healthy in old English. The root word of healthy is the word heal. Healing to achieve health can only be achieved by a focus on the whole. Interestingly, the word physician in Hebrew,  rāphè, means healer. A more modern day-working definition includes the evaluation and treatment of the whole system or the whole body. Without the whole, healing is not possible. This wholistic approach is the foundation of Integrative medicine. At the core, holistic versus wholistic is simply an academic argument. Is it a misspelling? Some say yes. Many others would say no. Holistic means wholistic, and wholistic means holistic. They are interchangeable. They mean the same thing. It just so happens that Christian Smuts might have misspelled and dropped the “w” when discussing holistic, and it stuck. Most recognize holistic as the correct spelling form, though wholistic is perfectly acceptable from a meaning and spelling perspective. From that perspective, I will use holistic…but think wholistic. Are you confused now? It boils down to an academic versus non-academic discussion. But, if you are from the deep South in the U.S., is that boils or bowls? Moving forward, I will discuss a holistic approach to cancer from a variety of different points that includes causation, evaluation, and treatment. Look for updates to post soon. __________________________________________________________ Russell G. Holism and Holistic. 2016. BMJ;353. Jorgenfelt C, Partington H. A critical analysis of J.C.

However, that doesn’t mean that they’re risk-free for everyone. Your age, health, special circumstances (such as pregnancy), and medicines or supplements that you take may affect the safety of complementary approaches. Headaches are the most common form of pain. They’re a major reason why people miss work or school or visit a health care provider. This fact sheet focuses on two types of headache: tension headaches and migraines. Researchers have studied complementary health approaches for both. Tension Headaches and Migraines: What’s the Difference? —the most common type of headache—are caused by tight muscles in the shoulders, neck, scalp, and jaw. They may be related to stress, depression, or anxiety and may occur more often in people who work too much, sleep too little, miss meals, or drink alcoholic beverages. —which affect about 12 percent of Americans—involve moderate to severe throbbing pain, often on one side of the head. During a migraine, people are sensitive to light and sound and may feel nauseated. Some people have visual disturbances before a migraine—like seeing zigzag lines or flashing lights, or temporarily losing their vision. Anxiety, stress, lack of food or sleep, exposure to light, or hormonal changes (in women) can trigger migraines. Genes that control the activity of some brain cells may play a role in causing migraines. For more information about headaches, visit the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Web site. What the Science Says About Complementary Health Approaches for Headache Research has produced promising results for some complementary health approaches for tension headache or migraine. For other approaches, evidence of effectiveness is limited or conflicting. Mind and body approaches that have been studied for headache include acupuncture, biofeedback, massage, relaxation techniques, spinal manipulation, and tai chi. Acupuncture is a technique in which practitioners stimulate specific points on the body, most often by inserting thin needles through the skin. There have been many studies of acupuncture for headache. The combined results from these studies indicate that acupuncture may help relieve headache pain, but that much of its benefit may be due to nonspecific effects including expectation, beliefs, and placebo responses rather than specific effects of needling. Acupuncture is generally considered safe when performed by an experienced practitioner using sterile needles. Improperly performed acupuncture can cause potentially serious side effects. Biofeedback measures body functions and gives you information about them so that you can become more aware of those functions and learn to control them. For example, a biofeedback device may show you measurements of muscle tension. By watching how these measurements change, you can become more aware of when your muscles are tense and learn to relax them. Several types of biofeedback have been studied for headaches, including techniques that help people learn to relax and more specific techniques that focus on changes that occur during headaches. Many studies have tested biofeedback for tension headaches, and several evaluations of this research have concluded that biofeedback may be helpful. However, an evaluation that included only the highest quality studies concluded that there is conflicting evidence about whether biofeedback is helpful for tension headaches. Studies have shown decreases in the frequency of migraines in people who were using biofeedback. However, it’s unclear whether biofeedback is better than a placebo for migraines. Biofeedback generally does not have harmful side effects. Massage therapy includes a variety of techniques in which practitioners manipulate the soft tissues of the body. Limited evidence from two small studies suggests massage therapy is possibly helpful for migraines, but clear conclusions cannot be drawn. Massage therapy appears to have few risks when performed by a trained practitioner. However, people with health conditions and pregnant women may need to avoid some types of massage and should consult their health care providers before having massage therapy. Relaxation techniques—such as , , and breathing exercises—are practices that can produce the body’s natural relaxation response. (Some types of biofeedback are also designed to help people learn relaxation; biofeedback is discussed in a separate section above.) Although some experts consider relaxation techniques to be promising for tension headaches, there isn’t much evidence to support their effectiveness. An evaluation of high-quality studies on relaxation techniques found conflicting evidence on whether they’re better than no treatment or a placebo. Some studies suggest that relaxation techniques are less helpful than biofeedback. Relaxation techniques generally don’t have side effects. However, rare harmful effects have been reported in people with serious physical or mental health conditions. Spinal manipulation is a technique in which practitioners use their hands or a device to apply a controlled force to a joint of the spine. Chiropractors or other health professionals may use this technique. Spinal manipulation is frequently used for headaches. However, it’s uncertain whether manipulation is helpful because studies have had contradictory results. Side effects from spinal manipulation can include temporary headaches, tiredness, or discomfort in the area that was manipulated. There have been rare reports of strokes occurring after manipulation of the upper (cervical) spine, but whether manipulation actually caused the strokes is unclear. Tai chi, which originated in China, combines with slow, graceful movements, deep breathing, and relaxation. One small randomized study has evaluated tai chi for tension headaches. Some evidence of improvements in headache status and health-related quality of life was found among patients on the tai chi program compared to others on a wait list. These data are too limited to draw meaningful conclusions about whether this practice is helpful for tension headaches. Tai chi is generally considered to be a safe practice. Several dietary supplements have been studied for headaches, particularly for migraine prevention. In 2012, the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society issued evidence-based guidelines that classified certain dietary supplements as “effective,” “probably effective,” or “possibly effective” in preventing migraines. Their findings regarding effectiveness of specific supplements are summarized in the next sections. Also included are brief summaries of evidence on the safety and side effects of each supplement. In their guidelines for migraine prevention, the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society concluded that butterbur is effective and should be offered to patients with migraine to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks. The most common side effects of butterbur are belching and other mild digestive tract symptoms. Raw butterbur extracts contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which can cause liver damage and cancer. Extracts of butterbur that are almost completely free from these alkaloids are available. It is uncertain whether butterbur products, including reduced-alkaloid products, are safe for prolonged use. Coenzyme Q10 is an antioxidant that cells need to function properly. It’s available as a and has been studied for a variety of purposes. The guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society say that coenzyme Q10 is possibly effective and may be considered for migraine prevention. No serious side effects of coenzyme Q10 have been reported. It may interact with some medications, including the anticoagulant (blood-thinning) medication warfarin (Coumadin). The guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society say that a specific feverfew extract called MIG-99 is probably effective and should be considered for migraine prevention. Side effects of feverfew may include joint aches, digestive disturbances, and mouth ulcers. It may interact with anticoagulants (blood thinners) and some other medications. Feverfew is not safe for use during pregnancy. Its long-term safety has not been established. Magnesium deficiency is related to factors that promote headaches, and people who get migraines may have lower levels of magnesium in their bodies than those who do not. The guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society say that magnesium is probably effective and should be considered for migraine prevention. Magnesium supplements can cause diarrhea and may interact with some medications. Because the amounts of magnesium people take for migraines are greater than the Tolerable Upper Intake Level for this mineral (the largest amount that’s likely to be safe for almost everyone), magnesium supplements for migraine should be used only under the supervision of a health care provider. The American Academy of Neurology and American Headache Society’s guidelines say that riboflavin is probably effective and should be considered for migraine prevention. Riboflavin has minimal side effects, but it can cause an intense yellow discoloration of the urine. NCCIH is supporting several studies of complementary health approaches for headaches. A study of for migraine that includes measurement of brain changes with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) A combined analysis of many studies of acupuncture for various types of pain, including headaches Most dietary supplements have not been tested in pregnant women, nursing mothers, or children. If you’re pregnant or nursing a child, or if you’re considering giving a child a dietary supplement, consult your (or your child’s) health care provider. Be aware that some dietary supplements may interact with conventional medical treatments. If you’re considering a practitioner-provided complementary health practice such as biofeedback or acupuncture, ask a trusted source (such as your health care provider or nearby hospital) to recommend a practitioner.

Division of Extramural Research Sponsored by NCCIHDivision of Intramural Research Conducted at NCCIH Training Grant Application, Review, and Award Process Complementary, Alternative, or Integrative Health: What’s In a Name? Complementary, Alternative, or Integrative Health: What’s In a Name? We’ve all seen the words “complementary,” “alternative,” and “integrative,” but what do they really mean? This fact sheet looks into these terms to help you understand them better and gives you a brief picture of the mission and role of the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) in this area of research. The terms “complementary,” “alternative,” and “integrative” are continually evolving, along with the field, but the descriptions of these terms below are how we at NIH currently define them. According to a 2012 national survey, many Americans—more than 30 percent of adults and about 12 percent of children—use health care approaches that are not typically part of conventional medical care or that may have origins outside of usual Western practice. When describing these approaches, people often use “alternative” and “complementary” interchangeably, but the two terms refer to different concepts: If a non-mainstream practice is used conventional medicine, it’s considered “complementary.” If a non-mainstream practice is used conventional medicine, it’s considered “alternative.” Most people who use non-mainstream approaches also use conventional health care. In additional to complementary and alternative, you may also hear the term “functional medicine.” This term sometimes refers to a concept similar to integrative health (described below), but it may also refer to an approach that more closely resembles (a medical system that has evolved from a combination of traditional practices and health care approaches popular in Europe during the 19th century). Integrative health care often brings conventional and complementary approaches together in a coordinated way. It emphasizes a holistic, patient-focused approach to health care and wellness—often including mental, emotional, functional, spiritual, social, and community aspects—and treating the whole person rather than, for example, one organ system. It aims for well-coordinated care between different providers and institutions. The use of integrative approaches to health and wellness has grown within care settings across the United States. Researchers are currently exploring the potential benefits of integrative health in a variety of situations, including pain management for military personnel and veterans, relief of symptoms in cancer patients and survivors, and programs to promote healthy behaviors. Integrative Approaches for Pain Management for Military Personnel and Veterans Chronic pain is a common problem among active-duty military personnel and veterans. NCCIH, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other agencies are sponsoring research to see whether integrative approaches can help. For example: An NCCIH-funded study is developing an innovative, collaborative treatment model involving chiropractors, primary care providers, and mental health providers for veterans with spine pain and related mental health conditions. Other NCCIH-funded studies are testing the effects of adding mindfulness meditation, self-hypnosis, or other complementary approaches to pain management programs for veterans. The goal is to help patients feel and function better and reduce their need for pain medicines that can have serious side effects. For more information on pain management for military personnel and veterans, see NCCIH’s Complementary Health Practices for U.S. Military, Veterans, and Families webpage. Integrative Approaches for Symptom Management in Cancer Patients and Survivors Cancer treatment centers with integrative health care programs may offer services such as acupuncture and meditation to help manage symptoms and side effects for patients who are receiving conventional cancer treatment. Although research on the potential value of these integrative programs is in its early stages, some studies have had promising results. For example, NCCIH-funded research has suggested that: Massage therapy may lead to short-term improvements in pain and mood in patients with advanced cancer. Yoga may relieve the persistent fatigue that some women experience after breast cancer treatment, according to the results of a preliminary study. Tai chi or qi gong have shown promise for managing symptoms such as fatigue, sleep difficulty, and depression in cancer survivors. For more information, see . Integrative Approaches and Health-Related Behaviors Healthy behaviors, such as eating right, getting enough physical activity, and not smoking, can reduce people’s risks of developing serious diseases. Research is looking at whether complementary and integrative approaches may have a role in promoting healthy behaviors. For example: Preliminary research suggests that yoga and meditation-based therapies may help smokers quit. In a study funded by the National Cancer Institute, complementary health practitioners (chiropractors, acupuncturists, and massage therapists) were successfully trained to provide evidence-based smoking cessation interventions to their patients. An NCCIH-funded study is testing whether a mindfulness-based program that involves the whole family can improve weight loss and eating behavior in overweight adolescents. For more information, see the NCCIH and webpages. Complementary health approaches include natural products and mind and body practices. This group includes a variety of products, such as (also known as botanicals), , and . They are widely marketed, readily available to consumers, and often sold as . According to the 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which included a comprehensive survey on the use of complementary health approaches by Americans, 17.7 percent of American adults had used a dietary supplement other than vitamins and minerals in the past year. These products were the most popular complementary health approach in the survey. (See chart.) The most commonly used natural product was fish oil. Researchers have done large, rigorous studies on a few natural products, but the results often showed that the products didn’t work for the conditions studied. Research on others is in progress. While there are indications that some may be helpful, more needs to be learned about the effects of these products in the human body, and about their and potential and other natural products. Mind and body practices include a large and diverse group of procedures or techniques administered or taught by a trained practitioner or teacher. The 2012 NHIS showed that and are among the most popular mind and body practices used by adults. According to the , the popularity of yoga has grown dramatically in recent years, from 9.5 percent of U.S. adults practicing yoga in 2012 to 14.3 percent in 2017. The 2017 NHIS also showed that the use of meditation increased more than threefold from 4.1 percent in 2012 to 14.2 percent in 2017. Other mind and body practices include (such as breathing exercises, guided imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation), , Feldenkrais method, Alexander technique, Pilates, Rolfing Structural Integration, and Trager psychophysical integration. The amount of research on mind and body approaches varies widely depending on the practice. For example, researchers have done many studies on acupuncture, yoga, spinal manipulation, and meditation, but there have been fewer studies on some other practices. Some complementary approaches may not neatly fit into either of these groups—for example, the practices of traditional healers, , , , , and. NCCIH is the Federal Government’s lead agency for scientific research on complementary and integrative health approaches. The mission of NCCIH is to define, through rigorous scientific investigation, the usefulness and safety of complementary and integrative health interventions and their roles in improving health and health care. NCCIH’s vision is that scientific evidence informs decision making by the public, by health care professionals, and by health policymakers regarding the use and integration of complementary and integrative health approaches.

Best-known are those among the rich and famous who have faced a cancer diagnosis and chose treatment beyond the pale of conventional medicine.  Among those who have tried alternative protocols include actors, presidents, and technology geniuses. As with any cancer treatment – conventional or alternative – there are no guarantees, but it does raise the interesting question of why. Why, with advances in conventional medical technology, would those with the most exceptional healthcare access choose to look outside the box? What's interesting is how this may or may not have influenced conventional medicine to begin rethinking how they view the treatment of cancer. For instance, an industry that used to destroy the immune system with chemotherapy now recognizes that building the immune system and overall health aids in the efficacy of conventional treatments. In more recent years, it's come to replace the old methods, as was the case with President Jimmy Carter. His melanoma was treated exclusively with immunotherapy-, an approach holistic medicine has been touting for years.  breast cancerconventional and alternative medicine 30-year survivor The co-star opposite John Travolta in the musical has been battling breast cancer for nearly 30 years. During those three decades, she's learned not to rely solely on the advice and treatments of conventional medicine.  Diagnosed in 1992, Newton-John had the entire arsenal of cancer assault mechanisms known to conventional medicine – mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation, and hormone therapy. Her cancer returned twice since, and she has decided against chemotherapy. And while Newton-John has incorporated radiation into her regimen, she's also emphasized a more holistic approach to what is now Stage IV cancer. By integrating holistic medicine practices, she's helped strengthen immunity, fight pain, and, she hopes, kill cancer. These alternative treatments include extracts from cannabis and certain mushrooms, , Vitamin D, and high doses of . Newton-John has since opened the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness & Research Centre in Heidelberg, Australia. Patients receive an integrative approach to cancer treatment that incorporates conventional treatment with holistic practices. uterine cancer radical hysterectomy combined with an integrative approach cancer-free The Jewish-American actress with the distinctive voice is famous twice: first for her semi-autobiographical show and then for her resolute response to a cancer diagnosis. During her final season of in 1999, Drescher was beginning a new season of life and starting a new journey with her health.   Eventually recognized by doctors as uterine cancer, her condition was addressed as peri-menopausal. This misdiagnosis delayed the treatment she needed while subjecting her body to treatments she did not need. When she finally emerged from this long dark period of her life – which included a radical hysterectomy – Drescher found herself with a story to tell and a movement to lead. Her experience led to writing a book, Cancer Schmancer, and launching a foundation by the same name.   Her celebrity became her platform not to raise money for foundations or institutions but rather to encourage reform in the way American's treated their health. She's using her platform to help people battle cancer before it begins by addressing lifestyle changes – diet, exercise, stress level, etc. She supports a holistic view of medical care, strengthening the body to fight for itself rather than relying solely on what she calls the American “sick care system.” breast cancerlumpectomy, radiation, complementary/alternative medicine cancer-free Following Suzanne Somers' breast cancer diagnosis in 2001, she addressed it the way most women do – surgery to remove tumors and radiation to zap the remaining cancer cells. But she decided against chemotherapy. Instead of decimating her immune system, she decided to strengthen her body's natural defenses. The approach allowed her to weaken and kill cancer cells lurking in the shadows. She turned to a little-known drug called Iscador, a mistletoe extract that's shown in studies to kill cancer and bolster immunities.  Through the years since her diagnosis, the Three's Company star has interviewed dozens of patients and doctors about cancer prevention through diet, detox, and natural cancer treatment protocols. She details her findings in the book skin cancer and colon cancer surgery plus supplementation and potential oxygen therapy full recovery; died of pneumonia in 2004 The 40th President of the United States was famously diagnosed with bouts of skin cancer, which he had surgically removed. And then, amid The Cold War tensions between the United States and Russia, President Reagan faced a threat from the inside. Inside his colon. Doctors identified and removed a cancerous polyp to prevent spread.   So just weeks into his second term, surgeons resected two feet of The Gipper's large intestine. What isn't as widely known about the POTUS is that he decided against chemotherapy or radiation.  There are reports that Reagan received intravenous treatments of laetrile, a compound also known as Amygdalin found in the seeds of apricots and other fruits. Reagan also may have received oxygen therapy.  melanoma immunotherapy cancer-free In 2015 Jimmy Carter sought treatment for metastatic melanoma using immune mechanisms that the natural cancer treatment community has highlighted for decades. Utilizing the immunotherapy drug Keytruda, doctors made Carter's natural immune defenses “smarter” and more precise in attacking the abnormal cell growth in his brain and liver. Only a handful of years ago, conventional medicine would have performed a widespread annihilation of Carter's immune system while trying to wipe out cancer with chemical warfare and radiation.  At 91 years old, Carter likely would not have even survived conventional cancer treatment – let alone cancer he was trying to treat. Now the mainstream medical community is developing and patenting drugs to strengthen and enhance the immune system. These modalities allow the body to fight without chemicals and procedures that would weaken its natural defenses. Natural formulations like Beta 1 3D Beta Glucan and other natural immune-enhancing supplements have worked effectively by similarly helping the immune system target foreign bodies, including abnormal cell growth. Immunotherapy in modern oncology is an encouraging development that affirms at least some practices of holistic medicine. The approach signals a turning point for conventional methods that historically have been governed more by industrial modalities than by health-focused innovation. prostate cancer cannabis living The Chong half of the 1970s comedy duo Cheech & Chong, Tommy Chong, says prison gave him prostate cancer, and his reason for jail time, in part, provided what he has called the cure. In 2003 he served 9 months for selling pot pipes and says he can trace his slow-growing prostate cancer to his time in prison.  “I was totally healthy when I went in jail … and then while I was in jail, I was clean as a whistle, and I started having problems with my prostate,” he said in an interview with CNN. “So, yeah, I think I got [cancer] there.” When he was diagnosed with the disease several years later, the then 74-year-old said he had given up smoking marijuana. But then he started using the plant in the form of suppositories to “treat” his cancer.  Whatever Chong's motive in utilizing cannabis during his battle with cancer, the actor might have benefited himself in the fight. Some studies have shown that cannabinoids, chemicals found in cannabis, might program specific prostate cancer cells to stop growing and multiplying.    pancreatic cancer lifestyle and diet changes, surgery, cutting-edge DNA sequencing survived for 8 years; died in 2011. The illustrious mind behind Apple Inc. is perhaps viewed with the most medical suspicion among the many celebrities to address their cancer diagnosis with unconventional treatments. Jobs undoubtedly is among the best known of these celebrities, in part because of the lengthy Walter Isaacson biography that detailed Jobs' diagnosis, subsequent treatment plans, and final years of life. And because of his illness, he also very visibly stepped down from his responsibilities as CEO of the most innovative tech company in history.  So why would this technological genius eschew the medical technology available at the time to treat him? As he did with most areas of his life, Steve Jobs approached his diet and health in somewhat quirky ways. While working at Atari, for instance, he reportedly denounced daily showers and deodorant, believing that his diet would keep him from needing those conventional hygiene regimens. So in 2003, when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer while being scanned for kidney stones, he followed the path he'd followed most of his life: the road less traveled. Instead of pursuing the conventional route of surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy, Jobs attacked his diagnosis by strengthening his body's ability to fight cancer. But this was not a haphazard decision. After all, the rare form of pancreatic cancer – islet cell carcinoma – was slow-growing and highly treatable. He consulted with some of the best medical minds available. Still, he concluded that he would aggressively change his lifestyle instead of being cut open or zapped. About a recommended surgical procedure, he told one confidante: “I really didn't want them to open up my body.”  It's easy to suggest that Jobs was just stubborn in his initial refusal of conventional medical treatments. His stubbornness and individuality branched into every decision he made. He also weighed the detriment of gambling with chemicals and surgery and the limits they might place on his ability to perform at optimal levels for whatever years he had left.  There are few details available about exactly what Jobs did during the months that he treated his cancer. He was a relatively private man, but a few things are clear. The lifelong adherent to a mostly plant-based diet became even more restrictive in his veganism and added to this discipline a regular intake of herbs, botanicals, and juices. He visited acupuncturists and also explored the spiritual side of physical healing. Nine months into this treatment, a scan revealed his tumor had grown and had likely moved outside the pancreas. Perhaps he was disappointed, but he wasn't defeated. He finally went in for the recommended surgery to have the tumor removed. Then he turned his attention and vast resources to pursuing cutting edge, experimental treatments through MIT and Harvard. Among the testing was genetic sequencing of the tumor to treat it at the molecular level.    “I'm either going to be one of the first to be able to outrun a cancer like this, or I'm going to be one of the last to die from it,” Jobs told Isaacson in early 2011. “Either among the first to make it to share or the last to get dumped.” ovarian cancer sought alternative treatment in Mexico died in 2005 After fighting alongside husband Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the struggle for civil rights, Coretta Scott King faced a battle with ovarian cancer in 2005. The diagnosis came while recovering from a stroke. Doctors in the United States gave her very little hope for successful treatment through conventional medicine. So, she traveled to a clinic in Mexico, hoping alternative medical options might provide more promise.  Sadly, Mrs. King was unable to make it to the treatment given the advanced stage of her diagnosis and other health issues. She passed away at the clinic in 2005. mesothelioma holistic treatment, immunotherapy, surgery died from pulmonary embolism After making his film debut in 1953, Hollywood Legend Steve McQueen would go on to star in dozens of successful films and television shows. For more than two decades, McQueen made a name for himself as a rugged, tough guy on screen and in the Hollywood hills. In 1979, doctors detected a cancerous mass on his lungs. McQueen's military career exposed him to asbestos, and a reported two-pack-per-day cigarette habit contributed to the mesothelioma that set up in his lungs. McQueen and his medical team determined no conventional medical intervention could treat his cancer. He sought the opinion of alternative medicine practitioners, including a clinic in Juarez, Mexico.  At the clinic, he was on a regimen of organic foods, high doses of vitamins, and intramuscular injection of animal cells. These increased the production of interferon, a protein that enables the body's natural defenses to ward off viruses and, presumably, fight cancer.  Already weak from aggressive cancer, McQueen was recovering after surgery to remove a cancerous mass pressing on his lungs. He suffered an embolism that took his life less than one year after diagnosis. anal cancer variety of conventional and alternative treatments short remission but eventual death in 2009 In 2006 the star was diagnosed with Anal Cancer, a form of cancer caused by an anal infection of HPV (Human Papilloma Virus). Fawcett's cancer went into remission following conventional treatment. But then cancer returned, so she turned to alternative therapies available in Germany. Trying to avoid surgery that would require the use of a colostomy bag, she made six trips to Germany for treatments. Unfortunately, the disease spread to her liver during this time, and treatments became ineffective. She died of cancer in 2009. cancer and other health issuesaggressive holistic diet and removal of toxins cancer survivor of more than 30 years More than 30 years ago, Sharyn Wynters' life took a sharp turn after receiving some dire news about her health. She'd been Miss Pennsylvania, played a role in the original television series, and was a successful fashion model. But then, in her 20s and with her career on the rise, she became a cancer patient. Doctors painted a grim portrait of her future as they described the disease. Wynters, however, did not take this news with resignation. Instead, the career detour became a destination. Instead of taking the absolute word of conventional medicine, Wynters was empowered to take control of the diagnosis. She began removing toxinsA poison made by certain bacteria, plants, or animals, including insects. from her household, cosmetics, clothing, foods, and even from the fillings in her teeth. Through whole-food and toxin-free living, Wynters saw her health slowly improve as she held cancer at bay. During the course of recovery, she was immersed in the study of complementary medicine and became a practitioner herself, empowering others to take control of their health. Hodgkin's lymphoma 2010 vegan diet, aggressive lifestyle changes, complementary medicinesurvivor of more than a decade At the height of her career, actress Lourdes Reynolds already had appeared in multiple television series and had recently landed an acting role on the CBS series . But in 2010, she also was diagnosed with Stage IV Hodgkin's Lymphoma. She was given two options by her doctors: A) do nothing and let the cancer run its course or B) submit to conventional treatments that could include chemotherapy or radiation. Reynolds decided to pursue her own option: C) strengthen her own body’s ability to fight back by changing her lifestyle and her diet. But instead of battling cancer behind the scenes and behind closed doors, Reynolds and her husband decided this battle was important to show the world, documenting step by step along the way of her treatment and recovery. The documentaries and chronicle Reynolds' life before cancer and the bold decision to forego conventional medicine. She armed herself with knowledge about gene expressions, the mechanisms by which cancer “turns on.” She discovered research about the relationship between environment, diet, and lifestyle and the activation of certain gene expressions that produce abnormal cell growth. Through her vegan diet and a number of other radical changes in her day to day living, Reynolds has been successful in warding off what was once a death sentence. prostate cancer holistic medicine and dietary modifications lived for 10 years after diagnosis A popular radio talkshow host of more than four decades, Don Imus was no stranger to controversy. And when diagnosed with Stage II prostate cancer in 2009, he embraced the controversy of a treatment regimen that veered away from conventional radiation, chemotherapy, or surgery in favor of a holistic approach. Imus had struggled with alcoholism and had, in his final years, also suffered from emphysema. He had adopted a vegetarian diet in the early 1990s. Following his cancer diagnosis, he added such dietary items as habanero peppers and Japanese soy supplements. For more than a decade Imus and his wife had hosted children with cancer at their New Mexico ranch, where these kids did manual labor and ultimately competed in a rodeo. Perhaps he decided that he’d rather fight cancer on his own terms – the way one might tame a horse, an animal Imus had both cherished and been injured by through the years. After 10 years, though, Imus succumbed to cancer in combination with other health issues. breast cancer both conventional and complementary cancer survivor When Angie Lima was diagnosed at 33 with breast cancer, she recalled stories of the grandfather she never met. He died of lung cancer before Angie was born. The chemotherapy and radiation he underwent ravaged and weakened his body; she vowed never to subject herself to these types of toxic treatment regimens. As an avid and health-conscious athlete, Angie faced her diagnosis the way she faced any competitive challenge – with full attention and vigor. She pursued every possible holistic treatment possibility. This, of course, included a strict whole-food diet and incorporating essential oils, herbs, and other non-conventional treatments. Eventually, though, she did use a number of other therapies including hypnotherapy, chemotherapy, IV therapy, immunotherapy, light therapy, and ultimately a mastectomy. She also maintains a strong faith in God as the ultimate healer of any disease. Her cancer journey is chronicled in the documentary .

6498c018-5dee-4196-b596-c2ac253733d8,"Holistic Healing and Energy Flow in the Body Note: As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases. Four aspects of being relate to the four elements: spirit (fire), thoughts (air), emotions (water), physical (earth). Holistic healing addresses the underlying causes of illness or disease from the perspective of the whole person as opposed to addressing the symptoms only. This type of healing incorporates the concept of —the idea that the whole is more than merely the sum of its parts.  Thus, holistic medicine is a system of healing therapeutics, typically outside mainstream scientific medicine, which might involve various modalities such as naturopathy, homeopathy, psychotherapy, nutrition therapy, as well as various stress relief aids. You might be wondering what constitutes a “whole person” anyway? This term will obviously mean different things to different people, but I think most people will agree that we all experience life in at least four different aspects of being. The four key aspects of being include the spiritual (fire), mental (air), emotional (water), and physical (earth). According to quantum physics, the essence of all life is energy. This is not theory; it is fact.  We also know that to a large degree, whether energy flows freely within us or not determines our health, happiness, success, and longevity. Thus, blockages in the physical body, the psyche, or even the spirit can lead to disturbances in the natural energy flow in the body.  According to ancient Chinese medicine, these blockages of energy, in the most simplistic terms, are the cause of disease. The flow of energy in our physical body has a lot to do with water. Since most adult bodies are composed of at least 70% water, it is easy to understand how important it is to stay hydrated. Just think of the difference between a flowing stream of water in the mountains compared to a stagnant pool of water that is drying up. The flowing stream is clean and charged with electrical energy, whereas the stagnant water is dirty and harbors unhealthy microorganisms. When our bodies are dehydrated, the tissues become dry, the colon becomes constipated, the blood becomes sticky and thicker, and cells do not get adequate hydration, nutrients, and oxygenation. Water is a solvent and the primary means of transport in the body. Water regulates all functions of the body, including the activity of the solutes it carries throughout the body. Water delivers key nutrients, enzymes, hormones and other essential substances to tissue and cells, and adequate water is needed to safely and effectively remove toxins through the processes of detoxification.  This means that we need to be  on a daily basis to stay hydrated and to facilitate movement and energy flow in the physical body. Medical researchers estimate that about 80 percent of all doctor visits are stress related!  The stress response in the body often arises out of habitual patterns of thinking that create undesirable emotions such as anxiety, depression, unhappiness, fear, and agitation.  These emotions, in turn, produce chemical messengers in the body that wreak havoc at the cellular level and decrease immunity. As human beings, we cannot escape stress, but we can manage stress factors through lifestyle choices and retrain our minds to perceive stressors and life challenges differently. Thus, a holist healing approach will incorporate various modalities to support the body’s response to stress, or even to help change levels of self-awareness, limited perspectives, unhealthy relationships or deep-seated psychological issues. The spiritual aspect of holistic healing is not determined so much by religious beliefs as it is by one’s inner sense of purpose and oneness with life.  Some define that life as Love or God or Spirit or Universal Light. Whatever we call it, the spiritual connection for many is at the core of one’s “wholeness” or sense of well being. I believe ALL healing naturally spirals outward from the spiritual center of being, through our thoughts and feelings, and finally into the physical body. From the holistic health perspective, if we are truly looking for healing, the first place to look is within.  The current medical term for this type of guided introspection, which is being used at a few well-known cancer clinics, is psycho-spiritual therapy. From my experience, I surmise that the psycho-spiritual aspect contributes at least 75 to 80 percent to one’s health—and yet it is largely ignored!  The remaining 20 to 25 percent is the physical aspect, which involves focusing primarily on removing toxins and giving the body the essential nutrients it needs to do what it does best—to thrive. In summary, the holistic healing approach is not a quick fix and thus it’s probably not for everyone.  It’s for people who are willing to take responsibility for their health and are looking for long-lasting results. A qualified holistic health practitioner can help guide someone on their journey and provide valuable resources.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied.

What is the history of the discovery and use of the Gerson therapy as a complementary or alternative treatment for cancer? The Gerson therapy was named after Dr. Max B. Gerson (1881-1959), who first used it to treat his migraine headaches. In the 1930's, Dr. Gerson’s therapy became known to the public as a treatment for a type of (TB). The Gerson therapy was later used to treat other including cancer. What is the theory behind the claim that the Gerson therapy is useful in treating cancer? The Gerson therapy is based on the idea that cancer develops when there are changes in cell metabolism because of the buildup of toxic substances in the body. Dr. Gerson said the disease process makes more toxins and the becomes overworked. According to Dr. Gerson, people with cancer also have too much sodium and too little potassium in the cells in their bodies, which causes damage and weakened . The goal of the Gerson therapy is to restore the body to health by repairing the liver and returning the metabolism to its normal state. According to Dr. Gerson, this can be done by removing toxins from the body and building up the with diet and supplements. The enemas are said to widen the of the liver so toxins can be released. According to Dr. Gerson, the liver is further overworked as the treatment breaks down cancer cells and rids the body of toxins. are given to decrease the demands on the weakened liver and to make enzymes for . An organic diet and are used to boost the immune system and support the body as the regimen cleans the body of toxins. Foods low in sodium and high in potassium are said to help correct the tissue damage caused by having too much sodium in the cells. The Gerson therapy requires that the many details of its treatment plan be followed exactly. Some key parts of the regimen include the following: Drinking 13 glasses of juice a day. The juice must be freshly made from organic fruits and vegetables and be taken once every hour. Eating vegetarian meals of organically grown fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Taking a number of supplements, including: Lugol's Solution (potassium iodide, , and water). with . (The original regimen used crude liver instead of coenzyme Q10.) Taking or enemas regularly to remove toxins from the body. Preparing food without salt, spices, or oils, and without using cookware or utensils. Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using the Gerson therapy? No results of or have been published in journals. Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of the Gerson therapy been conducted? Most of the published information on the use of the Gerson therapy reports on (reviews of past cases). Dr. Gerson published (detailed reports of the , treatment, and of individual patients) of 50 of his patients. He treated several different types of cancer in his practice. The reports include Dr. Gerson's notes, with some of the patients over time. The follow-up was contact with patients by mail or phone and included (incomplete descriptions of the medical and treatment histories of one or more patients). In 1947 and 1959, the (NCI) reviewed the cases of a total of 60 patients treated by Dr. Gerson. The NCI found that the available information did not prove the regimen had benefit. The following studies of the Gerson therapy were published: In 1983-1984, a retrospective study of 38 patients treated with the Gerson therapy was done. Medical records were not available to the authors of the study; information came from patient interviews. These case reviews did not provide information that supports the usefulness of the Gerson therapy for treating cancer. In 1990, a study of a diet regimen similar to the Gerson therapy was done in Austria. The patients received along with the special diet. The authors of the study reported that the diet appeared to help patients live longer than usual and have fewer . The authors said it needed further study. In 1995, the Gerson Research Organization did a retrospective study of their patients who were treated with the Gerson therapy. The study reported that patients who had or lived longer than usual for patients with these of melanoma. There have been no that support the findings of this retrospective study. A case review of 6 patients with who used the Gerson therapy reported that the regimen helped patients in some ways, both physically and . Based on these results, the reviewers recommended that clinical trials of the Gerson therapy be conducted. Have any side effects or risks been reported from use of the Gerson therapy? Reports of three deaths that may be related to coffee enemas have been published. Taking too many enemas of any kind can cause changes in normal chemistry, chemicals that occur naturally in the body and keep the muscles, heart, and other organs working properly. Is the Gerson therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? The Gerson therapy has not been approved by the for use as a treatment for cancer or any other disease. For most cancer patients, guidelines include eating a well-balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain products. However, general guidelines such as these may have to be changed to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Patients should talk with their about an appropriate diet to follow.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery.

They have been used to treat other health also, including , , and diseases. Flor Essence is reported to contain the same 4 herbs found in Essiac plus these 4 other herbs: Different batches of these mixtures may contain different ingredients or amounts and the effects may not always be the same. Essiac and Flor Essence are sold worldwide as health tonics or herbal . One company sells Flor Essence and several companies make and sell mixtures called Essiac. This summary refers to the trademarked (brand name) mixtures only. What is the history of the discovery and use of Essiac and Flor Essence as complementary or alternative treatments for cancer? A in Canada first began to promote Essiac as a cancer treatment in the 1920s. Today, Essiac and Flor Essence may be sold as herbal supplements as long as they do not claim to treat or cancer. In 1922, a patient gave the Essiac formula to the nurse and said it had cured her disease. The patient said the formula came from an Ontario Ojibwa Native American medicine man. In 1934, the nurse opened a cancer clinic in Ontario and gave Essiac to patients free of charge. In 1938, the Royal Cancer Commission of Canada visited the clinic but found little evidence that Essiac was effective. The nurse closed the clinic in 1942 but continued to give Essiac to patients until the late 1970s. Between 1959 and the late 1970s, the nurse worked with an American doctor to study Essiac in the laboratory and in people and to promote its use. They also created the formula now called Flor Essence. The results of their studies were not reported in any . Most journals have experts who review research reports before they are published, to make sure that the evidence and conclusions are sound. This is called peer review. Studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals are considered to be better evidence. In 1977, the nurse gave the formula for Essiac to a company in Canada. In 1978, the government of Canada allowed this company to do (research studies with people) on the safety and effectiveness of Essiac. In 1982, it withdrew its permission (see ). This company tried to have Essiac approved as a by the (FDA), but did not get approval. In the 1980s, companies making Essiac-like products began to sell the mixtures as health tonics. Because these companies did not make claims that it would treat or cure certain diseases, Essiac did not come under laws that regulate it as a drug. What is the theory behind the claim that Essiac and Flor Essence are useful in treating cancer? Supporters of Essiac and Flor Essence say that when the herbs they contain are mixed in exact amounts, the mixtures make the stronger, have effects (decrease swelling, redness, and pain), and show anticancer activity. Individual herbs in the Essiac and Flor Essence formulas have been shown to have these effects, but some of these herbs also have been shown to help cancer grow. Some supporters of Essiac recommend that (such as and ) not be used at the same time as Essiac because that may prevent Essiac from being effective. There is no evidence reported in to show that the exact formulas of Essiac and Flor Essence are effective in patients with cancer or other health conditions, or that conventional therapies interfere with the effects of Essiac. See the health professional summary on for more information on theory. Essiac and Flor Essence are taken (by mouth) as herbal teas. According to the companies that make the teas, the proper of Essiac depends on why a person is taking it. The maker recommends that Essiac be taken for 12 weeks in a row. The maker of Flor Essence states that adults may take between 30 and 360 (1 to 12 ) of Flor Essence tea a day, depending on individual needs, and may take it on an ongoing basis. The makers of Essiac and Flor Essence state that the products can be used with other . Some supporters of Essiac, however, recommend that patients avoid any other anticancer therapy (such as or ) when taking Essiac, because it may interfere with immune system function and prevent Essiac from working effectively. Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using Essiac or Flor Essence? Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a , procedure, or treatment is likely to be useful in humans. Animal are used to learn how a cancer may and to test new treatments. These are done before any testing in humans is begun. The following and of Essiac have been reported: In the mid 1970s, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York City tested dried and liquid samples of Essiac in 8 experiments involving the S–180 mouse tumor model (a type of used to study treatment). Researchers found that Essiac did not make the immune system more active and did not act as an anticancer drug. In the early 1980s, researchers at MSKCC tested Essiac again. They found no anticancer activity after doing 17 studies that used a variety of animal models and other tumor models. In 1983, the (NCI) tested a liquid sample of Essiac in the mouse P388 system but found no anticancer activity. Very high of Essiac killed the test animals. Scientists, however, do not know how this finding applies to people who take more than the maker's recommended doses of Essiac. In 2004, a laboratory study at Indiana University-Purdue University reported that Essiac slowed the growth of . Studies of Flor Essence have shown differing results: Two laboratory studies reported that Flor Essence made tumor cells grow. Another laboratory study reported that high doses of both Flor Essence and Essiac herbal teas reduced the growth of cancer cells. A 2004 animal study of Flor Essence found that it increased tumor growth in rats. Laboratory and animal studies have reported on the effects of some of the found in the different herbs used to make Essiac and Flor Essence. These studies report that certain chemicals may: Have an effect on the body similar to the . It is not known if taking Essiac and Flor Essence products can give humans enough of the chemicals that produce these effects. Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of Essiac or Flor Essence been conducted? No results of clinical studies (research studies with people) of Flor Essence have been reported. In addition, no reports of of Essiac have been reported in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Brief descriptions of one incomplete clinical trial and one review of reports on cancer patients who took Essiac have been published, however. In 1978, the Canadian government gave permission to a Canadian company to begin studying Essiac for safety and effectiveness. In 1982, the government withdrew its permission after it found that the company was not keeping all batches of Essiac exactly the same and was not following the proper rules for clinical trials. A review of data from this incomplete study showed no clear evidence of improved in cancer patients who took Essiac. Findings also showed that Essiac was not (harmful). In the early 1980s, the Canadian government reviewed information on 86 cancer patients who had taken Essiac. This was a review of case summaries written by the doctors; the original patient records were not reviewed. The researchers reported that it was not clear if changes in the patients’ conditions were caused by Essiac or something else. Have any side effects or risks been reported from Essiac or Flor Essence? The only reported caused by Essiac are and . According to the company making Flor Essence, side effects may include increased movements, frequent , swollen , skin blemishes, flu-like , and slight headaches. Is Essiac or Flor Essence approved by the FDA for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? The (FDA) has not approved Essiac or Flor Essence to treat cancer or any other medical condition. Companies sell Essiac and Flor Essence as health tonics or herbal dietary supplements, which the FDA regulates as foods, not drugs. Dietary supplements are products meant to be added to the . They are not drugs and are not meant to treat, prevent, or cure diseases.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research.

(NDV) is a that is of interest because it (makes copies of itself) more quickly in human than in most normal human cells and because it can kill these (see ). NDV can be used to directly kill cancer cells, or it can be given as a . Cancer vaccines cause the body’s natural to seek out and destroy cancer cells (see ). The results of ( with people) of NDV as a cancer treatment have not proved that it works (see ). The has not approved NDV as a treatment for cancer (see ). Questions and Answers About Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is a that causes a deadly in many kinds of birds. In humans, NDV causes mild flu-like or (an infection of the eye that is also called pink eye) and/or (an irritation and swelling of the and the area around it). Like other viruses, NDV infects (called ) and then uses those cells to (make copies of) itself. Researchers are interested in NDV because it replicates itself more quickly in human cells than in most normal human cells and it can kill the host cells. For these reasons, the virus is being studied as a treatment for cancer. What is the history of the discovery and use of Newcastle disease virus as a complementary or alternative treatment for cancer? The first report that NDV may be useful as a cancer treatment was published in 1964. For 20 years before this report, NDV was used in a to prevent Newcastle disease in birds. During that time, it was learned that NDV caused only minor illness in humans. The mild caused by NDV in humans and its ability to replicate up to 10,000 times faster in human cancer cells than in most normal human cells, led researchers to look more closely at NDV as a possible cancer treatment. NDV is now being studied by researchers also. What is the theory behind the claim that Newcastle disease virus is useful in treating cancer? There are many strains of NDV, and they may be either or for human cells. Lytic strains kill the infected cell by damaging its outer (layer of ). Nonlytic strains kill by blocking the basic processes a cell needs to live. Lytic strains of NDV have been studied in humans because they can kill cancer cells directly, but both lytic and nonlytic strains have been used to make vaccines to help the fight cancer. The way NDV is given depends on how the virus is used to target cancer cells. It may be used to directly infect the patient with NDV or to make . Cancer vaccines made with NDV may improve the body’s natural to cancer, causing it to attack and kill more cancer cells than it would if the NDV were not present. Researchers are studying 3 ways of using NDV as a possible cancer treatment: NDV can be directly into the , a muscle, or a (), or into the . The virus can also be . As explained in , NDV infects cells and then replicates itself, creating more copies of the virus that can then infect cells throughout the body. This process targets and kills cancer cells by damaging the cells' outer membranes. vaccines are made using pieces of cancer cell membranes infected with NDV. Oncolysate-based vaccines are injected under or into the skin. are made using whole tumor cells infected with NDV. The tumor cells used in the vaccine are changed in the laboratory so that they cannot multiply or infect the patient. Whole-cell vaccines with NDV are given only by injection under the skin. Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using Newcastle disease virus? A number of have been done with NDV. Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a , procedure, or treatment is likely to be useful in humans. These preclinical studies are done before any testing in humans is begun. The following has been learned from preclinical studies: NDV replicates more quickly in human cancer cells than in any other type of cell. Some types of NDV are able to directly kill certain types of cancer cells. NDV and NDV-infected cancer cells can cause the immune system to respond in different ways. A few of these studies used human cells, but most used animal cells. Based on these and other laboratory findings, ( with people) using NDV were begun. Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of NDV been conducted? Clinical trials of NDV have been done but have not proven that NDV is effective as a cancer treatment. Some of the trials reported positive results and some did not. Most of the studies enrolled only small numbers of patients who also received . None of the trials published in English were and few were . Randomized clinical trials give the highest level of evidence. In randomized trials, volunteers are assigned randomly (by chance) to one of 2 or more groups that compare different factors related to the treatment. In a controlled clinical trial, one group (called the ) does not receive the new treatment being studied. The control group is then compared to the groups that receive the new treatment, to see if the new treatment works. Randomized controlled trials, enrolling larger numbers of people, are needed to confirm the results of studies done so far on the use of NDV to treat cancer. Clinical trials studying the use of NDV as a cancer treatment have been done in the United States, Canada, China, Germany, and Hungary. Below are brief descriptions of these studies. Four clinical trials in the United States studied the use of NDV oncolysates in patients with . Three of these studies, a and 2 , were by the same group of researchers. Some positive results were found in these studies. The fourth trial was led by different researchers and showed no benefit. The same type of NDV was used to make the vaccines in all 4 studies, but the 2 groups of researchers used different methods to make them. Results from these studies need to be confirmed by randomized controlled trials that enroll larger numbers of people. Two other phase II trials of NDV oncolysates were done in Germany. One of the studies showed that people in the trial had longer when compared with published information on similar patients who were treated with alone. Because these studies were not controlled and the patients received other treatments, it is not clear if it was the treatment with NDV oncolysates that caused the reported. Most of the published clinical studies of whole-cell vaccines with NDV have been done in Germany. The largest reported trial was in China. Most of these studies involved patients with , , , , or . The same type of NDV was used to make the vaccines in all of the studies. Some of these studies found improved disease-free survival or improved in patients treated with whole-cell vaccines. The lack of control groups and other weaknesses in study design and reporting made it unclear if benefits were caused by the whole-cell vaccine or by something else. Overall, the results showed that these vaccines may help the immune system kill more cancer cells during the program but may not provide long-term cancer Studies Involving Infection with NDV (Including MTH-68) Most research on the treatment of cancer by infecting patients with NDV has been done in Hungary, using the NDV strain MTH-68. The published findings include the following types of studies: An (incomplete descriptions of the medical and treatment history of one or more patients). A (a detailed report of the , treatment, and of an individual patient). A small (a group of case reports involving patients who were given similar treatment). According to the researchers, the MTH-68 treatment was helpful for most of the patients in these studies. The number of patients in the studies was small, however, and the patients in the clinical trial were not randomly assigned. The patients also received other treatments. For these reasons, it is not known if the patients were helped by the MTH-68 or by something else. In the United States, a phase I clinical trial tested , another type of NDV. In this trial, 79 patients with advanced cancers that were not helped by were given PV701 by injection into a vein. Some patients had to the treatment, while others did not have any change in their More studies are planned. One major concern is that repeated injections of NDV may cause a person's immune system to form against the virus. These antibodies would prevent NDV from infecting and killing cancer cells. More research is needed to study this. While most studies of NDV in cancer treatment have been small and without control groups, there have been enough promising results to call for continued research. Have any side effects or risks been reported from NDV? The side effects caused by NDV exposure have been mild to moderate. As noted in , NDV causes mild flu-like symptoms, conjunctivitis, and laryngitis in humans. Other side effects vary with how the virus is given. The most commonly reported side effect after treatment with the virus alone is , which usually goes away within 24 hours. In one study, and swelling were seen near some tumors. These may have contributed to the death of one patient. The most common side effects of treatment with NDV-infected whole-cell vaccines are minor: Itching, swelling, and redness of the skin at the injection site. The only negative effect of treatment with the NDV oncolysate vaccine is inflammation at the injection site. Studies that combined treatment with NDV oncolysates or whole-cell vaccines with substances called reported flu-like symptoms, fever, and swelling. The side effects seen in these studies have been linked to the cytokine portion of the treatment.

Cartilage contains called , which are surrounded by (a ) and , which are made of protein and . Products containing cartilage are sold in the United States as . Companies that make cartilage products may not have a process in place to check that all batches they make are exactly the same. This means different batches of a cartilage product may contain different amounts or strengths of ingredients. Different (substances that make loose mixtures stick together) and may be used in different batches. Therefore, the results of a particular may be true only for the batch that was used in the study. What is the history of the discovery and use of cartilage as a complementary or alternative treatment for cancer? Cartilage from cows (bovine cartilage) and sharks has been studied as a treatment for and other medical for more than 30 years. It was once believed that sharks, whose are made mostly from cartilage, do not develop cancer. This caused interest in cartilage as a possible treatment for cancer. Although are rare in sharks, cancers have been found in these animals. Early studies used of bovine cartilage. In the 1960s, it was first reported that bovine cartilage decreased (redness, swelling, pain, and feeling of heat). In the 1970s, it was first reported that bovine cartilage contains a substance that blocks (the forming of new ). If blood vessel growth into a can be blocked, the tumor will stop growing or shrink. In the 1980s, researchers first described and and clinical trials ( in people) testing bovine cartilage as a treatment for cancer. Interest in using shark cartilage grew because it was believed that shark cartilage may be more active than bovine cartilage in preventing new blood vessels from being formed. Since a shark's skeleton is made mostly of cartilage, shark cartilage is more plentiful than bovine cartilage. In the 1980s, it was first published that shark cartilage contains a substance that blocks blood vessel growth. In 1998 and 2005, there were published reports of clinical trials of shark cartilage as a treatment for cancer. (See for more information about the laboratory and animal studies. See for more information about the clinical trials.) What is the theory behind the claim that cartilage is useful in treating cancer? Three theories have been suggested to explain how cartilage acts against cancer: As cartilage is broken down by the body, it releases products that kill cancer cells. Cartilage increases the action of the body’s to kill cancer cells. Cartilage makes substances that block tumor angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels that feed a tumor and help it grow). Based on laboratory and animal studies, the third theory may be most likely. Cartilage does not contain , so cancer cannot easily grow in it. It is suggested that a cancer treatment using cartilage may keep blood vessels from forming in a tumor, causing the tumor to stop growing or shrink. In animal studies, cartilage products have been given by mouth; into a or the ; applied to the skin; or placed in slow-release plastic pellets that were (put into the body). In studies with people, cartilage products have been given by mouth; applied to the skin; injected under the skin; or given by (injected as a liquid into the ). The and length of time the cartilage treatment was given was different for each study, in part because different types of products were used. Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using cartilage? A number of have been done with cartilage. Preclinical studies in a laboratory or using animals are done to find out if a , procedure, or treatment is likely to be safe and useful in humans. These preclinical studies are done before testing in humans is begun. Some research studies are published in journals. Most scientific journals have experts who review research reports before they are published, to make sure that the evidence and conclusions are sound. Preclinical studies of cartilage looked at whether bovine and shark cartilage products can kill cancer cells in the laboratory, make the immune system more active against cancer, and prevent blood vessels from forming. The following have been reported from preclinical studies of the effect of powdered cartilage on cancer cells (outside of the body): In a published laboratory study, a powdered form of bovine cartilage called Catrix slowed the growth of human cancer cells by half or more. It is not clear if Catrix had this effect only on cancer cells, because its effect the growth of normal cells was not tested. It is also not known if the dose used in the laboratory study could safely be used in people. In a published laboratory study of powdered shark cartilage, there was no effect on the growth of human cells (cancer cells that begin in the brain or ). The following have been reported from preclinical studies of the effect of powdered cartilage on the immune system: One published study reported that Catrix injected into mice caused their immune systems to be more active. This effect did not happen when Catrix was given by mouth. A laboratory study on the effect of shark cartilage on a reported an increase in tumor-fighting immune cells in the tumor but not in the . A study on the effect of shark cartilage on immune system response in mice reported a number of different effects, both helpful and harmful. It increased response but decreased the activity of (tumor-fighting . The study also reported a decrease in blood vessel growth. A large number of laboratory and animal studies on the effect of powdered cartilage on angiogenesis have been published. The following have been reported from these studies: Powdered shark cartilage given by mouth to rats decreased the growth of cells. Powdered shark cartilage given by mouth to rats decreased the growth of , a type of brain cancer. Two powdered shark cartilage products (Sharkilage and MIA Shark Powder) given by mouth to mice did not stop the growth or spread of . Three substances that prevent blood vessel growth were found in bovine cartilage. These substances have not shown an effect on the growth of normal cells or tumor cells. Two substances that prevent blood vessel growth were found in shark cartilage. These substances have not shown an effect on the growth of normal cells or tumor cells. The following have been reported from preclinical studies of liquid cartilage products: In a laboratory study, a liquid form of shark cartilage called /Neovastat was reported to stop the growth of a number of cancer cell types. The results have not been published in a scientific journal. Several studies have shown that AE-941/Neovastat blocks the growth of new blood vessels. AE-941/Neovastat given by mouth to mice slowed the growth of cells and the spread of . In the lung cancer study, AE-941/Neovastat increased the effect of the anticancer drug A substance made from human cartilage slowed the spread of cells in an animal study and prevented blood vessel growth in both animal and laboratory studies. Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) been conducted using cartilage? Clinical trials are a type of research study that tests how well new drugs or other treatments work in people. Since the 1970s, there have been at least a dozen of cartilage as a treatment for cancer. There has been one of cartilage as cancer treatment published in a . This trial compared treatment using a form of shark cartilage to treatment using a (an inactive substance that looks the same as, and is given the same way as, the substance being tested). Patients also received . In 83 patients having either breast or advanced , there was no difference in the or between the group that received the shark cartilage product and the group that received the placebo. The following have been reported from clinical trials of powdered cartilage products: (a collection of detailed information about individual patients) of 31 patients who were treated with Catrix by injection and/or by mouth: The cancer went into (signs and of cancer went away) in 19 patients and then (came back) in about half of them. Some of these patients also received standard cancer treatment and there was no (a group of patients who do not receive the treatment being studied, to show if the treatment being studied makes a difference). For these reasons, the effectiveness of cartilage as a cancer treatment is not proven by this case series. A clinical trial of Cartilade by mouth in 60 patients with advanced cancer: All but 1 patient had been treated with standard therapy before the trial. The cancer stopped growing in 10 of the patients for 12 weeks or more and then began to grow again. The cancer did not shrink or go into remission in any of the patients. The following have been reported from clinical trials of liquid cartilage products: A clinical trial of Catrix in 9 patients whose cancers did not to and/or : Catrix was given by injection. One patient's cancer went into remission for more than 39 weeks and the other 8 patients did not respond to treatment with Catrix. Clinical studies on the safety of the liquid shark cartilage product AE-941/Neovastat have reported that it has little harmful effect. A randomized clinical trial studied the effect of AE-941/Neovastat on blood vessel growth related to healing after . This study reported that one of the ingredients that prevents blood vessel growth can be absorbed and used by the body when taken by mouth. A clinical trial of AE-941/Neovastat in 379 patients with advanced reported that there was no difference in how long patients lived between the group receiving the shark cartilage product and compared to the group receiving the placebo and chemoradiotherapy. Both kinds of treatment were well tolerated. For more detailed information about these clinical trials and others that are ongoing or have not fully reported, see the . Have any side effects or risks been reported from cartilage? The of cartilage treatment are usually mild or moderate. The most common side effects of treatment with the bovine cartilage product Catrix include the following: Swelling of the (the sac that contains the ). The most common side effects of treatment with the shark cartilage include the following: A higher than normal level of in the blood. Nausea, vomiting, and upset stomach are the side effects reported most often from treatment with the shark cartilage product AE–941/Neovastat. There has been one report of occurring in a person who used shark cartilage. Is cartilage approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research. Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) facilitates research and evaluation of complementary and alternative practices, and provides information about a variety of approaches to health professionals and the public.

(See .) What is the history of the discovery and use of Cancell as a complementary or alternative treatment for cancer? Cancell was first made in the late 1930s by James V. Sheridan, a who called the mixture Entelev and gave it free to cancer patients. In 1984, another company began making Entelev under the name Cancell. That company gave it free to patients with cancer, (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), and other . What is the theory behind the claim that Cancell is useful in treating cancer? The exact ingredients used to make Cancell are not known. One sample of the liquid mixture Cancell was found to contain 12 different ingredients, none of which is known to be helpful in treating any type of cancer. The (FDA) has listed the following ingredients in Cancell: The first maker of Cancell said the ingredients work together by changing cancer so they are seen by the body as """" and are destroyed. The second maker stated that Cancell changes cancer cells so they “self-” and are replaced by normal cells. The waste matter made by this self-digestion was said to be passed from the body in , sweat, and other body .

Patients taking Cancell were advised by the makers to take to help digestion and to avoid high of and . Makers of Cancell stated that raise the energy of the cell while Cancell lowers it. Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using Cancell? Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a , procedure, or treatment is likely to be useful in humans. These are done before any testing in humans is begun. Some research studies are published in journals. Most scientific journals have experts who review research reports before they are published, to make sure that the evidence and conclusions are sound. This is called peer review. Studies published in are considered to be better evidence. The (NCI) did on Cancell in 1978 and 1980 and in 1990 and 1991. Laboratory studies using human cells concluded that Cancell could not be taken in doses high enough to kill cancer cells in the body. The NCI decided that Cancell did not show enough anticancer activity to continue the studies. See the health professional summary on for details on the results of these studies. The makers of Cancell reported doing animal studies with the liquid mixtures, but none of these studies have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. No information has been given on these studies, beyond stating that some of the studies tested the (harmful and unwanted ) of Cancell. Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) been conducted using Cancell? No of Cancell have been reported. The makers of Cancell have stated that more than 15,000 patients have used the mixture and that it is safe and effective in treating 50% to 80% of all cancers. Their findings have not been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. (information given by people who state that they have been helped by a particular treatment or product) and (incomplete descriptions of the medical and treatment histories of one or more patients) have been made available by the manufacturers. Have any side effects or risks been reported from Cancell? The company that made Cancell stated that the of the mixture include feeling tired during the first few weeks of treatment. is also a reported side effect. One patient who took more than the maker's advised dose reported that lasted for a few hours. Is Cancell approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? Cancell is not approved for use in the United States. In 1989, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration judged Cancell to be a new, unapproved drug. The FDA requested and received a court order making it illegal for manufacturers to send Cancell across state lines.

When is smoked and inhaled, cannabinoids quickly enter the bloodstream. The psychoactive chemical (11-OH-THC) is made in smaller amounts than when taken by mouth. A growing number of are studying a made from an of that contains specific amounts of cannabinoids. This medicine is sprayed under the tongue. Have any laboratory or animal studies been done using or cannabinoids? In , tumor cells are used to test a substance to find out if it is likely to have any anticancer effects. In , tests are done to see if a drug, procedure, or treatment is safe and effective in animals. Laboratory and animal studies are done before a substance is tested in people. Laboratory and animal studies have tested the effects of cannabinoids in laboratory experiments. See the section of the health professional version of for information on laboratory and animal studies done using cannabinoids. Have any studies of or cannabinoids been done in people? No ongoing studies of as a treatment for cancer in people have been found in the database maintained by the .

Clinical trials have shown that both dronabinol and nabilone work as well as or better than other drugs to relieve nausea and vomiting. Nabiximols, a extract given as a mouth spray, was shown in a small , , clinical trial in Spain to treat nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. Ten small trials have studied inhaled for the treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. Newer drugs given for nausea caused by chemotherapy have not been directly compared with or cannabinoids in cancer patients. There is growing interest in treating children for such as nausea with and cannabinoids, but studies are limited. The has not endorsed and cannabinoid use because of concerns about its effect on brain development. The ability of cannabinoids to increase has been studied: A clinical trial compared delta-9-THC (dronabinol) and a standard drug (, an appetite stimulant) in patients with and loss of appetite. Results showed that delta-9-THC did not help increase appetite or weight gain in advanced cancer patients compared with megestrol. There are no published studies of the effect of inhaled on cancer patients with loss of appetite. and cannabinoids have been studied in the treatment of pain: In a study of 21 patients with , vaporized given with relieved pain better than morphine alone, while vaporized given with did not give greater pain relief. Further studies are needed. Randomized controlled trials of inhaled in patients with or other pain found pain was reduced in patients who received inhaled compared with those who received placebo. A study of extract that was sprayed under the tongue found it helped patients with advanced cancer whose pain was not relieved by strong opioids alone. In another study, patients who were given lower of cannabinoid spray showed better pain control and less sleep loss than patients who received a placebo. Control of cancer-related pain in some patients was better without the need for higher doses of extract spray or higher doses of their other pain medicines. were related to high doses of cannabinoid spray. Two small clinical trials of delta-9-THC showed that it relieved cancer pain. In the first study, patients had good pain relief, less nausea and vomiting, and better appetite. A second study showed that delta-9-THC could relieve pain as well as . An of nabilone also showed that it relieved cancer pain along with nausea, , and when compared with no treatment. Neither dronabinol nor nabilone is approved by the FDA for pain relief. and cannabinoids have been studied in the treatment of anxiety. : A small found that patients who inhaled had improved mood, improved sense of well-being, and less anxiety. In another study, 74 patients newly with who were users were matched to 74 nonusers. The users had markedly lower anxiety or and less pain or discomfort than the nonusers. The users were also less tired, had more appetite, and reported greater feelings of well-being. Have any side effects or risks been reported from and cannabinoids? Both and cannabinoids may be . Symptoms of from cannabinoids include: These symptoms are mild compared with symptoms of withdrawal from and usually go away after a few days. Studies on the risk of various cancers linked to smoking have shown the following: Because smoke contains many of the same substances as smoke, there are concerns about how inhaled affects the . A of men in Africa found that there was an increased risk of lung cancer in tobacco smokers who also inhaled . A of lung cancer patients found that low use was not linked to an increased risk of lung cancer or other cancers. A 1970 study interviewed over 49,000 Swedish men aged 19 to 21 years about their of using at the time they enlisted in the military and then followed them for up to 42 years. The study did not find a link between those who had ""ever"" used and testicular cancer, but did find that ""heavy"" use of (more than 50 times in a lifetime) was linked to more than twice the risk of testicular cancer. The study was limited by the way data was gathered and did not note whether the testicular cancers were or types or whether use also occurred after enlistment. A review of bladder cancer rates in users and non-users was done in over 84,000 men who took part in the California Men's Health Study. After more than 16 years of follow-up and adjusting for age, race, , and , rates of bladder cancer were found to be 45% lower in users than in men who did not report use. Larger studies that follow patients over time are needed to find if there is a link between use and a higher risk of .

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied.

Cancer patients should talk with their about an appropriate diet to follow (see ). The has been used by some people to treat and other diseases. It is based on the role of , , and other factors. There are 3 key parts to the : Diet: fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to give the body plenty of , minerals, enzymes, and other . The fruits and vegetables are low in (salt) and high in . : The addition of certain substances to the diet to help correct (the chemical changes that take place in a cell to make energy and basic materials needed for the body's life processes). : Treatments, including , to remove (harmful) substances from the body. What is the history of the discovery and use of the Gerson therapy as a complementary or alternative treatment for cancer? The Gerson therapy was named after Dr. Max B. Gerson (1881-1959), who first used it to treat his migraine headaches. In the 1930's, Dr. Gerson’s therapy became known to the public as a treatment for a type of (TB). The Gerson therapy was later used to treat other including cancer. What is the theory behind the claim that the Gerson therapy is useful in treating cancer? The Gerson therapy is based on the idea that cancer develops when there are changes in cell metabolism because of the buildup of toxic substances in the body. Dr. Gerson said the disease process makes more toxins and the becomes overworked. According to Dr. Gerson, people with cancer also have too much sodium and too little potassium in the cells in their bodies, which causes damage and weakened . The goal of the Gerson therapy is to restore the body to health by repairing the liver and returning the metabolism to its normal state. According to Dr. Gerson, this can be done by removing toxins from the body and building up the with diet and supplements. The enemas are said to widen the of the liver so toxins can be released. According to Dr. Gerson, the liver is further overworked as the treatment breaks down cancer cells and rids the body of toxins. are given to decrease the demands on the weakened liver and to make enzymes for . An organic diet and are used to boost the immune system and support the body as the regimen cleans the body of toxins. Foods low in sodium and high in potassium are said to help correct the tissue damage caused by having too much sodium in the cells. The Gerson therapy requires that the many details of its treatment plan be followed exactly. Some key parts of the regimen include the following: Drinking 13 glasses of juice a day. The juice must be freshly made from organic fruits and vegetables and be taken once every hour. Eating vegetarian meals of organically grown fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Taking a number of supplements, including: Lugol's Solution (potassium iodide, , and water). with . (The original regimen used crude liver instead of coenzyme Q10.) Taking or enemas regularly to remove toxins from the body. Preparing food without salt, spices, or oils, and without using cookware or utensils. Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using the Gerson therapy? No results of or have been published in journals. Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of the Gerson therapy been conducted? Most of the published information on the use of the Gerson therapy reports on (reviews of past cases). Dr. Gerson published (detailed reports of the , treatment, and of individual patients) of 50 of his patients. He treated several different types of cancer in his practice. The reports include Dr. Gerson's notes, with some of the patients over time. The follow-up was contact with patients by mail or phone and included (incomplete descriptions of the medical and treatment histories of one or more patients). In 1947 and 1959, the (NCI) reviewed the cases of a total of 60 patients treated by Dr. Gerson. The NCI found that the available information did not prove the regimen had benefit. The following studies of the Gerson therapy were published: In 1983-1984, a retrospective study of 38 patients treated with the Gerson therapy was done. Medical records were not available to the authors of the study; information came from patient interviews. These case reviews did not provide information that supports the usefulness of the Gerson therapy for treating cancer. In 1990, a study of a diet regimen similar to the Gerson therapy was done in Austria. The patients received along with the special diet. The authors of the study reported that the diet appeared to help patients live longer than usual and have fewer . The authors said it needed further study. In 1995, the Gerson Research Organization did a retrospective study of their patients who were treated with the Gerson therapy. The study reported that patients who had or lived longer than usual for patients with these of melanoma. There have been no that support the findings of this retrospective study. A case review of 6 patients with who used the Gerson therapy reported that the regimen helped patients in some ways, both physically and . Based on these results, the reviewers recommended that clinical trials of the Gerson therapy be conducted. Have any side effects or risks been reported from use of the Gerson therapy? Reports of three deaths that may be related to coffee enemas have been published. Taking too many enemas of any kind can cause changes in normal chemistry, chemicals that occur naturally in the body and keep the muscles, heart, and other organs working properly. Is the Gerson therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? The Gerson therapy has not been approved by the for use as a treatment for cancer or any other disease. For most cancer patients, guidelines include eating a well-balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain products. However, general guidelines such as these may have to be changed to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Patients should talk with their about an appropriate diet to follow.

""Researchers have been testing individual chemicals for years to see if they can cause cancer. Now, a groundbreaking new report suggests scientists should also be looking at how low doses of chemicals considered safe on their own might cause cancer when mixed together.

'We must take on the significant challenge of evaluating mixtures and not just evaluate one chemical at a time,' says Linda Birnbaum, PhD, director of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences and the National Toxicology Program.""[3] The truth (as William Goodson indicates) is that the scientists don't really know. He says ""Its going to be a huge project. We dont underestimate how complicated this will be. And for anyone who realizes that there's an intelligence behind all biological programs of cancer then this ""huge project"" is far greater and more encompassing than any of these scientists can say. ""Goodson says. 'Its almost impossible to live a life thats going to get you away from these things.' But he says he has made a few changes. 'Probably the biggest thing Ive done is stop drinking bottled water' because of the chemicals in the plastic bottles, Goodson says. 'Whatever I decide to do is just my best guess.' Instead, he says, he drinks tap water, saying 'in most parts of the U.S., tap water is as safe and more regulated than bottled water.' Typically, he uses a stainless steel, BPA-free water bottle to carry it. Still, he says, 'if I go to a place where the only water available is bottled water, yes, I will drink it. I dont have a choice.' Goodson says hed prefer to buy milk in glass bottles, but its hard to find.""[4] My impetus to pursue the above originated with an article by Jon Barron who says: ""As Michael Culbert, in his book Medical Armageddon, describes it, modern medicine likes to claim Hippocrates and the ancient Greeks as its founding fathers, but the fact is that Isaac Newton and the seventeenth-century philosophers and scientists--who defined the universe as a giant machine ruled by the laws of mechanical physics and math--are probably much better candidates for the title""[5] Present day answers to pressing matrix-system questions will not be found as long as one limits their thinking to conform within a seventeenth-century paradigm. Do you think it's at all possible that human beings and our shared reality of the cosmos may have actually changed over the course of the last 300 plus years? ; ~ ) ***********^*********** Cont. - the 3rd - Submitted the following at Jon Barron's site: I find this article to be a great introduction to the big picture regarding the mechanistic paradigm behind modern medicine and that people essentially ""blind"" themselves to the holistic nature of their life by conforming their understanding within that paradigm. Without a truly holistic perspective (all-inclusive of body-mind-spirit) the individual may not fully appreciate that Disease was no longer viewed as an imbalance in the body (not to mention that the psyche deserves to be included in addition to ""in the body""). Much appreciate your reference that ""Idiopathic is a word we medical men use to conceal our ignorance of the cause of disease.""! The ... need to treat the body holistically. depends on how you define holistic. Since the 80s I have defined holistic at least in terms of body-mind-spirit. This perspective is supported by the five biological laws of Dr. Hamer's ""new medicine"" as well as by the holistic paradigms of Anthroposophical medicine and other truly holistic approaches to medicine.

97e3b3f1-46dd-4ca7-89fd-e6a64d54dd42,"Integrative, , holistic—it’s easy to get lost in the lingo of modern medicine. It used to be as simple as eating an apple a day and checking in once a year with your family physician, but let’s face it: has gotten complicated. (Don’t even get us started on health insurance.) Say you have a migraine. You could choose to treat it by seeing a general practitioner, an acupuncturist, or even a Reiki master. The vast array of medical care options is impressive—and perhaps a bit overwhelming. “As a consumer, you’re now in the driver’s seat,” says , an integrative oncologist in San Diego, CA. “There’s value in both practitioners and patients keeping an open mind about different modalities, while at the same time there are potential benefits and risks with each type of treatment.“ If your head is spinning, you’re not alone. Here’s a brief guide to the various approaches practiced today. Conventional or mainstream medicine is what comes to mind when you think of standard health care: med school grads in white coats, pharmaceutical drugs, and surgeries. The of conventional care is to cure patients by eliminating physical symptoms of illness and injuries. “It’s the evidence-based, science-backed foundation of modern medicine,” Eisenberg says. “If you have pneumonia, for example, you’ve got to take antibiotics. If you’re in a car crash, you have to go to the emergency room.” One downside: It can be costly (emergency room visits can cost , even when no procedures are performed.) It’s also sometimes for a lack of focus on the patient-doctor relationship, lack of long-term support, and rushed visits, as the pressure is on doctors to see as many patients as possible. This approach includes nontraditional treatments—think Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, homeopathy, acupuncture, yoga, herbal remedies, hypnotherapy, massage, or chiropractic therapy. While these methods aren’t new (some have been around for thousands of years), they’re gaining mainstream popularity. According to (the most recent data available), 38 percent of American adults report using alternative therapies. Dietary supplements—herbs like gingko or echinacea, vitamins, or probiotics—are the most popular alternative approach, with of Americans using them. Deep breathing, yoga, tai chi, or , as well as chiropractic or osteopathic manupulation, are also among the most common techniques. “Alternative” and “complementary” are often used interchangeably, but they’re actually terms, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH). When practices and products of non-mainstream (alternative) origin are used in conjunction with traditional medicine, it’s referred to as complementary medicine—or CAM. When you turn to only non-mainstream therapies as treatment, that’s considered “alternative.” Depending on what type of specialist you see, you may be prescribed a pill, switched to an , or advised to reduce stress with meditation. But using all three approaches in tandem? That would be integrative health care. “It’s the intelligent combination of alternative and conventional medicine,” explains , founder and director of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, who’s commonly considered the pioneer of integrative medicine. For example, turning to acupuncture to manage asthma isn’t considered integrative medicine—unless it’s used in coordination with, say, an inhaler. This approach also centers on a therapeutic doctor-patient relationship, in which the doc encourages lifestyle changes and provides continuous care.Integrative medicine and patient-centered care. Maizes V, Rakel D, Niemiec C. Explore (New York, N.Y.), 2009, Dec.;5(5):1878-7541.”> Maizes V, Rakel D, Niemiec C. Explore (New York, N.Y.), 2009, Dec.;5(5):1878-7541. The practitioner places an on mind, body, and community, caring for the whole person through changes in diet, lifestyle, and mind-body practices. Finally, functional medicine came into play in 1991 when Jeffrey Bland, Ph.D., founded the . This approach involves practitioners understanding the cause of disease, looking at the body as a whole, and figuring out how to treat the illness by delving into patients’ health histories. Think of it as an entirely new GPS navigational system in the world of health and illness, says , chairman of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine. Think of it as an entirely new GPS navigational system in the world of health and illness. Functional medicine and integrative medicine are on the same page when it comes to breaking down the many segments of conventional, specialized medicine: The whole body matters, the patient experience matters, and the doctor-patient connection matters. But functional medicine goes a step farther, Hyman explains. “It uses the latest scientific understanding about how our genes, environment, and lifestyle interact as a whole system to diagnose and treat diseases based on patterns of imbalance and dysfunction—without treating the disease specifically.” Sounds counterintuitive, but as Hyman explains, disease is often the result of the body trying to rebalance its system. The key isn’t so much about naming the disease or finding the drug to treat it; rather, it’s about listening to the patient’s story and history, and looking at factors like allergens, toxins, stress, infections, diet, and genetics to get to the root of the disease. Depending on who you ask, opinions of the various modalities are mixed. While supporters of integrative medicine it “healing-oriented“ and functional medicine supporters it’s “the model for medicine going forward,“ some doctors are dead-set against unconventional approaches. “It’s cleverly marketed, dangerous quackery,” Steven Salzberg, Ph.D., a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, of alternative medicine, while David Gorski, M.D., Ph.D., a surgical oncologist at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, has functional medicine “highly dubious medicine“ and “pure pseudoscience.“ Still, a good deal of research supports CAM and integrative approaches to healthcare. Several studies point to promising effects for managing pain and anxiety, relieving fatigue, and improving mood in cancer patients.Effects of integrative medicine on pain and anxiety among oncology inpatients.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2013 Aug 20; 110(34): 13971–13975. Other studies have pointed to the benefits of herbal supplements, like for relieving indigestion or for its anti-inflammatory properties. At the same time, many key claims by large, carefully controlled medical studies, or in some cases, those bigger studies . For example, several of the herbal supplement echinacea found it did not prevent or shorten the duration of the common cold. And since science-backed research is still limited, many health insurance plans consider CAM or integrative therapies too experimental and . In other words, be prepared to pay a pretty penny to take advantage. Still, it’s worth noting that many well-established medical centers are turning toward integrative approaches, including the in New York City, in Houston, TX, and the in Boston. Before using any of these approaches, people who’ve been diagnosed with any illness or injury should talk with their primary health care provider. Despite their differences and the doubts of some doctors, both functional and integrative health practitioners are working to shift the focus from disease management to disease prevention—and redefining our understanding of health care in the process.

Denny Sanford Institute for Empathy and Compassion Medical Students Say Western Medicine/Teaching Needs to Integrate More with Complementary and Alternative Medicine January 20, 2010 Joint UC study reveals need for more field research, better classroom education In the largest national survey of its kind, researchers from UCLA and UC San Diego measured medical students’ attitudes and beliefs about complementary and alternative medicine.  The findings will be published in the online issue of Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine (eCAM) on January 20, 2010. “Complementary and alternative medicine, or CAM, is receiving increased attention in light of the global health crisis and the significant role of traditional medicine in meeting public health needs in developing countries,” said study author Ryan Abbott, third-year medical student at UC San Diego School of Medicine and former researcher at UCLA Center for East-West Medicine. “Integrating CAM into mainstream health care is now a global phenomenon, with policy makers at the highest levels endorsing the importance of a historically marginalized form of health care.” Complementary and alternative medicine includes therapies such as massage, yoga, herbal medicine and acupuncture.  It is characterized by a holistic and highly individualized approach to patient care, with emphasis on maximizing the body’s inherent healing ability, involving patients as active participants in their own care, addressing the physical, mental and spiritual attributes of a disease and placing a strong emphasis on preventive care.  Interest in these fields has increased dramatically in the United States in recent years.  However, information about these therapies has not yet been widely integrated into medical education. “Even with the high prevalence of CAM use today, most physicians still know little about non-conventional forms of medicine,” said study author Michael S. Goldstein, PhD, senior research scientist, UCLA Center for Health Policy Research and professor of Public Health and Sociology, UCLA.  “Investigating medical students’ attitudes and knowledge will help us assess whether this may change in the future.” The team of UCLA and UC San Diego experts in the fields of CAM, integrative medicine, Western medicine, medical education and survey development created a novel 30-question survey and sent it to 126 medical schools throughout the United States.  In return, the team received 1,770 completed surveys from a pool of about 68,000 medical students nationwide (or three percent). While the current results offer valuable insight into medical students’ perceptions of CAM, given the low response rate, researchers plan future studies to further refine the tool and see if the findings can be more generalized.  Researchers found that although medical students endorsed the importance of complementary and alternative medicine, obstacles remain that may prevent future doctors from recommending these treatments in their practices.  According to the findings: 77 percent of participants agreed to some extent that patients whose doctors know about complementary and alternative medicine in addition to conventional medicine, benefit more than those whose doctors are only familiar with Western medicine.  74 percent of participants agreed to some extent that a system of medicine that integrates therapies of conventional and complementary and alternative medicine would be more effective than either type of medicine provided independently.  84 percent of participants agreed to some extent that the field contains beliefs, ideas, and therapies from which conventional medicine could benefit. 49 percent of participating medical students indicated that they have used complementary and alternative treatments however few would recommend or use these treatments in their practice until more scientific assessment has occurred. “Our research suggests that persuading doctors to integrate CAM will require investment in the types of clinical research that form the backbone of Western medicine,” adds Abbott. “Even now, medical schools have the opportunity to train the next generation of medical practitioners in health care systems outside of conventional medicine. Core values of CAM can help students develop a more holistic and individualized approach to patient care.” The study also found that the further along in school the student was, the more likely the student believed their learning regarding CAM therapies sufficed.  Still, researchers note that more than 60 percent of participants favored more education related to this field during their time in medical school.  Although more than half of all U.S. medical schools currently offer some type of CAM course, researchers say these courses could be augmented or streamlined into more formal, standardized curricula. “Although the content of integrative medicine programs remains controversial, medical schools across the country are moving forward with ambitious new programs to teach the next generation of health care leaders,” said Dr. Ka Kit Hui, Wallis Annenberg Chair in Integrative East-West Medicine at UCLA, founder and director, UCLA Center for East-West Medicine, and chair, Collaborative Centers of Integrative Medicine, UCLA. “Through the Collaborative Centers for Integrative Medicine, UCLA has become one of the nation’s leading academic centers for integrative medical education.  UCLA offers training programs for health sciences students and residents, as well as fellowships for clinicians and researchers.” Hui adds that the importance of integrative medical education is increasingly being realized outside of UCLA.

As Dr. John Bastyr said to me as a doubting student 40 years ago during the dark ages of natural medicine, So many times while laboring on this update I was reminded of the remarkable wisdom of the pioneers whose insights again and again are being validated by modern research. I hope this work will serve as a tribute to these remarkable and courageous men and women who suffered so much for daring to speak the truth. I know of no greater validation for a teacher than to learn from his students and see them make a real difference in the world. Dr. Michael Murray has had a remarkable impact on decreasing disease and suffering through his research, teaching, and writing, and his advocacy of science-based natural medicine. Thank you, my dear friend. The greatest joys in my life are my dear wife, Lara, and children, Raven and Galen. Lara, dear, thank you for your bountiful love and nurturing. Congratulations on your burgeoning career as an inspiring author () on your own. Love you. Raven, dear daughter, I am so proud of you! Achieving your M.S. in nutrition and R.D. from Bastyr University and now serving as supervising nutritionists at a clinic for eating disorders—you are such a gift to your patients. Son Galen, I watch in amazement as you excel at everything you do and at every level of education. The future is yours to create, and I wait with anticipation to see the impact you will make on the world. Raven and Galen, thank you for your love—I am blessed to have such wonderful children.

It dispels a common myth about the use of natural remedies—that natural medicine is This book contains information based on firm scientific inquiry and represents an evidence-based approach to wellness. This encyclopedia is without question the most thoroughly researched and referenced book on the use of natural medicines ever written for the public. The book must not be used in place of consulting a physician or other qualified health care practitioner. It is designed for use in conjunction with the services provided by physicians practicing natural medicine. Readers are strongly urged to develop a good relationship with a physician knowledgeable in the art and science of natural and preventive medicine, such as a naturopathic physician. In all cases involving a medical complaint, ailment, or therapy, please consult a physician. Proper medical care and advice can significantly improve the quality of your life and extend your life span. Although this book discusses numerous natural approaches to various health conditions, it is not intended as a substitute for appropriate medical care. Please keep the following in mind as you read: • Do not self-diagnose. If you have concerns about any subject discussed in this book, please consult a physician, preferably a naturopathic doctor (N.D.), nutritionally oriented medical doctor (M.D.) or doctor of osteopathy (D.O.), chiropractor (D.C.), or other natural health care specialist. • Make your physician aware of all the prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, nutritional supplements, or herbal products you are currently taking, in order to avoid any negative interactions. • If you are currently taking a prescription medication, you absolutely must work with your doctor before discontinuing any drug or altering any drug regimen. • Many health conditions require a multifactorial solution: medical, nutritional, and lifestyle changes. Do not rely solely on a single area of focus. You can’t just take pills and not change your diet, or do the diet and the pills but ignore the lifestyle issues. Any truly effective approach to health must be fully integrated. We believe that if you commit to following the guidelines of natural health care described in this book, you will be rewarded with a life full of health, vitality, and vigor. The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will interest his patient in the care of the human frame, in diet and in the cause and prevention of disease. An evolution in the core principles of health care has been occurring over the last few decades. At the forefront of this change is naturopathic medicine—a system of medicine based on the belief that the human body has a remarkable innate healing ability. Naturopathic doctors (N.D.’s) view the patient as a complex, interrelated system—a whole person—and focus on promoting health through natural, nontoxic therapies such as nutrition, lifestyle modification, herbal remedies, psychological measures, and many others. Naturopathic medicine is helping to usher in the emerging paradigm in medicine. A is a model used to explain events. As our understanding of the environment and the human body evolves, new paradigms are developed. For example, in physics the cause-and-effect views of Descartes and Newton were replaced by Einstein’s theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, and approaches in theoretical physics that take into considerations the tremendous interconnectedness of the universe. The new paradigm in medicine also focuses on the interconnectedness of body, mind, emotions, social factors, and the environment. While the old paradigm viewed the body basically as a machine that can be fixed best with drugs and surgery, the emerging new model considers these measures secondary to natural, noninvasive techniques that promote health by supporting the body’s own healing processes. The relationship between the physician and patient is also evolving. The era of the physician as a demigod is over. The era of self-empowerment is beginning. Naturopathy (the word means ) is a method of healing that employs various natural means to empower an individual to achieve the highest level of health possible. Despite its philosophical links to many cultures, modern naturopathic medicine grew out of natural healing systems in 18th- and 19th-century Europe and the United States. The European tradition of at natural springs or spas had gained a foothold in America by the middle of the 18th century. The custom helped make Germany and the United States especially receptive to the ideas of naturopathy. Among the movement’s earliest promoters were Sebastian Kneipp, a priest who credited his recovery from tuberculosis to bathing in the Danube; and Benedict Lust, a physician who trained at the water-cure clinic that Kneipp had founded in Europe. Lust arrived in the United States in the 1890s and began using the term to describe an eclectic compilation of doctrines of natural healing. In 1902, Lust founded the first naturopathic college of medicine in the United States in New York City. It taught a system of medicine that included the best of what was then known about nutritional therapy, natural diet, herbal medicine, homeopathy, spinal manipulation, exercise therapy, hydrotherapy, electrotherapy, stress reduction, and other natural therapies. The basic tenets of Lust’s view of naturopathy are summarized in his article The Principles, Aim and Program of the Nature Cure: The natural system for curing disease is based on a return to nature in regulating the diet, breathing, exercising, bathing and the employment of various forces to eliminate the poisonous products in the system, and so raise the vitality of the patient to a proper standard of health. . . . 1. ELIMINATION OF EVIL HABITS, or the weeds of life, such as over-eating, alcoholic drinks, drugs, the use of tea, coffee and cocoa that contain poisons, meat eating, improper hours of living, waste of vital forces, lowered vitality, sexual and social aberrations, worry, etc. 2. CORRECTIVE HABITS. Correct breathing, correct exercise, right mental attitude. Moderation in the pursuit of health and wealth. 3. NEW PRINCIPLES OF LIVING. Proper fasting, selection of food, hydropathy, light and air baths, mud baths, osteopathy, chiropractic and other forms of mechano-therapy, mineral salts obtained in organic from, electropathy, heliopathy, steam or Turkish baths, sitz baths, etc. . . . There is really but one healing force in existence and that is Nature herself, which means the inherent restorative power of the organism to overcome disease. Now the question is, can this power be appropriated and guided more readily by extrinsic or intrinsic methods? That is to say, is it more amenable to combat disease by irritating drugs, vaccines and serums employed by superstitious moderns, or by the bland intrinsic congenial forces of Natural Therapeutics, that are employed by this new school of medicine, that is Naturopathy, which is the only orthodox school of medicine? Are not these natural forces much more orthodox than the artificial resources of the druggist? The practical application of these natural agencies, duly suited to the individual case, are true signs that the art of healing has been elaborated by the aid of absolutely harmless, congenial treatments. The early naturopaths, including Lust, attached great importance to a natural, healthful diet. So did many of their contemporaries. John Kellogg, a physician, Seventh-day Adventist, and vegetarian, ran the Battle Creek Sanitarium, which utilized natural therapies; his brother, Will, built and ran a factory in Battle Creek, Michigan, to produce health foods such as shredded wheat and granola biscuits. Driven both by personal convictions about the benefits of cereal fibers and by commercial interests, the Kellogg brothers, along with a former employee, C. W. Post, helped popularize naturopathic ideas about food. Naturopathic medicine grew and flourished in the early part of the 20th century. However, in the mid-1930s several factors led to the medical profession’s establishing the foundation for its current virtual monopoly on health care: (1) the medical profession finally stopped using therapies such as bloodletting and mercury dosing, replacing them with new therapies that were more effective for treating symptoms and much less toxic; (2) foundations supported by the drug industry began heavily subsidizing medical schools and drug research; and (3) the medical profession became much more of a political force, resulting in the passing of legislation that severely restricted the viability of other health care systems. Naturopathy has experienced a tremendous resurgence since the mid-1970s when the profession was nearly extinct. This resurgence is largely related to increased public awareness about the role of diet and lifestyle in chronic diseases and the failure of modern medicine to deal effectively with these disorders. In addition, the 1978 founding of Bastyr University, with its focus on teaching science-based natural medicine and its landmark achievement of accreditation, played a major role. Although the term or was not used until the late 19th century, the philosophical roots of this medical system go back thousands of years. Drawing on the healing wisdom of many cultures, including India’s ayurveda, China’s Taoism, and Greece’s Hippocratic school of medicine, naturopathic medicine is a system founded on seven time-tested principles: Principle 1: The healing power of nature (). Naturopathic physicians believe that the body has considerable power to heal itself. It is the role of the physician to facilitate and enhance this process with the aid of natural nontoxic therapies. Principle 2: Identify and treat the cause (). The naturopathic physician is trained to seek the underlying causes of a disease rather than simply suppress the symptoms, which are viewed as expressions of the body’s attempt to heal. The causes of disease can arise at the physical, mental-emotional, and spiritual levels. Principle 3: First, do no harm (). The naturopathic physician seeks to do no harm with medical treatment by employing safe and effective natural therapies. Naturopathic physicians are trained to view an individual as a whole, a complex interaction of physical, mental-emotional, spiritual, social, and other factors. The naturopathic physician is foremost a teacher, educating, empowering, and motivating the patients to assume more personal responsibility for their health by adopting a healthful attitude, lifestyle, and diet. Naturopathic physicians are specialists in preventive medicine. Prevention of disease and support of health are accomplished through education and life habits. Establishing and maintaining optimal health and promoting wellness are the primary goals of the naturopathic physician. While health is defined as the state of optimal physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being, wellness is defined as a state of health characterized by a positive emotional state. The naturopathic physician strives to increase the level of wellness regardless of the disease or level of health. Even in cases of severe disease, a high level of wellness can often be achieved. Naturopathic physicians’ primary focus is on promoting health and preventing disease. In addition to providing recommendations on lifestyle, diet, and exercise, naturopathic physicians may elect to utilize a variety of therapeutic modalities to promote health. Some naturopathic physicians choose to emphasize a particular therapeutic modality, while others are more eclectic and utilize a number of modalities; some naturopaths elect to focus on particular medical fields such as pediatrics, natural childbirth, physical medicine, and so on. Naturopathic medicine is inclusive, in that it incorporates a variety of healing techniques. The current treatments naturopathic physicians are trained in include clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathy, Oriental medicine and acupuncture, hydrotherapy, physical medicine including massage and therapeutic manipulation, counseling and other psychotherapies, and minor surgery. In addition, in many states licensed naturopathic physicians can prescribe pharmaceutical drugs. Clinical nutrition, or the use of diet as a therapy, serves as the foundation of naturopathic medicine. There is an ever-increasing body of knowledge that supports the use of whole foods and nutritional supplements in the maintenance of health and treatment of disease. Plants have been used as medicines since antiquity. Naturopathic physicians are professionally trained in herbal medicine and know both the historical uses of plants and modern pharmacological mechanisms. The term is derived from the Greek words , meaning and , meaning Homeopathy is a system of medicine that treats a disease with a dilute, potentized agent, or drug, that will produce the same symptoms as the disease when given to a healthy individual, the fundamental principle being that like cures like. Homeopathic medicines are derived from a variety of plant, mineral, and chemical substances. Traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture are part of an ancient system of medicine involving techniques used to enhance the flow of vital energy (chi). Acupuncture involves the stimulation of certain specific points on the body along chi pathways called meridians. Acupuncture points can be stimulated by the insertion and withdrawing of needles, by the application of heat (moxibustion), by massage, by the application of laser light or electrical current, or by a combination of these methods. Hydrotherapy may be defined as the use of water in any of its forms (hot, cold, ice, steam, etc.) and methods of application (sitz bath, douche, spa or hot tub, whirlpool, sauna, shower, immersion bath, pack, poultice, foot-bath, fomentation, wrap, colonic irrigation, etc.) in the maintenance of health or treatment of disease. It is one of the ancient methods of treatment. Hydrotherapy has been used by many different peoples, including the Egyptians, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, Hebrews, Hindus, and Chinese. Physical medicine refers to the use of physical measures in the treatment of an individual. This includes the use of physiotherapy equipment such as ultrasound, diathermy, and other electromagnetic energy agents; therapeutic exercise; massage; joint mobilization (manipulative) and immobilization techniques; and hydrotherapy. Counseling and lifestyle modification techniques are essential to the naturopathic physician. A naturopath is formally trained in the following counseling areas:  1. Interviewing and responding skills, active listening, the assessment of body language, and other contact skills necessary for the therapeutic relationship 2. Recognition and understanding of prevalent psychological issues, including developmental problems, abnormal behavior, addictions, stress, problematic sexuality, etc. 3. Various treatment measures, including hypnosis and guided imagery, counseling techniques, correction of underlying organic factors, and family therapy The modern naturopathic physician provides all phases of primary health care. That is, naturopathic physicians are trained to be the doctor first seen by the patient for general (nonemergency) health care. Clinical assessment generally follows the conventional medical model, with a medical history, physical exam, laboratory evaluation, and other well-accepted diagnostic procedures, but the clinical assessment may be influenced by nonconventional diagnostic techniques such as tests for nutrient deficiencies, toxin load, and physiological function. A typical first office visit with a naturopathic doctor often takes one hour. Since naturopathic physicians consider one of their primary goals to be teaching the patient how to live healthfully, the time devoted to discussing and explaining principles of health maintenance and medical aspects is one of the aspects that set naturopaths apart from many other health care providers. The patient-physician relationship begins with a thorough medical history and interview process designed to explore all aspects of a patient’s lifestyle. The physician will perform standard diagnostic procedures if these are needed, including physical exam and blood and urine analysis. Once a good understanding of the patient’s health and disease status is established (making a diagnosis of a disease is only one part of this process), the doctor and patient work together to establish a treatment and health-promotion program. Because many naturopathic physicians function as primary health care providers, standard medical monitoring, follow-up, and exams are critical to good patient care. Patients are encouraged to receive regular yearly checkups, including a full physical. When therapies are used, outcomes are assessed using conventional tools (e.g., patient interview, physical exam, laboratory tests, radiological imaging, etc.). You may be asking how naturopathic physicians view health differently from conventional medical doctors. First of all, by definition and philosophy most conventional medical doctors practice medicine. refers to conventional medicine as practiced by a graduate of a medical school or college granting the degree of doctor of medicine (M.D.). It is a system of medicine that focuses primarily on treating disease rather than on promoting health. The fundamental difference between naturopathy and allopathy is that the allopathic physician tends to view good health primarily as a physical state in which there is no obvious disease present. In contrast, naturopathic physicians recognize true health as the state of optimal physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. The key difference between naturopathic and allopathic physicians is apparent if we look at how each type of doctor views not only health but also disease. To illustrate the differences, let’s take a look at how each views and addresses the The infection equation is like a mathematical equation, such as 1 + 2 = 3. In the infection equation, what determines the outcome is the interaction of the host’s immune system with the infecting organism. A naturopathic doctor tends to use treatments designed to enhance the immune system, while most conventional doctors tend to use treatments designed to kill the invading organism. Conventional medicine has been obsessed with infective agents rather than host defense factors. This obsession really began with Louis Pasteur, the 19th-century physician and researcher who played a major role in the development of the germ theory. This theory holds that different diseases are caused by different infectious organisms, with the patient as a passive victim. Much of Pasteur’s life was dedicated to finding substances that would kill the infecting organisms. Pasteur and others since him who pioneered effective treatments of infectious diseases have given us a great deal, for which we all should be thankful. However, there is more to the infection equation. Another 19th-century French scientist, Claude Bernard, also made major contributions to medical understanding. Bernard, however, had a different view of health and disease. Bernard believed that the state of a person’s internal environment was more important in determining disease than the pathogen itself. In other words, Bernard believed that the person’s internal or susceptibility to infection, was more important than the germ. Physicians, he believed, should focus more attention on making this internal terrain a very inhospitable place for disease to flourish. Bernard’s theory led to some rather interesting studies. In fact, a firm advocate of the germ theory would find some of these studies to be absolutely crazy. One of the most interesting studies was conducted by a Russian scientist named Élie Metchnikoff, the discover of white blood cells. He and his research associates consumed cultures containing millions of cholera bacteria, yet none of them developed cholera. The reason: their immune systems were not compromised. Metchnikoff believed, like Bernard, that the correct way to deal with infectious disease was to focus on enhancing the body’s own defenses. During the last part of their lives, Pasteur and Bernard engaged in scientific discussions on the virtues of the germ theory and Bernard’s perspective on the internal terrain. On his deathbed, Pasteur supposedly said: Bernard was right. The pathogen is nothing. The terrain is everything. Unfortunately, Pasteur’s legacy is the obsession with the pathogen, and modern medicine has largely forgotten the importance of the Now, we want to make it very clear that advances in conventional medicine can produce lifesaving results when used appropriately. There is little argument, for example, that when used appropriately, antibiotics save lives. However, there is also little argument that antibiotics are grossly overprescribed. While the appropriate use of antibiotics makes good medical sense, what does not make sense is the reliance on antibiotics for such conditions as acne, recurrent bladder infections, chronic ear infections, chronic sinusitis, chronic bronchitis, and nonbacterial sore throats. The antibiotics rarely provide a substantial benefit, and these conditions are effectively treated with natural measures. The widespread use and abuse of antibiotics is increasingly alarming for many reasons, including the near epidemic of chronic candidiasis as well as the development of that are resistant to currently available antibiotics. We are coming dangerously close to a in which many infectious diseases will once again become almost impossible to treat. Since there is evidence that resistance to antibiotics is less of a problem when these medications are used sparingly, a reduction in antibiotic prescriptions may be the only significant way to address the problem. The consensus of medical experts as well as the World Health Organization is that antibiotic use must be restricted and inappropriate use halted if the growing trend toward bacterial resistance to antibiotics is to be halted and reversed. Our interpretation of this challenge is that it is going to force conventional medical thinkers to take a closer look at ways to enhance resistance against infection. Our belief is that as they do so they will discover the healing power of nature. There is an ever-increasing body of knowledge that supports the use of whole foods, nutritional supplements, and a healthful lifestyle and attitude in enhancing resistance to infection. For example, children deficient in any of a large number of nutrients, such as vitamin A, vitamin C, and zinc, are far more susceptible to a wide range of infectious agents. While in the short term antibiotics may be critically important, in the long run they do nothing to improve an impaired immune system, so infections continue to recur. In addition to promoting good health, natural medicines such as herbal products and nutritional supplements are often used as direct substitutes for conventional drugs. However, an important distinction must be made: in most cases the use of these natural medicines involves promoting the healing process rather than suppressing symptoms. To illustrate this point, let’s look at osteoarthritis (the most common form of arthritis) and consider the natural approach vs. the drug approach. Osteoarthritis is characterized by a breakdown of cartilage. Cartilage serves an important role in joint function. Its gel-like nature provides protection to the ends of joints by acting as a shock absorber. Degeneration of the cartilage is the hallmark feature of osteoarthritis. This degeneration causes inflammation, pain, deformity, and limitation of motion in the joint. The primary drugs used in the treatment of osteoarthritis are the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. These include, for example, aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), piroxicam (Feldene), diclofenac (Voltaren), and the newer COX-2 inhibitor drugs such as celecoxib (Celebrex). Although NSAIDs are extensively used in the United States, these drugs are associated with side effects such as gastrointestinal upset, headaches, and dizziness, and are therefore recommended for only short periods of time. In addition, about 7,000 Americans die each year from ulcers produced by the older NSAIDs.⁵ Newer versions such as rofecoxib (Vioxx, withdrawn from the market in 2004) and celecoxib are now known to increase the risk of death due to heart damage, and they still carry a significant risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is estimated that in the first five years after these drugs were approved, more than 60,000 people in the United States may have lost their lives from side effects.⁶ Not widely known is that while these drugs may suppress the symptoms of osteoarthritis in the short term, clinical studies have shown that in the long run they may actually accelerate joint destruction and block cartilage repair by inhibiting the formation of key compounds in cartilage known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). These compounds are responsible for maintaining the proper water content in the cartilage matrix, thereby helping cartilage keep its gel-like nature and shock-absorbing qualities. Simply stated, aspirin and other NSAIDs are designed to fight disease rather than promote health. In contrast, the natural approach to the treatment of osteoarthritis facilitates the body’s natural healing process. For example, glucosamine sulfate appears to address one of the underlying factors that can cause osteoarthritis: the reduced manufacture of cartilage components (specifically GAGs). By getting at the root of the problem—not only increasing the rate of cartilage formation but also improving the health of the cartilage—glucosamine sulfate both reduces symptoms, including pain, and helps the body repair damaged joints.¹⁴–¹⁶ In head-to head comparison studies with NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, piroxicam, and celecoxib, glucosamine has been shown to provide comparable or greater benefit.¹⁷–²⁰ While side effects are common and even expected with pharmaceutical drugs, glucosamine sulfate does not cause side effects. The only advantage of the drugs is that symptom relief occurs more quickly than with the natural therapies, but this advantage lasts for only a few weeks. Within a few months, glucosamine sulfate results in greater symptom relief. For more information, see the chapter In addition to being used as primary therapy, naturopathic medicine is valuable as a complementary approach to conventional medicine, especially in severe illnesses that require pharmacological and/or surgical intervention, such as cancer, angina, congestive heart failure, Parkinson’s disease, and trauma. For example, a patient with severe congestive heart failure who requires drugs such as digoxin and furosemide can benefit from the appropriate use of thiamine, carnitine, and coenzyme Q10 supplementation. Although there are double-blind studies demonstrating the value of these agents as complementary therapies in congestive heart failure, they are rarely prescribed by conventional medical doctors in the United States. For more information, see the chapter Ultimately, naturopathic medicine may prove most useful in the prevention of disease. Naturopathic physicians are trained to spend considerable time and effort in teaching patients the importance of adhering to a health-promoting lifestyle, diet, and attitude. True primary prevention involves addressing a patient’s risk for disease (especially for heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and osteoporosis) and instituting a course of action designed to reduce controllable risk factors. The health benefits and cost-effectiveness of disease prevention programs have been clearly demonstrated. Studies have consistently found that participants in wellness-oriented programs had a reduced number of days of disability (a 43% reduction in one study), a lower number of days spent in a hospital (a 54% drop in one study), and a lower amount spent on health care (a remarkable 76% decrease in one study). There is a tremendous need for naturopathic medicine to become the dominant method of medicine in practice. Each year in the United States we spend more than $2 trillion on health care—or, more accurately, we are spending the majority of these dollars on Health care costs now consume 17% of the gross national product (GNP), with the percentage of GNP spent on health care continuing to increase at twice the rate of inflation. We cannot afford to continue to go in this direction. If naturopathic medicine, with its focus on promoting health and preventing disease, became the dominant medical model, not only would health care costs be dramatically reduced, but the health of Americans would improve dramatically. It is a sad fact that while we are grossly outspending every other nation in the world on health care, as a nation we are not healthy. Almost half of adults suffer from one or more chronic diseases (such as cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and heart disease) as well as obesity. What’s especially alarming about these statistics is that these apply to adults supposedly in their prime. The numbers are far worse for the elderly, virtually all of whom suffer from one or more chronic degenerative diseases Wellness-oriented medicine, such as naturopathic medicine, provides a practical solution to escalating health care costs and poor health status. Equally important is that this orientation can increase patient satisfaction. Studies have observed that patients utilizing the natural-medicine/health-promotion approach are more satisfied with the results of their treatment than they are with the results of conventional treatments like drugs and surgeries. A few studies have directly compared the satisfaction of patients using natural medicine with that of patients using conventional medicine. The largest study was done in the Netherlands, where natural medicine practitioners are an integral part of the health care system.²⁴ This extensive study compared satisfaction in 3,782 patients seeing either a conventional physician or a complementary practitioner. The patients seeing the natural medicine practitioner reported better results for almost every condition. Of particular interest was the observation that the patients seeing a complementary practitioner were somewhat sicker at the start of therapy, and that in only 4 of the 23 conditions did the conventional medical patients report better results. Why Is There a Bias Against Natural Medicine on the Part of Medical Doctors? The simple answer to this important question is that many doctors are simply not educated in the value of nutrition and other natural therapies. In fact, most were told during their education that alternative medicines are worthless. Many doctors are not aware of, or choose to ignore, data on beneficial natural therapies such as diet, exercise, and dietary supplements, even if the data are overwhelmingly positive. Rather than admit they don’t know whether natural therapies might be valid, most doctors have a knee-jerk reaction that such treatments can’t be helpful. They often suffer from what we refer to as the alluding to the widely held belief in North America in the 18th century that tomatoes were poisonous, even though they were a dietary staple in Europe. It wasn’t until 1820, when Robert Gibbon Johnson ate a tomato on the courthouse steps in Salem, Indiana, that the barrier was broken in the minds of many Americans. In medicine, many physicians have an attitude regarding alternative therapies that is quite similar to this For example, though diet is a critical foundation of health, when patients ask their doctor about dietary therapy or a nutritional supplement for a particular condition, even if the nutritional approach has considerable support in the scientific literature that proves its safety and effectiveness, most doctors will caution patients against going the natural route or tell them that while it won’t hurt them, it won’t help them either. The truth is that in many cases, the doctor just doesn’t know anything about it. Keep in mind that it took the medical community more than 40 years to accept the link between low folic acid levels during pregnancy and crippling birth defects of the spinal cord (neural tube defects such as spina bifida). It is estimated that 70 to 85% of the more than 100,000 children born with neural tube defects during that time could have been born healthy if doctors had not been so biased against scientific data on nutritional supplements.²⁵ The good news is that in the two decades since the publication of the first edition of this book, the medical community has become more receptive to natural therapies. Unfortunately, its political organizations continue to work at the local, state, and federal levels to prevent licensing of naturopaths, insurance equality, and critical research. A licensed naturopathic physician (N.D.) attends an accredited four-year graduate-level naturopathic medical school. Admission requirements are similar to those required for conventional medical school. Specifically, applicants must have a bachelor’s degree or a higher degree from an accredited college or university, and must have taken courses in general chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, algebra, general biology, psychology, and English composition. The curriculum is divided into two primary categories, academic and clinical. The first academic year is primarily composed of the study of the normal structure and function of the body (anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, histology, embryology, etc.). The second year focuses on the pathological transitions to disease, along with clinical recognition of these processes using physical, clinical, radiological, and laboratory diagnostics. The third and fourth academic years focus on conventional and naturopathic perspectives in clinical diagnostics for pediatrics, gynecology, obstetrics, dermatology, neurology, endocrinology, cardiology, gastroenterology, and geriatrics. During the third and fourth years there is also a focus on naturopathic therapies. Students are required to take core classes (usually two or three quarters) in botanical medicine, homeopathy, counseling, diet, therapeutic nutrition, and physical medicine. Students are then able to choose which modality to focus on in elective advanced courses or may choose courses in other areas such as acupuncture and ayurvedic medicine to meet elective requirements. The clinical curriculum begins first with students assisting in patient care and/or in the pharmacy and laboratory. Although no naturopathic medical school currently has inpatient facilities, all schools have extensive clinical facilities where students work under the direction of supervising naturopathic physicians and conduct complete patient evaluation, treatment, and monitoring, and perform other aspects of patient care. Students are also required to observe or work under the direction of licensed primary care physicians. The Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME) was created in 1978 to establish and administer educational programs and colleges of naturopathic medicine. Currently, there are seven schools in the United States and Canada that train naturopathic physicians with accreditation: University of Bridgeport—College of Naturopathic Medicine Currently, 16 states, the District of Columbia, and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands have licensing laws for naturopathic doctors. In these states, naturopathic doctors are required to graduate from an accredited four-year residential naturopathic medical school and pass an extensive postdoctoral board examination (NPLEX) in order to receive a license. Legal provisions allow the practice of naturopathic medicine in several other states, and efforts to gain licensure elsewhere are currently under way. Naturopathic physicians are also recognized throughout all provinces in Canada. Licensed naturopathic physicians must fulfill state-mandated continuing education requirements annually, and will have a specific scope of practice defined by their state’s law. Currently there are licensing laws for naturopathic physicians in: United States territories: Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) is the national professional organization of licensed naturopathic physicians. The organization is also seeking to differentiate professional trained naturopaths from unscrupulous individuals claiming to be naturopaths because they received a degree. In states that license naturopaths, it is apparent who is a qualified naturopathic physician. In other states, since there is no licensing board overseeing the profession, people receiving mail-order diplomas from nonaccredited correspondence schools may call themselves N.D.’s, but there is a major difference in the quality of education and training between a licensable N.D. who graduated from an accredited school and a mail-order N.D. In states that do not license naturopaths, the best criteria for legitimacy are that a doctor is a graduate of one of the schools listed above and that he or she is a member of the AANP, which restricts membership to only those N.D.’s who are graduates of accredited institutions. For more information contact: To some, naturopathic medicine, as well as the entire concept of natural medicine, appears to be a fad that will soon pass. However, when the subject is considered with an open mind, it is quite clear that naturopathic medicine is at the forefront of the future. It is obvious that an evolution is occurring in health care and that as a result more natural therapies are gaining acceptance even in mainstream medical circles. One of the pervasive myths about naturopathic medicine has been the belief there is no firm scientific evidence for the use of the natural therapies naturopathic physicians employ. However, as this book attests, scientific studies and observations have upheld the validity not only of diet, nutritional supplements, and herbal medicines but also of some of the more esoteric natural healing treatments, including acupuncture, biofeedback, meditation, and homeopathy. In many instances, scientific investigation has not only validated the natural measure but also led to significant improvements and greater understanding. In the past 30 or so years there have been tremendous advances in the understanding of the ways in which many natural therapies and compounds work to promote health or treat disease. Even in mainstream medicine there is a growing trend toward using substances found in nature, including compounds naturally found in the human body such as interferon, interleukin, insulin, and human growth hormone, in place of synthetic drugs. Add to this the growing popularity of nutritional supplements and herbal products and it is quite obvious that a trend is emerging toward natural medicine. Suffice it to say that it appears that the concepts and philosophy of naturopathic medicine will persist and be a major part of the medicine of the future. • Naturopathic medicine is a system of medicine that focuses on prevention and the use of nontoxic, natural therapies to treat and reverse disease. • Naturopathic medicine is built upon seven underlying principles. Principle 1: The healing power of nature (). Principle 2: Identify and treat the cause (). Principle 3: First, do no harm (). • As health care costs skyrocket, there is a tremendous need for naturopathic medicine. Nature is doing her best each moment to make us well. She exists for no other end. Do not resist. With the least inclination to be well, we should not be sick. One of the fundamental principles of naturopathic medicine is the body’s innate ability to spontaneously heal itself. Evidence that this ability exists can be found by examining the . Undoubtedly you have heard this term. A placebo supposedly does not have a medicinal effect, yet these and sham treatments often produce tremendous effects. One of the more dramatic examples of the placebo effect reported in medical literature involves a patient of Dr. Bruno Klopfer, a researcher involved in the testing of the drug Krebiozen back in 1950.¹ Krebiozen had received sensational national publicity as a for cancer. These reports caught the eye of a man with advanced cancer—a lymphosarcoma. The patient, Mr. Wright, had huge tumor masses throughout his body and was in such desperate physical condition that he frequently had to take oxygen by mask, and fluid had to be removed from his chest every two days. When the patient discovered that Dr. Klopfer was involved in research on Krebiozen, he begged to be given Krebiozen treatments. Dr Klopfer gave them, and the patient’s recovery was startling: The tumor masses had melted like snowballs on a hot stove, and in only a few days, they were half their original size! The injections were continued until Mr. Wright was discharged from the hospital and had regained a full and normal life, a complete reversal of his disease and its grim prognosis. However, within two months of his recovery, a report that Krebiozen was not effective was leaked to the press. Learning of this report, Mr. Wright quickly began to revert to his former condition. Suspicious of the patient’s relapse, his doctors decided to take advantage of the opportunity to test the dramatic regenerative capabilities of the mind. The patient was told that a new version of Krebiozen had been developed that overcame the difficulties described in the press, and some of the drug was promised to him as soon as it could be procured. With much pomp and ceremony a saline water placebo was injected, increasing the patient’s expectations to a fevered pitch. Recovery from his second near terminal state was even more dramatic than the first. Mr. Wright’s tumor masses melted, his chest fluid vanished, and he became a true picture of health. The saline water injections were continued, since they worked such wonders. He then remained symptom-free for over two months. Then a definitive announcement appeared in the press: Nationwide tests show Krebiozen to be a worthless drug in the treatment of cancer. Within a few days of this report, Mr. Wright was readmitted to the hospital in dire straits. His faith now gone, his last hope vanished, he died two days later. What is the placebo response? Is it all in a person’s mind? Absolutely not! Recent research demonstrates that the placebo response is a complex phenomenon, initiated by the mind and leading to a cascade of real, measurable effects. In brief, the placebo response is the activation of the healing centers of our being in a way that produces profound physiological changes. The body has two internal mechanisms to maintain health. The first is the inherent internal healing mechanism, vital force, chi, or primitive life support and repair mechanism that operates even in a person who is asleep, unconscious, or comatose. The second mechanism involves the power of the mind and emotions to intervene and affect the course of health and disease in a way that enhances or supersedes the body’s innate vital force. The placebo response seems to involve activation of the higher control center, but that is not to say that its effects are solely in the mind. One of the leading researchers of the placebo response is Dr. Fabrizio Benedetti of the University of Turin in Italy. He has conducted some very detailed studies trying to discover the underlying features of the placebo response.² For example, numerous studies have documented that the pain-relieving effects of a placebo are mediated by endorphins, the body’s own morphine-like substances. In roughly 56% of patients in clinical studies, a placebo saline injection is as effective as morphine for severe pain; furthermore, this pain relief can be completely nullified by adding naloxone, a drug that blocks the effects of morphine, to the saline. As a result of these sorts of experiments, a great deal of the credit for the placebo response has been given to endorphins, but Dr. Benedetti’s research has shown that a placebo can produce much more profound changes than simply increasing endorphin levels. For example, he has shown that a saline placebo can reduce tremors and muscle stiffness in people with Parkinson’s disease. That is not surprising, perhaps, but what is very interesting is that researchers found that at the same time that the placebo produced noticeable improvements in symptoms, there was a significant change in the measured activity of neurons in the patients’ brains as shown by a brain scan. In particular, as they administered the saline they found that individual neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (a common target for surgical attempts to relieve Parkinson’s symptoms) began to fire less often and with fewer —a characteristic feature associated with Parkinson’s tremors. Somehow the saline placebo resulted in the processing of the information by healing centers in the brain to specifically target an effect that would reduce the dysfunction in the areas of the brain affected by Parkinson’s disease. Other studies have shown that both the placebo response and the experience of particular emotions produce demonstrable changes in brain activity visible through modern imaging techniques (e.g., CAT scans and MRIs). For example, one study showed that expectation or hope is able to stimulate the part of the brain that is activated by pain medications and associated with pain relief. In addition, numerous changes in chemical mediators of pain, inflammation, and mood have also been demonstrated with the placebo response. The bottom line here is that there is tremendous evidence that the placebo response is a highly specific and targeted healing effect that is triggered by both conscious and unconscious activity in the brain. Rather than discounting and trying to avoid a placebo response, modern medicine should be more intent on developing techniques and practices designed to stimulate the same healing centers within patients as noted in these studies with placebos. The development of the drug industry is based largely upon the perceived value of the placebo-controlled trial. In order for a drug to be approved it must show a therapeutic effect greater than that of a placebo. Because the outcome of a trial can be affected by both doctors’ and patients’ beliefs about the value of a treatment, most placebo-controlled trials are usually conducted in double-blind fashion: that is, not only are the patients unaware when they are receiving a placebo; the doctors are unaware as well. Nearly all studies conducted this way show some benefit in the placebo group. For example, in 1955 researcher H. K. Beecher published his groundbreaking paper in which he concluded that across the 26 studies he analyzed, an average of 32% of patients responded to a placebo.⁴ This is a generally accepted figure, although there is evidence that under some conditions in real-life clinical practice, placebo response may be as high as 80 to 90%. The reason is that in the real world the placebo response is enhanced by both the doctor’s and the patient’s expectations. Noted Harvard psychologist Herbert Benson, M.D., has described three basic components to heightening a placebo response: the belief and expectation of the patient, the belief and expectation of the physician, and the interaction between the physician and the patient. When these three are in concert, the placebo effect is greatly magnified. Benson believes that the placebo effect yields beneficial clinical results in 60 to 90% of diseases. He states that the placebo has been one of medicine’s most potent assets and it should not be belittled or ridiculed. Unlike most other treatments, it is safe and inexpensive and has withstood the test of time. As powerful as the placebo response is, it still requires activation. If the therapeutic interaction between the physician and the patient does not stimulate the patient’s hope, faith, and belief, the chances of success are measurably diminished no matter how strong or effective a medication may be. It has been repeatedly demonstrated in clinical trials designed to better understand the placebo effect that the beliefs of both the patient and the doctor, as well as their trust in each other and the process, generate a significant portion of the therapeutic results. Conventional medicine often criticizes and belittles therapies that have not been stringently tested using the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, but in doing so it is arguing against something that is time-tested—the art of healing. The bottom line here is that patients of a compassionate, warm, and caring physician will experience better outcomes and fewer medication-related side effects than patients of an uninterested, cold, and uncaring physician. The word comes from the Latin term for Its polar opposite is , Latin for The nocebo effect is just the opposite of the placebo effect.

IN THE PROLOGUE to , Lewis Mehl-Madrona writes that he became convinced years ago that the ancient and modern approaches to illness can and should be integrated in a way that offers patients the benefits of both. He was way ahead of his time. Integration of and medicine is now much in fashion, but this is a very recent change, forced upon the medical profession by powerful economic forces. Our health care system is in total economic collapse, the logical result of medicine’s decision in the early part of this century to wed itself to technology. Now, as the century closes, high-tech treatments are simply too expensive to deliver to people who need them. No one can pay the bills, and hospitals all over the country are facing bankruptcy. At the same time a vast and powerful consumers’ movement has developed away from conventional practice and toward alternative medicine. Recent surveys show that as many as one in three American patients are now going to alternative providers; significantly, most of them do not tell their regular doctors they are doing so. What patients want is doctors who will take the time to listen to their stories and explain their treatment options, who will not just offer drugs, who are conversant with nutritional influences on health, who can make intelligent recommendations about the use of dietary supplements, who will not ridicule herbal medicine, Chinese medicine, homeopathy, and other unorthodox therapies, who are sensitive to mind/body interactions. They want doctors who will look at them as more than just physical bodies. Obviously, our medical schools are not turning out graduates who can meet these demands. Out of desperation about the economic catastrophe befalling it, the medical profession is at last opening to new ideas and practices. About twenty medical schools in the United States now offer elective courses in alternative medicine, a few have centers for the study of complementary therapies, and my own institution, the University of Arizona, has started a Program in Integrative Medicine that will soon begin training doctors to combine the best ideas and practices of conventional and alternative medicine. These developments would have been unthinkable even five years ago. Integration has become a rallying cry of those urging on this reformation. For too long, they say, doctors have regarded patients only as physical bodies, ignoring their minds and spirits. As a result of popular books and television programs, the public has become very enthusiastic about mind/body medicine, not realizing how little of it has penetrated the conventional system. I can see endless possibilities for teaching, research, and practice that take account of emotional and psychological influences on health and illness; in these areas, our work is cut out for us. But what would it mean to try to incorporate a spiritual perspective into medicine? If doctors routinely ignore the mental/emotional components of human beings, they regard spirituality as completely beyond the pale of scientific medicine. Throughout the 1970s I traveled around the world looking at healing practices in other cultures. During that time, I visited many Native American practitioners in North and South America. Always I was struck by the fact that when Indians talk about medicine men and medicine women, their use of the word means more than our use of it. In the Native American conception, Medicine (I will use a capital here) includes not only our medicine (with a small ) but also much of what we call religion and magic. In the ancient world, medicine, religion, and magic were not separate; in our world, they have fallen apart, which is our loss. Good doctoring requires all the wisdom of religion, all the techniques of magic, and all the knowledge of small-medicine to be most effective. One way to bring that perspective back into our health care institutions is to look to Native American Medicine as a resource. Lewis Mehl-Madrona has much to offer here, since he combines the heritage and experience of a Native American healer with very thorough training in conventional allopathic medicine. On top of that, he has great passion about replacing the reigning biomedical model with a new paradigm, and he is a good writer. is not medicine of the past, of cultures that are fading. It is also medicine of the future that must be taught in medical schools, practiced in clinics, and brought to all those who seek true health. I CALLED OUT. An ambulance had rushed in a fifty-two-year-old man. He hadn’t been breathing when the Emergency Medical Technicians arrived at his home. By the time they got him to the ER, he was still warm— as one EMT reported. That gave us enough hope to proceed. The patient was large, diabetic, and known to have heart disease. He had had two prior heart attacks. At his home, the EMTs had given him three doses of epinephrine and two of atropine, both used to try to get his heart working again. They had shocked him twice with a defibrillator before packing him into the ambulance, then shocked him again on the way to our hospital. CPR was still in progress when they arrived. The smaller EMT was standing on the stretcher to push on the patient’s chest. He was dwarfed by the patient’s huge abdomen. The man’s face was blue and his lips had turned an even darker shade of purple. I was readying equipment to intubate him (a procedure that involves inserting a tube into the trachea to ease breathing). The nurses and EMTs were dragging him from the ambulance stretcher onto the ER bed. I yelled, placing the suction catheter tip between his lips to draw out food and mucus. With that gone I opened up the laryngoscope, inserted its blade between the man’s teeth, and pulled his jaw open. My task was to pass the endotracheal tube between his vocal cords (not into the esophagus, as sometimes happens) so that our team could deliver pure oxygen to his lungs. His massive tongue was in the way, but a few adjustments of the blade enabled me to slip the tube safely past it to the man’s lungs. I pulled out the stylet and inflated the cuff to keep it in place. Soon the patient was being properly ventilated by the respiratory therapist. We continued to give him epinephrine and CPR. I grabbed a central line kit and tore it open. We needed IV access to his heart to be sure that the epi had a chance to be effective. I could get the quickest access by putting a needle into the internal jugular vein in his neck. Once I had a good blood flow back into the syringe, I threaded a wire through the needle, pulled the wire through, made a nick in the skin with a scalpel, and then threaded the needle through a very large catheter called a percutaneous sheath. Blood followed. Suddenly we had three large ports to connect to fluids and medicines. We continued our massive doses of epinephrine, and finally the man’s heart started pumping. We had a pulse! The EMT stopped CPR; the pulse continued. He climbed off the patient’s chest. A nurse inflated the blood pressure cuff. Now we had blood pressure, too—albeit a low one. I called out, and other nurses ran to start it. (Dopamine is a hormone used to raise blood pressure above critical limits.) Another large dose of epinephrine raised the man’s blood pressure enough to pump some blood to his brain. He survived long enough to make the helicopter trip to another hospital, one with a surgeon waiting to perform a coronary artery bypass graft. But there, on the operating table, the patient died. The power of emergency medicine had kept him alive for a time but was no match for his chronic diseases. Clearly what he had really needed was help years before to change his diet and his life. Since graduating from Stanford University School of Medicine in 1975, I have practiced scientific and emergency medicine for over two decades, in hospitals from California to New York. I have the utmost respect for what we can do with patients in extremis. But I have also come face-to-face with the many limits of modern medicine. As wonderful as our scientific tools are, we remain unable to heal many of the patients who suffer from chronic illnesses. During these same twenty years I have also observed, assisted with, and finally led Native American healing ceremonies. I came to realize, during medical school, that my Native American heritage was worthy of study and attention, and had a very important lesson to offer contemporary medicine, indeed our whole society’s attitudes toward illness and the recovery of health. For a Native American, a healing is a spiritual journey. As most people intuitively grasp (except maybe doctors, who are trained to disbelieve the idea), what happens to the body reflects what is happening in the mind and the spirit. People get well. But before a person can do so, he or she must often undergo a transformation—of lifestyle, emotions, and spirit—besides making the necessary shift in the physical body. Healing and doctoring are distinct pursuits. Having tried both, I saw years ago that both were tremendously—and differently—powerful. It is no exaggeration to say that healers and doctors inhabit different worlds. Nonetheless, I became convinced years ago that the ancient and modern approaches to illness can and should be integrated in a way that offers patients the benefits of both. Modern doctors must learn to take their patients on spiritual journeys. Those who do not will miss out on some of the most incredible tools consciousness has developed for our benefit. Personal transformation is no match for emergency trauma care. There are still a few old men and women who know the ancient bone-setting and wound-cauterizing techniques, but that kind of medicine is dying out along with its practitioners. And if the man with diabetic dehydration, renal failure, and pulmonary embolism had sought out a shaman instead of an ER, he would most likely have died. Ceremonial medicine isn’t designed to deal with that level of complication. It can deal with very serious and chronic disease, however. I have seen cancers, neurological disorders, anginas, glandular and other disease cured without (or sometimes in spite of) surgical or pharmaceutical interventions. We all carry within our souls the capacity to heal ourselves. There are different ways to tap into the soul’s riches. I have learned the Native American way; I believe patients and practitioners alike have much to gain by taking a look at our traditions. Within my ancestors’ model, there are many more functions for medicine than objectifying the body’s parts. For a Native American healer, the first step in treating a person is to listen. We climb into the world of the patient and see things through his or her eyes. This means we listen without judging or categorizing—we never simply take a history of prior complaints, procedures, and allergies. The next step is to have the patient create a metaphor for the illness. With such a concrete image of the illness, a healer can construct a ceremony to fight it. The ceremony can take many different forms. What kind of ceremony to conduct depends on the images the patient has used to describe the illness. The exact details of the ceremony cannot be specified in advance. The patient must be central to the ceremony, not a passive onlooker. As a modern medical doctor and a Native American trained in the practices of traditional healing, I can provide a unique and accurate perspective on both Western and Native American medicine. I’d like to bridge the gap between the old and the new, so that each culture may profit from the wisdom of the other. The foundation of this bridge is the Native American concept of interconnection between body, mind, and spirit. By realizing that most everything in our lives, including disease, is simultaneously a physical, emotional, social, and spiritual phenomenon, we will be closer to attaining true health and contentment. Should conventional doctors be more like shamans? Should they care for the souls of their patients? Does every community need a healer as much as it needs a doctor? Should medicine men and women teach in medical schools, alongside priests, ministers, and Buddhist nuns? I hope to give you some perspective from which to consider these questions as I tell the story of my own twin journeys through the worlds of medicine and the spirit. I STARTED medical school expecting to become a research scientist. While still in college, I had joined a professor in his efforts to study biological membranes using a then-new technique called magnetic resonance imaging (now referred to by its acronym, MRI). As a member of his research team, I was named as a co-author of a paper he published on the work, and I imagine my acceptance into Stanford in the early 1970s was based partly on my participation in this new line of research. Indeed, I soon found a professor in my new California home with whom I intended to continue these studies. What I never expected was to become a clinician, focused less on research than on seeing patients. At Stanford I actually started clinical work immediately. I had pushed myself to finish high school before turning sixteen, and as an undergraduate at Indiana University I had persuaded professors to let me take medical and graduate school biochemistry courses. These gave me advanced standing when I entered Stanford at age eighteen. As long as I took a necessary pharmacology course concurrently, I was ready to start seeing patients on clinical rotations. I was on track to finish medical school in June of 1975, with the required nine-quarter minimum. A decade later I learned I was Stanford’s youngest ever peacetime graduate, at twenty-one years of age. The challenging part for me was not in learning about pharmacology and anatomy but in understanding other doctors. There were numbing lists to memorize, of course, of nerves, muscles, bones, blood vessels, symptoms, diseases, drugs, and side effects; but compared with the knottier puzzles of philosophy or higher mathematics, nothing taught was all that difficult. There was plenty to memorize, but all memorization takes is time. The problem for me was that my interpersonal skills had languished in my race through high school and college. Thankfully, I had a new wife to coach me in the car on the way to dinner parties and social events. Professionally, though, I was on my own. Medical students on clinical rotations were expected to examine patients and entertain a diagnosis. We would discuss our potential diagnoses, and the treatments and medications they implied, with the faculty physician. The challenge was to show that we had considered every possible diagnosis and had either ruled it out or planned the necessary tests to confirm or disconfirm its existence. Although most patients suffer from common diseases, we relished considering all the outlandish possibilities. First prize went to those who, in the end, turned in exactly the diagnosis our faculty physician had already reached—we had to learn his or her style and mimic it. At nineteen, much to my own detriment, I was still young enough to be idealistic. I thought it was more important to think for myself than to try to think like someone else. I also thought other doctors shared my own ideal of medicine: that its purpose was to restore unwell persons to health. Imagine my surprise on hearing a renowned professor of internal medicine begin a lecture by noting that the physician’s job lay in slowing and making less painful the patient’s inexorable and inevitable progression toward death and decay. Despite this my first rotation—three months in neurosurgery—was challenging and rewarding. I had already done work in college on the neural functions of rats. I was studying a particular brain rhythm, hoping to show that a molecule called serotonin triggered it. To do this, I implanted electrodes into rats’ brains, then measured what happened when I introduced serotonin to different sites of their limbic systems. If the rhythm was produced by the serotonin, I would have strong evidence that serotonin was a neurotransmitter—a message sent by a nerve to the cells in the vicinity. Neurotransmitter molecules are the only verbs a nerve has at its command; which molecules are produced, and how many, determine a message’s content. At the time, scientists were certain of only two neurotransmitters; we have since identified twenty-six. These few molecules and the simple messages they carry from one to another of our three billion brain cells are the vital chemistry behind human thought. Although this wasn’t the concern at the outset, neurotransmitter research eventually had the practical yield of all sorts of drugs. Now we know, for instance, that serotonin depletion often accompanies depression. Drugs that increase the availability of serotonin, like Prozac, are common treatments for depression. Prozac, which belongs to a class of drugs known as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, works by blocking the enzymes that cause serotonin to be reabsorbed. I found that rat brains produced the theta rhythm I was interested in when serotonin was introduced to certain sites of the hippocampus—which, in plain language, meant that serotonin was indeed a neurotransmitter, at least for rats. This was a publishable result. With my professor’s advice and assistance, I finished my first solo paper and published it in a neurosurgery journal. I was very proud to become a part of a centuries-old tradition of expanding the known limits of scientific knowledge. Since I already loved research, it was no surprise to find the data-gathering aspect of the neurosurgery rotation appealing. But I was unprepared to find how much I enjoyed simply working with people, practicing clinical medicine. Even if I was still more comfortable in a lab than on a ward, two months into the rotation I was starting to consider a career that wasn’t pure research but combined research with clinical work. Perhaps I would become a pediatric neurosurgeon. Three months later I was on my second rotation, in urology, about to meet the four very sick men who would challenge my career plans even more profoundly. It was a foggy April morning outside the renal room of the Intensive Care Unit at San Mateo County Medical Center (SMCMC), a major teaching hospital of Stanford University. A nurse introduced me in a perfunctory manner to the first three of the four men inside. There was little hope for them. The fourth man—whom I will call Juan Martinez—had a chance to survive. He was a forty-two-year-old carpenter from Los Gatos, in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. He had lost one of his kidneys in a San Jose hospital. After the operation, his remaining kidney had stopped working. When Señor Martinez’s twenty-three-year-old daughter offered him one of her healthy kidneys, he had been transferred to SMCMC’s renal room to be evaluated for a transplant. My job was to begin a pre-transplant evaluation of Sr. Martinez to decide if there was any reason not to proceed with the surgery. I wondered what had happened to the man before he lost his kidney—what had brought him here. I started by asking when he had last been well. We had to speak up to be heard over the bustling doctors, the efficient nurses, the constant drone of the voice of the paging operator (these were the days before beepers). Only his three drugged roommates were quiet. The carpenter was lying on his back, holding himself perfectly still, looking more like a quadriplegic than a dialysis patient. His face had the texture of an onion skin. His muscled arms lay uselessly on the sheets. He took longer to answer than I expected; he seemed to be searching for an answer to a question much bigger than mine. Finally he said, I asked. He was avoiding looking at me, focusing instead on the grains in the ceiling panels overhead. Sr. Martinez said flatly. His usually dark Hispanic complexion was blushing ocher, and he began to cry quietly. His jaw continued working after he spoke, as if there were more to say but no words with which to say it. I glanced out the window. The morning’s fog had dissolved into a light rain, unusual weather for April in San Mateo. Water ran slowly in crazy currents down the window panes. I found myself shivering. What do you mean, there was nothing wrong with you? I asked when it was clear that the carpenter wasn’t going to go on. He was clutching the bedsheet. They said I had protein in my urine—but I didn’t feel bad or nothing, the man said without emotion. His face was expressionless except for the silent tears in the corners of his eyes. They ran some tests. Then more tests. They took a biopsy of my kidney, and I got this infection that almost killed me. The man gazed down the length of his sheet-covered body. he said. His jaw stopped working and his lips began to quiver. Our conference was interrupted by an officious nurse who had come to change his IV. Feeling worried and confused about what had happened to her charge, I left her to the task. LATER THAT MORNING I read his chart in the conference room behind the nurses’ station. Just a few months earlier, he had been framing houses in the canyons outside San Jose. On weekends he went hunting and fishing in the northern California wilderness. His doctor had discovered the traces of protein in his urine during a routine insurance physical. Proteinuria can be a normal enough finding in a person who has been exercising strenuously, but it can also be an early sign of serious kidney ailments and autoimmune diseases. Although Sr. Martinez had no symptoms of any of these problems, his internist ordered a full workup. A series of ordinarily innocuous medical procedures had led, for Martinez, to the worst possible complications. After his doctors biopsied a kidney, Martinez got an infection, then began to hemorrhage. His doctors repaired that damage by removing the injured left kidney; Martinez’s right kidney responded by shutting down. He developed sepsis, an infection of the blood that can spread anywhere in the body. Doctors at SMCMC managed to clear up the infection but couldn’t get the right kidney working again. Martinez’s best hope now was a new kidney. As for the biopsy that had kicked off the whole process, it had been inconclusive. Nobody had any idea why Martinez had once had traces of protein in his urine, and now nobody was trying to find out. That problem—if it had ever been a problem—no longer seemed important. I sat in the conference room looking out the hospital’s narrow windows at the rain and thinking about the man in the room on the other side of the nurses’ station. His old charts and records were heaped on the table before me. I thought of the dark forests of northern California, where Sr. Martinez had hunted, of the deep lakes the forests held, of the ancient trails that led up past the timberline into a world of rock and ice and snow—a world Juan Martinez might never see again. Then I reread his chart, hoping for some clue to his predicament. I was still searching when a resident in urology, Musaf Habra, walked in and set two Styrofoam cups of tea on the table. Dr. Habra was a Saudi general practitioner who wanted to teach at the Saudi Medical Center in Riyadh after he finished training as a urologist at SMCMC He was the sort of gentle man whose constitutional kindness can be mistaken for weakness. He had won my admiration at a recent party, where he played the violin with a sensitivity that was anything but weak. he asked, nodding at the charts on the table. Dr. Habra gave me a quizzical look. I said. The logic behind the biopsy, I suppose. I’m trying to understand how this could have happened. He shrugged and pushed one of the cups of tea toward me. His doctor wanted to know what was causing his proteinuria, Habra said in a matter-of-fact tone that served to mask what he thought about the whole thing. I countered. And I can’t find anything in his chart that indicates any other symptoms or diseases. Habra thought a moment and lowered his already quiet voice. And he had the ‘advantage’ of the best preventive health care in the world. ""wouldn’t have biopsied him ,But you Americans are so much more advanced than we Saudi.Wanting to know the answers to everything can be deadly."" He parodicd his own accent a little, lending it a playful hint of intrigue. I agreed with Habra’s critique but was hurt to be included by him among Of course I was one, but I didn’t identify at all with the culture that lay behind the unnecessary renal biopsy that had destroyed the carpenter’s health. I wanted Habra to see me as something more than just another American. I was a American, for one thing, and I hoped that somehow made me different. It seemed to me my medical student friends and I were more like Habra than he knew. A small group of us were naturally drawn together—Native Americans, Hispanics, and Asians—because we all had different cultural perspectives from those prevalent at Stanford. Though we didn’t have strong social ties, we did hang out together in school. It took the edge off our feeling of not belonging. Some of my fellows had come to Stanford straight from their reservations and found themselves in an entirely new, often incomprehensible culture. Spurred by my new friendships, I began to reconsider my own Native American heritage, which my mother had long ago turned her back on. While I was thinking about what Dr. Habra had said, David Vickory breezed into the conference room. Dr. Vickory was a decisive, energetic man with an encyclopedic knowledge of kidneys. In his late thirties, Vickory was juggling two ambitious careers, running a busy research lab and simultaneously winning a reputation as one of the best nephrologist—kidney specialists—in the country. he said, rubbing his hands together as if they were cold, what do you think of my man, Martinez—is he a good candidate for transplant, or what? Dr. Habra thought for a moment. he started. Dr. Vickory interjected. His fever has long since lifted. He’s ready for the knife. Unless … He turned a chair backward and straddled it. His tone was challenging. He waited barely an instant and turned toward me. —he glanced at my name tag—""Mehl. Did find something I missed?"" he continued in his light, teasing tone, you do look troubled. Our man is stable. We’ve cleared his infection. We’ve got a kidney standing by. And still something worries you. I said slowly, I’m struggling to understand how he got here in the first place. Vickory’s face went blank for a moment, and his cheerful demeanor vanished. You have a question about how patients get infections? On one level, it would be a ridiculous question for a medical student to ask: even premeds know that microbes cause infection. But on another level, the question was worth pondering. Why did this particular patient succumb to microbes when most others do not? The first question would be too basic and the second too philosophical to warrant discussion in the urology conference room. Vickory was trying to figure out which of these transgressions I had made. I saved him the trouble. Of course I know what causes infection. I was wondering why we did a renal biopsy on a healthy man. Vickory corrected. He had proteinuria. That’s something we work up. It’s the standard of care, as you know—or should know. He could probably see the beads of sweat on my forehead starting to form. I hadn’t started out to challenge his authority, but I could see Vickory was thinking I had. I countered. I could see Habra pursing his lips and shaking his head, but I couldn’t understand this taboo on discussing the biopsy. Vickory, after all, was not the one who’d ordered it, so even if it had been a mistake, it wasn’t his. It just seems like they could have waited to see if there were any real problems before going for a piece of the guy’s kidney. Vickory asked. He stroked his chin with his thumb and forefinger and pretended to think about it for just an instant. But those of us who study kidneys for a living have found that guys who have protein in their urine usually do have a real problem. Maybe someday you’ll show us how to identify the lucky ones who don’t. Until then, we’re just going to have to stumble along doing biopsies. We know from experience that we’ll find a lot of renal disease that way. We also know that in a few cases—not many, but a few—there’ll be infection. His voice was intentionally slow and flat. It’s unfortunate, but it’s life. And it’s irrelevant to the business at hand—which is whether or not to give Martinez a new kidney. That’s the question on the table this morning, he said, rapping hard on its Formica surface with two fingers. So you let me know if you see any reason we shouldn’t transplant this guy. Until then, Dr. Mehl— Vickory nodded dismissively and walked out of the room. I felt stunned and embarrassed. My heart had hammered through every long second of his speech; I wasn’t used to conflict, and it frightened me. I was young, I worried what people might think of my youth, and I wanted desperately to do well to compensate. I was scared of Vickory. How could I have had the audacity to challenge him? said Habra. If you keep acting like that, you’ll never graduate. I was surprised to hear no trace of sympathy in his voice. Although I had not expected him to stick his neck out to defend me from Vickory, I thought at least he would be a confederate afterward. He shook his head as he gathered up the charts. You might consider which you want to do, debate the philosophy of medicine or become a doctor anytime soon. I muttered in a voice barely audible over the background noise of the hospital. he said without inflection. It was hard to tell whether he meant what he said or precisely the opposite. WHEN HABRA AND I went back to see Señor Martinez later that day, we found him lying deathly still on his back, moving only his eyes—from Habra to me and back again. He looked bewildered while Habra spoke to him. Habra told him, if that is what you truly want. But I insist that your daughter talk to the psychiatrist. She must know what she’s risking. She must know what the chances are that you’ll reject her kidney. She must know what she’s getting into, and I must know that she knows or I would never forgive myself. Habra had surprised me again. In the few months I’d spent on rotations, I hadn’t come across any other doctors who would consider holding this kind of conversation with a patient, acknowledging that it was possible for the physician to be emotionally affected by a treatment’s outcome. But if Martinez was surprised or moved by hearing a doctor mention his own feelings of guilt or responsibility, he didn’t show it. His eyes continued to float like the bubbles in his leveling tool, looking for a spot on the ceiling to comfort him. Dr. Habra said, placing one of his cards on the bedside table. He searched the corners of the room for clues about how to proceed. he told the carpenter shortly, standing up from the bedside chair. We will see you in the morning and talk again then. Martinez managed a nod. Habra rubbed his eyes as we made our way to the next bed, where lay Dr. Jackson, a forty-eight-year-old professor of English from the University of California at Santa Cruz. His story was nearly identical to his neighbor’s, beginning with proteinuria and ending with two useless kidneys. Dr. Jackson’s infection, however, was out of control, and dialysis was failing to cleanse his blood adequately. Habra and I had been asked to determine if surgical removal of his kidneys and debridement of the region (cleaning out the infected tissue) might help. It might, we decided, and should be tried, because it was his only chance to beat the infection. But even this radical treatment might fail. Unless our debridement was accompanied by a miracle, Dr. Jackson did not have a very good chance of leaving the hospital alive. Neither did a fifty-one-year-old store clerk, Mr. Brasher, nor a thirty-seven-year-old postal worker, Mr. Brown—two more men who had begun with protein in their urine and no other symptoms, who had run the gamut from biopsy to infection to the loss of kidney function. We trudged past their beds, murmuring short greetings and shorter good-byes. When we finished rounds, we ducked into the cafeteria. Habra bought himself a Coke. he said, that in any one morning we would do four such similar consults, that four men who had been well before visiting their physicians would all be lying in the same room together? I responded carefully. I wanted to know what Habra thought, but after the episode with Vickory, I was reluctant to set anybody else off. It seems like something must be wrong with three people dying because of their physicians’ best efforts. Habra nodded. The rain had stopped and the sun was starting to shine. We walked outside. Habra asked. No one amputated the wrong leg or prescribed incorrectly. No one missed a disease or made the wrong diagnosis. Perhaps Vickory is right—perhaps this is the price we pay for good preventive health care. I ventured. The chairs were still too wet for us to sit down. Habra said, but you can’t quote me. Anyway, my opinion carries no weight. I asked. Habra suggested. After all, they were faithfully following the guidelines of our profession. We were leaning against the rough concrete walls of the building. We could see planes landing and taking off through the mist covering the San Francisco Bay. I asked, genuinely agonized. If you kill the patient, can you call the operation successful? I finished my tea. Squirrels were climbing up and down the trees, and birds squawked overhead.

17d1a0d9-f54e-450a-a3e1-1b05d618115c,"Eastern medicine compared to western, do you have a preference? I have always believed that Eastern medicine is better than the traditional or more recognized practices of Western medicine. One reason I believe this is because I have used and benefited from the use of chiropractic treatment. Through the use of spinal manipulation, along with the use of medical massages, I am able to function on a daily basis without the aggravation of aches and pains and without the use of drugs or invasive surgeries. care is not the only form of Eastern that I have used and certainly is not the only form of treatment available. Several other practices are available and I think you as a reader will agree that all are safer and more natural than the traditional methods of Western medicine. Allow me to explain and outline aThe main focus point of all these treatments is to treat the body as an entire entity, not just one ailment at a time. Eastern medicine is built on the belief of healing someone from the inside out, not just treating a single symptom or ailment. Treatments include education about exercise, nutrition, and lifestyle intervention. Using these techniques is a way to provide not only relief but, to treat, cure and prevent an ailment from reoccurring. The goal is for the body to maintain a state of homeostasis. Eastern medicine is not as commercialized as Western medicine, but that doesn’t mean it is ineffective. You may be surprised to learn that the earliest Western drug for smallpox occurred in 1796 but, China had developed and used this remedy 200 years prior. Doctors from Russia and Turkey were sent to China to learn small pox inoculation from the Chinese ! I have talked a lot about Eastern medicine and the benefits that come with it, now let’s take a look at Western medicine The Importance Of Complementary And Alternative Medicine Based on the research it is, maybe not all but most. It helps and it is safer than prescribed Western Medicine, it helps effectively and reduces symptoms. A lot of herbal medicine is hard to find but it is sometimes more affordable than modern medicine. There is a lot of research done about it. “The similarities and the differences between herbal ingredients and western drugs were deeply explored” ( Peng 10). Complementary therapy takes a holistic approach to healing the body. This is an inexpensive type of treatment can be used in conjunction with conventional medicine, which is the using of drugs to treat illnesses and other health conditions, in order to reintroduce balance in the functionality of an individual. On the other hand, when used in place of conventional medicine it is referred to as alternative medicine. It is believed that an individual need to be completely balanced holistically to be considered healthy; this means that the mind, body and spirit needs to be treated along with any illness that occurs. Complementary therapy takes many forms that falls under five (5) categories: Mind-body therapies, biologically based therapies, For example, meditation and acupuncture were practices in China. Dissection, operations and drug therapy were also performed. But how did theses societies – who did not have as much technology as today – found out about the different illnesses and their cures? The western medicines usually compromise the use of folk remedies and prayers. They now believed that sickness was not a result of punishments sent from gods, but something ‘natural’. (1) The ideas that the ancient Chinese had about the organs of the body, and their functions, as well as the causes and development of disease, show large differences when compared with Western medicine. (2) The Chinese do not think of theory, as we do in the West, as needing to be proven to reach the highest degree of truth. A Chinese doctor can look at the kidney as a machine and think of it as a reflection of universe. (2) He can apply two different disease classification systems, cold damage or warm damage where he feels it is appropriate, without being deterred by contradictions between the two. (3) One (Western) method of gaining knowledge is analysis. Health is considered a complete wellness of a body including physical, mental and social well-being and Holistic Health is considered a wellness of a whole body including mind, body and spirit. According to American Holistic Medicine Association “Holistic medicine is the art and science of healing that addresses the whole person – body, mind and spirit” (Wollumbin, page 3). Holistic Health is an alternate way to treat, prevent, and wellness of an illness and achieves the best possible level of health. It focuses on the whole body rather than just symptoms or diseases. It is an approach to heal the physical, psychological, environmental, spiritual, nutritional health of one’s being. Western Vs. Eastern Medicine: Western And Western Medicine Eastern medicine is all natural with no dangerous sides effects. The healing process takes longer but general outcomes can often be longer lasting. The cost of treatment is substantially lower yet most are still not recognized as healthcare by insurance companies therefore, are not covered. Eastern medicine is not a substitute for conventional healthcare but, by a composition of Western medicines scientific knowledge and the holistic approach of Eastern medicine, we could actually maximize our healing potential. The Rise in Popularity of Alternative Medicine over Mainstream Medicine In addition, there is no ""father"" of alternative medicine who is solely responsible for its growth. In fact, the recent upsurge in popularity of alternative medicine has been a gradual process aided by the establishment of health maintenance organizations which favour cost-effective alternative therapy programs over costly surgical and chronic illness procedures. Acupuncture, for example, is an ancient technique which originated in China as long ago as 2689 B.C. it is the stimulation of special points on the body usually with fine needles. Yoga is also among the oldest known systems of health practiced in the world today. Compare And Contrast Chinese Medicine And Western Medicine The western and eastern hemispheres have very different approaches to health and medicine. In western hemisphere countries, such as the United States, medical practices are very scientific. Medicines and surgeries are common practices for the treatment of various ailments in western medical practices. Countries in the eastern hemisphere, such as China, are much more spiritual and energy based in their medicine. Many of Chinese medical practices have survived from ancient time because of their success. Holistic Medicine: The Use Of Medicine And Modern Medicine Holistic medicine provides countless natural ways to cure the pains of the body. The concern for the health of an individual should not stop when the pain disappears for the time being. Medicine must focus on the body throughout a lifetime. In addition, wellness should incorporate the whole body as found in the practice of holistic medicine. The methods of holistic medicine are less expensive and are more accessible to individuals. This way you can get the most effective product and be safe at the same time. I think that this new era of using natural herbal medicine is great and I support it greatly. Trying something new for a change is good. Even though some kinds of herbal medicine can produce harmful effects, many of the others are good.

Medicinal Mushrooms (PDQ®): Integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies - Patient Information [NCI] Medicinal Mushrooms (PDQ®): Integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies - Patient Information [NCI] This information is produced and provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The information in this topic may have changed since it was written. For the most current information, contact the National Cancer Institute via the Internet web site at http://cancer.gov or call 1-800-4-CANCER. Medicinal mushrooms are mushrooms that are used as medicine. They have been used to treat infection for hundreds of years, mostly in Asia. Today, medicinal mushrooms are also used to treat lung diseases and cancer. For more than 30 years, medicinal mushrooms have been approved as an addition to standard cancer treatments in Japan and China. In these countries, mushrooms have been used safely for a long time, either alone or combined with radiation or chemotherapy. In Asia, there are more than 100 types of mushrooms used to treat cancer. Some of the more common ones are Ganoderma lucidum (reishi), Trametes versicolor or Coriolus versicolor (turkey tail), Lentinus edodes (shiitake), and Grifola frondosa (maitake). Mushrooms are being studied to find out how they affect the immune system and if they stop or slow the growth of tumors or kill tumor cells. It is thought that certain chemical compounds, such as polysaccharides in turkey tail mushrooms, strengthen the immune system to fight cancer. This PDQ cancer information summary gives an overview of the use of medicinal mushrooms in treating cancer. The following information is given for Trametes versicolor, also called Coriolus versicolor (turkey tail), and (reishi): Questions and Answers About Turkey Tail and Polysaccharide-K (PSK) What is turkey tail? Turkey tail is a type of mushroom that grows on dead logs worldwide. It's named turkey tail because its rings of brown and tan look like the tail feathers of a turkey. Its scientific name is Trametes versicolor or Coriolus versicolor. In traditional Chinese medicine, it is known as Yun Zhi. In Japan, it is known as kawaratake (roof tile fungus). There are many other types of Trametes mushrooms. It can be hard to tell the difference between turkey tail and other types of Trametes mushrooms without the use of special testing. Turkey tail has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat lung diseases for many years. In Japan, turkey tail has been used to strengthen the immune system when given with standard cancer treatment. What is PSK? Polysaccharide K (PSK) is the best known active compound in turkey tail mushrooms. In Japan, PSK is an approved mushroom product used to treat cancer. How is PSK given or taken? Have any laboratory or animal studies been done using PSK? In laboratory studies, tumor cells are used to test a substance to find out if it is likely to have any anticancer effects. In animal studies, tests are done to see if a drug, procedure, or treatment is safe and effective in animals. Laboratory and animal studies are done before a substance is tested in people. Laboratory and animal studies have tested the effects of PSK on the immune system, including immune cells called natural killer cells and T-cells. See the Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies section of the health professional version of Medicinal Mushrooms for information on laboratory and animal studies done using PSK. Have any studies of PSK been done in people? PSK has been studied in patients with gastric cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer. It has been used as adjuvant therapy in thousands of cancer patients since the mid-1970s. PSK has been safely used in people for a long time in Japan and few side effects have been reported. Studies show that the use of PSK as adjuvant therapy in patients with gastric (stomach) cancer may help repair immune cell damage caused by chemotherapy and strengthen the immune system. Studies of PSK as adjuvant therapy for gastric cancer include the following: A randomized clinical trial in Japan done between 1978 and 1981 included 751 patients who had surgery for gastric cancer. After surgery, patients received chemotherapy with or without PSK. On average, the patients who received chemotherapy and PSK lived longer than those who received chemotherapy alone. The researchers believe it might be possible to predict which patients would benefit the most from PSK depending on the numbers of granulocytes and lymphocytes in the patient's blood. In 1994, a study in Japan followed 262 patients who had successful surgery for gastric cancer and were given chemotherapy with or without PSK. Patients who received chemotherapy and PSK were less likely to have recurrent cancer and lived longer than those who did not. Treatment with PSK caused few side effects. The researchers thought the study showed that PSK and chemotherapy should be given to gastric cancer patients after surgery to remove the cancer. A review published in 2007 combined results from 8 randomized controlled trials in 8,009 patients who had surgery to remove gastric cancers. After surgery, patients in the trials were given chemotherapy with or without PSK. The results suggest that receiving chemotherapy and PSK helped patients live longer after surgery. In a phase I clinical trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, a product made with turkey tail was given to a small group of patients with breast cancer following radiation therapy. There was an increase in natural killer cells and other cancer-fighting cells in the immune system. Studies of PSK as adjuvant therapy for colorectal cancer include the following: PSK was studied in a randomized clinical trial for its effect on the immune system in patients with stage II or stage III rectal cancer. Patients received chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with or without PSK. This study found that PSK increased the number of cancer-killing immune cells and had anticancer effects in tissue that received radiation therapy. A review that combined results from 3 studies in 1,094 patients with colorectal cancer found that patients who received PSK were less likely to have recurrent cancer and lived longer than those who did not. Studies of PSK as adjuvant therapy for patients with lung cancer include the following: Five nonrandomized clinical trials reported that patients treated with PSK and radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy lived longer. Six randomized clinical trials in patients with lung cancer studied chemotherapy with or without PSK. The studies showed that patients who received PSK improved in one or more ways, including immune function, body weight, well-being, tumor-related symptoms, or longer survival. Have any side effects or risks been reported from turkey tail or PSK? There have been few side effects reported in studies of PSK in Japan. Is turkey tail or PSK approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the use of turkey tail or its active compound PSK as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition. The FDA does not approve dietary supplements as safe or effective. The company that makes the dietary supplements is responsible for making sure that they are safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer. The way that supplements are made is not regulated, so all batches and brands of mushroom supplements may not be the same. What is reishi? Reishi is a type of mushroom that grows on live trees. Scientists may call it either or . In traditional Chinese medicine, this group of mushrooms is known as Ling Zhi. In Japan, they are known as Reishi. In China, is known as Chizhi and is known as Zizhi. There are many other types of mushrooms and it is hard to tell the medicinal mushrooms from the other types. Reishi has been used as medicine for a very long time in East Asia. It was thought to prolong life, prevent aging, and increase energy. In China, it is being used to strengthen the immune system of cancer patients who receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy. How is reishi given or taken? Reishi is usually dried and taken as an extract in the form of a liquid, capsule, or powder. Have any laboratory or animal studies been conducted using reishi? In laboratory studies, tumor cells are used to test a new substance and find out if it is likely to have any anticancer effects. In animal studies, tests are done to see if a drug, procedure, or treatment is safe and effective in animals. Laboratory and animal studies are done before a substance is tested in people. Laboratory and animal studies have tested the effects of the active ingredients in reishi mushrooms, triterpenoids and polysaccharides, on tumors, including lung cancer. See the Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies section of the health professional version of Medicinal Mushrooms for information on laboratory and animal studies done using reishi. Have any studies of reishi mushrooms been done in people? Studies using products made from reishi have been done in China and Japan. Studies suggest that the use of products made from reishi as adjuvant therapy may help strengthen the immune system in patients with lung cancer. Studies in patients with lung cancer include the following: In an open-label trial done in China, 36 patients with advanced lung cancer were given an over-the-counter product made from reishi called Ganopoly. The patients were being treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, along with other complementary therapies. Some patients had marked changes in the immune responses being studied, such as lymphocyte count and natural killer cell activity, and some patients had no change in immune response. A similar study of Ganopoly in 47 patients with colorectal cancer showed the same results. In China, a study was done with 12 lung cancer patients. Their blood was tested to see if taking a product made from reishi could help improve immune response. The study found that the polysaccharides in reishi mushrooms may help cancer-fighting immune cells, called lymphocytes, stay active. The following study looked at reishi for the prevention of colorectal cancer: In Japan, 225 patients with benign colorectal tumors were studied. For 12 months, 123 of the patients were given an extract of the mushroom mycelia (MAK), while 102 patients did not receive treatment with MAK. At 12 months, a follow-up colonoscopy was done on all the patients. The number and the size of the tumors decreased in the group that received MAK, but not in the group that did not receive MAK. The researchers suggest that MAK may help stop benign colorectal tumors from forming. Is reishi approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the use of reishi as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition. The FDA does not approve dietary supplements as safe or effective. The company that makes the dietary supplements is responsible for making sure they are safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer. The way that supplements are made is not regulated, so all batches and brands of mushroom supplements may not be the same. Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. The NCI Best Case Series Program which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients' medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research.

Milk Thistle (PDQ®): Integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies - Patient Information [NCI] Milk Thistle (PDQ®): Integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies - Patient Information [NCI] This information is produced and provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The information in this topic may have changed since it was written. For the most current information, contact the National Cancer Institute via the Internet web site at http://cancer.gov or call 1-800-4-CANCER. Milk thistle is a plant whose fruit and seeds are used for liver and bile duct disorders (see Question 1). Milk thistle is usually taken in capsules or tablets (see Question 2). Studies of milk thistle have been done in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and head and neck cancer (see Question 4). Side effects from the use of milk thistle or silymarin are mild (see Question 5). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved the use of milk thistle as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition (see Question 6). Milk thistle is available in the United States as a dietary supplement (see Question 6). What is milk thistle? Milk thistle is a plant whose fruit and seeds have been used for more than 2,000 years as a treatment for liver and bile duct disorders. Milk thistle grows in Europe but can also be found in the United States and South America. Silymarin, found in milk thistle seeds, is a mixture that contains compounds, such as silybin, isosilybin, silychristin and isosilychristin, silydianin, and taxifolin. Most studies have been done in silymarin or silybin, instead of the whole plant. The botanical name for milk thistle is Silybum marianum. Milk thistle is also called holy thistle, Marian thistle, Mary thistle, St. Mary thistle, Our Lady's thistle, wild artichoke, Mariendistel (German), and Chardon-Marie (French). How is milk thistle taken or given? Milk thistle is usually taken by mouth in capsules or tablets. In Europe silybin is given by intravenous infusion as the only treatment for Amanita phalloides, a mushroom toxin that causes death. Have any laboratory or animal studies been done using milk thistle? In laboratory studies, tumor cells are used to test a substance to find out if it is likely to have any anticancer effects. In animal studies, tests are done to see if a drug, procedure, or treatment is safe and effective in animals. Laboratory and animal studies are done before a substance is tested in people. Laboratory and animal studies have tested the effects of milk thistle in laboratory experiments. Silymarin, the active substance found in milk thistle seeds, and silybin A and B, the major components of silymarin, have been studied in laboratory research. See the Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies section of the health professional version of Milk Thistle for information on laboratory and animal studies done using milk thistle. Have any studies of milk thistle been done in people? Several small studies have looked at whether milk thistle can be used to decrease side effects of cancer treatment. A randomized clinical trial in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia found that silymarin decreased the side effects of chemotherapy on the liver without harming the cancer treatment. A randomized clinical trial in men with prostate cancer who had surgery to remove their prostate found that taking silymarin and selenium improved quality of life, lowered cholesterol, and increased the amount of selenium in the blood. A randomized clinical trial of 30 patients with head and neck cancer who had radiation therapy found that those who took silymarin for 6 weeks had lower rates of radiation-related mucositis compared to those who did not. A nonrandomized observational study in women with breast cancer who had surgery and radiation therapy found that a silymarin-based cream helped prevent patients from having skin rashes from radiation therapy. A number of clinical trials have studied milk thistle in the treatment of patients with hepatitis, cirrhosis, mushroom poisoning, or bile duct disorders. These trials have used a wide range of doses with mixed results. In a trial of biologic therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis, patients taking silymarin had less symptoms and a better quality of life compared to patients not taking silymarin. Silymarin has been found to help with iron chelation therapy, which removes extra iron in the blood of patients who have had many blood transfusions. Have any side effects or risks been reported from milk thistle? Very few side effects from the use of milk thistle or silymarin have been reported. Several large studies in patients with liver disorders have found that taking silymarin may rarely have a laxative effect or cause nausea, heartburn, or stomach upset. At high doses, mild allergic reactions have been seen. Is milk thistle approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the use of milk thistle as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition. Milk thistle is available in the United States as a dietary supplement. Dietary supplements are products meant to be added to the diet. They are not drugs and are not meant to treat, prevent, or cure diseases. The company that makes the dietary supplements is responsible for making sure they are safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer. The FDA does not approve dietary supplements as safe or effective before they are sold. Use our clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

Aromatherapy With Essential Oils (PDQ®): Integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies - Patient Information [NCI] Aromatherapy With Essential Oils (PDQ®): Integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies - Patient Information [NCI] This information is produced and provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The information in this topic may have changed since it was written. For the most current information, contact the National Cancer Institute via the Internet web site at http://cancer.gov or call 1-800-4-CANCER. Aromatherapy is the use of essential oils from plants (flowers, herbs, or trees) as therapy to improve physical, mental, and spiritual well-being (see Question 1). Aromatherapy may be used with other complementary treatments, such as massage or acupuncture, as well as with standard medical treatments to manage symptoms caused by cancer or cancer treatment (see Question 1). Essential oils are most often used by inhaling them or by applying a diluted form of them to the skin (see Question 2). Aromatherapy research with cancer patients has studied the effect of essential oils on anxiety, nausea, vomiting, and other health-related conditions (see Question 4). Safety testing on essential oils has found very few side effects. Lavender and tea tree essential oils have been found to have some hormone -like effects (see Question 5). Aromatherapy products do not need approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (see Question 6). What is aromatherapy? Aromatherapy is the use of essential oils from plants to improve the mind, body, and spirit. It is used by patients with cancer to improve quality of life and reduce stress, anxiety, pain, nausea, and vomiting caused by cancer and its treatment. Aromatherapy may be used with other complementary treatments like massage therapy and acupuncture, as well as with standard medical treatments, for symptom management. Essential oils are the fragrant (aromatic) part found in many plants, often under the surface of leaves, bark, or peel. The fragrance is released if the plant is crushed or a special steam process is used. There are many essential oils used in aromatherapy, including those from Roman chamomile, geranium, lavender, tea tree, lemon, ginger, cedarwood, and bergamot. Each plant's essential oil has a different chemical make-up that affects how it smells, how it is absorbed, and how it affects the body. Essential oils are very concentrated. For example, it takes about 220 pounds of lavender flowers to make about 1 pound of essential oil. The aroma of essential oils fades away quickly when left open to air. How is aromatherapy given or taken? The patient breathes in an essential oil by using a room diffuser, which spreads the essential oil through the air, or by placing drops on a tissue or piece of cotton nearby. The patient breathes in an essential oil by using an individual inhaler made by floating essential oil drops on top of hot water. In aromatherapy massage, one or more essential oils is diluted into a carrier oil and massaged into the skin. Essential oils may also be mixed with bath salts and lotions or applied to bandages. There are some essential oils used to treat specific conditions. However, the types of essential oils used and the ways they are combined vary, depending on the experience and training of the aromatherapist. Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been done using aromatherapy? In laboratory studies, tumor cells are used to test a substance to find out if it is likely to have any anticancer effects. In animal studies, tests are done to see if a drug, procedure, or treatment is safe and effective in animals. Laboratory and animal studies are done before a substance is tested in people. Laboratory and animal studies have tested the effects of essential oils. See the Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies section of the health professional version of Aromatherapy With Essential Oils for information on laboratory and animal studies done using essential oils. Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of aromatherapy been done? Clinical trials of aromatherapy have studied its use in the treatment of anxiety, nausea, vomiting, and other health-related conditions in cancer patients. No studies of aromatherapy used to treat cancer have been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Studies of aromatherapy have shown mixed results. There have been some reports of improved mood, anxiety, sleep, nausea, and pain. Other studies reported that aromatherapy showed no change in symptoms. A trial of 103 cancer patients studied the effects of massage compared to massage with Roman chamomile essential oil. Two weeks later, a decrease in anxiety and improved symptoms were noted in the group that had massage with essential oil. The group that had massage only did not have the same benefit. Another study of 58 patients with various cancers who completed six aromatherapy sessions showed a decrease in anxiety and depression compared with before the sessions began. A randomized controlled trial studied the effects of inhalation aromatherapy on anxiety during radiation therapy. There were 313 patients randomly assigned to either lavender, bergamot, or cedarwood essential oils. There were no differences reported in depression or anxiety between the groups. Newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia who were hospitalized to receive intensive chemotherapy inhaled an essential oil through a diffuser overnight for 3 weeks. Patients were given the choice of lavender, peppermint, or chamomile. Improvement was reported in sleep, tiredness, drowsiness, lack of appetite, depression, anxiety, and well-being. Radioactive iodine may cause damage to salivary glands. Increased saliva production during treatment may decrease damage to salivary glands. In a randomized controlled trial, patients who inhaled a mixture of lemon and ginger essential oils had increased saliva production compared with the placebo group. A study of inhaled ginger essential oil in women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer somewhat decreased acute nausea, but did not lessen vomiting or chronic nausea. A study of inhaled bergamot essential oil in children and adolescents at the time of stem cell infusion reported an increase in anxiety and nausea and no effect on pain. In a study of adult patients at the time of stem cell infusion, tasting or sniffing sliced oranges was more effective at reducing nausea, retching, and coughing than inhaling an orange essential oil. Women having breast biopsies were randomly assigned to receive lavender-sandalwood or orange-peppermint essential oil drops placed on a felt tab and attached to their hospital gown or to no scent on the felt tab. Women who received the lavender-sandalwood aromatherapy tab had less anxiety than women who received the orange-peppermint aromatherapy tab or no scent tab. In a study of inhaled lavender essential oil, eucalyptus essential oil, or no essential oil in cancer patients having needles inserted into a central venous port catheter, patients who inhaled lavender essential oil reported less pain. Have any side effects or risks been reported from aromatherapy? Safety testing on essential oils shows very few side effects or risks when they are used as directed. Most essential oils have been approved as ingredients in food and fragrances and are labeled as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Swallowing large amounts of essential oils is not recommended. Allergic reactions and skin irritation may occur when essential oils are in contact with the skin for long periods of time. Sun sensitivity may occur when citrus or other essential oils are applied to the skin before going out in the sun. Lavender and tea tree essential oils have been found to have effects similar to estrogen (female sex hormone) and also block or decrease the effect of androgens (male sex hormones). Applying lavender and tea tree essential oils to the skin over a long period of time was linked in one study to breast growth in boys who had not yet reached puberty. Is aromatherapy approved by the FDA for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? Aromatherapy is not regulated by state law, and there is no licensing required to practice aromatherapy in the United States. Practitioners often combine aromatherapy training with another field in which they are licensed, for example, massage therapy, nursing, acupuncture, or naturopathy. The National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy (www.naha.org) and the Alliance of International Aromatherapists (www.alliance-aromatherapists.org) are two organizations that have national educational standards for aromatherapists. A list of schools that offer certificate programs approved by NAHA can be found at https://naha.org/index.php/education/approved-schools/. The Canadian Federation of Aromatherapists (www.cfacanada.com) certifies aromatherapists in Canada.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. The NCI Best Case Series Program which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients' medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research. Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) facilitates research and evaluation of complementary and alternative practices, and provides information about a variety of approaches to health professionals and the public.

Mistletoe is a semiparasitic plant that grows on several types of trees such as apple, oak, pine, and elm (see Question 1). Mistletoe is one of the most widely studied complementary and alternative medicine therapies in people with cancer. In Europe, mistletoe extracts are among the most prescribed drugs for patients with cancer (see Question 1). Mistletoe extracts are usually given by injection under the skin or, less often, into a vein, into the pleural cavity, or into a tumor (see Question 2). Few side effects have been reported from the use of mistletoe extracts (see Question 5). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved mistletoe as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition (see Question 6). What is mistletoe? Mistletoe is a semiparasitic plant that grows on trees, such as apple, oak, maple, elm, pine, and birch. It has been used for hundreds of years to treat medical conditions such as epilepsy, hypertension, headaches, menopausal symptoms, infertility, arthritis, and rheumatism. Mistletoe is one of the most widely studied complementary and alternative medicine therapies for cancer. In Europe, mistletoe extracts are among the most prescribed therapies for cancer patients. Mistletoe products vary, depending on the following factors: The type of host tree on which the mistletoe grows. The type of extract used and if it is made with homeopathic methods. Mistletoe extracts are made in water-based solutions or solutions of water and alcohol. Mistletoe products may be named according to the type of tree on which the plant grows. For example, IscadorM is from apple trees, IscadorP comes from pine trees, IscadorQu is from oak trees, and IscadorU comes from elm trees. How are mistletoe extracts given? Mistletoe extracts are usually given by an injection under the skin (subcutaneous). Less common ways to give mistletoe include by mouth, into a vein (intravenous or IV), into the pleural cavity, or into a tumor. What laboratory or animal studies have been done using mistletoe extracts? In laboratory studies, tumor cells are used to test a substance to find out if it is likely to have any anticancer effects. In animal studies, tests are done to see if a drug, procedure, or treatment is safe and effective in animals. Laboratory and animal studies are done before a substance is tested in people. Laboratory and animal studies have tested the effects of mistletoe extracts in laboratory experiments. See the Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies section of the health professional version on Mistletoe Extracts for information on laboratory and animal studies done using mistletoe extracts. Have any studies of mistletoe extracts been done in people? Most clinical trials using mistletoe extracts to treat cancer have been done in Europe. Many studies use mistletoe as adjuvant therapy in patients with cancer. Although these trials have reported mistletoe extracts to be effective, weaknesses have been reported. Findings from studies with large numbers of patients reported the following: A retrospective cohort study done between 1993 and 2000 looked at the use of a mistletoe extract as long-term adjuvant therapy in 804 patients treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for colorectal cancer that had not spread. The study found that patients treated with mistletoe had fewer adverse events, better symptom relief, and improved disease-free survival compared to patients who did not receive mistletoe as adjuvant therapy. A study published in 2013 looked at the use of mistletoe in advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Patients received best supportive care and were randomly assigned to receive either mistletoe or no anticancer therapy. Results in 220 patients showed that those treated with mistletoe had improved survival and less disease-related symptoms (including pain, weight loss, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and anxiety) compared with those who did not receive mistletoe. A study done between 1978 and 1987 looked at the use of mistletoe in non-small cell lung cancer that could not be treated with surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of 3 treatments: (1) a mistletoe injection; (2) an injection made from a sheep spleen said to stimulate the immune system and have antitumor effects; (3) a placebo injection of vitamin B. Results in 312 patients showed no differences among the 3 groups in survival or tumor response. It was noted that more patients in the mistletoe group reported an improved sense of well-being compared with patients in the other groups. A randomized clinical trial in 830 high-risk melanoma patients receiving treatment of interferon or mistletoe for one year, found that at 8 years follow-up there was no increase in survival time in either the interferon or the mistletoe group. In 2002, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) enrolled patients in a phase I clinical trial of a mistletoe extract and gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors. This combination showed low toxicity and no botanical -drug interactions were reported. Reviews have looked at the effects of mistletoe on quality of life, survival, and symptom relief in different types of cancer: Quality of life was measured in a review that included 26 randomized clinical trials. Of these, 22 trials showed patients had improved quality of life. Chemotherapy-related fatigue, nausea and vomiting, depression, emotional well-being, and concentration improved. All 10 nonrandomized, controlled clinical trials reviewed also reported the same benefits. Some of the studies were well designed, while others had weaknesses. Tumor response, quality of life, and psychological distress were measured in a review of 21 randomized clinical trials in patients with different types of cancer. Mistletoe extracts were used either alone, with chemotherapy, or with radiation therapy. Most of the studies reported benefits for patients, although this review had weaknesses in design and size. Quality of life and survival were measured in a review of 10 randomized clinical trials which used mistletoe extracts in patients with different types of cancer. There was no difference in survival or quality of life measures in patients who received mistletoe compared to those who did not. Have any side effects or risks been reported from mistletoe? Few serious side effects have been reported from the use of mistletoe extracts. Side effects include soreness and inflammation at injection sites, headache, fever, and chills. One review reported that treatment was not found to lessen immune system response. High doses of mistletoe damaged the liver in some cases, but damage was correctable. Another review of clinical trials reported adverse effects that included circulatory problems, thrombophlebitis, swelling of lymph nodes, and allergic reactions. A few cases of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported. Is mistletoe approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the use of mistletoe as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board. A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become ""standard."" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. The NCI Best Case Series Program which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients' medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research. Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) facilitates research and evaluation of complementary and alternative practices, and provides information about a variety of approaches to health professionals and the public. TTY (for deaf and hard of hearing callers): 1-866-464-3615 NCCIH and the NIH National Library of Medicine (NLM) jointly developed CAM on PubMed, a free and easy-to-use search tool for finding CAM-related journal citations.

Add complementary medicine to your treatment or wellness plan. Complementary medicine is a term used for a wide variety of health care practices that may be used along with standard medical treatment. It covers alternative health approaches, mind and body practices, and natural products. Many forms of complementary, or nonstandard, medicine have been around for hundreds or even thousands of years. But often there is not much evidence from science on how safe they are or how well they work. Some practices are thought to be safe. For example, most mind and body practices such as acupuncture, meditation, and yoga are very safe when used by healthy people with a well-trained professional. People often use complementary medicine to treat long-term health problems or to stay healthy. It is important to talk with your doctor about any complementary health practice that you would like to try or are already using. Your doctor can help you manage your health better if he or she has the whole picture about your health. Your insurance may not cover the cost of some treatments.

Alternative health approaches such as traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, and naturopathy. Mind and body practices like acupuncture, massage therapy, and tai chi. Natural products like herbs, dietary supplements, and probiotics. Some complementary practices have been studied and tested. But most haven't been studied with well-designed trials. That means there are still many questions about these practices. We often don't have good evidence from science about whether they are safe, when they should be used, and how well they work. In the U.S., the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health was formed within the National Institutes of Health to test how safe treatments are and how well they work. The center has guidelines to help you choose safe treatments that are right for you. The greatest risk is that you use complementary treatment of going to your regular doctor. Complementary medicine should be treatment from your doctor. Otherwise you may miss important treatment that could save your life. Some natural products may be safe when you take them on their own. But they may not be safe if you have other medical problems. And they could be dangerous when they are combined with another medicine you take. To be safe, always check with your doctor before you use any new natural products or supplements. Natural products also can vary widely in how strong they are. And they may contain harmful things not listed on the label. Your doctor or practitioner may be able to recommend a brand you can trust.

I looked into some herbal diet remedies that were supposed to help speed up my metabolism and help me lose weight. When I did some research, I found out that people with high blood pressure should not take certain herbs—like the one I was considering. I did not want to risk making my high blood pressure worse or, worse yet, put my life in danger by taking the herb. I decided to work on my diet and struggle through weight loss the old-fashioned way. I prefer to use complementary therapies whenever they are available. They are my first choice in most cases. But I do see my doctor who supports my use of complementary therapies. He sometimes suggests a ""standard"" treatment when he feels it's necessary—like when I had a small skin cancer surgically removed. It was clear to me that this tried-and-true and possibly lifesaving treatment was best. For everyday health and wellness, though, I use a variety of complementary therapies. I've used everything from tea tree oil for fungal nail infections; to aloe vera, straight off the plant, for mild burns; to acupuncture for low back pain. I have had great success keeping my cancer in remission using conventional cancer treatments. At this point, I don't want to upset the apple cart. If it ain't broke, I'm not going to try to fix it.

Aromatherapy uses essential oils (oils extracted from plants) for healing. Some people find that the smell (aroma) of particular oils helps them to relax, sleep better, relieve pain and improve low mood. For example, when used appropriately lavender and camomile essential oils are thought to be relaxing and help you sleep. The oils can be used in many different ways, such as in creams, oil burners, massaged in to the skin or by adding drops to a warm bath.

Some people find that trying homeopathic remedies for stress, anxiety and depression does make them feel better. However, most doctors are sceptical about homeopathy. The NHS says that the evidence shows homeopathy works no better than a placebo (a sugar pill). It also cautions that choosing homeopathy as your main treatment may mean you don't choose other options, which could work better. Hypnosis involves putting you in a state of deep relaxation to access subconscious beliefs, thoughts and memories which may affect the way you act. Hypnotherapists use hypnosis to help you change unwanted thoughts and behaviours by using suggestion and increasing your self-awareness.

Complementary and alternative therapies What else should I consider before starting a therapy? Complementary and alternative therapies typically take a holistic approach to your physical and mental health. This means that they consider all aspects of your physical and emotional wellbeing as a whole, rather than treating particular symptoms separately. For example, some complementary therapies focus on the mind, body and spirit or on the flow of energy through your body. Many of these approaches have roots in ancient Eastern philosophies of health, or the kinds of traditional healing methods used widely before the development of the treatment models currently used by the NHS. By contrast, NHS treatment models are are largely based on clinical evidence and academic research (sometimes called 'modern medicine' or 'conventional medicine'). What's the difference between a 'complementary' and an 'alternative' therapy? describes therapies which may be used alongside treatments offered by your doctor (such as , and ). describes approaches which are generally meant to replace the treatments offered by your doctor (such as or , or some herbal remedies such as ). But you might hear either or both of these terms used to broadly describe any kind of treatment that isn't available through the NHS. (See our page on ​ for more information about the different therapies available.) There are many reasons you might decide to try complementary or alternative therapies. For example: You don't want the treatment your doctor has offered (such as or ). You've already tried the treatments your doctor has offered and they haven't suited you (for example, you haven't found a psychiatric medication that works, or it's caused unwanted side effects). You're on an NHS waiting list for treatment, but you need help to manage your symptoms right away. You want more options to try in addition to the treatments your doctor has offered. You don't agree with your doctor's approach and you want to take another approach to looking after your mental health. Whatever your situation, if you have any worries about your mental health you can , and talk through all your options through with someone you trust. ""When I could no longer take SSRI antidepressants due to side effects, I tried St John’s wort as an alternative. It has definitely helped with my depression and my mood has lifted quite a lot."" Complementary and alternative therapies can be used as a treatment for both physical and mental health problems. The particular problems that they can help will depend on the specific therapy that you are interested in, but many can help to reduce feelings of depression and anxiety. Some people also find they can help with sleep problems, relaxation and feelings of stress. ""I have used massage therapy to help relieve some of the muscle tension and pain that my anxiety creates. Just having someone respond to me and my body with compassion helps me treat myself more compassionately and with more respect."" As with all medicines and therapies, different things work for different people, and it’s not easy to predict which therapy you would find most useful or effective. Most of the evidence for complementary and alternative therapies is based on traditional use rather than modern scientific studies. This means it's really difficult to know whether they are an effective treatment for mental health problems. However, many people do say they find them helpful in managing or relieving the symptoms they experience. For information about the evidence behind specific therapies, see our pages on ​ and . Complementary and alternative therapies are not typically available through the NHS as a treatment for mental health problems. This is because they aren't typically recommended as evidence-based treatment options by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) – the organisation that produces guidelines on best practice in healthcare. To find out what the NHS is able to offer you locally, it's a good idea to make a GP appointment and ask your doctor directly. Most complementary and alternative therapies are considered to be safe when conducted by a trained and experienced practitioner. However, there may be times when a certain therapy may carry higher risks for you, and would not be recommended. For example, if: you are receiving any other treatments that could interfere with the therapy you have a physical or mental health problem that could be made worse by the therapy. Before you start any new treatment it is a good idea to talk through any safety concerns with your doctor and the treatment provider. This is especially important if you're already taking any kind of medication. If you are considering taking a herbal remedy, see our information on . Remember that your local pharmacist can also give you advice about prescription and over-the-counter medications. There's no compulsory regulation for complementary healthcare practitioners in England and Wales, so it is possible to practice totally independently without regulation. However, there are several kinds of voluntary organisation with which practitioners can choose to register: The Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC). The CNHC acts as a voluntary regulator for the sector. It publishes a list of registered therapies, and maintains a public register of practitioners who have signed up.

What else should I consider before starting a therapy? Only you can decide whether a type of treatment feels right for you. But it might help you to think about: What do I want to get out of it – is it realistic? How long will it take – have I got enough time? Is it open-ended or time-limited? Have I got any health problems that would affect me being able to do the therapy? Am I receiving any other treatments that would affect me being able to do the therapy? Would someone I trust be able to come along with me if I didn't feel comfortable going on my own? As with any kind of therapy, it's really important to find someone you feel confident and safe with. Regardless of the kind of therapy or medicine they practice, if you don't like or trust that person you're less likely to have a positive experience. As a good starting point, your practitioner should be able to give you straightforward answers to your questions about: their past experience of using the therapy for your specific problem what risks might be involved, and what you should do if you experience any negative effects what procedures they have in place for making a complaint any other concerns or questions you have about the therapy.

An INTERVIEW with Gateway Foundation The main goal of any addiction treatment facility is to help people achieve balance in mind and body. In the last two decades, a new form of treatment has been rapidly expanding. Known as “holistic treatment”, this possible key to recovery success focuses on the mind, body, and spirit. What’s it really all about? We’ve asked a clinician who’s practicing holistic therapy to explain more in this exclusive digital interview. Author of ""The Definitive Guide to Addiction Interventions"" Many people who enter addiction treatment find themselves looking deeper into their personal story than ever before. And, it’s truly possible to discover a new side of yourself in the process. “I’ve been challenged to question my former beliefs about life.” “Rehab has helped me re-discover my spiritual essence. “ “I feel much more clear that I have a mission in life.” So, how do people get to this realization of self? Everyone is different in this sense. You’ll read stories of people who find a love for nature and begin exploring hiking trails. Others realize they’ve let their gift for art waste away too many years and explore their innate creativity. And some people are motivated to throw themselves into new business ventures. But what does a holistic approach to addiction treatment look like? What’s it all about? And are its claims wishy-washy or founded in science? To answer these questions, we turn to the The Gateway Foundation in Caseyville and Swansea. The group offers people the opportunity to look into their spiritual side through holistic treatment. Patients are offered the chance to discover that inner part of them that’s been missing through addiction. And don’t these treatment modalities sound attractive?: The Gateway Foundation’s Executive Director, Deacon Farrelly, is always looking for new and improved methods of helping those that enter his facilities. He’s told us, “Different things work for different people. It’s important that our Gateway Foundation programming reflects this difference.” Let’s take a closer look at holistic addiction treatment now…and learn from The Gateway Foundation’s experience. Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us, Deacon! To begin, what are most patients seeking when they start the recovery process? Does spirituality come as a surprise to them? Most patients are looking to quit using drugs and alcohol. They report they are tired of “seeking the drug” and hurting their families and loved ones. A lot of them report they want to feel “normal” and live “normal” lives without drugs and alcohol. Spirituality does not come to a majority of them as a surprise. Many of them enter into treatment with a sense of values and meanings by which they want to live. They often explain their values are still there, but the drugs and alcohol were “overshadowing” them. How were you introduced to holistic treatment and how would you define it to people who don’t know what it is? I think overall, healthier lifestyle choices are on the upswing with many people these days; so in many ways, introducing a holistic approach to the treatment of substance use disorders is a logical development. Holistic rehab programs look at a combined physical, mental, and spiritual model for treating substance abuse and addiction. These techniques are also often referred to as complementary treatments, and they are often based on practices that are defined as being close to nature or derived from cultural traditions. ** Swansea utilizes acupuncture, meditation and art. Caseyville utilizes Yoga, art and meditation techniques. How can holistic treatment help those struggling with addiction? Addiction treatment centers are gradually adopting holistic treatment for addiction recovery that addresses the whole person—body, mind and spirit. This combined approach includes evidence-based therapeutic techniques, such as counseling and behavioral therapy, with alternative therapies, such as art, meditation, and yoga to create a complete program that addresses addiction. For the body, drug or alcohol abuse causes nutritional deficiencies and contributes to several medical conditions. recovery programs combines a variety of therapies that allow the body to repair and restore itself. At our center we provide healthy meals to help clients keep their strength and energy levels high. We offer nutritional education that allows them to maintain a balanced diet after they complete treatment. Our center uses a dietician that also assists with a balanced healthy diet. Other components of holistic treatment that heal the body that our center utilizes are exercise and yoga. This therapeutic activity leaves clients feeling rejuvenated and balanced, and they help ward off feelings of depression and anxiety that can lead to a relapse. For the mind, it’s important to explore the underlying issues that may have contributed to substance abuse and develop new ways to cope with difficult experiences or unpleasant feelings. Our treatment program includes both individual counseling and group therapy which can help clients achieve these goals. One-on-one time with a counselor helps clients learn new techniques to deal with their unique life situations and challenges, while group therapy sessions allow clients to share their experiences with like-minded members. In addition to these therapeutic techniques, our holistic approach offers meditation and other mindfulness exercises that benefit clients, providing them with powerful stress-reducing tools that they can depend on throughout their recovery. Research suggests that just eight weeks of regular mindfulness meditation can impact the brain’s neural pathways and lead to feelings of well-being. For the spirit, our holistic approach includes a spiritual element. Many people who struggle with addiction describe feeling an inner void and attempting to fill that void through substance abuse. Our holistic approach works to remedy those feelings of emptiness and enable spiritual healing which allows clients to heal and renew their spirit through expressive therapies such as art and music therapy. Through these activities, clients can often release feelings that are too difficult or painful to put into words. Within the practice of holistic treatment, which therapies have you found to be the most effective? I think there are many approaches which have proven to be effective; the thing to remember is that not all approaches are equally successful for all people. One key element is helping people discover what it is that they most value or what motivates them. Many of our clients have expressed their love for exercise, art and music in residential treatment and art and acupuncture in outpatient treatment. What studies or research has been done to document the efficacy of these claims? What research might be done in the future? For example, how effective are different modalities in preventing cravings? What about relapse prevention? What would say are the success rates of those who undergo a holistic treatment in comparison to those who don’t? That’s a tricky one for two reasons. First, the lack of a long history means there isn’t ton of data yet on success rates. Second, remember that a holistic approach is not something that’s done ‘instead of’, but more often is an enhancement of treatment. Is holistic treatment applied simultaneously with the use of medications and/or talk therapy? Why or why not? Yes, at our treatment centers we like to use a combined physical, mental, and spiritual model for treating substance abuse and addiction which, in some cases, includes medication. Treating the “whole person” appears to be the most effective. Do you find people who explore their spiritual side to recover with a different timeframe than those who don’t? I guess I’d say that while spirituality is a key component for many who achieve success in their recovery; I don’t want to give the message that recovery cannot be achieve without it. Is holistic treatment something that can be practiced on your own? For example, if someone is recovering in a treatment facility that doesn’t offer it, are they able to perform the therapies on their own? We also use Mindfulness Based Therapy at both our residential and outpatient facilities which incorporates mindfulness practices such as meditation and breathing exercises. Clients can be taught mindfulness exercises and breathing techniques that they can do on their own. Being that you’re a mental health expert by trade, do you think holistic treatment will be practiced more in the future as an option for people struggling with addiction and mental illness? Technology consistently happens all around us; technology in treatment is no different. The current emphasis that holistic lifestyle choices have put on overall health is a welcome addition to the some of the more traditional treatment methods and I hope that it remains an integral part of substance use disorder treatment for many years to come. How scan people learn more about holistic treatment if they’re interested? I think the simplest answer is to simply do some research via the internet or library. And feel free to go to to learn more about us or call the Gateway site nearest you to get information. Is there anything else that you’d like to add for our readers? I often talk to people about the importance of getting information on and exposure to spirituality, meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, education, exercise, support groups etc., as they work on their recovery and maintaining their sobriety. The real key, however, is to make sure that learning about these different strategies is followed up with practice and repetition until they become integral parts of their daily lives.

0ba233f1-3c39-445a-bb51-22868353ea13,"Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a system of medical care that developed in China over thousands of years. Some herbs may interfere with other cancer drugs you are taking Practitioners of TCM believe there is no separation between mind and body. They look at the interaction between mind, body and environment. It is very different to Western medicine and uses a combination of various practices including: moxibustion (burning moxa – a cone or stick of dried herb) breathing and movement exercises called qi gong (pronounced chee goong) movement exercises called tai chi (pronounced tie chee) improve your ability to enjoy life and work in general TCM is a very complex system of medical care. We only give an outline of it below. According to traditional Chinese belief humans are interconnected with nature and affected by its forces. The human body is seen as an organic whole in which the organs, tissues, and other parts have distinct functions but are all interdependent. In this view, health and disease relate to balance or imbalance of the functions. TCM treatments aim to cure problems by restoring the balance of energies. There are important components that underlie the basis of TCM.  Yin-yang theory is the concept of two opposing but complementary forces that shape the world and all life. The balance of yin and yang maintains harmony in your body, mind and the universe. Qi (pronounced chee) energy or vital life force flows through your body along pathways known as meridians and is affected by the balance of yin and yang. It regulates our spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical health. If there is a blockage or imbalance in the energy flow  you become ill. TCM aims to restore the balance of qi energy. The 5 elements – fire, earth, metal, water, and wood – is a concept that explains how the body works and the elements correspond to particular organs and tissues in the body. The TCM approach uses 8 principles to analyse symptoms and put particular conditions into groups – cold and heat, inside and outside, too much and not enough, and yin and yang. Diagnosis is a complex process and involves looking at you as a whole, including the environment you live in. Remedies treat the whole person, not just a single health problem. On your first visit, your practitioner will ask you general questions about your health, lifestyle, diet, relationships and medical history. Your practitioner will also use hearing, touch, sight and smell to help diagnose you. They will do a physical examination which might include looking at your skin, eyes, tongue, feeling your abdomen and checking your pulse.  Taking your pulse is a very important part of diagnosing you. The process won’t be as simple as when your usual doctor or nurse does it. Your TCM practitioner might check up to 200 pulses in your wrist and arm. Most treatments involve acupuncture and herbal remedies which you usually make into a tea. Your practitioner will tell you everything you need to know. The first visit is usually about 60 to 90 minutes long. Your practitioner will probably recommend that you go back for another appointment in about 2 to 4 weeks time. How long you go on seeing your practitioner will depend on why you are using TCM. Contact your practitioner or doctor if you feel ill or your symptoms get worse before your next appointment. Stop taking your herbal medicine and see your own doctor if you are worried. Your relationship with your TCM practitioner is very important. They must create a safe environment for you to have treatment. If you don’t feel comfortable with anything that your practitioner does, it is important to discuss it. Many people assume that because a product is marketed as natural or herbal, this means it’s safe to use. Some Chinese herbal medicines are safe but others can have serious and dangerous side effects. Some herbal medicines may interact with treatments from your doctor, including cancer drugs or radiotherapy. Or they may affect the way drugs are broken down by your body, or the way drugs are carried around your body.  Always check with your cancer specialist before you take any herbs or chinese medicine.  TCM involves several types of treatment, so we can’t list all the possible side effects here. We have more detailed information about individual therapies such as acupuncture, herbal medicine or massage. Find more detailed information on individual therapies TCM is a complex system. So it is very difficult for western doctors to test whether it works for treating or preventing cancer. It is even more difficult to test TCM using randomised clinical trials, and compare the results to conventional medicine. As TCM is tailored to the patient, it can't be tested by giving a group of patients the same medicine for a certain amount of time. Instead of looking at the medical effects, a TCM practitioner measures how well a treatment works by looking at: Most research into TCM has focused on acupuncture and Chinese herbal remedies. Some studies suggest that acupuncture might be useful for a number of different conditions, but we need more research. A Cochrane review of 29 studies suggested that moxibustion might help to reduce some of the side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, however further research is still needed in this area.   TCM involves many treatment types, so we can’t list all the available research into each one here. It is very important to only have your treatments with a qualified practitioner. Your first consultation will usually cost between £40 and £90 for an hour. Treatments can be more expensive in bigger cities. Further appointments are usually shorter and might cost less. You also have to pay for the herbs that you are given. Companies making herbal products bought over the counter in health food shops and pharmacies have to meet quality standards. They also need to provide information about their product, including the exact content and dose of the product and how safe it is. In Europe it is important to only buy products registered under the Traditional Herbal Remedies (THR) scheme. Remedies that are registered under the scheme have a THR mark and symbol on the packaging. THR products have been tested for quality and safety. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) regulates the registration of herbal products in the UK. They state there is a big variation in how unlicensed traditional Chinese medicines are made. Some have been found to contain illegal substances and toxic herbs. These substances may not be listed on the packaging of the product. The amount of the active ingredient can also vary widely between products. It is safest to buy herbal remedies from a fully qualified herbal practitioner who is trained to work out which medicines are appropriate for you.

There is not enough reliable scientific evidence to use it as a treatment for cancer. Herbal medicine uses plants or plant extracts to treat illness and promote health There is not enough scientific evidence to use it as a cancer treatment Herbal medicines might have side effects and interact with other medicines Herbal medicines may not be regulated if made outside the UK, and what they contain can vary. If you are going to buy herbal remedies it is safest to buy them from a fully qualified herbal practitioner. Herbal medicines are made from plants. They use combinations of plant parts, for example leaves, flowers or roots. Each part of the plant can have a different medicinal use. Manufacturers use different ways of extracting the chemicals from the plant parts. They use fresh and dried plants to make the medicine. Herbal medicine aims to restore your body, so that it can protect, regulate and heal itself. It is a whole body approach. It looks at your physical, mental and emotional well being. It is sometimes called phytomedicine, phytotherapy or botanical medicine. Manufacturers make many drugs from plants. But herbalists don’t extract plant substances in the way the drug industry does. Herbalists believe that the remedy works due to the delicate chemical balance of the whole plant, or mixtures of plants. And not from one active ingredient. The two most common types of herbal medicine used in the UK are Western and Chinese herbal medicine. Less common types include Tibetan or Ayurvedic medicine (Indian). Western herbal medicine focuses on the whole person rather than their illness. So, the herbalist looks at your: Western herbal therapists usually make medicines from European and North American herbs. They also use herbs from China and India. Herbalists use remedies made from whole plants or plant parts. They believe it helps your body to heal itself or to reduce the side effects of medical treatments. Chinese herbal medicine is part of a whole system of medicine. The system is called Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM aims to restore the balance of your Qi (pronounced chee). TCM practitioners believe that Qi is the flow of energy in your body and is essential for good health. Yin and yang refer to different qualities of Qi. When all of the yin and yang aspects of Qi are in harmony with one another, there is health, wellbeing and peace. Illness is due to a disturbance of the balance between yin and yang. Chinese herbalists use plants according to how they affect a part of the body or energy channel. traditional breathing and movement exercises called qi gong (pronounced chee goong) movement exercises called tai chi (pronounced tie chee) TCM uses hundreds of medicinal substances. Most of these are plants, but there are also some minerals and animal products. Practitioners may use different parts of plants. They might use the leaves, roots, stems, flowers or seeds. Usually, they combine herbs and you take them as teas, capsules, tinctures, or powders. Herbal medicine is one of the most used complementary and alternative therapies by people with cancer. This is alongside conventional cancer treatments. People have used herbal medicine for centuries to treat many different health conditions. They believe it is a natural way to help you relax and cope with anxiety and depression. Or, to help with other conditions such as: People might also use herbal medicine to help themselves to feel better or more in control of their situation. A 2011 study in the UK surveyed people with cancer who use herbal medicines. It found that most of the people used herbal medicines to feel more in control. And that it helped them to feel that they have some responsibility for their treatment. They also felt the therapies wouldn't cause side effects. During your first visit, the herbalist will ask you general questions about your health, lifestyle, diet and medical history. find out about any medication or supplements you use They will also do a physical examination, which may include: The herbalist will then decide which remedies you need. They will usually make it while you wait. a diluted alcohol solution of plant parts (tincture) water-based solutions like a tea that you make from raw herbs Your herbalist may suggest that you go back for another appointment after a few weeks. How long you continue seeing them will depend on why you are using herbal medicine. This depends on which herbal medicine you want to have. It is important to check with your doctor first before taking any herbal remedies if you: are having other cancer treatment (conventional, complementary or alternative) Many people assume that products are safe to use when marketed as natural or herbal. Some herbal medicines might be safe. But others can have severe and dangerous side effects. And, they might interact with other cancer treatments you are having. We need more research into this. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre in America looked at how herbal medicines can change the way other drugs work. They suggest that the following herbal remedies can interact with cancer treatments: Some herbal treatments might affect the way your body processes cancer drugs. For example the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in America says that St John’s wort can cause your body to get rid of the drug, imatinib (Glivec), quicker. This means it could make the imatinib less effective at fighting your cancer. Some herbal medicines might increase the effect of cancer drugs. This means that you could have too much treatment. Other herbal medicines can interfere with some drugs. For example, Asian ginseng and bilberry can increase the risk of bleeding after surgery. Some herbal remedies make your skin more sensitive to light. Do not take them while having radiotherapy. In the UK, the Health and Care Professions Council regulates TCM. It also regulates other herbal practitioners. Contact them for a list of registered practitioners in your area. Most practitioners are members of the herbal medicine organisations listed below. Each type of herbal remedy might have side effects. Some are safe to use and do not have any noticeable side effects. But some plants are poisonous to humans and can have serious and severe side effects. Always tell your doctor if you are using any type of herbal remedy. It might be helpful to ask your herbalist for a list of all the ingredients in your herbal remedy. Then if you do have any side effects, your doctor will know what you have taken. You, your doctor or herbalist can report side effects. You report it to the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority (MHRA). The MHRA is the UK regulatory body. It collects information about the side effects of drugs, including herbal medicines. Let both your herbalist and doctor know if you feel worse or ill while you are taking herbal medicine. There is no reliable evidence from human studies that herbal remedies can treat, prevent or cure any type of cancer. Some clinical trials seem to show that certain Chinese herbs may help people to live longer, might reduce side effects, and help to prevent cancer from coming back. This is especially when combined with conventional treatment. But many of the studies are published in Chinese, and some of them don't list the specific herbs used. Some journal articles don't give enough detail on how the researchers did the studies. It is difficult to know how reliable the research is and which herbs may be helpful. But there are trials looking into this. There is no reliable evidence that herbal remedies can prevent cancer. Chinese researchers did a cohort study in 2018.  A cohort is a group of people, so cohort studies look at groups of people. The researchers follow the group over a period of time.  The researchers in this study looked at people with oesophageal (food pipe) cancer. And who might develop a second primary (new) cancer of the head and neck. The researchers followed the group over 10 years. One part of the group received Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) and the other part did not.  The results showed that the group of people who took CHM had fewer cases of a second primary cancer of the head and neck. This was when the researchers compared them to the group that did not take CHM. The researchers suggested that CHM might prevent a second primary cancer of the head and neck in people with oesophageal cancer. The results looked promising. But the people in the study received different types of CHM. This might make the results of the study less accurate. Relieving symptoms or side effects There is evidence that some herbal remedies might prevent or relieve cancer symptoms. And that it might help with treatment side effects. But we need results from large clinical trials. This way we can know which herbs are safe to use alongside conventional cancer treatment. A Cochrane review of studies in 2018 looking at preventing a dry mouth in people having radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. They found that there was not enough evidence to say that CHM can prevent the feeling of dry mouth. This was in people who had radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy to the head and neck. Another Cochrane review of studies in 2018  found that there was not enough evidence to use CHM as a treatment for oesophageal cancer. But they said that it might help with quality of life. And that it might relieve some side effects caused by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. A third Cochrane review of studies in 2018 looked at moxibustion. Moxibustion involves the burning of herbs above the skin at acupuncture pressure points. The researchers found little evidence to say that it helped with side effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Or that it helped with quality of life in people with cancer. But the researchers felt that the evidence was not clear enough to rule out some benefits or risks of this treatment. They suggested better quality studies.  Chinese researchers did a review study in 2019. The researchers looked at studies that used different types of CHM. The studies looked at how to relieve perimenopausal symptoms in women who had surgery, chemoradiotherapy or hormone treatment for breast cancer. Perimenopausal means the transition time to full menopause. The researchers found that CHM might improve perimenopausal symptoms. But suggested better quality, precise and in-depth studies. Some laboratory tests have found certain plants or plant extracts have anti-cancer qualities. Manufacturers made these into cancer drugs such as Taxol from the yew tree. But, there is no scientific evidence from human trials that herbal medicine can treat or cure cancer. We need large trials to prove this. Researchers did a laboratory study in 2019. They looked at the use of Chang-wei-qing (CWQ) as a treatment to prevent a certain type of bowel cancer. The researchers found that CWQ showed an anti-cancer (anti-tumour) effect. But this was a laboratory study, and we need more research. Chinese researchers did a case study of 182 patients with pancreatic cancer. All of the patients received CHM. It showed that people having herbal medicine might survive longer. This was a case study and isn’t evidence to use it as a treatment. We need more research. Chinese researchers did a review study in 2018. They looked at several studies on CHM. The researchers said that CHM showed positive results. This was as a therapy to use with other types of cancer treatment. They also said that CHM can help chemotherapy and radiotherapy to work better. They felt that CHM can help to control certain cancer genes. And that it can influence the way cancer cells work. But they recommended more research to understand exactly how CHM works. A Cochrane review in 2016 looked at studies using a type of CHM called Ganoderma lucidum to treat cancer. The researchers found that there was not enough evidence to use Ganoderma lucidum as a treatment for cancer. But they suggested that it might be used alongside conventional cancer treatment to boost immunity. The researchers also said that future research should be of better quality studies.

When considering this growth, different dimensions are provided by following a wider sociological evaluation as well as by listening to the voices of representative individuals involved. In doing, so two key themes emerge. A broader approach can be gathered by considering societal change in recent years.

In a widening of the concept of post modernity Anthony Giddens (cited in Lee-Treweek, 2005, p.13) presents the changes of late modernity which describe ‘a greater acceptance of a wider range of sets of knowledge, ideas and ‘experts’ within society’. Running parallel to this has been a decline in ‘the power of claims from orthodox sources of information’ (Lee-Treweek, 2005, p.17). This evolution within the UK’s sociological backdrop gives insight into how the current orientation of the UK population to CAM has arisen.

Read More Music Therapy: The Power of Healing Essay ...The healing power of music has existed since the beginning of human civilization. Music has grown to define a person’s values and become an aspect of culture. Such a force has led medical specialists to believe in music as a treatment just like any other drug would be. As a result, the music therapeutic field of study has grown over the past decades with support from new findings from extended research. Music should be one of the top treatments for common medical situations, such as cancer, and should be present in all hospitals. Music as communication has its beginnings tracing back to the beginnings of humankind. As Homo sapiens became more civilized, they developed language; as language became more sophisticated, communication became integral to society; as communication connected more people, it cultivated a new force called music, a language that unified people with more than just words. Various generations let music define their time period. If society can be affected largely by music in that way, the medical world would surely have a positive and growing response to music . Humans already emote with music. Take, for an example, a film score that brings back memorable scenes into viewers’ heads: Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, and Pirates of the Caribbean.

It is based on a classic published in the third century, B.C., entitled Nei Jing, or The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine. Many diseases and ailments that cannot be cured by Western medicine (WM) can be treated by TCM successfully. This is not to say that TCM can cure all diseases that Western medicine cannot. It is, however, an excellent alternative to a wide range of illnesses experienced by most individuals. Dr. Henry C. Lu, in his book Chinese Natural Cures, asserts the case that TCM is better for certain health problems: “WM is more useful for first aid and surgery, while TCM is more useful in treating skin, internal diseases, and chronic cases in particular” (10). Not only can it be used exclusively or complementary, it can also be used as preventive medicine. WM relies on chemical drugs that are very strong and tend to produce serious side effects to the patient, where TCM relies on Chinese herbs, acupuncture, and qigong (pronounced chee-gong). The goal of TCM is to return the body to homeostasis. That is, its optimal balanced functioning ability. When the body is at homeostasis, there is no room for disease. It is only when the body is out of balance (something is deficient, in excess or stagnating) that pain, illness, or disease can occur. Chinese herbal therapy is able to restore these imbalances once a proper TCM doctor prescribes the right treatment. The herbs prescribed can be taken as teas, tinctures, powders, liniments, extracts, plasters, capsules, pills, etc. The herbs used are known to be hygienic and safe. According to the website of the Longevity Center of Classical Chinese Medicine, “Using the international GMP standard, or good manufacturing practices, these herbs are known for their strict hygienic policies and quality control.” Meeting GMP standards...

Some of the most common methods include bioenergetics (combination of mind and body), synergetic (a fusion between alternative and medical methods), acupuncture (an energy balancing process), and homeopathic (the administration of small doses of a drug that in massive amounts produces symptoms in healthy individuals similar to those of the disease itself). Bioenergetics is a method of psychodynamic pshychotherapy that combines body and mind exercises to help people address and resolve their emotional problems and realize more of their potential for pleasure in the joy in living (goodtherapy.org). Bioenergetics therapists believe that there is a correlation between the function of the mind and its effect on the body. has begun to acknowledge this connection; for example, according to Julie...

TCM traces its history since the period of the mythical “Yellow Emperor”, Huang di (Jia, 2005). According to Jia, “TCM is old enough but is not something out of date, and it still has the power of getting rid of troubles of our modern society”. Much of today’s TCM was founded on The NeiJing or The Yellow Emperor’s Canon of Internal , one of the oldest medical texts which is presented in a question and answer manner. As the nation evolved throughout different dynasties to the contemporary era, so did the theory and practice of TCM. As biomedicine began to gain leverage in China, mainly due to the Opium wars, the advancements in TCM was greatly affected. Skepticism on the modalities of TCM grew, and even ethnic people started questioning whether or not TCM really caters to the medical problems experienced by the people. In an interview to Dr. Philip Nino Tan-Gatue (2015), a practitioner of...

The goal of TCM and each of the treatments is to integrate the mind, body, and spirit in order to prevent illness and promote ultimate wellness. 2.) The roots of TCM extend back to antiquity, originating with the study of the healing properties of plants and flowers. Sheng Nung played a crucial role in the discovery and and recording of certain plants and flowers. He regularly went to the countryside to collect and test the healing properties of hundreds of plants, using himself as the test subject. Sheng Nung’s work was carried on by Huang Ti. Helping him was his court physician, Qi Bo. Together they developed the first detailed system for diagnosing a variety of diseases conditions and cataloged herbs that could treat them. 3.) There are seven different therapies that are a part of TCM. The first one is called diet therapy. This consists of keeping a proper diet and having goo nutrition to maintain optimal health. The second one is called herbal . The herbs are classified into sixteen different categories and further categorized by appearance and taste. They can be taken many different ways, but the most common way is internally. Acupuncture is the third part and this is the most popular form of TCM. It seeks to...

830aedd5-edde-4c03-a938-d6902c30fe72,"National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health   (Redirected from National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine) National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health 1991 (as Office of Alternative Medicine)1998 (as NCCAM) National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health () is a United States government agency which explores (CAM). It was initially created as the (), and renamed the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine () before receiving its current name. NCCIH is one of the 27 institutes and centers that make up the (NIH) within the of the . Its stated mission is: ""to define, through rigorous scientific investigation, the usefulness and safety of complementary and alternative medicine interventions and their roles in improving health and health care"". NCCIH was established in October 1991, as the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM), which was re-established as NCCAM in October 1998 and again as NCCIH in December 2014. The name change to NCCIH has been discussed as an attempt by the center to mitigate criticism, such as to avoid the term ""alternative"" and to distance itself from having funded studies of questionable merit. NCCAM's mission statement declared that it is ""dedicated to exploring complementary and alternative healing practices in the context of rigorous science; training complementary and alternative medicine researchers; and disseminating authoritative information to the public and professionals."" As NCCIH, the mission statement is ""to define, through rigorous scientific investigation, the usefulness and safety of complementary and alternative medicine interventions and their roles in improving health and health care."" was appointed the first director of the OAM in 1992. Initially, Jacobs' insistence on rigorous scientific methodology caused friction with the office's patrons, such as . Sen. Harkin, who had become convinced his allergies were cured by taking pills, criticized the ""unbendable rules of randomized clinical trials,"" saying ""It is not necessary for the scientific community to understand the process before the American public can benefit from these therapies."" Harkin's office reportedly pressured the OAM to fund studies of specific ""pet theories,"" including bee pollen and . In the face of increasing resistance to the use of scientific methodology in the study of alternative medicine, one of the OAM board members, , publicly criticized the office, saying: ""The degree to which nonsense has trickled down to every aspect of this office is astonishing ... It's the only place where opinions are counted as equal to data."" Finally, in 1994, Harkin appeared on television with cancer patients who blamed Jacobs for blocking their access to antineoplastons, leading Jacobs to resign from the OAM in frustration. In an interview with , Jacobs ""blasted politicians – especially Senator Tom Harkin... for pressuring his office, promoting certain therapies, and, he says, attempting an end run around objective science."" Harkin drew support also from Iowa Representative , as Bedell had used cow against his . With the OAM's increasing budget in the 1990s, the office drew increasing criticism for its perceived lack of rigorous scientific study of alternative approaches in favor of uncritical boosterism. , a , wrote to the Senate that "" will always prey on the gullible and uninformed, but we should not provide it with cover from the NIH,"" and called the office ""an embarrassment to serious scientists."" Allen Bromley, then-president of the , similarly wrote to Congress that the OAM had ""emerged as an undiscriminating advocate of unconventional medicine. It has bestowed the considerable prestige of the NIH on a variety of highly dubious practices, some of which clearly violate basic laws of physics and more clearly resemble witchcraft."" One opinion writer in described the OAM as ""Tom Harkin's folly"". In 1995, , a promoter of and political ally of Senator Harkin, became the director of the OAM, and continued in that role until 1999. In 1997, the NCCAM budget was increased from $12 million to $20 million annually. From 1990 to 1997, use of alternative medicine in the US increased by 25%, with a corresponding 50% increase in expenditures. The OAM drew increasing criticism from eminent members of the scientific community with letters to the Senate Appropriations Committee when discussion of renewal of funding OAM came up. In 1998, the President of the North Carolina Medical Association publicly called for shutting down the OAM. In 1998, NIH director and Nobel laureate came into conflict with Senator Harkin by pushing to have more NIH control of alternative medicine research. The NIH Director placed the OAM under more strict scientific NIH control. Senator Harkin responded by elevating OAM into an independent NIH ""center"", just short of being its own ""institute"", and renamed to be the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). NCCAM had a mandate to promote a more rigorous and scientific approach to the study of alternative medicine, research training and career development, outreach, and ""integration"". Stephen Strauss was the director of NCCAM from 1999 to 2006. He tried to bring more scientific rigor to the organization. In 1999 the NCCAM budget was increased from $20 million to $50 million. The United States Congress approved the appropriations without dissent. In 2000, the budget was increased to about $68 million, in 2001 to $90 million, in 2002 to $104 million, and in 2003, to $113 million. In 2008 was appointed as director of NCCAM. She was ""...a with impeccable scientific credentials..."". The appointment was considered surprising since she did not have a background in complementary and alternative medicine or integrative medicine. Writing for , states Briggs was in an impossible position. ""She was a real scientist trying to impose scientific rigor on an enterprise that was inherently resistant to such an imposition"". She attempted to impose a more scientific approach with two long term strategic plans. Unfortunately the plans used ""...one of the most harmful tactics of quacks to legitimize their quackery under the banner of ""integrative medicine"", the co-opting of the opioid crisis as an excuse to claim all nonpharmacological treatments for pain as being ""integrative"". The results are threatening great harm to chronic pain patients by misguided governments wanting to force them to undergo quack treatments like acupuncture as a means of getting them off opioids"". However she was able to eliminate studies on homeopathy and tried to counter anti vaccine beliefs. Energy healing was ""...relegated to the fringes, if not eliminated"". Most of the studies became centered around nutrition, exercise, ""...and other modalities within the realm of science-based medicine"". In 2009, after 17 years of government testing at a cost of $2.5 billion, almost no clearly proven efficacy of alternative therapies had been found. Senator Harkin complained, ""One of the purposes of this center was to investigate and validate alternative approaches. Quite frankly, I must say publicly that it has fallen short. I think quite frankly that in this center and in the office previously before it, most of its focus has been on disproving things rather than seeking out and approving."" Members of the scientific community criticized this comment as showing Senator Harkin did not understand the basics of scientific inquiry, which tests hypotheses, but never intentionally attempts to ""validate approaches"". In 2009, the NCCAM's yearly budget was increased to about $122 million. Overall NIH funding for CAM research increased to $300 million by 2009. By 2009, Americans were spending $34 billion annually on CAM. In 2012, the (JAMA) published a criticism that study after study had been funded by NCCAM, but ""failed to prove that complementary or alternative therapies are anything more than placebos"". The criticism pointed to large wasting of research money on testing scientifically implausible treatments, citing ""NCCAM officials spending $374,000 to find that inhaling lemon and lavender scents does not promote wound healing; $750,000 to find that prayer does not cure or hasten recovery from breast-reconstruction surgery; $390,000 to find that ancient Indian remedies do not control ; $700,000 to find that magnets do not treat arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, or migraine headaches; and $406,000 to find that coffee do not cure pancreatic cancer."" It was pointed out that negative results from testing were generally ignored by the public, that people continue to ""believe what they want to believe, arguing that it does not matter what the data show: They know what works for them"". Continued increasing use of CAM products was also blamed on the lack of FDA ability to regulate alternative products, where negative studies do not result in FDA warnings or FDA-mandated changes on labeling, whereby few consumers are aware that many claims of many supplements were found not to be supported. In 2014, while Josephine Briggs was the director, the NCCAM was renamed to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH). Briggs retired in October 2017. On August 29, 2018 the NCCIH announced as the new director. She was previously the director of the and professor-in-residence of medicine at . Her medical interests involve connective tissue. Langevin ""...believes that the stretching of connective tissue is how a number of CAM modalities ""work"", such as chiropractic, massage, and...acupuncture"". She has been studying acupuncture since the 1990s. says he is concerned that the ""...balance of power at NCCIH is about to shift back towards pseudoscience..."" and states that she will have the ""...largest budget ever at NCCIH to fund that shift"". NCCIH funds research into complementary and alternative medicine, including support for of CAM techniques. The four primary areas of focus are research, research training and career development, outreach, and integration. NCCIH divides complementary and alternative medicine into natural products, including and ; mind and body practices, including , , , , and (both and ); and other approaches, such as , , (TCM), and . The NCCIH charter states that ""Of the 18 appointed members (of the council) 12 shall be selected from among the leading representatives of the health and scientific disciplines (including not less than 2 individuals who are leaders in the fields of public health and the behavioral or social sciences) relevant to the activities of NCCIH, particularly representatives of the health and scientific disciplines in the area of complementary and alternative medicine. Nine of the members shall be practitioners licensed in one or more of the major systems with which the Center is involved. Six of the members shall be appointed by the Secretary from the general public and shall include leaders in the fields of public policy, law, health policy, economics, and management. Three of the six shall represent the interests of individual consumers of complementary and alternative medicine."" Since 1999 the division's funding has increased more than 6 fold. Up to 2012, OAM and NCCAM have spent $1.6 billion funding CAM grants. NCCAM supports about 50% of the total NCI spending on CAM between 1999 and 2009 making the total amount spent on CAM in this time $2.856 billion. The NCCIH budget for 2005 was $123 million. For fiscal year 2009 (ending September 30, 2009), it was $122 million. Research in alternative medicine is done elsewhere at NIH, notably in the . The NIH's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine had the same budget as NCCIH, $122 million, for fiscal year 2009. Other parts of NIH had an additional $50 million for FY 2009; NIH's total budget was about $29 billion. The NCCIH budget for 2015 was $124.1 million. They requested a $3,459,000 funding increase for their 2016 budget. 362 projects for diabetes (e.g. whether expressive writing reduces symptoms) Does inhaling lemon and lavender scents promote wound healing? Does distance healing improve outcome of HIV patients? “Distant healing or prayer from a distance does not appear to improve selected clinical outcomes in HIV patients who are on a combination antiretroviral therapy.” Can ancient Indian remedies control type 2 diabetes? Can magnets cure arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, or migraine headaches? ""[I]mprovements (in pain intensity) did not differ significantly from changes in the Sham group or in the Usual Care group."" Effects of Energy Healers on cholesterol-fed rabbits Of 52 CAM clinical trial studies on HIV and Cancer only 8 reported results. NCCAM also funds education and outreach programs. Despite the negative findings on the effectiveness of distance healing, NCCAM awarded $180,000 to a consultant to develop an Internet-based wellness program on the healing by . NCCIH has been criticized by , , and among others, for funding, along with the a study of for , which lasted about 10 years and cost about $31 million, even though smaller, controlled trials found chelation ineffective. Other NCCIH-funded studies have included the benefits of distant prayer for AIDS, the effects of lemon and lavender essential oils on wound healing, ""energy chelation"", and ""rats stressed out by white noise"". In 2006, NCCIH was criticized in with the comment ""NCCAM funds proposals of dubious merit; its research agenda is shaped more by politics than by science; and it is structured by its charter in a manner that precludes an independent review of its performance."" The authors suggested that, while it was appropriate to study alternative therapies, the quality of its research was lower than other NIH institutes, and that these studies could be performed under the auspices of other institutes within the NIH. As an example, the authors described a trial of with the for stage II to IV , in the belief that cancer is caused by a deficiency of pancreatic proteolytic enzymes. Severe adverse effects were associated with the Gonzalez regimen, and no evidence in journals supported the plausibility or efficacy of the regimen or chelation therapy. A 2012 study published in the examined the grants and awards funded by NCCIH from 2000 to 2011, which totaled $1.3 billion. The study found no discoveries in complementary and alternative medicine that would justify the existence of this center. The authors argued that, after 20 years and an expenditure of $2 billion, the failure of NCCIH was evidenced by the lack of publications and the failure to report clinical trials in peer-reviewed medical journals. They recommended that NCCIH be defunded or abolished, and the concept of funding alternative medicine be discontinued.

Plants have been the basis for medical treatments through most of human history, and such is still widely practiced today. Modern medicine makes use of many plant-derived compounds as the basis for evidence-based . Although herbalism may apply modern standards of effectiveness testing to herbs and medicines derived from natural sources, few high-quality and standards for purity or dosage exist. The scope of herbal medicine is sometimes extended to include and products, as well as , and certain animal parts. Herbal medicine is also called or describes and practices of using unrefined plant or animal as unproven medicines or health-promoting agents. Paraherbalism differs from plant-derived medicines in standard because it does not isolate or biologically active compounds, but rather relies on the belief that preserving various substances from a given source with less processing is safer or more effective – for which there is no evidence. Herbal most often fall under the phytotherapy category. Main articles: and A physician preparing an elixir, from an version of 's pharmacopoeia, 1224 Archaeological evidence indicates that the use of dates back to the , approximately 60,000 years ago. Written evidence of herbal remedies dates back over 5,000 years to the , who compiled lists of plants. Some ancient cultures wrote about plants and their medical uses in books called . In ancient Egypt, herbs are mentioned in , depicted in tomb illustrations, or on rare occasions found in medical jars containing trace amounts of herbs. Among the oldest, lengthiest, and most important medical papyri of ancient Egypt, the dates from about 1550 BC, and covers more than 700 compounds, mainly of plant origin. The earliest known herbals came from of Eresos who, in the 4th century BC, wrote in , from who wrote during the 3rd century BC, and from Krateuas who wrote in the 1st century BC. Only a few fragments of these works have survived intact, but from what remains, scholars noted overlap with the Egyptian herbals. Seeds likely used for herbalism were found in archaeological sites of China dating from the (c. 1600–1046 BC). Over a hundred of the 224 compounds mentioned in the , an early Chinese medical text, are herbs. Herbs also commonly featured in the of ancient India, where the principal treatment for diseases was diet. , originally written in Greek by (c. 40–90 AD) of , , a Greek physician, pharmacologist and botanist, is one example of herbal writing which was used for 1500 years until the 1600s. The (WHO) estimates that 80 percent of the population of some Asian and African countries presently use herbal medicine for some aspect of primary health care. Pharmaceuticals are prohibitively expensive for most of the world's population, half of whom lived on less than $2 U.S. per day in 2002. In comparison, herbal medicines can be grown from seed or gathered from nature for little or no cost. Many of the currently available to physicians have a long history of use as herbal remedies, including , , , , and . According to the World Health Organization, approximately 25% of modern drugs used in the United States have been derived from plants. At least 7,000 medical compounds in the modern pharmacopoeia are derived from plants. Among the 120 active compounds currently isolated from the higher plants and widely used in modern medicine today, 80% show a positive correlation between their modern therapeutic use and the traditional use of the plants from which they are derived. In a 2010 global survey of the most common 1000 plant-derived compounds, 156 had clinical trials published. Preclinical studies ( and animal studies) were reported for about one-half of the plant products, while 120 (12%) of the plants evaluated – although available in the Western market – had no rigorous studies of their properties, and five were toxic or allergenic, a finding that led the authors to conclude ""their use ought to be discouraged or forbidden."" Nine plants evaluated in human included (marshmallow), (marigold), (centella), (echinacea), (passionflower), (pomegranate), (cranberry), (bilberry), and (valerian), although generally there were inconsistent, often negative results, and the studies were of low quality. In 2015, the published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by ; Herbalism was one of 17 topics evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. Establishing guidelines to assess safety and efficacy of herbal products, the provides criteria for evaluating and grading the quality of clinical research in preparing monographs about herbal products. In the United States, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health of the funds clinical trials on herbal compounds, provides fact sheets evaluating the safety, potential effectiveness and side effects of many plant sources, and maintains a registry of clinical research conducted on herbal products. According to as of 2015, ""there is currently no strong evidence from studies in people that herbal remedies can treat, prevent or cure cancer"". The use of herbal remedies is more prevalent in patients with chronic diseases such as , , and . Multiple factors such as gender, age, ethnicity, education and social class are also shown to have association with prevalence of herbal remedies use. A survey released in May 2004 by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health focused on who used (CAM), what was used, and why it was used. The survey was limited to adults, aged 18 years and over during 2002, living in the . According to this survey, herbal therapy, or use of natural products other than and minerals, was the most commonly used CAM therapy (18.9%) when all use of was excluded. Herbal remedies are very common in . In , herbal medications are dispensed by apothecaries (e.g., Apotheke). Prescription drugs are sold alongside essential oils, herbal extracts, or . Herbal remedies are seen by some as a treatment to be preferred to pure medical compounds that have been industrially produced. In India the herbal remedy is so popular that the government of India has created a separate department—AYUSH—under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The National Medicinal Plants Board was also established in 2000 by the Indian government in order to deal with the herbal medical system. There are many forms in which herbs can be administered, the most common of which is in the form of a liquid that is drunk by the patient—either an herbal tea or a (possibly diluted) plant extract. Several methods of standardization may be determining the amount of herbs used. One is the ratio of raw materials to solvent. However different specimens of even the same plant species may vary in chemical content. For this reason, is sometimes used by growers to assess the content of their products before use. Another method is standardization on a signal chemical. Leaves of being packed into a steam unit to gather its , or tisanes, are the resultant liquid of extracting herbs into water, though they are made in a few different ways. are hot water extracts of herbs, such as or , through . are the long-term boiled extracts, usually of harder substances like roots or bark. is the cold infusion of plants with high -content, such as or . To make macerates, plants are chopped and added to cold water. They are then left to stand for 7 to 12 hours (depending on herb used). For most macerates, 10 hours is used. are alcoholic extracts of herbs, which are generally stronger than herbal teas. Tinctures are usually obtained by combining 100% pure ethanol (or a mixture of 100% ethanol with water) with the herb. A completed tincture has an ethanol percentage of at least 25% (sometimes up to 90%). Non-alcoholic tinctures can be made with glycerin but it is believed to be less absorbed by the body than alcohol based tinctures and has a shorter shelf life. Herbal wine and are alcoholic extract of herbs, usually with an ethanol percentage of 12–38%. include liquid extracts, dry extracts, and nebulisates. Liquid extracts are liquids with a lower ethanol percentage than tinctures. They are usually made by vacuum tinctures. Dry extracts are extracts of plant material that are into a dry mass. They can then be further refined to a capsule or tablet. The exact composition of an herbal product is influenced by the method of extraction. A tea will be rich in components because is a . Oil on the other hand is a solvent and it will absorb non-polar compounds. Alcohol lies somewhere in between. Many herbs are applied topically to the skin in a variety of forms. extracts can be applied to the skin, usually diluted in a carrier oil. Many essential oils can burn the skin or are simply too high dose used straight; diluting them in olive oil or another food grade oil such as almond oil can allow these to be used safely as a topical. , oils, , creams and lotions are other forms of topical delivery mechanisms. Most topical applications are oil extractions of herbs. Taking a food grade oil and soaking herbs in it for anywhere from weeks to months allows certain phytochemicals to be extracted into the oil. This oil can then be made into salves, creams, lotions, or simply used as an oil for topical application. Many massage oils, antibacterial salves, and wound healing compounds are made this way. , as in , can be used as a treatment. For partial list of herbs with known adverse effects, see . has been used in Ayurveda for various treatments, but contains , such as and , which may cause severe toxicity. A number of herbs are thought to be likely to cause adverse effects. Furthermore, ""adulteration, inappropriate formulation, or lack of understanding of plant and drug interactions have led to adverse reactions that are sometimes life threatening or lethal."" Proper double-blind clinical trials are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of each plant before they can be recommended for medical use. Although many consumers believe that herbal medicines are safe because they are natural, herbal medicines and synthetic drugs may interact, causing toxicity to the patient. Herbal remedies can also be dangerously contaminated, and herbal medicines without established efficacy, may unknowingly be used to replace medicines that do have corroborated efficacy. Standardization of purity and dosage is not mandated in the United States, but even products made to the same specification may differ as a result of biochemical variations within a species of plant. Plants have chemical defense mechanisms against predators that can have adverse or lethal effects on humans. Examples of highly toxic herbs include poison hemlock and nightshade. They are not marketed to the public as herbs, because the risks are well known, partly due to a long and colorful history in Europe, associated with ""sorcery"", ""magic"" and intrigue. Although not frequent, adverse reactions have been reported for herbs in widespread use. On occasion serious untoward outcomes have been linked to herb consumption. A case of major potassium depletion has been attributed to chronic licorice ingestion., and consequently professional herbalists avoid the use of licorice where they recognize that this may be a risk. Black cohosh has been implicated in a case of liver failure. Few studies are available on the safety of herbs for pregnant women, and one study found that use of complementary and alternative medicines are associated with a 30% lower ongoing pregnancy and live birth rate during fertility treatment. Examples of herbal treatments with likely cause-effect relationships with adverse events include aconite, which is often a legally restricted herb, ayurvedic remedies, broom, chaparral, Chinese herb mixtures, comfrey, herbs containing certain flavonoids, germander, guar gum, liquorice root, and pennyroyal. Examples of herbs where a high degree of confidence of a risk long term adverse effects can be asserted include ginseng, which is unpopular among herbalists for this reason, the endangered herb goldenseal, milk thistle, senna, against which herbalists generally advise and rarely use, aloe vera juice, buckthorn bark and berry, cascara sagrada bark, saw palmetto, valerian, kava, which is banned in the European Union, St. John's wort, Khat, Betel nut, the restricted herb Ephedra, and Guarana. There is also concern with respect to the numerous well-established interactions of herbs and drugs.

Education of herbalists varies considerably in different areas of the world. Lay herbalists and traditional indigenous generally rely upon apprenticeship and recognition from their communities in lieu of formal schooling. In some countries, formalized training and minimum education standards exist, although these are not necessarily uniform within or between countries. In Australia, for example, the self-regulated status of the profession (as of 2009) resulted in variable standards of training, and numerous loosely-formed associations setting different educational standards. One 2009 review concluded that regulation of herbalists in Australia was needed to reduce the risk of interaction of herbal medicines with , to implement clinical guidelines and prescription of herbal products, and to assure self-regulation for protection of public health and safety.

Manufacturers of products falling into this category are not required to prove the safety or efficacy of their product so long as they do not make 'medical' claims or imply uses other than as a 'dietary supplement', though the FDA may withdraw a product from sale should it prove harmful.

Globally, there are no standards across various herbal products to authenticate their contents, safety or efficacy, and there is generally an absence of high-quality scientific research on product composition or effectiveness for anti-disease activity. Presumed claims of therapeutic benefit from herbal products, without rigorous evidence of efficacy and safety, receive skeptical views by scientists.

It relies on the false belief that preserving the complexity of substances from a given plant with less processing is safer and potentially more effective, for which there is no evidence either condition applies. Phytochemical researcher described paraherbalism as ""faulty or inferior herbalism based on pseudoscience"", using scientific terminology but lacking scientific evidence for safety and efficacy. Tyler listed ten that distinguished herbalism from paraherbalism, including claims that there is a to suppress safe and effective herbs, herbs can not cause harm, that whole herbs are more effective than molecules isolated from the plants, herbs are superior to drugs, the (the belief that the shape of the plant indicates its function) is valid, dilution of substances increases their potency (a doctrine of the pseudoscience of ), astrological alignments are significant, animal testing is not appropriate to indicate human effects, is an effective means of proving a substance works and herbs were created by to cure disease.

In India the herbal remedy is so popular that the government of India has created a separate department—AYUSH—under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The National Medicinal Plants Board was also established in 2000 by the Indian government in order to deal with the herbal medical system. There are many forms in which herbs can be administered, the most common of which is in the form of a liquid that is drunk by the patient—either an herbal tea or a (possibly diluted) plant extract. Several methods of standardization may be determining the amount of herbs used. One is the ratio of raw materials to solvent. However different specimens of even the same plant species may vary in chemical content. For this reason, is sometimes used by growers to assess the content of their products before use. Another method is standardization on a signal chemical. Leaves of being packed into a steam unit to gather its , or tisanes, are the resultant liquid of extracting herbs into water, though they are made in a few different ways. are hot water extracts of herbs, such as or , through . are the long-term boiled extracts, usually of harder substances like roots or bark. is the cold infusion of plants with high -content, such as or . To make macerates, plants are chopped and added to cold water. They are then left to stand for 7 to 12 hours (depending on herb used). For most macerates, 10 hours is used. are alcoholic extracts of herbs, which are generally stronger than herbal teas. Tinctures are usually obtained by combining 100% pure ethanol (or a mixture of 100% ethanol with water) with the herb. A completed tincture has an ethanol percentage of at least 25% (sometimes up to 90%). Non-alcoholic tinctures can be made with glycerin but it is believed to be less absorbed by the body than alcohol based tinctures and has a shorter shelf life. Herbal wine and are alcoholic extract of herbs, usually with an ethanol percentage of 12–38%. include liquid extracts, dry extracts, and nebulisates. Liquid extracts are liquids with a lower ethanol percentage than tinctures. They are usually made by vacuum tinctures. Dry extracts are extracts of plant material that are into a dry mass. They can then be further refined to a capsule or tablet. The exact composition of an herbal product is influenced by the method of extraction. A tea will be rich in components because is a . Oil on the other hand is a solvent and it will absorb non-polar compounds. Alcohol lies somewhere in between. Many herbs are applied topically to the skin in a variety of forms. extracts can be applied to the skin, usually diluted in a carrier oil. Many essential oils can burn the skin or are simply too high dose used straight; diluting them in olive oil or another food grade oil such as almond oil can allow these to be used safely as a topical. , oils, , creams and lotions are other forms of topical delivery mechanisms. Most topical applications are oil extractions of herbs. Taking a food grade oil and soaking herbs in it for anywhere from weeks to months allows certain phytochemicals to be extracted into the oil. This oil can then be made into salves, creams, lotions, or simply used as an oil for topical application. Many massage oils, antibacterial salves, and wound healing compounds are made this way. , as in , can be used as a treatment. For partial list of herbs with known adverse effects, see . has been used in Ayurveda for various treatments, but contains , such as and , which may cause severe toxicity. A number of herbs are thought to be likely to cause adverse effects. Furthermore, ""adulteration, inappropriate formulation, or lack of understanding of plant and drug interactions have led to adverse reactions that are sometimes life threatening or lethal."" Proper double-blind clinical trials are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of each plant before they can be recommended for medical use. Although many consumers believe that herbal medicines are safe because they are natural, herbal medicines and synthetic drugs may interact, causing toxicity to the patient. Herbal remedies can also be dangerously contaminated, and herbal medicines without established efficacy, may unknowingly be used to replace medicines that do have corroborated efficacy. Standardization of purity and dosage is not mandated in the United States, but even products made to the same specification may differ as a result of biochemical variations within a species of plant. Plants have chemical defense mechanisms against predators that can have adverse or lethal effects on humans. Examples of highly toxic herbs include poison hemlock and nightshade. They are not marketed to the public as herbs, because the risks are well known, partly due to a long and colorful history in Europe, associated with ""sorcery"", ""magic"" and intrigue. Although not frequent, adverse reactions have been reported for herbs in widespread use. On occasion serious untoward outcomes have been linked to herb consumption. A case of major potassium depletion has been attributed to chronic licorice ingestion., and consequently professional herbalists avoid the use of licorice where they recognize that this may be a risk. Black cohosh has been implicated in a case of liver failure. Few studies are available on the safety of herbs for pregnant women, and one study found that use of complementary and alternative medicines are associated with a 30% lower ongoing pregnancy and live birth rate during fertility treatment. Examples of herbal treatments with likely cause-effect relationships with adverse events include aconite, which is often a legally restricted herb, ayurvedic remedies, broom, chaparral, Chinese herb mixtures, comfrey, herbs containing certain flavonoids, germander, guar gum, liquorice root, and pennyroyal. Examples of herbs where a high degree of confidence of a risk long term adverse effects can be asserted include ginseng, which is unpopular among herbalists for this reason, the endangered herb goldenseal, milk thistle, senna, against which herbalists generally advise and rarely use, aloe vera juice, buckthorn bark and berry, cascara sagrada bark, saw palmetto, valerian, kava, which is banned in the European Union, St. John's wort, Khat, Betel nut, the restricted herb Ephedra, and Guarana. There is also concern with respect to the numerous well-established interactions of herbs and drugs. In consultation with a physician, usage of herbal remedies should be clarified, as some herbal remedies have the potential to cause adverse drug interactions when used in combination with various prescription and pharmaceuticals, just as a patient should inform a herbalist of their consumption of orthodox prescription and other medication. For example, dangerously low blood pressure may result from the combination of an herbal remedy that lowers blood pressure together with prescription medicine that has the same effect. Some herbs may amplify the effects of anticoagulants. Certain herbs as well as common fruit interfere with cytochrome P450, an enzyme critical to much drug metabolism. In a 2018 study, FDA identified active in over 700 of analyzed dietary supplements sold as ""herbal"", ""natural"" or ""traditional"". The undisclosed additives included ""unapproved antidepressants and designer steroids"", as well as , such as or . A 2013 study found that one-third of herbal supplements sampled contained no trace of the herb listed on the label. The study found products adulterated with contaminants or not listed on the label, including potential allergens such as soy, wheat, or black walnut. One bottle labeled as was found to actually contain , a laxative. Researchers at the found in 2014 that almost 20 per cent of herbal remedies surveyed were not registered with the Therapeutic Goods Administration, despite this being a condition for their sale. They also found that nearly 60 per cent of products surveyed had ingredients that did not match what was on the label. Out of 121 products, only 15 had ingredients that matched their TGA listing and packaging. In 2015, the issued letters to four major U.S. retailers (, , , and ) who were accused of selling herbal supplements that were mislabeled and potentially dangerous. Twenty-four products were tested by as part of the investigation, with all but five containing DNA that did not match the product labels. A herbalist gathers the flower heads of . Herbalists must learn many skills, including the or cultivation of herbs, diagnosis and treatment of conditions or dispensing herbal medication, and preparations of herbal medications. Education of herbalists varies considerably in different areas of the world. Lay herbalists and traditional indigenous generally rely upon apprenticeship and recognition from their communities in lieu of formal schooling. In some countries, formalized training and minimum education standards exist, although these are not necessarily uniform within or between countries. In Australia, for example, the self-regulated status of the profession (as of 2009) resulted in variable standards of training, and numerous loosely-formed associations setting different educational standards. One 2009 review concluded that regulation of herbalists in Australia was needed to reduce the risk of interaction of herbal medicines with , to implement clinical guidelines and prescription of herbal products, and to assure self-regulation for protection of public health and safety. In the , the training of herbalists is done by state funded universities offering degrees in herbal medicine. In the United States, according to the American Herbalist Guild, ""there is currently no licensing or certification for herbalists in any state that precludes the rights of anyone to use, dispense, or recommend herbs."" However, there are U.S. federal restrictions for marketing herbs as cures for medical conditions, or essentially practicing as an unlicensed physician. In 2017, the issued a to an herbalist company for marketing products under ""conditions that cause them to be drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)], because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body."" The (WHO), the specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) that is concerned with international public health, published Quality control methods for medicinal plant materials in 1998 in order to support WHO Member States in establishing quality standards and specifications for herbal materials, within the overall context of quality assurance and control of herbal medicines. In the (EU), herbal medicines are regulated under the . In the , herbal remedies are regulated by the (FDA) under (cGMP) policy for dietary supplements. Manufacturers of products falling into this category are not required to prove the safety or efficacy of their product so long as they do not make 'medical' claims or imply uses other than as a 'dietary supplement', though the FDA may withdraw a product from sale should it prove harmful. Canadian regulations are described by the Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate which requires an eight-digit Natural Product Number or Homeopathic Medicine Number on the label of licensed herbal medicines or dietary supplements. Some herbs, such as and , are outright banned in most countries though coca is legal in most of the countries where it is grown. The is used as an herbal , and as such is in some parts of the world. Since 2004, the sales of as a dietary supplement is prohibited in the United States by the FDA, and subject to Schedule III restrictions in the United Kingdom. Herbalism has been criticized as a potential """" of unreliable product quality, safety hazards, and potential for misleading health advice. Globally, there are no standards across various herbal products to authenticate their contents, safety or efficacy, and there is generally an absence of high-quality scientific research on product composition or effectiveness for anti-disease activity. Presumed claims of therapeutic benefit from herbal products, without rigorous evidence of efficacy and safety, receive skeptical views by scientists. Unethical practices by some herbalists and manufacturers, which may include false advertising about health benefits on product labels or literature, and contamination or use of fillers during product preparation, may erode about services and products. An example of a herbal medicine resource: the bark of the tree contains , which today is a widely prescribed treatment for . The unpurified bark is still used by some who can not afford to purchase more expensive antimalarial drugs. is the use of of plant or animal origin as supposed medicines or health-promoting agents. Phytotherapy differs from plant-derived medicines in standard because it does not isolate and the compounds from a given plant believed to be biologically active. It relies on the false belief that preserving the complexity of substances from a given plant with less processing is safer and potentially more effective, for which there is no evidence either condition applies. Phytochemical researcher described paraherbalism as ""faulty or inferior herbalism based on pseudoscience"", using scientific terminology but lacking scientific evidence for safety and efficacy. Tyler listed ten that distinguished herbalism from paraherbalism, including claims that there is a to suppress safe and effective herbs, herbs can not cause harm, that whole herbs are more effective than molecules isolated from the plants, herbs are superior to drugs, the (the belief that the shape of the plant indicates its function) is valid, dilution of substances increases their potency (a doctrine of the pseudoscience of ), astrological alignments are significant, animal testing is not appropriate to indicate human effects, is an effective means of proving a substance works and herbs were created by to cure disease. Tyler suggests that none of these beliefs have any basis in fact. Ready to drink medicinal liquor with , , and , for sale at a traditional medicine market in , . Up to 80% of the population in Africa uses traditional medicine as primary health care. Native Americans medicinally used about 2,500 of the approximately 20,000 plant species that are native to North America.

The medicine book from dated from circa 1700 contains 3,000 entries of jamu herbal recipes, while Javanese classical literature (1814) describes some jamu herbal concoction recipes. Though possibly influenced by Indian systems, Indonesia's vast archipelago holds numerous indigenous plants not to be found in India, including plants similar to those in beyond the . Jamu practices may vary from region to region, and are often not written down, especially in remote areas of the country. Although primarily herbal, some Jamu materials are acquired from animals, such as , , and . Herbalists tend to use extracts from parts of plants, such as the roots or leaves, believing that plants are subject to environmental pressures and therefore develop resistance to threats such as radiation, and microbial attack in order to survive, providing defensive of use in herbalism. Indigenous healers often claim to have learned by observing that sick animals change their food preferences to nibble at bitter herbs they would normally reject.

These healers are effectively who are highly revered and respected in a society where illness is thought to be caused by witchcraft, pollution (contact with impure objects or occurrences) or through neglect of the ancestors. It is estimated that there are as many as 200,000 traditional healers in South Africa compared to 25,000 doctors trained in bio-medical medicine. Traditional healers are consulted by approximately 60% of the South African population, usually in conjunction with modern biomedical services.

These muti often have powerful symbolism; for example, fat might be prepared for children to promote courage. There are medicines for everything from physical and mental illness, social disharmony and spiritual difficulties to potions for protection, love and luck. Although is a term that is colloquially used to commonly describe all types of Southern African traditional healers, there are differences between practices: an inyanga is concerned mainly with medicines made from plants and animals, while a sangoma relies primarily on divination for healing purposes and might also be considered a type of . In modern times, , , and have blurred the distinction between the two and traditional healers tend to practice both arts. Traditional healers can alternate between these roles by diagnosing common illnesses, selling and dispensing remedies for medical complaints, and divining cause and providing solutions to spiritually or socially centred complaints. Each culture has their own terminology for their traditional healers. traditional healers are known as (herbalists) or (diviners). and are the terms in and respectively, while among the they are called . The Tsonga refer to their healers as or . A sangoma is a practitioner of , a philosophy based on a belief in (: ; : ; : ; : ) and the practice of , which is often a mix of medicinal plants and various animal body fats or skin. Sangomas perform a holistic and symbolic form of healing by drawing on the embedded beliefs of the , who believe that ancestors in the afterlife guide and protect the living. Sangomas are called to heal, and through them it is believed that ancestors from the spirit world can give instruction and advice to heal illness, social disharmony and spiritual difficulties. Traditional healers work in a sacred healing hut or , where they believe their ancestors reside. Where no physical 'indumba' is available, a makeshift miniature sacred place called can be used. Sangomas believe they are able to access advice and guidance from the ancestors for their patients through by an ancestor, or , throwing bones, or by . In possession states, the sangoma works themself into a trance through drumming, dancing and chanting, and allows their ego to step aside for an ancestor to take possession of his or her body and communicate directly with the patient, or dancing fervently beyond their stated ability. The sangoma will provide specific information about the problems of the patient. Some sangomas speak to their patients through normal conversation, whilst others speak in tongues, or languages foreign to their patients, but all languages used by sangomas are indigenous Southern African languages depending on the specific ancestors being called upon. Not all sangomas follow the same rituals or beliefs. Ancestral spirits can be the personal ancestors of the sangoma or the patient or they might be general ancestors associated with the geographic area or the community. It is believed that the spirits have the power to intervene in people's lives who work to connect the sangoma to the spirits that are acting in a manner to cause affliction. For example, a crab could be invoked as a mediator between the human world and the world of spirits because of its ability to move between the world of the land and the sea. Helping and harming spirits are believed to use the human body as a battleground for their own conflicts. By using ngoma, the sangoma believes they can create harmony between the spirits which is thought to bring an alleviation of the patient's suffering. The sangoma may burn incense (like ) or sacrifice animals to please the ancestral spirits. is also used to communicate with the ancestors through prayer. A sangoma's goal in healing is to establish a balanced and harmless relationship between the afflicted patient and the spirits that are causing their illness or problem. The healer intercedes between the patient and the world of the dead in order to make restitution. This is generally performed through divination (throwing the bones or ancestral channeling), purification rituals, or animal sacrifice to appease the spirits through atonement. Sangoma performing a divination by reading the bones after being thrown Throwing the bones to access the advice of ancestors is an alternative practice to the exhausting ritual of possession by the ancestor. In a typical session, a patient will visit the sangoma and the sangoma must determine what the affliction is or the reason the patient has come to them for help. Before the throwing of the bones; the healer should first ask the name and surname of the patient; the healer then calls the ancestors by names, starting with his/her initiators' names, then his\hers then followed by the patient's ancestors names. The patient or diviner throws bones on the floor, which may include animal vertebrae, dominoes, dice, coins, shells and stones, each with a specific significance to human life. For example, a bone signifies a thief and will provide information about stolen objects. The sangoma or the patient throws the bones but the ancestors control how they lie. The sangoma then interprets this metaphor in relation to the patient's afflictions, what the ancestors of the patient require, and how to resolve the disharmony. In the same way, sangomas will interpret metaphors present in dreams, either their own or their patients. When the diviner comes to an acceptable understanding of the problem and the patient agrees, the diviner then needs to again throw the bones to ask the ancestors if he/she could help the patient. Depending on the feedback from the bones he/she will instruct the patient on a course of medicine which may include the use of ngoma, referral to a herbalist, inyanga (if the sangoma does not have the knowledge themselves), or recommend a Western medicine regimen. The prescribed by a traditional healer are called . They may be employed in healing as warranted in the opinion of the herbal specialist or inyanga. Muti is a term derived from a word for tree. African makes extensive use of botanical products but the medicine prescribed by an inyanga may also include other formulations which are zoological or mineral in composition. Traditional medicine uses approximately 3,000 out of 30,000 species of higher plants of Southern Africa. Over 300 species of plants have been identified as having psychoactive healing effects on the nervous system, many of which need further cultural and scientific study In and , the word muti is sometimes used as a for medicine in general. Mutis are prepared, and depending on the affliction, a number of purification practices can be administered Fasting one of the most important thing to do in preparing muti and healing. These practices include bathing, vomiting, steaming, nasal ingestion, , and cuttings: Bathing – Herbal mixtures are added to bath water to purify the patient Vomiting () – A large volume (up to +-2 litres) of a weak, lukewarm herbal infusion is drunk and a process of self-induced vomiting occurs to cleanse and tone the system. Steaming () – Medicinal herbs are commonly inhaled by steaming them in a bucket of boiling water. A blanket is used to cover the patient and container. Hot rocks or a portable stove may be included to keep the bucket boiling. The patient sits under the blanket or plastic (preferably) as blankets get to absorb the heat and the steam doesn't rotate well, breathes in the herbal steam and sweats. Nasally – A variety of plants can be taken dried and powdered as snuff. Some are taken to induce sneezing which may traditionally be believed to aid the expulsion of disease. Others are taken for the common conditions such as headaches. Enemas – Infusions and some decoctions are commonly administered as enemas. The enema is a preferred route of administration of certain plant extracts, as it is believed they are more effective when administered this way. Cuttings () – Extracts or powders are directly applied to small cuts made with a razor blade in the patients skin. An experienced inyanga/Sangoma will generally seek the guidance of an ancestral spirit before embarking to find and collect muti and you can also go to herbalists to ask for a certain plant/herb you need. The healer, through dreams or during prayers, believes they are advised of auspicious times for collecting the plants. In some cases, symbols and dreams are also interpreted to determine which particular plants to collect for a specific patient and where these plants are located, not in all cases as most traditional healers have their herbs stored in their huts(). The healer supplements the perceived advice from an ancestral spirit with their own knowledge, training and experience. An initiate () being led towards the goat that will be sacrificed at her initiation into becoming a sangoma. Both men and women can become traditional healers. A sangoma is believed to be ""called"" to heal through an initiation illness; symptoms involve , , intractable stomach pain, shoulder, neck complaints, short breath, swollen feet and waist issues or illness that cannot be cured by conventional methods. These problems together must be seen by a sangoma as or the calling of the ancestors. Sangomas believe that failure to respond to the calling will result in further illness until the person concedes and goes to be trained. The word is derived from which means 'the light of the new moon' or from meaning 'to be led to the light'. A trainee sangoma (or ) trains formally under another sangoma for a period of anywhere between a number of months and many years. The training involves learning humility to the ancestors, purification through steaming, washing in the blood of sacrificed animals, and the use of , medicines with spiritual significance. The ithwasa may not see their families during training and must abstain from sexual contact and often live under harsh and strict conditions. This is part of the cleansing process to prepare the healer for a life's work of dedication to healing and the intense experiences of training tend to earn a deeply entrenched place in the sangoma's memory. During the training period the ithwasa will share their ailments in the form of song and dance, a process that is nurtured by the analysis of dreams, anxieties, and with prayer. The story develops into a song which becomes a large part of the graduation-type ceremony that marks the end of the ukuthwasa training. At times in the training, and for the graduation, a ritual is performed (usually chickens and a goat or a cow). At the end of ukuthwasa and during initiation, early hours of the morning a goat that will be slaughtered should be a female one, that's for , the second one will be slaughtered the following morning after the chickens, which are sacrificed at the river . All this sacrifices are to call to the ancestors and appease them. The local community, friends and family are all invited to the initiation to witness and celebrate the completion of training. The ithwasane is also tested by the local elder sangomas to determine whether they have the skills and insight necessary to heal. The climactic initiation test is to ensure the ithwasa has the ability to ""see"" things hidden from view. This is signified and proved when other sangomas hide the ithwasa's sacred objects, including the gall bladder of the goat that was sacrificed and the thwasane must, in front of the community, call upon their ancestors, find the hidden objects, which includes the skin of the goat, , the ancestors clothes and return them back to the sangomas that hid them, thus proving they have the ability to ""see"" beyond the physical world. The heading practice is also done at night after taking off all those traditional clothing you had worn all day, they hide them for that thwasane to look for them again. The graduation ceremony takes 3 days from Friday till Sunday, the early hours of the morning the thwasane needs to sweep the whole yard, wash his/her clothes and also to bath at the river, he/she should return home when they are dry. in traditional attire dancing in celebration of his ancestors Sangoma can also literally mean 'person of the drum' or 'the drumming one' and drumming is an important part of summoning the ancestors. During times of celebration (e.g. at an Initiation) the possessed sangoma is called to dance and celebrate their ancestors. The sangoma will fall into trance(When in trance the Sangoma isn't conscious of what is happening, so after that he/she will be told of the things he/she had said) where the ancestors will be channeled (which is signified in Zulu traditions by episodes of convulsive fits) followed by the singing of ancestral songs. These songs are echoed back to the ancestor via the audience in a process of . The possessed sangoma will then change into their traditional ancestral clothing and dance vigorously while others and sing in celebration. The word with prefix is (pl. ), alternatively it is also spelled as (pl. ), means 'do and means ""those who do "", so or refers specifically to the practitioner of the practice. Sangoma/N'anga in Johannesburg, South Africa, performing a traditional baptism to protect the spirit of the baby The term sangoma is often used colloquially in South Africa for equivalent professions in other in . Forms of the ritual are practiced throughout southern and south-eastern Africa in countries such as , , , , , , and . In more northern areas the practices are generally more diverse and less organized than the southern practices. Among the , the practice is called or more negatively , a term meaning witchcraft. Ngoma is believed to have come to southern Africa during the that began around 2000 BCE and was further influenced by the that occurred until 500 CE. The practice has evolved along with the social problems of its users. In pre-colonial form ngoma songs dealt mainly with issues of hunting. Over time the system adapted to include the introduction of guns, and later the racial and class struggles of practitioners under colonial rule. In Zimbabwe, the civil war experience led to a revival of ngoma practice with a new emphasis on the spirits of the victims of war. The service allowed the sangoma to help people cope with their own violent acts as well as those they had fallen victim to. An example of this is the who believe that one of the main alien spirits that can bestow powers of clairvoyance and the ability to detect is the Ndau Spirit. The Ndau spirit possesses the descendants of the who had slain the and taken their wives. Once the Ndau spirit has been converted from hostile to benevolent forces, the spirits bestow the powers of divination and healing on the n'angna. In addition, ngoma has been adapted by many to include both Christian and Muslim beliefs. Sangomas are legally recognised in South Africa as ""traditional health practitioners"", under the Traditional Health Practitioners Act of 2007 (Act. 22 of 2007) as diviners alongside herbalists, traditional birth attendants, and traditional surgeons. The act calls for the establishment of a national council of traditional health practitioners to regulate and register a.o. sangomas in the country. However, it was only in December 2011 that the took action and opened nominations for seats on an interim council. In October 2012, Health Department spokesperson Joe Maila advised that the Department aimed to have the council up and running by the end of 2012. The Interim Traditional Health Practitioners Council was eventually inaugurated on 12 February 2013. Several sections of the act, dealing with the establishment and governance of the national council and the registration of practitioners, came into effect on 1 May 2014. Previously, the had passed the Traditional Health Practitioners Act of 2004 (Act. 35 of 2004). However, the act was ruled after Doctors for Life International challenged it at the , citing the insufficient public participation at provincial level in the drafting of the act. The received a submission from the Traditional Healers Organisation requesting the investigation of the constitutionality of the and the , the drafting of which was suspended in 2008. On 23 March 2010 the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development approved a South African Law Reform Commission project to review witchcraft legislation. In March 2012 the South African Law Reform Commission advised that Ms Jennifer Joni has been designated as researcher and Judge Dennis Davis has been designated as project leader for Project 135: Review of witchcraft legislation. Dr Theodore Petrus, who completed a doctoral thesis on witchcraft-related crime in 2009, was invited to become part of an advisory committee to assist in the review. After a successful initiation in , Johannesburg, Gogo Mashele of the Tshwane Traditional & Faith Healers Forum welcomes new sangomas (including a white thwasa) While there are recorded instances of sangomas before 1994, since 1994 an increasing number of white people have openly trained as sangomas in South Africa. The question of authenticity is still an ongoing discussion. According to Nokuzola Mndende of the Icamagu Institute, a Xhosa sangoma and former lecturer in at the : An igqirha is someone who has been called by their ancestors to heal, whether from the maternal or paternal side, they can't be called by [somebody else's] ancestors. Philip Kubekeli, director of the Traditional Medical Practitioners, Herbalist and Spiritual Healers Association, and Phephsile Maseko, spokesperson of the Traditional Healers Organisation, see nothing wrong with white sangomas. Kubekeli and Maseko maintain the position that traditional healing knows no colour. Several white sangomas, interviewed by in 2010, claimed that they have been welcomed by the black community in South Africa, aside from isolated experiences of hostility. On the other hand, there have also been reports that white sangomas have been less readily accepted by black sangomas. A number of the South African traditions (e.g. and ) believe that a foreign or alien spirit can call one to become a traditional healer, which they call , especially if there is a significant extreme relationship between one of the healer's biological ancestors and the foreign spirit that occurred in the past. Dr Nhlavana Maseko, founder of the Traditional Healers Organisation, explains: Foreign spirits are not of your family. That is all it means. Foreign spirits are not your ancestors. My forefathers, for instance, were warriors and they killed some people. When these people were killed, they become my family's foreign spirits. There must be a working relationship with your foreign spirit and your ancestors. They have something, an injustice, a murder that must be worked out, must be healed. During training, as the ancestors come out, you have to finish up with your own ancestors first. That relationship sorts itself out, then you are ready to work with the foreign spirits. It happens in a natural way. The ancestors do the work through you. Maybe the foreign spirit want to be the important or senior ancestor; when the ancestor of your clan comes, well, they may have to fight it out. You might feel some aches during this time. It is friction among them that is working itself out. Inyanga in her ndumba, a sacred hut used for healing. Behind her are her , medicine stored in containers. The formal health sector has shown continued interest in the role of sangomas and the efficacy of their herbal remedies. and continue to study the ingredients of traditional medicines in use by sangomas. Well known contributions to world medicine from South African herbal remedies include , and . Public health specialists are now enlisting sangomas in the fight, not only against the spread of /, but also and , which are major causes of death in rural areas, especially in children. In the past decade, the role of traditional healers has become important in fighting the impact of HIV and treating people infected with the virus before they advance to a point where they require (or can obtain) anti-retroviral drugs. However, there are no traditional medicines in South Africa that have clinically been proven to be effective in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. A conclusion from a review by in September 2000, regarding collaboration with traditional healers in HIV/AIDS prevention and care, found that modern and traditional belief systems are not incompatible, but complementary. While for many they provide the healing needed, there are some causes for concern. who have not undergone thwasa charge exorbitant prices for fraudulent service, and not all countries in southern Africa have effective regulatory bodies to prevent this practice. Some sangomas have been known to abuse the charismatic power they have over their patients by sexually assaulting them, sometimes dressed up as ritual. Repeated use of the same to make incisions for carries transmission risks in regions where the disease is rife. Western-style doctors have seen a number of cases of patients with serious gastrointestinal problems through the use of muti, especially in enema form, and have coined the phrase ""ritual enema induced colitis"" to describe the phenomenon. Typical flyer advertising found around the major cities of South Africa Some charlatans have set up bogus healing practices, where they exploit clients for as much money as possible. These charlatans often call themselves doctors or professors and claim themselves as sangomas, faith healers, psychics or as traditional healers, but have no legitimate references and are not trained as such. All this Charlatans do not really see the negative impact they make in the community as all they want is quick money, it is believed these people use for one not to even see when they are being scammed, most scammers claim to be able to help people multiply their wealth, perform abortions, penis enlargement, bring your love back. A true Sangome/Inyanga stays in one place not moving around. In the , they often adopt in order to attract the local population, who are in part . They advertise through flyers, posters and adverts that are commonly plastered on the streets and lamposts of cities throughout South Africa, especially in densely populated urban areas. The adverts make outlandish promises and claims about spells that bring back lost lovers, potions to and spells that will make people rich or provide them with luck to win in gambling or the lottery, to name a few. The sophistication of their advertising also extends to advertising in local newspapers and internet websites. Many people have lost significant amounts of money from scams, tricks and false promises that these charlatans use in their cons. Many women have significantly damaged their reproductive organs and the ability to reproduce, due to back street abortions. Legitimate sangomas are angered by these charlatans and are working to end the trade of bogus traditional healers and fake sangomas through regulation, legal action and awareness. They believe the charlatans harm the reputation of the legitimate traditional healers and also damage the lives of many innocent people. As a general rule, sangomas tend not to advertise through flyers or posters. They tend to rely more on their reputation, word of mouth and their trust in their ancestors to bring them the right clients. Sangomas don’t do miracles and there is no such a thing as doubling a person’s money. They only help to connect with the ancestors, who gives them directions on how to heal and assist people in need. The ancestors get angry when people play with their name and end up taking away the powers and calling given to a person. The [real] sangomas are not rich because they are controlled by the ancestors. The bogus sangomas cause people to not believe [in the] ancestors, because they lie about their work with the ancestors. Dr Motlalepula Matsabisa, director of the Medical Research Council's Indigenous Knowledge Unit, says there appears to be many fake traditional healers around, however because of a lack of regulation, they go unchecked and explains that if anyone can bring about good luck and predict lotto numbers, they wouldn't be poor themselves. However, he also warns that people should not be gullible. Phephsile Maseko, national co-ordinator of the Traditional Healers Organisation (THO) says: A true healer is someone who has been through initiation, inducted by an expert in the field, who has undergone rigorous training and completed external healing courses. If a patient complains of headaches, they will be given plants with painkilling properties. But the healer will also try to establish the root cause of the headaches, and treat that too. This may mean the healer will provide counselling to the patient. Treatment is usually holistic, and a once-off ointment will generally not do the trick. Many clients come for help with their relationships or marriages. A potion may be given to open the communication channels between couples, so that they can speak about their problems. Counselling will also be on offer, but there is no quick-fix solution. Pretorius, Engela (1999). Crisp, Nicholas; Ntuli, Antoinette (eds.). . Durban: Health Systems Trust. pp. 249–257.  .

7c532043-b70c-42cc-9b28-5898d06fab2e,"Integrative medicine: Different techniques, one goal Discover how integrative medicine combines mainstream and alternative practices to improve health. More than 30% of Americans adults report using health care approaches not typically associated with conventional medicine, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Doctors are also embracing evidence-based alternative therapies, often combining them with mainstream therapies to treat disease and maintain health — an approach called integrative (in-tuh-GRAY-tiv) medicine. Exactly what's considered integrative medicine changes constantly as treatments are studied and move into everyday practice. To make sense of the many nonconventional therapies available, it helps to look at how they're classified by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH): Dietary supplements and herbal remedies are considered natural products because they contain ingredients found in nature. Examples of herbal remedies include ginseng, ginkgo and echinacea; examples of dietary supplements include glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin and SAMe. Herbal products and supplements come in many forms, such as teas, oils, syrups, powders, tablets and capsules. Mind-body techniques strengthen how your mind and your body work together. Practitioners believe these must be in harmony for you to stay healthy. Examples of mind-body techniques include meditation, prayer, relaxation, yoga, music and animal-assisted therapy. Manipulation and body-based practices use human touch to move or manipulate a specific part of your body. They include chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation and massage. Some traditions believe an invisible energy force flows through your body, and when this energy flow is blocked or out of balance, you can become sick. This energy has different names, such as chi, prana and life force. The goal of these therapies is to unblock or re-balance your energy force. Energy therapies include acupuncture, qi gong, healing touch and reiki. Other approaches to integrative health focus on a system, rather than just a single practice or remedy. These systems center on a philosophy, such as the power of nature or the presence of energy in your body. Examples include: These healing systems existed before conventional Western medicine. They include ayurveda from India and traditional Chinese medicine. This approach focuses on noninvasive treatments to help your body do its own healing. It uses several practices, such as massage, acupuncture, herbal remedies, exercise and lifestyle counseling. Research on integrative approaches continues to grow as the use of these treatments becomes more common. Researchers are looking to identify safe, effective therapies as well as those that offer no benefit and may even cause harm. In general, there has been a lack of research because large, carefully controlled medical studies are costly. Trials for conventional therapies are often funded by big companies that develop and sell drugs. Fewer resources are available to support trials of integrative approaches. That's why was established — to foster research into therapies typically not associated with conventional medicine and make the findings available to the public. Work with your conventional medical doctor to make informed decisions about integrative medicine. Even if your doctor can't recommend a specific practitioner, he or she can help you understand possible risks and benefits before you try a treatment. It's especially important to consult your doctor if you are pregnant, have medical problems or take prescription medicine. And don't stop or change your conventional treatment — such as the dose of your prescription medications — without talking to your doctor first.

d41dc386-111e-41a2-9ff8-e5bbe249a803,"Integrative medicine: Different techniques, one goal Discover how integrative medicine combines mainstream and alternative practices to improve health. More than 30% of Americans adults report using health care approaches not typically associated with conventional medicine, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Doctors are also embracing evidence-based alternative therapies, often combining them with mainstream therapies to treat disease and maintain health — an approach called integrative (in-tuh-GRAY-tiv) medicine. Exactly what's considered integrative medicine changes constantly as treatments are studied and move into everyday practice. To make sense of the many nonconventional therapies available, it helps to look at how they're classified by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH): Dietary supplements and herbal remedies are considered natural products because they contain ingredients found in nature. Examples of herbal remedies include ginseng, ginkgo and echinacea; examples of dietary supplements include glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin and SAMe. Herbal products and supplements come in many forms, such as teas, oils, syrups, powders, tablets and capsules. Mind-body techniques strengthen how your mind and your body work together. Practitioners believe these must be in harmony for you to stay healthy. Examples of mind-body techniques include meditation, prayer, relaxation, yoga, music and animal-assisted therapy. Manipulation and body-based practices use human touch to move or manipulate a specific part of your body. They include chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation and massage. Some traditions believe an invisible energy force flows through your body, and when this energy flow is blocked or out of balance, you can become sick. This energy has different names, such as chi, prana and life force. The goal of these therapies is to unblock or re-balance your energy force. Energy therapies include acupuncture, qi gong, healing touch and reiki. Other approaches to integrative health focus on a system, rather than just a single practice or remedy. These systems center on a philosophy, such as the power of nature or the presence of energy in your body. Examples include: These healing systems existed before conventional Western medicine. They include ayurveda from India and traditional Chinese medicine. This approach focuses on noninvasive treatments to help your body do its own healing. It uses several practices, such as massage, acupuncture, herbal remedies, exercise and lifestyle counseling. Research on integrative approaches continues to grow as the use of these treatments becomes more common. Researchers are looking to identify safe, effective therapies as well as those that offer no benefit and may even cause harm. In general, there has been a lack of research because large, carefully controlled medical studies are costly. Trials for conventional therapies are often funded by big companies that develop and sell drugs. Fewer resources are available to support trials of integrative approaches. That's why was established — to foster research into therapies typically not associated with conventional medicine and make the findings available to the public. Work with your conventional medical doctor to make informed decisions about integrative medicine. Even if your doctor can't recommend a specific practitioner, he or she can help you understand possible risks and benefits before you try a treatment. It's especially important to consult your doctor if you are pregnant, have medical problems or take prescription medicine. And don't stop or change your conventional treatment — such as the dose of your prescription medications — without talking to your doctor first.

e92cea36-6151-46c3-b59e-e5853558555c,"https://www.thebody.com/article/meditation-health-purposes U.S. National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Meditation for health purposes is a mind-body practice in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). There are many types of meditation, most of which originated in ancient religious and spiritual traditions. Generally, a person who is meditating uses certain techniques, such as focusing attention (for example, on a word, an object, or the breath); a specific posture; and an open attitude toward distracting thoughts and emotions. Meditation can be practiced for various reasons -- for example, with an intent to increase physical relaxation, mental calmness, and psychological balance; to cope with one or more diseases and conditions; and for overall wellness. This Backgrounder provides a general introduction to meditation and suggests some resources for finding out more. CAM is a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine. Complementary medicine is used conventional medicine, and alternative medicine is used conventional medicine. Conventional medicine is medicine as practiced by holders of M.D. (medical doctor) or D.O. (doctor of osteopathy) degrees and by their allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, psychologists, and registered nurses. Some health care providers practice both CAM and conventional medicine. People practice meditation for a number of health-related purposes. Resources for published research results on meditation are listed at the end of this Backgrounder. It is not fully known what changes occur in the body during meditation; whether they influence health; and, if so, how. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) and some other components of the National Institutes of Health are sponsoring studies to find out more about meditation's effects, how it works, and what diseases and conditions it may be most helpful for. Tell your health care providers about any complementary and alternative practices you use. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health. This will help ensure coordinated and safe care. The term refers to a group of techniques, most of which started in Eastern religious or spiritual traditions. These techniques have been used by many different cultures throughout the world for thousands of years. Today, many people use meditation outside of its traditional religious or cultural settings, for health and wellness purposes. In meditation, a person learns to focus his attention and suspend the stream of thoughts that normally occupy the mind. This practice is believed to result in a state of greater physical relaxation, mental calmness, and psychological balance. Practicing meditation can change how a person relates to the flow of emotions and thoughts in the mind. Most types of meditation have four elements in common: Many meditators prefer a quiet place with as few distractions as possible. This can be particularly helpful for beginners. People who have been practicing meditation for a longer period of time sometimes develop the ability to meditate in public places, like waiting rooms or buses. Depending on the type being practiced, meditation can be done while sitting, lying down, standing, walking, or in other positions. Focusing one's attention is usually a part of meditation. For example, the meditator may focus on a mantra (a specially chosen word or set of words), an object, or the breath. Having an open attitude during meditation means letting distractions come and go naturally without stopping to think about them. When distracting or wandering thoughts occur, they are not suppressed; instead, the meditator gently brings attention back to the focus. In some types of meditation, the meditator learns to observe the rising and falling of thoughts and emotions as they spontaneously occur. Meditation is practiced both on its own and as a component of some other therapies, such as yoga, tai chi, and qi gong. This Backgrounder focuses on meditation practiced on its own. Meditation used as CAM is a type of mind-body medicine (one of the four domains, or areas of knowledge, in CAM). Generally, mind-body medicine focuses on: The interactions among the brain, the rest of the body, the mind, and behavior The ways in which emotional, mental, social, spiritual, and behavioral factors can directly affect health People use meditation for various health problems, such as: Physical or emotional symptoms that may be associated with chronic illnesses and their treatment, such as: A large national survey on Americans' use of CAM, released in 2004, found that nearly 8 percent of the participants had used meditation specifically for health reasons during the year before the survey. Mindfulness meditation and the Transcendental Meditation technique (also known as TM) are two common approaches to meditation. They are also two types of meditation being studied in NCCAM-sponsored research projects. Mindfulness meditation originated in Buddhism. It is based on the concept of being mindful, or having an increased awareness and total acceptance of the present. While meditating, the meditator is taught to bring all her attention to the sensation of the flow of the breath in and out of the body. The intent might be described as focusing attention on what is being experienced, without reacting to or judging that experience. This is seen as helping the meditator learn to experience thoughts and emotions in normal daily life with greater balance and acceptance. TM originated in the Vedic tradition in India. It is a type of meditation that uses a mantra (a word, sound, or phrase repeated silently) to prevent distracting thoughts from entering the mind. The intent of TM might be described as allowing the mind to settle into a quieter state and the body into a state of deep rest. This is seen as ultimately leading to a state of relaxed alertness. Practicing meditation has been shown to induce some changes in the body, such as changes in the body's ""fight or flight"" response. The system responsible for this response is the autonomic nervous system (sometimes called the involuntary nervous system). It regulates many organs and muscles, including functions such as the heartbeat, sweating, breathing, and digestion, and does so automatically. The autonomic nervous system is divided into two major parts: The helps mobilize the body for action. When a person is under stress, it produces the fight-or-flight response: the heart rate and breathing rate go up, for example, the blood vessels narrow (restricting the flow of blood), and muscles tighten. The creates what some call the ""rest and digest"" response. This system's responses oppose those of the sympathetic nervous system. For example, it causes the heart rate and breathing rate to slow down, the blood vessels to dilate (improving blood flow), and activity to increase in many parts of the digestive tract. While scientists are studying whether meditation may afford meaningful health benefits, they are also looking at how it may do so. One way some types of meditation might work is by reducing activity in the sympathetic nervous system and increasing activity in the parasympathetic nervous system. Scientific research is using sophisticated tools to learn more about what goes on in the brain and the rest of the body during meditation, and diseases or conditions for which meditation might be useful. There is still much to learn in these areas. One avenue of research is looking at whether meditation is associated with significant changes in brain function. A number of researchers believe that these changes account for many of meditation's effects. Meditation is generally safe. There have been a small number of reports that intensive meditation could cause or worsen symptoms in people who have certain psychiatric problems, but this question has not been fully researched. Individuals who are aware of an underlying psychiatric disorder and want to start meditation should speak with a mental health professional before doing so. Any person who is interested in using meditation as CAM should consider the following: Meditation should never delay the time it takes you to see your health care provider about having a medical problem diagnosed or treated, and it should not be used as the only treatment without first consulting your provider. Tell your health care providers about any complementary and alternative practices you use. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health. This will help ensure coordinated and safe care. If you are interested in learning meditation, ask about the training and experience of the instructor. Find out whether there have been any research studies published on meditation for the health condition you are interested in. Some recent studies supported by NCCAM have been investigating: The potential effectiveness of the Transcendental Meditation technique to prevent and treat heart disease Mindfulness-based stress reduction to relieve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and, in a different study, chronic lower back pain What happens to the brain's activity and structures during Buddhist insight meditation (which includes mindfulness) in a study that uses a brain scan called fMRI The long-term impact of meditation on basic emotional and cognitive functions and on mechanisms in the brain that are involved in these functions Sources are drawn from recent reviews on the general topic of meditation in the peer-reviewed medical and scientific literature in English in the PubMed database, selected evidence-based databases, and Federal sources.

809f8992-6fe3-498b-9bac-2a1610bd10b2,"Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM): Treatment Options for Breast Cancer — — If you have breast cancer, you may want to explore different treatment methods to supplement traditional medicine. Options include acupuncture, detoxification diets, traditional Chinese medicine, and antioxidants, among other alternatives. These are known as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Many people use CAM treatments to help ease side effects, relieve pain, and improve their quality of life. Although some CAM treatments are effective, not all are safe. It’s important to keep in mind these are complementary remedies and shouldn’t be used in place of your doctor-approved treatment plan. A healthy diet is an important part of cancer treatment. You should eat well whether you’re using traditional methods or CAM. However, some people with breast cancer may start on a special diet in place of taking anticancer drugs. You should also double up on fruits, vegetables, and plant-based foods. Before switching up your diet, talk with your doctor. They can work with you to come up with a nutrition plan that can help you build strength and maintain your body’s natural defenses. Antioxidants lower your risk of cancer by helping protect your body from damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are molecules that can harm cells. Certain grains, fruits, and vegetables are rich with dietary antioxidants, including: These antioxidants may be found in the following foods: They’re also available through dietary supplements. However, research is mixed on whether antioxidant supplements are safe to use during cancer treatment. This can result in a number of unexpected complications. People with breast cancer should use them with caution. If you want to try antioxidant supplements, be sure to talk with your doctor first. They can explain your individual risks and benefits. Mind-body practices are meant to improve your mind’s positive impact on the rest of your body. Each therapy targets your mind, body, and soul using meditative techniques and creative activities that help enhance your quality of life. Some remedies, such as art therapy and music therapy, are most effective when working with a licensed practitioner. Research has proven that these types of mind, body, and soul therapies are effective at relieving stress, anxiety, and pain, but they shouldn’t be used in place of a doctor-recommended treatment plan. Massage therapy is known to boost immunity and ease anxiety, pain, and fatigue. One found that in women who had breast cancer, massage therapy helped reduce not only anxiety and pain, but also the need for pain medication. Another released around that time found that massage therapy and progressive muscle relaxation helped increase protective white blood cells in women with stage 1 and stage 2 breast cancer. If you’d like to incorporate massage therapy into your routine, make sure you work with a licensed practitioner who’s trained to avoid or work around sensitive areas affected by traditional treatment. Acupuncture is a central part of traditional Chinese medicine that may help relieve symptoms of breast cancer and side effects of treatment. Acupuncture requires a practitioner to place sterile, hair-thin needles into acupuncture points — specific points on your skin — then gently move them to stimulate your nervous system. lymphedema, which is swelling caused by excess fluid, in your arm Sometimes practitioners incorporate herbal supplements into acupuncture treatment. People undergoing chemotherapy shouldn’t use herbal supplements because they’re known to reduce the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Be sure to talk with your practitioner about your needs and what techniques they may use for you. Biofeedback training is used to treat the side effects of chemotherapy. During biofeedback, you’re hooked up to electrical sensors that monitor subtle changes in your body. This method may help you gain conscious power over your body so that you can control actions that are normally autonomic, or involuntary. These functions include: Your doctor will determine which type of biofeedback technique is best to treat your symptoms. According to the , Resperate is the only biofeedback device approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. So be careful of machines marketed for at-home use. Some may be fraudulent and can cause damage. What a traditional treatment plan for breast cancer consists of There are five standard types of care used to treat breast cancer: Surgery and radiation therapy are considered because they treat cancer cells without affecting the rest of your body. Local therapies are most effective in the earlier stages of breast cancer. Chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy are known as Systemic therapies use drugs to treat breast cancer. Those drugs enter your bloodstream by either oral use or injection and reach tumors that have spread throughout your body. Systemic therapies are more effective in advanced stages of breast cancer. Some breast cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, may cause side effects that last months or even years after therapy has ended. Some treatment plans may require multiple remedies at once, or one after the other. The stage and type of breast cancer will determine the type of treatment plan you’re on. Advanced stages of breast cancer typically require a combination of local and systemic therapies. Early on, localized or operable breast cancer may only require surgery. However, your doctor may want you on postoperative treatment to reduce the chances of tumors reappearing. Make sure you talk with your doctor before you begin any of these alternative treatments. Your doctor can tell you if complementary or alternative therapies will be effective for the stage of your breast cancer, and steer you away from fraudulent products. They can also tell you what research is available on different CAM treatments, what is and isn’t known about them, and whether they’re safe. Your doctor can also write you a referral or a recommendation for an appropriate CAM treatment. Once you have all the information, you can make a truly informed decision. CAM treatments shouldn’t be used in place of your doctor-recommended treatment plan. CAM treatments aren’t considered an effective alternative to first-line treatment for breast cancer. Although many major insurers cover CAM treatment, some may not. Because of this, there may be a large out-of-pocket cost. You should make sure to investigate the type of CAM treatments you’re interested in and whether they’re covered before committing your time, money, and energy. — — The Emotional Trauma Felt by Shannen Doherty and Others When Their Cancer Returns Genetic Testing for Metastatic Breast Cancer: Questions to Ask Your Doctor What Black Women Need to Know About Breast Cancer Now Here are the best cancer blogs to find support, gain information, learn about the newest research and treatments, and more.

bfa842e4-3c43-4730-af11-da1a98a95500,"Medically reviewed by Debra Rose Wilson, Ph.D., MSN, R.N., IBCLC, AHN-BC, CHT — “Allopathic medicine” is a term used for modern or mainstream medicine. Other names for allopathic medicine include: Allopathic medicine is also called allopathy. It’s a health system in which medical doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals are licensed to practice and treat symptoms and diseases. Other types or approaches to medicine are referred to as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), or integrative medicine. Alternative approaches by definition require stopping of all western medicine. Complementary and integrative medicine are commonly used along with mainstream medicine. These include: The term “allopathic” is most commonly used by CAM professionals to separate their type of medicine from mainstream medical practice. The word “allopathic” comes from the Greek allos” — meaning “opposite” — and “pathos” — meaning “to suffer.” This word was coined by German physician Samuel Hahnemann in the . It roughly refers to treating a symptom with its opposite, as is often done in mainstream medicine. For example, constipation might be treated with a laxative. Hahnemann was interested in other approaches based more on ancient principles of treating “like with like.” He later left mainstream medical practice and is considered to be the founder of homeopathy. Based on the historical definition of the term, some physicians argue that it was used to falsely label mainstream medical practices. Many in mainstream medicine consider the term derogatory. Allopathic medicine doctors and other healthcare professionals use a range of treatments to treat infection, illness, and disease. These include prescription drugs like: (penicillin, amoxicillin, vancomycin, augmentin) (diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ace inhibitors) (metformin, sitagliptin, DPP-4 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones) (ergotamines, triptins, antinausea drugs) Some types of prescription drugs replace hormones when the body can’t make enough or any of a certain type, such as: Allopathic medicine professionals may also recommend over-the-counter (OTC) medications like: pain relievers (acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen) Common allopathic medicine treatments also include: Allopathic medicine is quite different today than it was in the 1800s. Modern or mainstream medicine works to treat symptoms and illness. But it also helps to prevent illness and disease. In fact, allopathic doctors can specialize in preventative medicine. This branch of mainstream medicine is overseen by the . Prophylactic care is treatment to prevent an illness from happening. It’s used in a variety of mainstream medical fields. Preventative care in allopathic medicine includes: to prevent serious life-threatening illness in infants, children, and adults to prevent infection after a surgery, wound, or very deep cut blood pressure medications to help prevent serious complications like heart disease and stroke education programs to prevent development of health issues common to at-risk populations such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes Osteopathy is another type of healthcare. Osteopaths treat conditions with medical treatments as well as manipulation and massage of muscles, bones, and joints. In much of the world, osteopaths aren’t considered physicians. However, in the United States, are licensed physicians and surgeons. As with other physicians, osteopaths graduate from medical schools. Osteopathic doctors must pass the same national board exams that all physicians do. They also undergo the same residency training programs as other doctors. The main difference is that osteopathic doctors have the title DO instead of MD. You’ll likely not notice any difference in your treatment from a physician or surgeon who is a DO rather than an MD. A DO might recommend complementary treatments along with standard medications or procedures. Homeopathic medicine is also known as homeopathy and is often added to mainstream medicine, used as a complementary/integrative approach. “Homeo” means “similar to” or “like.” This type of healthcare is often considered to be the opposite of allopathic medicine. According to the , homeopathic medicine is based on two theories: This means that illness and disease are treated with substances that cause similar symptoms in healthy people. A lower dose of medication is thought to have a greater effect than a higher dose. Homeopathic practitioners aren’t licensed medical doctors. Most homeopathy medicines are natural substances that come from plants or minerals, like: Homeopathic treatments aren’t prescription medications. Additionally, homeopathy medicines usually aren’t regulated or tested like medications used in allopathic or mainstream medicine. Treatments and doses are different from person to person. There is some research emerging on the effectiveness of some remedies. Allopathic medicine or mainstream medicine is a system of healthcare. It has had the most evidence-based scientific research, data collection, and drug testing. It’s also the most regulated by a neutral party like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the American Medical Association. In comparison, homeopathy drugs haven’t had any or adequate amounts of research and testing. The correct dosages, effects, and side effects may not be known. Homeopathy drugs also aren’t regulated. Some may contain ingredients that have unknown or harmful effects. In other cases, homeopathic dosages are too diluted to have a medicinal effect. People with diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, and cancer require effective drugs and very accurate dosages of specific treatments. However, homeopathy, naturopathy, and other types of medicine have been used for generations in some cases. Some homeopathy drugs and supplements show promising results. The action of long-used herbs and tonics are getting some research to support their use. More testing, research, and regulation is needed. Allopathic or modern medical schools have recently added more study and information on how and nutrition can help prevent and treat disease. More education is being offered on integrative approaches and potential interactions with mainstream medicine. Other areas of study in allopathic medicine include exercise and reducing the use of and other medications that may have harmful effects. No healthcare system is perfect. Combining homeopathic and other alternative medicine with allopathic or mainstream medicine might work in treating people with some types of illnesses or ailments. Any kind of medical treatment should be tailored to the individual and treat the whole person, not symptoms alone.

It helps your body fight off infection. swelling of the lymph nodes, in the neck, armpit, or groin Common treatments for lymphoma include radiation and chemotherapy. However, many people are now considering complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). This refers to treatments or therapies that aren’t routinely included in conventional, Western medicine. Common CAM treatments include acupuncture, stress relief, and ginger. Complementary treatments won’t cure lymphoma, and you shouldn’t postpone conventional treatments to pursue CAM.

There’s no solid evidence that alternative therapies can treat lymphoma, but many people claim that it helps relieve symptoms. Always talk to your doctor before making any changes to your treatment plan.

This includes: dietary supplements other than vitamins and minerals Today, Americans are looking to CAM more and more. But some CAM options can interfere with traditional treatment. Before you start a CAM treatment, you should talk to your doctor. It’s also important to choose a CAM practitioner carefully. Consider asking for recommendations from your doctor or hospital. Several professional organizations certify CAM practitioners. It’s best to work with a certified or licensed professional, when possible. Certification implies that a practitioner has received specific training and has met certain acceptable standards for safe and competent practice. License requirements vary by state. CAM services that often are regulated include: CAM therapies shouldn’t be used solely to treat cancer, but they may be helpful in reducing symptoms. Several common CAM treatments are described below. Acupuncture is a type of traditional Chinese medicine that involves inserting small needles into points throughout your body. This is said to unblock energy, or qi, realigning energy pathways. Acupuncture may reduce vomiting caused by chemotherapy and may also reduce pain. A number of CAM techniques have been shown to reduce stress and pain associated with cancer treatment. They can also help balance your mind and body. Stress-relieving CAM therapies include: Ginger is a traditional treatment used for nausea. It has been used for pregnancy-associated nausea. It may also help relieve nausea associated with chemotherapy. Ginger may be taken in a variety of ways. Some people like eating candied ginger or chewing ginger gum. Others prefer taking the powered, dried rhizome in pill form. Ginger may also be consumed as a beverage. It’s possible that ginger might interfere with other cancer treatment. If you’re consuming ginger frequently, be sure to tell your doctor.

Increasing numbers of Americans are turning to CAM to help treat cancer and many other conditions. But remember: These treatments should be used in addition to traditional cancer treatments, not by themselves.

f12625de-b8a8-4da5-b553-d7c5048b6d49,"The Dangers of ‘Home Remedies’ for Serious Illnesses — Many people turn to home remedies to treat their cancer, colds, and autoimmune disorders, but some of these can cause more harm than good. In a world where you can fix almost anything with a do-it-yourself video on YouTube, you might think curing your own illness would be a piece of cake. It might be if it weren’t for a couple of (not so small) sticking points. One, the home remedy recommended by your friend — or one of the many websites promoting “natural therapies” — might not work. And two, it could make you sicker or even kill you. That’s exactly what happened to an Australian man who developed after taking high doses of apricot kernel extract, hoping to prevent his prostate cancer from returning. This “superfood” is touted as having anticancer properties. It’s a claim that has to back it up. Apricot kernel extract isn’t alone in peddling hope alongside an increased risk of harming your health. People use home remedies for a variety of reasons — fighting cancer, losing weight, increasing sex drive, or reducing symptoms of illnesses that have few medical treatments available. Most home remedies or natural therapies, though, haven’t been put through the same rigorous clinical testing you expect from pharmaceutical medications. So, does that mean you should ignore them completely? Not necessarily. It’s more a matter of approaching them with a healthy dose of skepticism. Dr. Harriet Hall, a retired family physician, former Air Force flight surgeon, and author of the column in Skeptic magazine, is one of those leading the charge against medical “treatments” not supported by science. Like others in the medical and scientific community, Hall is bothered that many questionable home remedies that might once have been called quackery, folk medicine, or fringe medicine now take shelter under the “alternative medicine” umbrella. “There is no such thing as ‘alternative medicine.’ There is only medicine that has been tested and proven to work, and medicine that hasn’t,” Hall told Healthline. “Alternative medicine is a marketing term, not a scientific one.” It’s common for people to think that “natural” means healthy. But many natural things can kill you — asbestos, ionizing radiation from radon, poison hemlock, and deadly nightshade, just to name a few. As surprising as it may seem, some herbal supplements sold in reputable natural food stores or pharmacies can also , even at doses recommended on the package. Supplements may be toxic all by themselves, contaminated with another compound that is toxic, or interact with prescription medications. Despite the risk of dangerous interactions between supplements and medications, only about one-third of people tell their doctor about the supplements they’re taking, according to one . Children are especially at risk of poisoning from herbal or dietary supplements. A published this summer found that calls made to poison control centers across the country about herbal and dietary supplements increased almost 50 percent between 2005 and 2012. Dietary supplements were the top reason for the calls, followed by herbal, hormonal, and other products. Serious medical problems occurred in about 4 percent of these calls. Ninety-five percent of the serious cases were in children under 6 years old. The majority of these poisonings were unintentional. One reason for the popularity of herbal supplements is that they’re easy to buy — no visit to the doctor or prescription needed. They’re the ultimate health DIY. There’s also little government regulation of these products. If companies don’t make claims that their product can treat or cure a health condition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) won’t bother with them. Last year, the FDA issued a that homeopathic baby teething tablets and gels may pose a risk to infants and children. Homeopathic remedies are based on the idea that “like cures like.” Small amounts of substances — sometimes toxic — are used to cure symptoms that those substances would cause at higher doses. The teething tablets contained the poisonous plant belladonna, except in higher amounts than listed on the label. The FDA investigation turned up more than 400 reports of bad reactions to these products over the past six years. Reactions included tremor, fever, and shortness of breath. On top of the dangers of some homeopathic remedies, there’s that they’re effective treatments for any condition. The recently decided to stop using government funds to pay for homeopathic treatments. The debate over homeopathy, though, isn’t just about a lack of clinical trials. One guiding principal of homeopathy is that the more you dilute the active ingredient in water or alcohol, the greater the therapeutic benefit. say that for this to work, we’d have to radically change what we know about biology, physics, and chemistry. “Homeopathy not only doesn’t work, but couldn’t possibly work,” said Hall. Cancer has long been targeted by people promoting natural therapies. One estimates that use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by cancer patients in 18 countries rose from 25 percent in the 1970s to 49 percent after 2000. Use of these products was highest in the United States. Another found that herbal supplements were the most commonly used home remedy for cancer, followed by homeopathy, vitamin and mineral supplements, medicinal teas, spiritual therapies, and relaxation techniques. One of the most popular therapies is Essiac tea, which has been promoted as a cancer treatment since the 1920s. This herbal blend contains burdock root, sheep sorrel herb, slippery elm bark, Turkish rhubarb root, and sometimes other ingredients. Despite its long reputation as an anticancer remedy, of Essiac have been completed and published in a peer-reviewed journal. Unlike apricot kernel extract, the side effects of Essiac are less severe, but they do include nausea, vomiting, increased bowel movements, and slight headaches. Another home remedy for cancer is the Gerson method. It involves following a strict diet, drinking lots of fresh fruit and vegetable juices, taking dietary supplements, and giving yourself coffee enemas. Although some on the Gerson method have been published, none were the rigorous randomized clinical trials that are needed to determine if this home remedy actually helps. Three people have also died as a result of giving themselves coffee enemas. They can throw off your normal blood chemistry if you do them too often. There are many more home remedies for treating cancer, with side effects ranging from minor to severe. But even natural therapies for cancer that don’t kill you directly can still kill you. In a published earlier this year, Yale researchers looked at the survival rates of 840 patients with breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer. People who chose to use only alternative medicine treatments had a higher risk of dying compared to those who used conventional cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or hormone therapy. There’s also the fact that people spend a lot of money on unproven treatments. According to the , 83 million adults spent almost $34 billion out-of-pocket on CAM therapies that year. This accounts for 1.5 percent of the total healthcare spending in the United States. One found that people are more likely to use herbal supplements if they’re uninsured, use more prescription and over-the-counter medications, or have certain health conditions. Other has found higher herbal supplement use among women and people with a higher education. Some of the most common conditions that people try to treat with herbs include colds, stomach or intestinal illnesses, and problems like rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis. These are all conditions that have few effective medical treatments available. A person’s may also influence their use of CAM therapies. For example, botanical medicine is important to many indigenous cultures in Mexico and the Southwestern United States. Chinese herbal medicine has been for centuries by Chinese people and Chinese-Americans. These studies try to explain why people turn to home remedies in the first place. But a bigger question is why people use home remedies that don’t have any scientific evidence showing that they’re effective. The Australian man who developed cyanide poisoning from taking apricot kernel extract — a mix of a supplement he purchased and a brew he made at home — apparently had a “scientific background,” according to an anesthetist at the hospital where he was treated. His doctors also warned the man about the risks of the extract, saying the cyanide was blocking the cells in his body from getting the oxygen they needed to survive. In a post on , Hall suggests that human evolution has made it easy for us to fall into the trap of thinking that an herb might cure our cancer, that burning a candle in our ear could improve our overall health, or that a homeopathic remedy diluted almost to nothingness might help us have better sex. First, our brains are designed to look for patterns, even if they’re wrong. In our distant past, we reacted quickly if we saw a shadow that looked like a lion in the bushes. It’s better to see a pattern that isn’t there than to miss seeing a real lion. We also tend to listen to what others tell us. If your friend says there are lions on the other side of the hill, often you’ll listen rather than do your own research. Our emotions — especially fear — can also motivate us to act, such as running away as fast as we can from a lion. While these traits helped us survive in a world without technology, they can get us into trouble today. If a friend has a cold, takes an herbal supplement, and gets better, we might think the pill cured her. But the cold could’ve just as likely gone away on its own. Without clinical studies, we’re just guessing. Or if you have a headache and your friend says, “I put three drops of lemon oil on my wrists and my headache went away,” you might give it a try. What the heck, right? Or if you have cancer and you’re afraid of dying, you might try anything to get better — even if it’s never been shown to be effective in a clinical trial, doesn’t make any sense how it might work in the first place, or you have to shell out thousands of dollars at a clinic in another country for treatment. Choosing treatments for your illness is complicated by that suggests many published studies — yes, scientific studies — are wrong. Science isn’t infallible. But it is methodical and self-correcting. Over time, new studies either confirm past results or weed out the mistakes. Not everyone has a strong background in science or clinical trials, so how are we supposed to decide which treatments work? “Before you accept any claim, try to find out who disagrees with it and why. That can be very illuminating,” she said. Also, you can always ask your doctor for advice. But even with that, Hall suggests some level of skepticism. People should “ask their doctor to provide evidence to support his or her recommendations,” said Hall, “and then they should check to see what others have said about that evidence.” — Alternative Medicine Finally Becoming More Mainstream Proponents say integrative and holistic treatments such as acupuncture and diet are finally being recognized and accepted by the traditional medical… Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM): Treatment Options for Breast Cancer Are you experiencing side effects from your breast cancer treatment?

457afb18-acd4-4e78-9af9-1bb3f35ab683,"Can You Use Ayurvedic Medicine to Successfully Treat IBS? — Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a series of symptoms that typically affect the digestive tract and intestines. Common symptoms include: While doctors generally can diagnose quickly, they can’t always find a treatment. That’s because it’s not entirely clear why IBS occurs. Western medicine uses a combination of prescription medications and lifestyle changes to address the . Other approaches include and holistic treatments like Ayurveda. Read on to learn how Ayurvedic medicine might help treat symptoms of IBS, along with potential side effects and benefits. Ayurvedic medicine is a centuries-old holistic approach to wellness that originated in northern India. It’s a form of treatment that encompasses the well-being of body, mind, and spirit. It encourages you to consider all three when managing health issues. In Ayurveda, the body balances different types of energies, or doshas. The three doshas are: Each of these doshas is responsible for a different part of your body. Vata, for example, controls bodily functions like eliminating waste and balancing electrolytes in the body. If the three doshas are not balanced for any reason, you may experience illness or disease. You need to maintain balance within your doshas to maintain good health. IBS is thought to occur when one of the doshas is unbalanced or when toxins are present. Ayurvedic medicine aims to restore balance. It does this through natural treatments so that the symptoms of IBS will be eliminated. It also aims to remove any toxins in the body. In Ayurveda, the Agni (or digestive fire) is responsible for converting food into energy and nutrition. When you eat something, the food is held in the duodenum until it’s completely digested by Agni. When digestion is complete, the food passes onto the next stage of digestion. If for some reason the food isn’t fully digested, you may become ill. This may signal that your Agni is weak. As a result of the incomplete digestion, your body may develop Ama, or toxins. The symptoms of IBS may be the result of a weak Agni and the resulting buildup of these toxins. That’s why the first step in Ayurvedic medicine is to treat the Ama. Then, you treat the doshas. With these treatments, you may see improving symptoms in a matter of days. But in some cases, it may take an extended period of time to treat the imbalance properly. Since wellness relies on the equilibrium of all three doshas, they must all be balanced before you can feel restored. Here are some Ayurvedic steps to help promote wellness: Initially, your Ayurvedic practitioner may suggest you eat a bland diet to help reset your digestive system. may include soft, warm foods like basmati rice and light soups. The practitioner may also suggest a . During this time, the goal is to let your body naturally eliminate the Ama while reducing irritations that may cause future symptoms. What’s more, you may try drinking . Popular in Ayurvedic medicine, buttermilk is thought to aid recovery and reduce symptoms. Additionally, your practitioner may suggest you consume medicated ghee, or concentrated butter. Research suggests practitioners believe ghee helps stimulate the weak Agni. Yoga, like Ayurvedic medicine, takes an all-body approach to wellness. The goal of yoga is to help increase strength and flexibility, but a supplementary goal is eliminating stress and reducing physical symptoms of ailments. Specific yoga positions or postures may be more helpful for eliminating the symptoms of IBS. These include and . Try meditation, massage, or aromatherapy to reduce stress It’s not clear what causes IBS, but research suggests stress may play a significant role in who develops IBS and when symptoms worsen. In Ayurveda, stress is the result of an imbalance in doshas. Anti-stress techniques, like , and , may help reduce stress. That, in turn, can eliminate or reduce symptoms of IBS. and supplements are an important part of Ayurvedic medicine. Precisely which tonics you use will depend on the imbalance or dosha you’re aiming to treat. A practitioner can help you select the right one. Can western medicine treatments for IBS be combined with Ayurvedic medicine for IBS?  is commonly prescribed to treat symptoms of IBS, but no medication can completely eliminate the condition. People with IBS typically take antidiarrheal, anticonstipation, and antispasmodic medications when symptoms occur. Ayurvedic medicine is considered a holistic approach to illness treatment and wellness. In contrast to prescription medication, it aims to eliminate symptoms before they occur. That’s why some practitioners are open to people practices with their Western medicine, and vice versa. A combination of treatment may be beneficial for people who are seeking alternatives and holistic approaches to treatment. What’s more, many elements of Ayurveda do not interfere with Western medicine treatments. Those that might, such as herbs and tinctures, should be run by your practitioner or pharmacist before you take them. This can help you spot possibly drug interactions before they become problematic. If you’d like to consider using both types of treatment, talk with your doctor or clinician. Together, you can find a treatment approach that works for you. What are the potential side effects or downsides of Ayurvedic medicine for IBS?  Ayurvedic medicine has been around for centuries. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean it’s well studied. In fact, very few clinical studies have examined this type of treatment and whether it works. What’s more, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies the tinctures and herbal remedies common in Ayurvedic medicine as supplements. That means they’re not tested or approved by the FDA. If you decide to try this type of medicine, it’s important that you tell all your healthcare providers. In the event you need to add or change treatments for any condition, they need to be aware to watch for and prevent possible interactions and negative side effects. Though Ayurveda has been around for centuries, it’s not considered a mainstream treatment for IBS. Many elements of this holistic approach to wellness and care can be applied easily, without much worry for side effects. However, that’s not always the case. You should talk with your healthcare provider and a trained Ayurvedic practitioner to find the right treatment options for you. — Diet plays an important role in managing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

eb53c77d-0e42-4bef-8003-9b48b79715a2,"Complementary and Alternative Medicine use in women during pregnancy: do their healthcare providers know? Complementary and Alternative Medicine use in women during pregnancy: do their healthcare providers know? , Article number:  () The National Institutes of Health reported in 2007 that approximately 38% of United States adults have used at least one type of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). There are no studies available that assess general CAM use in US pregnant women. The objectives of our study were to determine the prevalence and type of CAM use during pregnancy at one medical center; understand who is using CAM and why they are using it; and assess the state of patients’ CAM use disclosure to their obstetrical providers. A cross-sectional survey study of post-partum women was done to assess self-reported CAM use during pregnancy. Results of this survey were compared to results from a previous survey performed by this research team in 2006. Data were analyzed using binary logistic regression. In 2013, 153 women completed the survey, yielding a response rate of 74.3%. Seventy-two percent and 68.5% of participants reported CAM use during their pregnancies in 2006 and 2013 respectively. The percentage of participants who reported discussing CAM use with their obstetrical providers was less than 1% in 2006 and 50% in 2013. Increased use of different CAM therapies was associated with increased maternal age, primagravida, being US-born, and having a college education (p ≤ 0.05). However, these factors were poor predictors of CAM use. Given the frequency of CAM use and the difficulty in predicting who is using it, obstetrical providers should consider being informed about CAM and incorporating discussions about its use into routine patient assessments. In 2007, approximately 38 percent of United States adults (83 million people) used at least one type of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) []. In that year alone, they spent $33.9 billion out-of-pocket on CAM therapies []. However, little is known about CAM use in US pregnant women. This lack of knowledge poses a unique challenge to women and health care providers []. During their pregnancies, many women are concerned about the potentially harmful effects of conventional medicine on their babies [] but, because CAM is often thought of as natural and without risk [, ], women frequently are not aware of the possible negative effects of their CAM use []. Complementary and Alternative Medicine is described by the National Institutes of Health’s National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine as “the array of health care approaches with a history of use or origins outside of mainstream medicine” []. It encompasses a wide range of therapies that can be divided into five categories: Alternative Medicine practices (traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, homeopathy, etc.), Mind-body interventions (meditation, yoga, imagery, prayer, etc.), Biologic-based therapies (herbal medicine or teas, dietary supplements, probiotics, etc.), Manipulative and Body-based methods (osteopathic and chiropractic manipulation, massage therapy, etc.), and Energy Healing therapies (qigong, tai chi, Reiki, etc.). These therapies can be used either alongside conventional medicine (Complementary Medicine) or by themselves (Alternative Medicine). With such a wide array of therapies considered to be CAM, it is important to note that different types and categories of CAM have different risk profiles and can have a wide range of implications for the health of the mother and fetus. For example, no harmful effects have been linked to Mind-body CAM interventions, such as yoga, hypnotherapy, and imagery [], and it would be unlikely to encounter an adverse effect from prayer or energy healing when used in concert with conventional medicine. However, for Alternative Medicine practices, Biologic-based therapies, and Manipulative and Body-based methods, the risk versus benefit calculation is less straightforward. The use of Biologic-based therapies, such as raspberry tea leaf and some herbal and vitamin supplements, during pregnancy has been associated with adverse events, such as premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and neonatal hyponatremic seizures [], while the use of other supplements, such as prenatal vitamins, has been widely accepted by the field. Some evidence of the benefit of certain types of Alternative Medicine practices and Manipulative methods, such as accustimulation for pregnancy-induced nausea [] and osteopathic manipulation for back pain during the third trimester of pregnancy [], have also been established. In studies of CAM use from countries outside the US, 50-70% of pregnant women studied were found to use at least one type of CAM [, –]. A UK study found that despite these high levels of use, most obstetrical providers did not ask about CAM use during pregnancy, and one-third of mothers did not disclose their CAM use to their obstetrical providers []. A variety of predictors of maternal CAM use have been found, including higher education, ethnicity, and income in Germany [], parity, higher education, and CAM use before pregnancy in the UK [], and higher education and Caucasian origin in Switzerland []. The most common types of CAM used during pregnancy varied amongst the countries []. Our study’s objectives were 1) to learn about CAM use during pregnancy in a single U.S medical center; 2) to look for changes in CAM use between 2006 and 2013; 3) to analyze maternal factors associated with CAM use; and 4) to understand the state of CAM use disclosure between obstetrical provider and patient. We hypothesized that, in our population, CAM use would be high; it would be associated with higher education and income; and the quality of communication would be low between patient and provider. We also hypothesized that CAM use would increase from 2006 to 2013. A cross-sectional survey study was done at two time points. The first survey results were collected during a four month enrollment period in 2006; the second set of results was collected during a two month enrollment period in 2013. The sample population for the 2013 survey included women who had given birth to infants cared for on the Well Baby Newborn Unit (WBN) or in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Christiana Hospital, a tertiary care center on the East Coast. The 2006 survey was only given to women on the WBN. Both of the sample populations were convenience samples. Women with infants in the WBN were surveyed during their post-partum hospital stays, while women with infants in the NICU were surveyed during their infants’ hospital stays. Women less than 18 years of age, women of limited English proficiency, and post-partum women whose infants died within 24 hours of delivery were excluded from the study. Approval was attained from the Christiana Care Institutional Review Board. The survey was designed and validated by six physicians, nurses, and mothers. There was no previously validated survey available. The survey consisted of five tables with questions about 22 different kinds of CAM therapies. For each therapy, there were four questions, asking whether CAM had been used during this recent pregnancy, the frequency of its use, and the obstetrical provider’s knowledge of and response to its use. The survey also contained 11 Likert scale questions from “Strongly Disagree” (5) to “Strongly Agree” (1), which asked about reasons for and attitudes toward CAM use. Participants were asked about prior CAM use, the use of other substances during pregnancy, who recommended CAM use, and the perceived benefit or harm of CAM. Demographic information was also collected. There were 48 questions in total. After providing informed consent, participants were asked to complete the survey and place it in a sealed envelope, which was later collected. Survey responses were analyzed using SPSS (Version 20.0). We found differences in the breakdown of race and ethnicity between our sample population and the general population of women at Christiana Hospital. The data were weight-adjusted accordingly. Demographic information and CAM use data between the 2006 and 2013 groups, as well as between the 2013 NICU and WBN groups, were analyzed using Chi square test. With no significant differences in demographics and CAM use between the 2013 NICU and WBN groups, we combined them into one 2013 group for comparison with the 2006 group. Although the populations for the two time periods were different—the 2013 study looked at both NICU and WBN women and the 2006 study looked only at WBN women—and there were some demographic differences between the two groups, they were determined to be similar enough for comparison. For the 2013 group and a combination of both the 2006 and 2013 groups, we used Mann–Whitney, Chi Square, and Binary Logistic Regression to analyze CAM use by maternal factors including age, race/ethnicity, country of origin, previous pregnancy, use of a midwife, public insurance, employment outside of the home, marital status, any college education, and mode of delivery. We looked at these factors by dividing CAM use into three groups to see if different categories of CAM therapies had users with different characteristics. The three categories we used were CAM use, CAM use excluding prayer, and CAM use excluding prayer, special diet, and supplements. Prayer was separated from the rest of the CAM therapies because people could consider prayer to be more religious than medical. Prayer, supplements, and special diets were separated because they were the more “mainstream” CAM therapies in our study. Finally, we compared the frequency and type of CAM use, provider response to CAM use, and Likert scale responses between the 2006 and 2013 data. P values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant. In 2013, 206 women (142 WBN, 64 NICU) were approached for this study, and a total of 153 (102 WBN, 51 NICU) were enrolled and completed the survey for a response rate of 74.3% (71.8% WBN, 79.7% NICU). In 2006, 201 out of 292 post-partum women (all WBN) were enrolled and completed the survey for a response rate of 69%. Table  contains the demographic information for the 2006 and 2013 samples, as well as information on the NICU and WBN groups within the 2013 sample. Median gravity and parity, race/ethnicity, insurance type, and type of obstetrical provider were different between 2006 and 2013 participants (p < 0.05). There were no significant statistical differences between 2013 NICU and WBN participants. CAM use was analyzed by year and by unit (NICU and WBN). In both 2006 and 2013, almost two-thirds of all participants used at least one type of CAM. Figure  demonstrates the percent of participants who used CAM in 2006 and 2013 according to the different categories of CAM therapies. The top nine most common CAM therapies used in both 2006 and 2013 were prayer, supplements, massage therapy, meditation, yoga, teas, music therapy, chiropractor, and special diet. Figure  separates the types of CAM therapies used by the 2013 NICU and WBN participants. Homeopathy/naturopathy (p = 0.032), spiritual healing (p = 0.011), and prayer (p = 0.05) were all more likely to be used in the NICU than in the WBN participants (Figure ). Supplements (p = 0.087) approached statistical significance with more use in the WBN than in NICU. Participants were also asked how frequently they used medications and substances other than CAM (Table ). Prescription medications were used less in 2013 than in 2006 (p < 0.05). Table  shows maternal factors associated with different categories of CAM use for 2013 alone, as well as for 2006 and 2013 together. In multivariate analysis of the combined 2006 and 2013 data, any college education and a vaginal delivery were associated with higher rates of CAM use. The overall predictability of the model remained low, limiting its clinical usefulness. Table  displays the Likert scale results of the participants’ responses to statements regarding CAM in both 2006 and 2013. During both time periods, the majority of CAM users was happy with traditional medical care, had used CAM prior to pregnancy, and used CAM to improve their pregnancy health and experience and/or to benefit their baby. The only response that differed between the two years was the percent of participants who used CAM during pregnancy because of unhappiness with conventional medicine (1% in 2006 and 10.3% in 2013, p <0.05). Most participants (80.3%) did not consider the CAM they used to be part of their culture. In non-Likert scale questions that asked about benefit and harm, 96.1% of participants thought that at least some of the CAM they used was beneficial, and only 1.3% of participants thought that any of the CAM they used was harmful. One person reported chiropractic manipulation as harmful, and one person reported massage as harmful. In 2013, participants reported that their obstetrical providers knew about their CAM use 60.8% of the time. The percent of participants who disclosed their non-dietary CAM use to providers increased from 1% in 2006 to 50% in 2013 (p < 0.05) (Figure ). Table  contains information about the participants’ level of comfort with talking to their obstetrical providers about CAM use in both 2006 and 2013. Only 1.6% of participants perceived their providers’ responses to CAM use disclosure as negative. There was no difference in perceived provider response between the NICU and WBN participants (negative responses: p = 0.164, positive responses: p = 0.362, neutral responses: p = 0.691). Participants reported that their obstetrical providers knew about supplement use most frequently (94.4%) and prayer use least frequently (28.4%) (Figure ). Family and friends made up 74.7% of CAM recommenders while Obstetrical Providers made up 15.5% of CAM recommenders. In a single tertiary care center on the East Coast of the United States, Complementary and Alternative Medicine is used commonly by women during their pregnancies, with 68.5% of women surveyed in 2013 reporting that they used at least one type of CAM. This prevalence closely matches those reported in the UK (57.1%), Switzerland (69%), Australia (50%), and Germany (50.7%) [, –]. In spite of similarities in prevalence of CAM use, the types of therapies used by women in each country vary greatly []. In 2013, the top five most common types of CAM therapies used in our population were prayer; supplements; yoga, meditation, and imagery; massage; and music, art, and dance therapy. These are similar to the top four CAM therapies used in the UK (vitamins, massage, yoga, and relaxation) [], but fairly different from the top three CAM therapies reported in Germany (homeopathy, acupuncture, and massage) []. Just as overall rates of CAM use in our population stayed around two-thirds between 2006 and 2013, the therapies participants used also remained very similar. Three of the top five CAM therapies used in both years were Mind-body interventions with low potential for adverse effects. We also found minimal differences in the frequency and type of CAM used between NICU and WBN participants. One significant difference was the higher use of spiritual healing, prayer, and homeopathy/naturopathy in NICU participants. There is evidence to suggest that people experiencing certain health problems are more likely to use CAM []. This could also hold true for women when it becomes apparent during pregnancy that their infant may have to spend time in the NICU. Unfortunately we were not able to separate the NICU participants who knew about complications beforehand from the participants whose infants had an unexpected NICU admission. CAM use in pregnant women is associated with primiparous older women of higher education and income who have physical health problems and previous complementary medicine use []. When we analyzed these variables, as well as other factors, we found multiple statistically significant relationships. However, it is important to note that these statistically significant factors are not good enough predictors of CAM use to be useful clinically. This inability to accurately predict CAM use by these demographic variables emphasizes that “consumers of complementary and alternative products or services are far from a homogeneous group with similar beliefs, motivations, and needs” []. Because the group of women who use CAM is so diverse, communication about CAM becomes all the more important. Obstetrical providers cannot rely on demographic information to accurately predict who is using CAM; instead, they must specifically ask their patients about it if they want reliable information. Although it is difficult to predict which patients are using CAM therapies, common trends help explain why CAM is used. In our study population, most participants who used CAM made that decision because they “felt it would improve their health and experience” or because they “felt it would be beneficial to their baby.” This evidence supports the concept of a “risk society [],” in which growing CAM use could be a sign of “a desire for personal fulfillment and need for autonomy and active participation in healthcare during pregnancy and childbirth” []. CAM could provide women with an opportunity, often thought of as risk free, to have a positive effect on both themselves and their infants. However, the desire to use CAM is not just limited to pregnancy. The majority of participants said they used CAM during their pregnancies because they had used it previously. Finally, a relatively small number of participants, 1% in 2006 and 10% in 2013, stated they used CAM because they were unhappy with conventional medicine. This shows providers that CAM use should not be seen as an expression of dissatisfaction, but rather may be something that patients value along with conventional medicine []. Even so, because there was a rise in dissatisfaction between the two time periods, investigating explanations for this increase would be a good area for future research. In the 2013 study, we found that the obstetrical provider knew about CAM use 60.8% of the time. This is similar to the rates found in the UK []. It is also comparable to the 20-77% of US cancer patients who disclosed their CAM use to doctors [], and to the two-thirds of US Hispanic women who disclosed information about supplement use to their physicians []. Our study shows that there has been a substantial increase in the reporting of CAM use to obstetrical providers between 2006 and 2013, despite a lack of reported change in the participants’ comfort asking or providing information about CAM. This increase in provider knowledge between the two time periods could be the result of providers becoming more aware of how common CAM use is. Seven years ago, providers may not have directly asked questions about CAM use; and without the provider asking about it specifically, the patient may have never thought to disclose it. Nevertheless, even with this remarkable improvement in CAM use disclosure over the seven year time gap, it is important to recognize that half of the participants’ CAM use still is not known by their providers. There were significant variations in the likelihood that participants would share their CAM use with providers. Supplements, the second most commonly used CAM therapy, were most likely to be disclosed, while prayer, the most common CAM therapy, was one of the least likely to be shared. This may reflect the perception that supplements are well-received by the medical field, which may make patients more comfortable and willing to share the information with their providers. This trend is a positive finding since some supplements have been associated with adverse effects []. Conversely, prayer, which has not been associated with negative health effects, is often associated with a person’s religious beliefs and may not be perceived as something that needs to be discussed with providers. Nonetheless, having knowledge about the practices and beliefs of the mother and family is still valuable, especially in the event of complications for the mother or infant. When a conversation about CAM use does take place, participants perceived their obstetrical providers’ responses as largely positive. The two reported perceived negative responses were toward osteopathic manipulation and qigong, tai chi, and reiki. Since we did not ask the corresponding obstetricians about their attitudes toward CAM, it is impossible to assess whether this accurately reflects the provider’s actual attitude. In Australian and Israeli studies where obstetricians were asked directly about their attitudes toward CAM use, they too found favorable responses from providers [, ]. As was discussed previously, different types of CAM therapies have a wide range of risk profiles. Assuming that the CAM used was not harmful to the mother or fetus, the provider’s positive or neutral responses to CAM use can be viewed as beneficial to the provider-patient relationship. They may increase the patient’s willingness to share other information and put the patient more at ease with the provider. Although obstetrical providers were largely receptive to disclosures of CAM use, they only recommended CAM therapies 15% of the time, while family and friends recommended them almost three-quarters of the time. This dynamic was echoed in studies which found that many people relied on advice from non-healthcare providers, such as friends and relatives, when deciding to use CAM [, ]. In our patient population, we also looked at whether CAM therapies were more likely to be recommended to patients who had a midwife on their obstetrical team, but the relationship was not statistically significant. Although the participants perceived little trouble with the safety of the CAM they used, this confidence in CAM safety may be misguided. No harmful effects have been linked to mind-body CAM interventions, such as yoga, hypnotherapy, and imagery []. However, the effects of herbal preparations during pregnancy have not been well measured and have been linked to adverse events []. In our population, we found that supplement use was more common in the WBN than in the NICU. It is possible the use of this type of CAM does not lead to an increased likelihood that the infant will need admission to the NICU. However, our study was not powered to look at that difference. Since the exact risks associated with CAM use are often unknown, especially in the cases of some Alternative Medicine practices, Biologic-based therapies, and Manipulative and Body-based methods, it is prudent for women to use CAM only if the “benefit is clearly greater than the potential fetal risk” []. Weighing benefit with fetal risk may not just be useful when making decisions about CAM use, but also for making decisions about the safety of other medications with little safety data during pregnancy []. With around 80% of participants using OTC medication and over half using prescription medication, it is important that the safety and efficacy of these medications is established and that pregnant women are educated about possible risks. Some limitations to this study include the cross-sectional design, exclusion criteria, sample population, small sample size, and demographic differences between the 2006 and 2013 populations. We excluded post-partum women whose infants died within 24 hours of delivery, women with limited English proficiency (LEP), and women under the age of 18. This may have altered our results, especially in the case of women with LEP, who may have had high levels of cultural CAM use. Because this was a single, large Mid-Atlantic center, these findings may only be generalizable to areas of the United States with demographics similar to this region. Finally, using a larger sample size could have allowed more detailed analysis of relationships between CAM use in the NICU and WBN and between people using specific types of CAM therapies. Future research could address these limitations by doing a multicenter evaluation with better matched groups and analyzing the data using sub-group stratification by different maternal attitudes and demographic characteristics. Future studies should also be done to investigate the safety and efficacy of CAM during pregnancy, the effects of communication about CAM on the provider-patient relationship, the possible relationship between pregnancy complications and when CAM use is initiated, and the increase in dissatisfaction with conventional medicine found between 2006 and 2013. Complementary and Alternative Medicine is commonly used by pregnant women in a large Mid-Atlantic center. Its use is not an indictment of conventional medicine; instead, it is often an expression of a woman’s desire to be an active participant in her health. Obstetrical providers are having more discussions about CAM use in 2013 than they were in 2006, but they still do not know about 50% of their patients’ CAM use. There is a need for increased awareness of CAM use in respect to its frequency, the types of therapies used, and its benefits and risks. Because there is no effective way to use demographics to pinpoint which patients use CAM, providers instead should consider integrating questions about CAM use into their routine patient assessments.

In a recent research study of readers we found that over 80 per cent were taking a complementary therapy as part of their Integrated Recovery Programme and 40 per cent were using 4 or more such therapies. But the fact is there is a bewildering array to choose from - the list from the research totalled 26 different therapies! Which ones are right for your personal needs - for you and your cancer at this particular time? Are they all safe, or could they do more harm than good? Are there any research studies, or Clinical Trials, or is it all in the mind? And even if it is, is that such a bad thing? In our magazine and on this web site, we have covered a number of these therapies in some depth, but we realised after conducting our research that our readers needed the definitive overview - a ’Kiddies Guide’!. We have been working with the London   (there’s one in Hereford and a new one in Leeds too) for several years now on this subject, and so it seemed only natural to start with their thoughts and then add our extra research knowledge on top.Obviously their focus is on women (and men) with breast cance but you will see this is an excellent overview - and contains more therapies than even they offer! As you may know, CANCERactive is the UK’s leading Charity in Integrative Therapies. We believe in helping people chose the best of Complementary and Alternative Therapies around their orthodox treatments. Such programmes are thought by US experts to increase survival by 60 per cent. We have developed our own programme. If you go to you will see our approach to building (tailoring) a programme to your personal needs. From time to time we also offer everybody a Personal Prescription service designed to provide all patients with information tailored to their particular cancer and the complementary therapies, supplements, diet and other lifestyle benefits they might best introduce into their personal treatment programme. Several research studies in the USA have shown that those people taking a complementary therapy, for example daily exercise, have 50 per cent lower mortality rates.

The person’s condition is diagnosed by analysing their symptoms, life-style and emotional state, as well as by using tongue and pulse diagnosis. Once this has been understood, specific points located on the energy channels of the body (called meridians) are chosen into which fine needles are carefully inserted to help restore balance to the body. Acupuncture can help to relieve possible side effects of orthodox cancer treatments such as nausea, hot flushes, fatigue or discomfort following surgery. Acupuncture helps balance the body, increases energy levels, relieves pain (1,2), nausea (3) and gives an enhanced sense of well-being. A course of treatment: 4 - 6 treatments is often given to help alleviate symptoms and rebalance the body. Precautions: Acupuncture needles should not be inserted where lymphoedema is present. Sterile disposable needles are used to prevent infection. Side effects: Sometimes recipients may feel tired following treatment and need to rest. ( There have been a number of scientific studies on acupuncture, notably in the USA including work at NASA. It is known to affect the brain, hormone levels, and nervous system and can control pain and energy flow. It can be used instead of anaesthetic in operations. As a result of the evidence produced, this therapy which is widely used in parts of South East Asia has been incorporated into normal medical practice in the USA, and now the UK. Two clinical trials, one from Harvard and MIT on how it works in pain relief, and another on reducing side-effects for chemotherapy better than the drugs on offer, can be found in Cancer Watch Febrary 2009 in .) Aromatherapy uses essential oils from plants to help with a variety of symptoms and side effects resulting from cancer and its treatments. Generally applied via gentle massage or inhalation, aromatherapy, in the clinical setting, has also been used to help with wound healing and to relieve anxiety, depression, pain, nausea (26) and insomnia. Whilst essential oils are available over the counter, it is recommended that someone affected by cancer should take professional advice regarding oils that are safe to use and that will not show any possible interactions with treatment. ( Oils used in their concentrated form may be very potent. For centuries certain herbs and natural compounds have been known to have a variety of clear proven beneficial effects) The term ’Flower Remedy’ refers to the products developed by Dr Edward Bach, a London bacteriologist and homoeopath. Dr Bach became disillusioned with the side effects of drug therapies and turned his research to the healing power of nature. Dr Bach believed that harmful emotions contributed to the development of diseases. He believed that illness was a result of mental or emotional balance and that the unique energetic property of a plant could be used to rectify an imbalance and restore the awareness of ’wholeness’. Referring to the vibrational medicine model provided in homoeopathy, he reasoned that the healing effects of plants might also be contained in the morning dew found on their flowers. In this system, each negative emotion can be helped by a particular flower remedy. The best known remedy is called Rescue Remedy, it is made up of five flowers and can be used in emergency situations or for shock and trauma. Whilst these remedies can be bought over the counter and taken safely, therapists trained in this area can offer a more appropriate prescription.  provides an opportunity to work with the psychological and emotional issues which may arise as a result of experiencing cancer. Our counsellors work with a wide range of issues that affect women and sometimes men with breast cancer and those who support them. Counselling can help people to understand more about the impact and meaning of diagnosis, treatment and also support recovery. It may help with the adjustment to shock, illness, treatment and the impact on body. Issues such as those relating to body image, sexual matters, relationships and other life events which have come to the fore through the impact of illness may also be helped by counselling. Counselling is offered to partners and other family members. Haven counsellors may employ a range of techniques including participative sessions and tools for people to try out at home. There has been a lot of research looking into support for people affected by breast cancer. Research shows that people who feel better emotionally and mentally cope better with breast cancer and its treatments (4). ( One issue that comes up time and time again at is the need for people to talk ’with’ someone rather than ’at’ or ’to’ someone about their problems and feelings. Having a discussion with an independent person, especially a qualified professional, can be so helpful)  is a subtle and profound healing form. It is thought that movement restrictions at the cranial sutures of the skull may negatively affect rhythmic impulses conveyed through the cerebrospinal fluid which surrounds the central nervous system from the cranium to the sacrum. A disturbance of the rhythmic flow of cerebrospinal fluid is believed to adversely affect health. Through light touch, normal function can be restored within the system. This helps increase physical vitality and well being, not only releasing physical tension and disharmony, but also helping to bring psycho-emotional balance and to relieve stress. It can be very relaxing and at the deepest level, truly transformative. Craniosacral has no contraindications for those affected by primary breast cancer. There has been research performed into this therapy (5). If you think that you would like the opportunity to discuss ways that you can personally develop a healthier lifestyle following the experience of breast cancer, then an appointment can be made to discuss this with one of our Senior Therapists, Counsellors or Life-Work Coach. It may be that you want support in making changes to jobs, relationships, the community or place in which you live or support in developing a regular exercise or meditation routine.  involves a transfer of energy between the healer and the recipient to promote self-healing. This is done by ""focused intent"" and holding the hands, at varying distances, electro-magnetic pollution. Through muscle testing, which gathers information directly from the recipient’s conscious and unconscious mind, the practitioner seeks to identify the stress whether on a physical, mental or emotional level. The body is then balanced using techniques that include healing offered with hands on or off the body and the healer may offer suggestions to help the recipient work with issues that arise in the session (6). Herbal Medicine uses the healing properties of plants, information about which has been gathered over centuries. These are prescribed in the form of pills, juices, teas or tinctures. Medical herbalists combine the wisdom of traditional herbal use with the latest scientific knowledge. As part of the consultation, lifestyle and diet are considered. It may help with headaches, insomnia, nausea, hair loss, fatigue, mood changes and depression, skin, joint and digestive problems. Medical Herbalists prescribe herbs individually and appropriately each person to avoid known and documented drug interactions. There is currently discussion between oncologists and herbalists regarding possible interactions between herbs and chemotherapy. Some oncologists are advising patients to abstain from taking any herbal medicines during their chemotherapy in the light of inadequate evidence to show if they interact with each other. To balance this rather extreme view, it is worth noting that many herbalists suggest foods e.g. ginger for nausea and herbal teas e.g. peppermint which can be beneficial and given safely during treatment without resorting to potentially higher-dosed herbal medicines. Consulting a qualified medical herbalist is certainly the safest way to take herbs. Buying over the counter preparations is not recommended. We have several articles on Herbs, such as The Power of Herbs by and on how at M.D. Anderson has been shown to double Survival times. Plus and specifically)  is based on the idea that like treats like. This means that a substance, which causes symptoms in a healthy person, given in minute doses, will balance those same symptoms in someone who is unwell. Homeopathy aims to treat the whole person and may also help with the side effects of treatment including wound healing, hot flushes, digestive disorders, depression, mood changes, nausea, bone pain and hair loss. It can be very helpful for fatigue and skin problems following radiotherapy. It is safe to take with other prescribed drug treatments. A detailed medical and psychological history is taken prior to making a decision as to which remedy is given. As an energetic or vibrational medicine, many people have difficulty understanding its mechanisms of action. However, the benefits of this are that homeopathy does not interact with any conventional medicine so can be taken safely during other cancer treatments. There has been some research into homeopathy that does show benefits in certain conditions including chemotherapy induced stomatitis, radiodermatitis, and general adverse events from radiotherapy (8-13). It is worth noting that the NHS offers a number of homeopathic hospitals around the country offering complementary therapies including homeopathy to patients with cancer including The Royal London Homeopathic Hospital and others in Glasgow, Bristol, Tunbridge Wells and Liverpool. ( It is important to note that no responsible homeopath would ever claim to ’cure’ cancer or even to help treat the disease directly. But expert homeopaths can provide a great deal of help in controlling and limiting side effects from surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy.You might to read the personal story of how   in her Therapy programme) Some patients find hypnosis very helpful in various aspects on therapy like pain control.  is a self-healing art that combines movement, meditation and visualisation to enhance the mind/body connection and assist healing. Coming from the Chinese medical tradition, the name comes from the word Qi - the life energy source that connects and sustains everything in the universe, and Gong - work or practice. Regular practice can help improve health and wellbeing (14), reduce stress and help develop a more peaceful state. Qi gong is a gentle yet powerful form of exercise that can be adapted to suit the needs of most people affected by cancer. It may be done standing, seated or even lying according to the needs of the individual. Daily practice is recommended as a self-help mechanism. ( In the 2006 Alberta Conference on Complementary Therapies, there were a number of significant scientific studies presented on the healing benefits of this therapy) Indian Head Massage uses a combination of techniques to ease tension and invigorate the muscles and soft tissues in the shoulder and scalp area. A face massage is sometimes included. Benefits include reducing stress, relaxation and freeing muscular tension. This technique can be done very gently and is safe with any forms of cancer. As with any other therapy, the therapist would treat each person appropriately to best meet his or her needs. Kinesiology is a therapy that uses muscle testing to determine what is wrong with the body and how best to put the problem right. The body can be disturbed by imbalances in virtually any aspect of life - nutrition, emotions, thoughts, relationships, experiences from childhood, fears, environmental chemicals, bacteria and viruses, or through muscle testing, which gathers information directly from the recipient’s conscious and unconscious mind, the practitioner seeks to identify the stress whether on a physical, mental or emotional level. The body is then balanced using techniques that include acupressure, nutritional supplements, hypoallergenic approaches, homeopathic remedies, magnets, specific intentional thoughts, sounds and body positions. Kinesiology can help correct imbalance in physical, mental and emotional patterns in the body. Reflexology is a holistic healing method that involves pressure and massage of the reflex points on the feet and hands. It teaches that life force or energy moves throughout the body via nerve and meridian (energy) pathways and that, if this is blocked, it can cause imbalance. These blockages can be detected via the reflex points and dissipated by pressure and massage techniques which encourage healing. Reflexology can help alleviate pain and anxiety (15, 16, 17), low mood, hot flushes, nausea, vomiting and fatigue, as well as helping tissue healing. This treatment is considered generally safe for people with cancer, although contra-indicated if there is suspicion of a deep vein thrombosis in the leg.  is a system of healing. Reiki is a spiritual healing discipline with its roots in ancient eastern teachings, and is a Japanese word meaning Universal Life (Rei) Energy (Ki). Reiki is thus the vital life energy which flows through all living things and which can be activated for the purpose of healing. The Reiki therapist channels the Ki through his or her hands to the recipient, activating the body’s natural ability to heal itself. When a person’s Ki is strong and flowing freely, the body and mind are in a positive state of health. However, the vital energy may become weak or blocked, and this may lead to symptoms on a physical or emotional level. The Therapist’s hands are placed lightly on the body in a series of positions. It can alleviate pain (18), anxiety and low mood and help generate relaxation and a feeling of well-being.  plays a vital part in our health, and some people may suffer from allergic reactions or food intolerance, or may simply need a more balanced diet. A Nutritionist examines dietary intake and lifestyle in order to discover and remedy any imbalances. Dietary changes may be suggested and nutritional supplements or tests recommended if the person is interested. Dietary changes, particularly increasing the amount of fruit, quantity and variety of vegetables, drinking enough water, and reducing the amount of saturated fat, sugar, denatured and processed foods we consume can help in staying healthy. ( As regulars will know, we have extensive information on this web site on this whole area, including the benefits of supplements, vitamins and minerals, an appropriate diet for chemotherapy, the issues of insulin or obesity and cancer. Readers might like to know about recent research from North Carolina which showed that a woman with breast cancer had a lowered risk of recovery the greater her weight above ’ideal’) Shiatsu literally translated means ’finger pressure’ and is based on the same principles as acupuncture but uses touch of varying pressures and gentle stretches to help release and balance the energy system of the body, which encourages self-healing to occur. Coming originally from the traditional Chinese medical system, shiatsu is a deeply relaxing and also energising treatment and can be used to help with fatigue, stress, anxiety, worry, muscular tension, insomnia, hot flushes and the side effects of drugs e.g. indigestion and constipation. Shiatsu is given with the person clothed, often on a mat on the floor, although other positions can be used for those unable to lie down. It is little known treatment, but used in a number of complementary cancer treatment centres. Many of the groups and classes offered at Breast Cancer Haven not only provide support but also enable people to develop self-help skills The Alexander Technique is a gentle and non-manipulative method for changing the way people ’use’ their bodies and themselves. Common examples of people ’using’ their bodies poorly include having a slumping posture and holding the breath, which in turn leads to stiff and restricted movement. This restriction and tension can be exacerbated by pain and complex emotions. The Alexander Teacher gently works with the tension and movement patterns of the person, helping them to become aware of and correct them. This can help also help bring awareness and relief to some emotional patterns and emotional states held in the body (19). Art Therapy is the spontaneous use of paint, pastels, clay or other art materials to help people communicate and overcome emotional and psychological difficulties. It is now considered a valuable therapeutic aid for people coping with illnesses and provides a means of communicating feelings and experiences, which may sometimes be difficult to put into words. It can be a form of relaxation and a way to explore quality of life issues and can help people come to terms with diagnosis and treatment for cancer. Used in many cancer treatment centres, it is recognised for its value in this setting. It is worth noting that participants do not need to be artistic or have any experience of using art materials to benefit from this therapy. Auricular (ear) acupuncture is used for the side effects that may occur during and after breast cancer treatment. In this group each person has five small, fine acupuncture needles inserted into points on the outer ear and left there for about 40 minutes during which time people sit quietly. The group has proved very successful in helping to reduce hot flushes, relieve nausea, anxiety, headaches, fatigue and insomnia. Auricular Acupuncture helps the body to detoxify itself, increases energy levels and gives an enhanced sense of well-being. Hair and makeup workshops are available to give advice and support with appearance and hair. Tips will be given to overcome the problems created by cancer treatments such as loss of eyebrows and lashes from chemotherapy. In addition to this, advice and help with wigs will be given. These workshops are fun and can enhance self-confidence during or after treatments. Meditation is about paying attention. It is about being present and fully aware in our lives and the self-healing that this brings. To start meditation, concentration is enhanced using the focus of awareness on the breath, a sound, an image or sensations in the body to help keep the ever wandering mind present. With practice, meditation practised mindfully can bring deeper levels of peace, aid well-being, reduce anxiety, pain and stress and improving mood state and energy levels (20,21). This can also help dealing with the numerous stressful situations in everyday life. ( We have covered US Clinical Trials in icon on meditation - for example, meditation prior to surgery has been proven to reduce bleeding ) Emotional Freedom Technique is a powerful technology for quickly resolving emotional distress. It is even capable of relieving physical complaints such as pain, allergic symptoms, and much more. When effective, not only does it do this quickly, but it works without forcing the recipient to repeatedly re-experience the negative emotional state. This treatment is generally lasting, relatively easy to apply and is free of negative side effects. When a person remembers a painful or traumatic incident it causes their energy system to disrupt. As the body recalls the memory, it also re-produces the original emotional state associated with that time. EFT works directly to re-balance the energy field; as a result, negative emotions are cleared and harmony is restored. The feelings connected to even the most intense memories or limitations are then dispelled.(Ed: we have a on the subject ) NES Energetic Analysis is an energy field scanner that quickly and accurately analyses the location and causes of ill health. Developed over 25 years by an Australian team of scientists, the Nutri-Energetics System (NES) machine effectively maps the human body-field, establishing which organs are lacking in energy, where blockages have been triggered by environmental chemicals, heavy metals, bacteria and viruses, nutritional imbalances, allergies or muscular-skeletal trauma and correcting any damage caused. The device then recommends specific energetically based remedies that correct these disruptions at a molecular and cellular level, enabling the body’s energy fields to re-align themselves and re-activate their innate self-healing abilities. A course of sessions with the NES runs over a period of 4 months with two weekly scans, each involving the recommendation of up to three homeopathic-like remedies to help rebalance the body’s energy. These remedies do not interact with cancer treatments therefore are safe to use during treatment.  offer people an opportunity to come together to share and discuss any issues that have arisen in their lives as a result of having breast cancer and its treatments. The issues may relate to coping with the shock and trauma of diagnosis and treatment, relationship issues, body image or matters of intimacy. Support groups are led by a counsellor experienced with groups and are open to anyone affected by breast cancer. Havens have a support group specifically designed to meet the needs of younger women with breast cancer as there are fewer younger women diagnosed with the illness, they can feel quite isolated and may have different issues to contend with. There has been much research published regarding the role of psychological and emotional support for people with cancer (22). Stretch and Relaxation is a combination of strengthening and stretching exercises. It uses the fundamental principles and practices of Yoga and Pilates to create a holistic workout with a relaxation and visualisation technique at the end of the class that brings the body and mind into a state of balance and harmony. These exercises bring flexibility and strength, relieve stress and bring emotional calm.  is an ancient Indian philosophy and practice. The word ’Yoga’ means ’union’ or ’ integration’ and yoga uses stretching, postures and breathing to help harmonise the body, mind and spirit. These classes consist of specifically and appropriately chosen exercises to help promote movement and lymphatic drainage following breast cancer treatment. Yoga relaxes and energises whilst bringing flexibility, strength, concentration, self-confidence and peacefulness. It has been shown to reduce sleep disturbance and increase emotional well-being and spiritual integration (23, 24, 25). ( There are a number of studies on Yoga from the USA - notably one from Seattle where, even in beginners classes, there was a 50 per cent reduction in cortisol (the stress hormone linked to cancer) levels after one week, compared to just a 5 per cent reduction if the patient went home to rest and calm down! On Meditation prior to surgery there are even clinical trials showing blood loss is reduced by 40 per cent - New York Presbyterian Hospital)  Awareness Classes are aimed at teaching people affected by breast cancer what they can do to help prevent the development of lymphoedema. This includes the giving of information and advice about daily activities as well as the opportunity to learn specific exercises, known as , which focuses on healing through movement and dance. It is a therapeutic exercise program for women who have had any kind of breast surgery, node dissection, radiation, chemotherapy, lymphoedema, or who suffer with chronic fatigue. Two doctors and a dance movement specialist created this programme to help women and men. It aims to regain range of motion, increase flexibility in frozen shoulder, work with balance issues both physically and emotionally, help reduce swelling from lymphoedema, may help reduce the risk of lymphoedema decrease depression, add to sexuality, increases femininity, promotion of positive self image and joy, weight stabilization. No special physical abilities required. The classes are complemented by a DVD made in collaboration with St George’s Hospital NHS Trust entitled ’Lymphoedema Awareness: reducing your risk’ and is available from Breast Cancer Haven. Anita Wallace, Chair of the Lymphoedema Support Network described the film as ’an excellent resource for at risk patients.’ We are also working to extend our support to those who are not able to directly access a Haven. As well as our literature, DVD’s and website, which offer extensive information, we offer telephone consultations to individuals and welcome people along to our Haven Support Workshop wherever they are based. The workshop offers information, practical tips and an introduction to the complementary therapies on offer. Lee H. Schmidt,K. Ernst E. Acupuncture for cancer-related pain - a systematic review.

Three Cancer Centers Institute Complementary Medicine Units ARLINGTON, Va-One measure of the influence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) on the world of conventional medicine may be the acceptance by major cancer centers of programs designed to integrate these therapies into their services. ARLINGTON, VaOne measure of the influence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) on the world of conventional medicine may be the acceptance by major cancer centers of programs designed to integrate these therapies into their services. At a panel session of the Comprehensive Cancer Care 2000 conference, program chiefs from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center discussed how they developed and currently manage CAM units at their institutions. M.D. Andersons offers an environment for healing opportunities for the mind, body, and spirit, said administrative director Judy Gerner, LPT. The center focuses on the current and future quality of life of any patient diagnosed with cancer, regardless of whether they were treated at M.D. Anderson, and their personal caregivers, and also serves as a point of triage for all M.D. Anderson services and programs used by this population. The program had its origins in a series of annual workshops on complementary medicine that began in 1985, but high patient interest pushed M.D. Anderson to begin strategic planning for a freestanding unit a decade later. The key to its implementation, Ms. Gerner said, was getting both the administration and the heads of the medical departments to sign off on the proposal. The members in this meeting were scientists, researchers, and, of course, clinicians. We had no idea how or if they would accept the proposal, she said. But they gave us enthusiasm and support. More than a year before the unit opened, Ms. Gerner put together a steering committee drawn from M.D. Anderson departments to avoid overlap and a sense of competition and to bring experienced perspectives to the new venture in patient education, social work, and chaplaincy. She also set up a committee of patients and family members. Dana-Farbers CAM unit is really a multi-institutional coalition, backed by Brigham & Womens Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Childrens Hospital, Beth Israel Hospital, and the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy, said Mary Jane Ott, MN, MA, a nurse practitioner at Dana-Farber. Ms. Ott said that the program had its origins in patient interest, but was especially aided by the patient for whom it is namedLeonard P. Zakim, who died last December after a long battle with multiple myeloma. Mr. Zakim was co-chair of the Complementary Therapy Task Force, and a large fund-raising event was held in his honor, allowing the center to become a reality. Planning for the Leonard P. Zakim Center of Integrative Therapy meant consulting with existing departments, including patient care, education, and research, she said. The Dana-Farber Zakim Center, in contrast to M.D. Andersons CAM unit, is a center without walls. Patients asked us to come to where they were throughout the institution, Ms. Ott said. Simone B. Zappa, RN, MBA, program director and administrator at Memorial Sloan-Ketterings Integrative Medicine Service, said that ideas have to be adapted to each institution and location. She describes the Integrative Medicine Service as a center with and without walls. Half of the 200 patients seen by Ms. Zappas staff each week are inpatients. She found that most outpatients didnt want to linger for CAM sessions after chemotherapy or physician visits. A second, separate site helped patients feel good about their CAM experience, she said, and not like cancer patients. All of these programs concentrate on improving the quality of life for cancer survivors or those patients undergoing treatment. Techniques used at the Zakim Center include relaxation techniques, mindfulness meditation, guided imagery, yoga, Therapeutic Touch, and Reiki (a Japanese form of healing touch). A referral patterns showed that patients sought CAM primarily for stress reduction (25%), anxiety relief (15%), and Therapeutic Touch (24%), Ms. Ott said. Memorial Sloan-Kettering uses some of these therapies as well as reflexology, mind/body work, acupuncture (performed only by MDs) and inpatient music therapy. M.D. Anderson offers yoga, tai chi, meditation, art, music, and humor therapy, support groups, nutrition, stress management, relaxation, guided imagery, and educational forums. A critical element in starting and running CAM programs, all three representatives said, is placing them on a firm medical footing. Patients want both conventional and complementary therapies. At M.D. Anderson, we emphasize the complementary,  Ms. Gerner said. We dont use the term alternative. Ms. Zappa credits the Memorial Sloan-Kettering programs success to sticking to evidence-based therapies, structuring the unit on a medical model, and collaborating closely with the health care team. Power lies with the doctors in a conservative institution, she said, so the only way to integrate the service is to get the buy-in of the doctors. The Integrative Medicine Service acts on referrals from all members of the health care team as well as self-referrals. Patients are assessed and receive a treatment plan that might call for anything from a one-shot therapy to treatment several times a week. Ms. Zappa said she hires only staff licensed within their specialties. The panelists noted that not all CAM therapies have credentialing boards, so staffing decisions may rely on references and interviews as well as on formal credentials. Funding sources vary widely at all three institutions. M.D. Anderson paid for the renovation of an existing but disused space and contributed $30,000 in startup funds. The Cancer Center also pays $40,000 per year for expenses plus salaries for a medical director, administrative director, and three full-time equivalent staff. The staff must raise funds for additional programming, Ms. Gerner said. The unit charges no fees to the 10,000 patients per year who visit. Memorial Sloan-Kettering is currently a fee-for-service program, but Ms. Zappa is working to make insurance coverage easier to obtain for patients. CAM lowers costs, added commentator Clem Bezold, PhD, a consultant and president of the Institute for Alternative Futures, and that should drive what gets on the list for reimbursable care. Marketing the programs is critical to success. Persuasive efforts to gain approval from decision makers within the institution in the planning stages, ongoing marketing of services to doctors and nurses to encourage referrals, and external marketing to draw in patients and their families are all needed. Even terminology has a mysterious effect on patients, Ms. Zappa said. Simply renaming a Back in Shape course, Light Aerobics attracted many more participants, she said. Finally, research and education are important components of these CAM programs. Researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering are studying Asian herbal remedies and evaluating quality of life. Dana-Farber is doing studies on pediatrics and on the immunologic benefits of qi gong, a type of healing exercise from China. Ms. Gerner said that M.D. Anderson has more than 70 ongoing research studies examining issues related to the mind, body, and spirit. She sees playing an important role in helping M.D. Anderson develop and implement novel research studies in the area of psychosocial care and quality of life.",51,What is holistic medicine and what does it include?,-12.798800468444824,146

We'll help you pick the best addiction treatment program for you. The Difference Between Holistic and Drug-Based Rehabilitation There are two primary schools of thought when it comes to drug rehabilitation, .  It could be called a or approach. The other could be called or . Any inquiry into drug rehab should include examination of these two systems. Traditional medical detox does not involve the use of drugs or medications but quite often does. The development of drugs as a substitute for other drugs is a field unto itself. The basic theory is that a substitute drug is needful to offset the withdrawal symptoms of the one the addict has been abusing. Patents for newer drugs are in constant demand among researchers in this field, thus the list of such is constantly expanding. A few examples: for heroin or opiate addiction, (and other similar compounds) or could be used. For alcohol dependency, or could be prescribed. (brand names ) is also used to treat both alcohol and . Some of these create an effect similar to the chemical they are intended to counter-act. Methadone is taken orally on a daily basis by heroin addicts and is listed as a narcotic (Suboxone is also in this category – the same class as heroin). It acts on the same brain receptor as heroin, produces a “” and a reportedly more gradual “” than heroin. A methadone dosage lasts about 24 hours, hence the need for daily ingestion. In treating alcohol dependency, could be used. This drug is designed to create an adverse reaction; if the person does drinks alcohol, 5-10 minutes later he/she experiences severe nausea, vomiting or headache for 30 minutes or up to several hours. This method could be called “stimulus-response” such as an electric jolt for smoking tobacco. One should be aware of side effects of these , which for some can include diarrhea, allergic reactions, headaches, insomnia, irregular heartbeat, and high (or low) blood pressure, as well as blurred vision, confusion or hallucination. In this type of rehab, various forms of treatment or psychoanalysis are employed – such as behavioral or cognitive therapies – in order to get the patient to deal with the problems associated with drug abuse. Holistic rehabilitation is used to describe methods that do not employ other drugs. While there can be exceptions – like a mild sedative to help someone sleep – the basic holistic philosophy is that a person is much better off without drugs in the body. The first concern in holistic rehab is to detoxify the body of drugs with minimal pain or discomfort. One principal in holistic recovery is that – among the many harmful effects – the body will become depleted of essential vitamins and minerals, hence the often emaciated appearance of a long-term addict. Some of the methods that could be employed in holistic detox are controlled nutrition, vitamin and mineral supplements, massage, acupuncture, physical therapy or alternative medicine. Various forms of physical fitness could be employed, such as martial arts or yoga. Holistic rehab will also lean towards a more or approach to recovery, utilizing such avenues as 12-step programs, prayer, meditation or pastoral counseling. Both will use systems of therapy – group and individual – to help an addict deal with the problems and emotional pain inevitably connected to drug addiction and alcoholism. The truth of the matter is that the best drug rehabilitation system is the one that works for the individual. Relapse is a major part of the problem of addiction. Where one system did not work, it may be time to consider one’s options and try another. One should also define what it means to say a treatment “” for you personally. Does this mean “” Unfortunately, the abuse of prescription drugs – substitute and otherwise – is alarmingly widespread. Prescription drug abuse is at an all-time high and some would argue is at epidemic proportions. It is way too easy to get prescription . An unlocked medicine cabinet can lead to disaster for a child or teenager. Even a Vicodin prescription for a broken arm can lead to addiction. In a report by the , drugs overdoses now outnumber traffic accidents in fatalities, in large part due to abuse of prescription drugs. Undecided on Holistic and Drug-Based Rehabilitation? The sea of facts and opinions can be disheartening. If you have not decided what method is best for you, your next logical step is to look up various rehab centers and talk to their staff, talk to graduates and make up your own mind.

bc03aad1-7b16-414e-bff1-3231512f655e,"Yoga and massage are components of Ayurveda because they accomplish so many of the mental, physical and spiritual parts of feeling good or getting better. Western cultures have been embracing holistic medicine or treating the whole patient -- mind, body and spirit -- in recent decades, but as many as 80 percent of people in India have been doing the same for about 3,000 years. Ayurvedic medicine, or Ayurveda, has its roots in the Hindu religion and focuses on both prevention and cures by looking at how well the body is balanced. Using three systems, or doshas -- the nervous (Vata), arterial (Kapha) and venous (Pitta) -- practitioners of help people keep their insides and outsides in check with the physical and spiritual world. As many as 70 percent of individuals in India use only Ayurveda for health care, but most in the West and some in India and other parts of Asia combine it with more traditional medicine and physicians. Combining the best of both is often called complementary and alternative medicine, or CAM. Translated as the ""knowledge of life"" or the ""science of life,"" Ayurveda can help improve both physical, measurable health and the overall quality of life. We'll take a look at five benefits of using Ayurvedic treatments. Eating grapefruits and other citrus food in advance of cold season is a simple immunity-booster in the West, but in traditional Ayurvedic medicine, a multitude of herbs, , minerals and proteins are mixed together to prevent and combat immune disorders. These combos, or tonics, are believed to help strengthen the body's defenses and to keep the appetite strong so illness has less of a chance of settling in. Treatments for immunity are mixed depending on the condition or imbalance, but some general tonics can contribute to disease resistance when taken by healthy individuals. One word of caution, though: Some ingredients have been found to be either toxic or dangerous when used in combination or along with traditional medications -- both prescribed and over-the-counter. Finding a reputable and trained Ayurvedic practitioner and eliminating any possible harmful drug interactions is very important before beginning treatments, even if they seem all-natural and harmless. Although garlic has shown to have some medicinal benefits, including some links to improved heart health and cancer resistance, it causes more than bad breath according to many who use Ayurveda. Both garlic and onions are avoided in Hindu celebrations as well as in day-to-day meals because they are considered poor ingredients for spiritual health and physical vitality. Along with tonics for improving immunity, practitioners also mix or give straight herb preparations to reduce symptoms of illness or disease. Most recommendations for symptom relief also come with lifestyle changes or activity, too. , taking breaks to breathe in and out, getting sun exposure, and eating a healthier or illness-specific diet all work together to help the whole person feel better and not just to treat the symptoms. Sometimes foods believed to aggravate symptoms are eliminated from the diet and minerals might be increased. Even metals such as iron and gold are thought to have healing properties and to keep viruses and disease at bay before they have a chance to produce symptoms of ill health. Yoga is a complement to this component of because it accomplishes so many of the mental, physical and spiritual parts of feeling good or getting better. Even without incorporating its historic Eastern, religious aspects, yoga is beneficial for breathing, stretching and improving circulation. Treatments for reducing or relieving stress include a multitude of herbs, vitamins, minerals and proteins. There are proven links between poor physical health and high stress levels, and Ayurvedic texts going back thousands of years recognized how taxing worry can be on the body and spirit. Treatments for reducing or relieving stress include the tonics and activities mentioned for physical well-being, but an added emphasis for balancing mood and mental activity can include getting more deeply in tune with the spiritual and tipping the scales back down from the material world. Even the Bible talks about ""being choked out by the concerns of this world,"" and Ayurvedic medicine has long held the same belief. Worry and stress can literally take the life out of people and lead us away from a life more balanced and centered in the spiritual and non-physical. for breathing sake is one way to stop the noise and re-center the mind and body, and taking breaks to stop thinking too much -- which is harder than it sounds, most of us know -- are actually medicinal when used in harmony with other Ayurvedic practices. One way to start is to avoid or reduce time in situations known to trigger your own worry. Nourish the mind instead of letting the mind eat or consume you is one way to look at it. Many of the preparations and individual ingredients of aid in digestion and keeping the body in balance, and most of the diet principles complement the tonics or specific recommendations of practitioners. When a person is suffering from poor health or even poor , Ayurvedic medicine also encourages a good cleansing of the insides for improved overall health. Panchakama is the name of the process for getting rid of food and impurities that interfere with how the body should ideally work. Administering enemas, oils and massage therapy all help get the body moving from the tissue level to the intestinal level as impurities get released from the system. Breathing, digestion and thinking are thought to improve, and having a cleansed inside also allows for more filling spiritually. Achieving balance through cleansing should be done carefully and with the go-ahead of your physician or a reputable Ayurvedic practitioner. Overdoing it can lead to deficiencies of vitamins and minerals as well as some of the body's healthy bacteria, which are also needed for digestion and balance. Ayurveda complements that basic approach to healing by helping us de-junk and de-clutter the mind and spirit while taking care of our bodies. One of the greatest benefits of and other holistic forms of medicine is that it allows for individualizing treatments and improving the whole body a little at a time, all of the time. It is a lifestyle as much as a complementary and alternative medicine, so within reason and depending on health needs, it is practical for every day. Even from its start, Ayurveda was believed to be effective for psychiatry, sexual energy, surgery and internal medicine. If health is waning or emotional stress and have set in, diet, physical activity and connectivity to things spiritual -- in whatever religious tradition you adhere to -- can be ""applied"" to correct the imbalance and promote harmony. A lot of the work of even the most traditional physician's treatments involves getting rid of junk that makes our bodies sick, and Ayurveda complements that basic approach to healing by helping us de-junk and de-clutter the mind and spirit while taking care of our bodies.

Complementary medicine is now practiced in more than one-third of hospitals in the United States, a notable increase over the one-quarter of hospitals offering complementary therapies in 2005 [source: ]. There are lots of complementary therapies out there, divided typically into broad categories that describe the overall approach or theory behind the treatment: These are not hard-and-fast distinctions. Some complementary therapies fall into more than one category, like meditation, which is a mind-body therapy and part of a whole medical system known as . In this article, we'll find out what each of these complementary approaches entails and which therapies they promote. We'll talk about the five most popular complementary therapies that hospitals offer and what's involved in the treatments. We'll start with another therapy that began thousands of years ago in traditional Chinese medicine: acupuncture. Acupuncture is one of the more common complementary therapies used in hospitals. Whole medical systems are overarching groups of theories and practices that encompass every aspect of health. , for instance, a system that developed in Europe, is based on the principle of ""like cures like"" -- a homeopath would inject a person with a tiny amount of whatever disease he or she suffers from so his or her body can learn to fight it and heal itself. is a whole medical system that revolves around the concepts of balance -- -- and energy flow, or "","" along lines known as . In this medical system, disease and pain are caused by a disruption in the body's flow of energy. , a treatment in traditional Chinese medicine, is one of the most common complementary therapies offered in hospitals. In acupuncture, a practitioner inserts thin metal needles into the skin at specific places. The points align with the body's meridians, the lines along which energy flows. The purpose is to stimulate these points with the needles to encourage the movement of energy (qi) to specific parts of the body, or remove an energy block, in order to restore the body's natural energy flow and thereby alleviate the symptoms of an illness. Acupuncture may be used to treat chronic , circulation problems, and arthritis. These conditions are some of the most common reasons why people seek complementary (and alternative) medical therapies. Someone in a hospital experiencing pain or poor circulation might also receive the next treatment on the list. A massage increases blood circulation to targeted parts of the body. Publications International, Ltd. Hospitals have been offering massage for many years. It's been proven effective in the treatments of (chronic, post-surgery and illness-related), arthritis and circulation problems, not to mention soreness. Massage is part of a group of therapies known as . This category also includes practices like chiropractic and (another top five therapy). In manipulative and body-based medicine, the idea is that alignment of joints and the proper circulation to muscle groups and other tissues are crucial to good health. Massage addresses this concept in a direct way, through the working of muscles, tendons and other soft tissues. A massage therapist uses hands and arms (and sometimes other body parts, like feet) to manipulate the patient's body. Massage increases blood circulation to a part of the body, or throughout the body in general, by rubbing a muscle group and extending joints. This manipulation stimulates the flow of blood to that area, which, in turn, increases the oxygen available to muscles and tissues. Good blood flow is essential for the body to work efficiently and fight disease. ­­Up next are the related practices of yoga and meditation, which also seek to stimulate areas of the body -- but with the added component of mind-based work. ­ Yoga can exercise the body and quiet the mind. Bob Stockfield/National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine/NIH Practices like meditation and yoga, offered in hospitals all over the country (and the world), are popular not only in the treatment of sickness but also in the regular maintenance of general health. They're part of a group of therapies known as , as well as a whole medical system called , which originates in India. In mind-body medicine, the mind and body are connected integrally. The mind can and does affect a person's health. In this approach, treatments like meditation, yoga, and art are used to alleviate symptoms and assist in the treatment of all sorts of diseases and conditions, including , and anxiety, , high blood pressure, poor circulation and chronic pain. In yoga, a person holds poses (or postures) for extended periods of time and stretches muscles in ways that promote not only circulation to certain body parts, but also help to quiet the mind and ease . In this practice, a calm and healthy mind helps to heal the body, and a calm and healthy body helps to soothe the mind, which can then better serve the body. Meditation seeks to achieve similar results but it is a still, mind-based approach. People who meditate use techniques such as visual imagery and mantras to focus and clear the mind. Mind-body medicine is probably the most common group of complementary treatments offered in conventional hospitals. The next two practices on the list are also from this category. Many hospitals include chapels or places of worship for patients and families. The most common complementary therapy in the United States is . More people turn to prayer when they are experiencing health problems than to any other practice [source: ]. Guided prayer -- not only to a god but also within a general spiritual context -- is just one component of a complementary therapy known as . Pastoral or faith-based counseling is offered by most hospitals -- it can be as simple as having a rabbi, reverend, priest and imam on staff or on call in case a patient wants spiritual advice. A hospital might have a chapel in case a patient (and/or patient's family) wishes to pray or just sit in a spiritual place. This group of spiritual treatments can include prayer, spiritual guidance and individual and group therapy. Anyone of any religion, or people who are not involved in any particular religion but are looking for something purposeful beyond themselves, may seek this type of assistance when faced with major medical decisions, and especially when faced with serious or terminal illness. Pastoral counseling, prayer or spirituality can be viewed in the context of mind-body medicine, since it's based on the idea that a serene mind can help the body to heal and ease pain. Research shows that people who have religious faith tend to be healthier and live longer. This may be due to a reduction in stress associated with prayer, or it may be something more elusive. Between 2003 and 2004 alone, at least 45 percent of Americans used prayer specifically for health reasons [source: ]. The last of the top five complementary treatments used in hospitals also seeks to cure bodily disease by way of the mind. It's a very common therapy for heart patients, especially. Among mind-body practices, is a primary goal. This is actually a body of practices unto itself: Stress management is a critical component in the treatment and prevention of conditions like chronic pain and heart disease; and patients with terminal illness can experience an improved quality of life by reducing their stress levels. Stress has a direct and documented affect on health. The ""stress hormone"" is a factor in heart disease, high blood pressure, pain and mental disorders, among other issues. There are lots of approaches to stress management -- ways to decrease the amount of cortisol coursing through the body. Yoga and meditation help to ease the mind. A stress-management counselor might recommend cognitive practices like visualization (perhaps going to your ""happy place""), mantras and journaling to lower stress levels. There are also behavioral approaches, like giving yourself more time before an appointment so you don't have to rush. Sometimes listening to music can help, and using creative outlets like painting and drawing can ease stress, too. Along these lines, many hospitals offer and music therapy to their patients.

5a2249f9-6c1f-4532-88a6-7788afe4deb3,"Written by: The term is used to describe treatment programs that offer some that of many, more traditional rehab centers. The services provided in a holistic rehab derive from holistic or integrative medicine, and are utilized to achieve optimal wellness by focusing on the concept of a ; with goals for treating the “whole person” and not just the individual or alcoholism. Most holistic rehabs utilize practices such as: Frequently these techniques are superimposed or incorporated into a framework of more traditional . For some, there is more to rehabilitation than maintained abstinence and therapy sessions. Holistic rehab provides some alternatives to a more standard rehab atmosphere, and therefore is an attractive option for many. As mentioned, many holistic drug and operate with a holistically augmented framework of more traditional treatment approaches in place. Some of these traditional services can include: According to the Academy of Integrative Health & Medicine (formerly the American Holistic Medical Association), there are a great number of holistic approaches that can be utilized for the treatment of any person. These include: Ayurveda – Ayurvedic medicine is regularly used by much of the population of India. Incorporates meditation, yoga and quite specific dietary guidelines to nurture a singular mind-body-spirit. Herbal therapy – Herbal supplementation can augment healthy nutrition and strategically utilized to detoxify and diminish unhealthy cravings. Homeopathy – Many homeopathic remedies can be used to supplement more traditional pharmacotherapeutic management of the uncomfortable symptoms of withdrawal. Massage – Massage therapy can provide a relaxing adjunct to treatment, providing stress relief and soothing the aches and pains as a body adjusts to a drug-free state. Reiki – The harnessing of ‘universal life force energy’ to begin a process of physical healing and increase relaxation; helpful in alleviating some physical symptoms of withdrawal. Many holistic practitioners stress that our bodies have an innate healing ability, and many of the techniques described above are tools to help unlock that potential. This healing philosophy applies to issues of substance abuse and addiction, as well. Patients are encouraged to reclaim control of their lives and take responsibility for the health and recovery in a holistic program. A recovering addict who chooses a holistic treatment program can expect to be exposed to some or all of these types of treatments during the . Could you, or someone you know benefit from a more holistic approach to recovery? The professional staff at our helpline can provide you with a confidential assessment at no cost in an effort to determine the best holistic rehab for you. With a nationwide database of treatment centers that provide effective holistic rehabilitation, we can match your personal recovery needs with the actual services provided in the treatment center. Call us now toll-free at any time, day or night. More traditional approaches to recovery place emphasis on evidence based clinical interventions to treat substance abuse disorders. Patients can expect to undergo a period of detoxification and managed withdrawal (when necessary), to be followed by regular participation in group and individual therapy sessions, sober skills training and plans for continued recovery post-treatment. In programs that employ a more holistic approach to substance abuse treatment, patients can potentially experience a as their emphasis is more on self-discovery and utilizing the tools to enable the body to begin a natural process of healing and recovery. Traditional rehabs typically use a variety of prescribed medications to usher a patient through a difficult period of detoxification and , and later can institute a program of medically assisted recovery, when another set of prescribed medicines can help modify cravings, or limit the rewards associated with continued drug or . Holistic practitioners adhere to the belief that the optimum method of detox is to minimize the introduction of new chemicals or medications to the body, and to embark on a period of cleansing achieved through healthy food and pure water, as well as herbal supplementation. Therefore, a person enrolled in a holistic rehab might encounter a similar period of withdrawal but–in situations safe to proceed in this manner–more natural measures such as herbal remedies, nutritional support, rest and massage therapy can be used to mitigate the discomfort of a detoxification process. With proper supervision, a holistically managed detox can equate to a less taxing and potentially expedited withdrawal period than one attempted on your own, or with the use of more standard, long-term prescription medications. More medications, holistic practitioners maintain, can equate to lengthier periods of toxicity, and only postpone the experience and full benefits of being completely drug free. Many believe that holistic practitioners approach to healing stems from a spiritual or even religious point of view, and that holistic techniques will have little benefit to someone who doesn’t adhere to such beliefs. This isn’t necessarily the case – if you can embrace the belief in an interconnectedness of mind, body and spirit, and see a benefit in a more natural approach to allowing your body and mind to begin its own healing process, holistic rehab might be a terrific option. The many facets and tools to be used with a holistic approach can be modified and adapted to fit any individual’s needs and preferences. Holistic treatment, as it augments a more traditional rehabilitation strategy, can provide a very well rounded program – perhaps allowing one to focus even more on a total picture of health and vitality, even one beyond the immediate recovery from substance abuse itself. With more emphasis on nutrition, as well as relaxation and peace of mind, holistic treatment can prepare someone to re-enter the outside world with renewed and lasting health. As many of the treatment modalities used in a holistic rehab program are considered complementary or alternative medicine, only certain insurance companies will recognize their legitimacy and provide reimbursement for them. For many, as a result, the biggest downside to seeking a holistic recovery program is a financial one. Some patients might have to pay a fair sum of money out of their own pocket if they are determined to undergo holistic treatment but, for many, it’s well worth it. The cost of inpatient treatment tends to run between $200 and $900 per day. Outpatient services cost around $100 to $500 per treatment session. These costs vary by the duration and frequency of treatment, as well as program specifics like location and level of luxury. Licensing for practitioners of many CAM therapies is another issue to consider. Acupuncturists carry their own recognized set of licenses and accreditation, however many other practitioners do not fall under any federal licensing jurisdiction or scrutiny. On an individual state basis, some form or registration or quality of care indicators are mandated, but it is not universal. For these reasons, and to ensure that the highest level of quality care will be administered, it would be in one’s best interest to do some investigating of the training and background of the health care providers that you are bound to encounter at specific holistic rehabs. Before making a decision about whether to choose holistic rehab, it can help to get word-of-mouth recommendations, check the practitioner’s track record, and ask any questions you have about the practitioner’s qualifications and methods used. Our treatment support specialists can help you find a holistic rehab that will accept your insurance and, if you must pay privately, help you to find a rehab that is affordable.

d9c4c731-b6c4-4eaa-bbff-4081b0539ff9,"What Nurses Need to Know About Alternative Medicine — How best to integrate CAM into care and how to use caution by Acupuncture, aromatherapy, supplements, and the like -- more and more people across the nation are using these therapies. Because a number of these people will be your patients, it's important for you, as a nurse, to know complementary and alternative medicine and about how to get more education if you'd like to implement them into your practice. First, let's make some distinctions: while ""complementary"" and ""alternative"" both represent the same types of therapies, they are . Both words refer to non-mainstream treatments such as aromatherapy, meditation, massage, etc. However, when a health care provider uses complementary medicine, it's used in conjunction with common, Western medicine. When the provider uses alternative medicine, it's used in place of common, Western medicine. Within this article, we will use the abbreviation CAM, which stands for complementary and alternative medicine. The focus here is not on if it's used with or without Western medicine, but how it is used with patients at all. If CAM isn't used yet at every health care facility, then why should nurses learn about it? ""Patients are using them. Time and time again, research finds that the majority of the population is using integrative health products, and this rate is much higher for patients with higher socioeconomic status and/or patients who suffer from chronic health conditions,"" said Jessie Hawkins, PhD, director of the Franklin School of Integrative Health Sciences. ""Without guidance from their care providers, patients are left to self-educate through online sources. This results in reduced efficacy at best and injury at worst."" With so many patients using CAM, Mollie Aleshire, DNP, program director and clinical associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro School of Nursing said ""it is essential that nurses have knowledge about common CAM and obtain information to elicit use of CAM therapies from the patient history."" Tina M. Baxter, APRN, GNP-BC, president and CEO of Baxter Professional Services, LLC, added: ""It's important to help patients get information from reliable sources and to know if a suggested alternative treatment, such as herbal supplements, may interfere with the medications they are currently prescribed or may be detrimental to their health."" According to Baxter, there are eight most commonly used CAM therapies in health care: acupuncture, aromatherapy, hypnosis, massage therapy, meditation, Tai Chi, therapeutic touch, and vitamins/herbal supplements. These, she said, are the most researched and studied. ""For example, aromatherapy oils are now used post-op in some hospitals to reduce anxiety and pain after surgery so that patients will require less pain medications. Meditation has been used in psychiatry through progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, and mindfulness meditation to augment the practices of cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectic behavioral therapy. Tai Chi has been shown to improve balance and flexibility for older adults and thereby reducing falls in long-term care and community settings,"" explained Baxter. ""Herbal supplements such as CBD oil have shown some efficacy in reducing seizures, pain, and anxiety. Hypnosis is a treatment that is offered for smoking cessation and obesity treatment. Massage therapy and acupuncture have been demonstrated to be beneficial in addiction treatment. Therapeutic touch has been demonstrated to help with pain in some instances by manipulating the energy fields that surround the body."" Audrey Christie, MSN, RN, a self-employed holistic wellness practitioner, noted that CAM has become more common because of evidence illustrating their benefits. ""Things like aromatherapy in labor and delivery units, as well as mindfulness and meditation or Reiki-style practices, are becoming more and more mainstream,"" Christie said. ""They can help with pain reduction, mindset, relaxation, anxiousness, and many other aspects of the body-mind connection. In recent years, science has been beginning to catch up to what we have known intuitively for years."" Hilary Erickson, RN, BSN, a labor and delivery nurse and creator of Pulling Curls, explained that if patients are pregnant with breech babies, she will often recommend that they see a chiropractor, as she believes that a skilled practitioner may help prevent them needing a C-section. Christie makes another good point: ""All therapies were once considered alternative -- even antibiotics. We know that there is far more to healing than just applying a chemical compound or mechanical procedure to the human form -- that intrinsic mind and spirit aspect can be a real determining factor in whether or not a patient gets better."" Don't be like your patients and simply look up information about CAM online. If you want to implement it into your practice, it's necessary for you to get some kind of formal education. ""Integrative health is a concept that is rapidly growing and expanding worldwide. Sales of dietary supplements are up year after year, and the industry itself is a multi-trillion-dollar global market. Patients are using alternative therapies, and that use is increasing,"" said Hawkins. ""Continuing education in integrative health is one of the best career investments a nurse can make."" But there are other reasons to study CAM. ""Nurses should be skilled in the therapy before providing it, and it should abide within hospital policies so that they can maintain the standard of care the hospital wants them to provide -- and so that they are protected,"" Erickson cautioned. A number of our sources recommend that nurses first look to the American Holistic Nurses Association for educational opportunities in CAM. The organization offers certification as well as online training programs. ""There are some complementary certificates available, such as the two-year program with alternative therapies expert Dr. Andrew Weil,"" said Linda Steele, PhD, MSN, program director for Walden University's nurse practitioner programs. ""Many nurses also get certified as a licensed massage therapist or acupuncturist."" Steele also noted that some conferences, like the annual one offered by the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, may offer CAM single sessions and in-depth training. ""We train nurses to become board certified health coaches, herbalists, and aromatherapists. We focus on these specific areas because they are the dominant integrative health fields in nursing practice,"" said Hawkins, referring to the Franklin School of Integrative Health Sciences. ""These therapies complement a nurse's practice by providing additional tools that can be used to boost overall quality of life as well as patient compliance with wellness programs. For example, much of the research on aromatherapy is specific to pre-procedural applications such as anxiety relief before a surgical intervention. For many applications of herbs and essential oils, there is high quality evidence supporting its use,"" Hawkins explained. ""Sometimes this evidence also clarifies its use. For example, recent research we conducted found that children with an autism spectrum disorder respond differently to pre-procedural aromatherapy than the general population. This helps to demonstrate not only that these interventions work, but with which populations they are found to be effective."" Most nurses can streamline their training at Franklin because they have general health education. Nurses train via interactive distance learning -- so they can still work -- and most complete their programs within a year. While many institutions teach CAM, Christie advises nurses to use caution: ""Only spend time and money on accredited schools. The kind of education they need depends entirely on the state in which they are practicing."" ""Medicine is evolving, as is the state of health. It's critical to explore options and be at the forefront of new therapies. In fact, most nurses took an oath to continue educating themselves,"" said Christie. While many patients will be using some form of CAM, you may encounter some who aren't. As a result, you'll need to explain it to them to make them comfortable. ""Never force them,"" said Christie. ""I try to come from a place of explaining it on their level. If you think of something like a breathing technique and work from there -- often in conversation and assessment -- you can find a connection to discuss with the patient and make them comfortable. If they never get comfortable, I try to send them with some education to learn more about the therapy on their own time."" Steele suggests nurses begin by giving basic tips to their patients to improve their overall health and wellness. ""Ask the patient to identify what types of therapies they have heard about and what their level of comfort with them is. Always assure them that they will have access to different medical recommendations, including alternative therapies, if and when they are ready to take that step,"" said Steele. ""Stress the idea of complementary medicine and nursing as a blend of both Western traditional medicine and Eastern modalities, which are more than 2,000 years old. Patients become much more comfortable when they realize they have choices in their health care."" Baxter said she explains to patients that there is research and evidence for the prescribed therapy as well as how the therapy may benefit them. ""I would be very careful, as some clients are concerned about promoting a specific religion when you talk of medication and Tai Chi. I encourage the clients to think of it as learning to 'quiet your mind' and 'learning to move your body to promote healing' as opposed to supporting a particular ideology."" With any kind of health therapy, there are cautions to be aware of. For example, just because vitamins and other supplements are sold over the counter, that doesn't mean that they are safe at all times. Steele said there are still precautions nurses should take. ""As with any medical or physical therapy, all have side effects and can cause potential harm or injury to the patient,"" she said. ""Avoid a one-size-fits-all approach. Like medications, what works for one person may not work for another. I have clients who do not respond well to aromatherapy but may respond better to some acupressure,"" said Baxter. ""I would make sure that if I am recommending any treatment, I would first research it for the evidence that it may be effective and make sure that you are qualified to provide the service that is offered."" Hawkins stressed that nurses need to know if their individual state or facility where they practice allows alternative therapies. Some don't. But they also need to know how the therapies, if allowed, will affect their patients as well. ""Nurses should be aware that alternative therapies are not free from risks and contraindications. Many of these therapies interact with conventional medications or treatments, and many others pose risks to patient health,"" said Hawkins. ""There are also restrictions on how these therapies should be used, even on otherwise healthy patients. For example, some essential oils can slow breathing in infants. Others can cause someone who does not typically burn to get a sunburn. Studying integrative health provides the framework needed to keep patients safe.""

Penn Foster High School High School Diploma There are several training program options for students who want to get post-secondary Ayurveda training. The most basic programs train students to become certified Ayurvedic Health Counselors. The only prerequisite for these programs is a high school diploma. The next-highest level is an Ayurvedic Practitioner training program. Finally, there are master's and doctoral degree programs offered in the field, which require applicants to have a bachelor's degree in order to enroll. Students can often find Ayurveda programs online or in hybrid formats that are designed to meet the needs of working students. There are also postsecondary institutions that offer continuing education courses in Ayurveda for current health professionals. For instance, registered nurses and certified massage therapists can get credits toward licensure renewal by taking Ayurveda courses at an accredited school. Ayurvedic Health Counselor training programs provide a basic overview of the field of Ayurveda. These programs usually take about a year to complete. They culminate in a comprehensive exam, and students are awarded a diploma upon completion. From there, they are eligible to apply for Ayurvedic Health Counselor certification from the National Ayurvedic Medical Association (NAMA). Right now, the only requirement for this designation is to have successfully completed an accredited program that provides certain courses, but it is important to note that NAMA is currently in the process of developing a certification exam, which is expected to be made available in December 2016. In addition to lecture-based coursework, some programs require students to complete clinical observations and supervised consultations. Some of the course topics include: The next-highest level of training is for aspiring Ayurvedic Practitioners. These programs usually take two years to complete. To enroll, applicants must have a high school diploma or GED, and they need to have completed an Ayurvedic Health Counselor Training program. In addition, most schools require applicants to take a college-level anatomy and physiology course before they enroll. Some programs even recommend that applicants have earned a bachelor's degree before undertaking this program. Students in these programs take anatomy- and disease-focused Ayurveda courses and meet extensive clinical experience requirements. Schools may award graduates a certificate, but like Ayurvedic Health Counselors, Ayurvedic Practitioners are officially designated by NAMA after finishing a program that includes certain courses and clinical experience requirements, with a future certification exam in the works. Here are some common course topics that may be included in the curriculum: Chronic diseases of the endocrine, immune and musculoskeletal systems At the graduate level, it is possible to earn a master's degree in Ayurveda. Degrees may be offered as a Master of Arts (MA) in Ayurveda or a Master of Science (MS) in Ayuredic Sciences. In terms of coursework, these programs are generally similar to practitioner training programs, but studies are usually more wide-ranging, and clinical experience requirements are more extensive. In addition, students may be required to conduct independent research in a particular field of interest, culminating in a master's thesis. Here are some general areas of study that are typically included in the curriculum: Although programs are rare, it is possible to earn a doctoral degree in Ayurvedic medicine. These programs are generally similar to master's degree programs, providing a comprehensive overview of the field and including both classroom coursework and clinical experiences. Graduates are qualified to apply for practitioner status from NAMA. Depending on the program they complete, graduates can work as Ayurvedic Health Counselors or Practitioners. Possible employers include holistic health institutions and spas. Individuals may also find work as yoga instructors, and they may be qualified for administrative work in traditional medical facilities. Graduates who want to expand their studies into Western medicine may enroll in nursing programs or apply to medical school. They may also enroll in postsecondary programs that prepare them for licensure as chiropractors or nutritionists. Students who are interested in Ayurveda have multiple training options. They can choose to become holistic health practitioners or expand their current knowledge of holistic practices, depending on their career goals and education level.

Introduction ""Medicine is a science and practice of intervention, manipulation, and control concerned with curing sick people, caring for sick people, preventing maladies, and promoting health"" [1] (p. IX). Throughout human history, different cultures in all parts of the world have had their own type of medicine. In Western countries and cultures, conventional, biomedical-based medicine has been developed, rooted in the natural sciences that had developed since the Middle Ages, [2]. In many non-Western cultures but also in Western cultures, several types of whole medical systems (WMSs) [3], that is, complete systems of theory and practice that have evolved independently over time in different cultures and apart from conventional medicine or Western medicine [3], have been developed. Currently WMSs, often referred to as traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) or (traditional and) Complementary and Alternative medicine (TCAM/CAM), and conventional medicine are found in almost all countries in the world. WMSs are in increasing demand by patients and are also studied in universities (e.g., the Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine & Health in the USA). According to the ""Traditional Medicine Strategy: 2014-2023"" of the World Health Organization (WHO), ""the public and consumers of health care worldwide continue to include T&CM in their health choices. This obliges Member States to support them in making informed decisions about their options"" [4] (p. 18). ""As the uptake of T&CM increases, there is a need for its closer integration into health systems. Policy makers and consumers should consider how T&CM may improve patient experience and population health"" [4] (p. 19). A central argument in favor of integrating T&CM into conventional medicine is that T&CM has additional knowledge and interventions on preventive and curative health promotion [5]. The integration can therefore contribute to current issues in public health and healthcare such as developing strategies of healthy ageing, promoting self-management, and controlling healthcare expenditures [6, 7]. Positive examples demonstrating and supporting the WHO strategy of integrating the best of both of worlds from T&CM and conventional medicine are the integration of the AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy (AYUSH)) system in the conventional system in India [8], the increasing use of mindfulness techniques in the treatment of depressive disorders [9], and the use of traditional medicinal systems in reducing the prescription of antibiotics in Thailand as one of the strategies to fight the global antimicrobial resistance problem [10]. This WHO position on integration of T&CM and conventional medicine is in contrast with the developments in many Western countries. Whereas many traditional medical systems were tolerated in clinical practice next to or integrated with conventional medicine in many Western countries until the end of the 20th century, this situation has rapidly changed, as a result of two interrelated developments regarding science-based medicine: (i) The first development is the increasing dominance of evidence-based medicine (EBM) in medicine since the 1990s [11]. As a result, ideally, only therapies with high-quality scientific evidence (from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials) on safety and (cost) effects are accepted in medicine [12]. And although in practice many conventional medical guidelines for a large part are based on lower quality scientific evidence (including clinical expertise), for opponents of the integration of T&CM and conventional medicine, a lack of high-quality scientific evidence is often used as an argument against integration. (ii) The second development has to do with the roots of science in theory development and theory testing [13]. In the last decades, the dominance of the biomedical model in medicine has led to scientific criticism of WMSs due to their theoretical basis that is perceived as not being in agreement with biomedical theories, but based on paradigms deemed as prescientific or unscientific. Furthermore, there is allegedly no evidence for specific effects of CAM medicinal products for conventional indications as tested in clinical studies according to the EBM paradigm [14,15]. And although in science currently the reductionist model is increasingly challenged and the WMSs theoretical models appear to be content-wise in line with the systems approaches in science and medicine, opponents of the integration of T&CM and conventional medicine use the assumed prescientific or unscientific theoretical models of WMSs often as an argument against integration. On the other hand, there are positive examples of integration, like the integrated use of Ayurveda and conventional medicine in treating elephantiasis in India, that resulted in a lifetime achievement award from the International Society of Dermatologists for Oxford professor of Dermatology Terence Ryan; the highly successful integrated treatment of depression with Yoga medicine and conventional medicine in the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuroscience in Bangalore (Bengaluru) in India; and the widely adopted use of Yoga medicine for geriatrics in Japan. Given the current need for some type of integration of conventional medicine and traditional/complementary medicine in countries all over the world, the large amount of scientific publications and the ongoing scientific debate on this topic among proponents and opponents, we decided to perform a critical review on the literature. Our aim is to provide a transparent overview on similarities and differences between WMSs and the conventional medical system and, based on this overview, identify issues that have to be dealt with in order to overcome the differences. It is expected that this overview will support informed decision-making in the integration process. 2. Material and Methods 2.1. Research Questions. A critical, narrative review of the literature was performed on the following research questions: (i) In order to describe the domain of WMS, what are the historical, clinical practice, ontological, epistemological and methodological aspects of WMSs? (ii) In order to clarify whether a uniform approach or diverse approaches to their integration are most appropriate, what are the major similarities and differences between the different WMSs? (iii) In order to clarify the generalizability of experiences from integrating non-WMS CAM therapies with conventional medicine, what are the major differences between WMSs and other ""single component"" or non-WMS CAM therapies? (iv) In order to demonstrate the common grounds and issues to overcome in the integration process, what are the similarities and differences between WMSs and conventional medicine? (v) What are the consequences for the testing of effects of medicinal products (MPs) from WMS (WMPs) and for regulation of WMPs? (vi) In order to facilitate the integration process, which aspects need attention to promote the integration of conventional medical system and the WMSs? 2.2. Scope of the Review, Databases, and Search Terms. In order to address the six research questions, we included the following six WMSs: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) [16,17], Ayurveda [18,19], Unani Medicine [20], Homeopathy [21], Naturopathy [22], and Anthroposophic Medicine (AM) [23, 24]. A discussion of ""all"" WMSs around the world was beyond the scope of the paper; the selection includes WMSs established in four large populations/cultures (China, Indian subcontinent, Arabic/Muslim countries, and Western cultures). Beyond the scope ofthis article is a comprehensive review of the discussions of the topics of (supposed) lack of evidence on specific effects of WMS treatments and the (supposed) lack of tested WMS theories. Nonetheless, these topics are briefly discussed. We searched the database PubMed, Google Scholar, and our own literature archives. Combinations of search terms used were as follows: whole medical systems, TCM, Ayurveda, Unani, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, or AM in combination with features, philosophy, methodology, or ontology. 3. Results 3.1. Overview and Historical Development of the Whole Medical Systems. A condensed overview of the WMSs included in this review is presented in Table 1. Of these six WMSs, three (TCM, Ayurveda, and Unani) are based on old traditions (first classical texts in the first millennium BC, predated by oral transmissions from the second millennium BC), each from a specific culture: TCM developed in China in connection with the philosophical traditions of Taoism (Lao Tzu, 605-531 BC) and Confucianism (Confucius: 551-479 BC), with classical TCM texts written in the period 221-207 BC [25,26]. Ayurveda developed on the Indian subcontinent in connection with Hinduism; classical Ayurveda texts are variously dated c700-200 BC [27, 28]. Unani has roots in Greek medicine (Hippocrates: 460-370 BC; Dioscorides: 40-90 AD; Galen: 130-210 AD); a seminal classical text from mainstream Medieval medicine and still used in Unani is the Canon of Medicine (1025 AD) by Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 980-1037 AD) [29]. These three WMSs have existed in their respective cultures for millennia before the development of natural science-based, conventional medicine [3, 16, 17, 19, 21-23, 30]. Three other WMSs (Homeopathy, Naturopathy, and Anthroposophic Medicine) are comparatively younger (<250 years), although traces of influences by older traditions can be found [31-33]. Seminal publications appeared for Homeopathy in 1796 [34], for Naturopathy in 1848 [35], and for AM in 1925 [36]. These three WMSs were first practiced in Central Europe by medical doctors and were further developed next to conventional medicine within Western cultures. In the course of globalization, all six WMSs have become disseminated from their original culture into other countries and regions, sometimes with establishment of ""second centers"" such as for Naturopathy in North America [37] and Homeopathyin India [38]. Currently, in almost every country in the world, one or more types of WMS are practiced [4]. 3.2. Similarities and Differences 3.2.1. Similarities and Differences between the WMSs. Some major similarities between the WMSs are as follows: (i) Holistic, nonatomistic ontological, epistemological, and practice orientation (ii) Aiming at preventive as well as curative health promotion (iii) Individualized treatment based on a system approach (iv) Medicinal use of a large number of different substances and WMPs, of mostly herbal but also mineral and zoological origin (e.g., 700 herbal species in TCM [39], >1000 substances in homeopathy [40], >4000 herbal species in Ayurveda, and >800 substances in AM [41]) (v) Nonmedication treatment modalities including massage, physical exercises, hydrotherapy, thermotherapy, and diet (although each modality maybe applied differently, cf. Table 1) Some major differences between the WMSs are as follows: (i) Use of different languages, including different concepts of levels of wholeness (ii) Different diagnostic systems (iii) Different specific therapy modalities, for example, acupuncture in WMS and art therapies in AM Homeopathy has two particular aspects: (i) In the development of homeopathy, there have been a strong element of pure empiricism and relatively less emphasis on theory. (ii) Homeopathic diagnostics and treatment are usually limited to case taking and the prescription of homeopathic MPs [42]. All homeopathic MPs are manufactured according to specific homeopathic procedures such as potentization, that is, successive dilution, each dilution step involving a rhythmic succession (repeated shaking of liquids) or trituration (grinding of solids into lactose monohydrate). In contrast, treatment in the other five WMSs is to a much larger extent multimodal (Table 1). A particular aspect of Naturopathy is the widespread use of therapy modalities from other WMSs (e.g., Chinese herbs and homeopathic MPs) or from non-WMS CAM (e.g., food supplements) [43]. In contrast, the other WMSs have a stronger element of uniformity, either in their theory (TCM, Ayurveda, Unani, and AM) or in the use of one specific type of WMPs (Homeopathy). TCM and Ayurveda have long traditions of mainly oral transmission of WMS knowledge and experience, predating the classical texts [16, 26]. Particular aspects of AM include the broad spectrum of artistic therapies deployed (painting, clay modeling, drawing, recitation, and music exercises) and the use of AM treatments also in large hospitals offering accident and emergency service within public requirement plans [23]. WMPs used in AM can be manufactured according to specific anthroposophic methods or methods used for herbal, homeopathic, or conventional MPs [41]. 3.2.2. WMSs versus Other ""Single Component"" or Non-WMS CAM Therapies. The major differences between WMSs and single component CAM interventions are as follows: (i) Some single component (or fixed combination of) CAM interventions can be conceptualized within the conventional biomedical paradigm: for example, a number of vitamins are used as CAM therapy, while their purported pharmacological effects are conceptualized on the levels of cell biology or biochemistry. In contrast, WMS interventions are not so easily understood on these levels (although the difference is not absolute [5]). (ii) Single component CAM interventions can be protocolled for specific conventional and/or CAM indications, whereas this is not the case for WMS interventions. (iii) Individualized, multimodal CAM treatment entails the combination of several treatment modalities that are tailored to the needs of the individual patient. When this happens within a WMS, all treatment modalities are understood within and derived from one conceptual framework, leading to a uniform treatment approach. When diverse single component CAM interventions are combined, a uniform conceptual understanding is often not possible, leading to eclecticism. 3.2.3. Similarities and Differences between WMSs and the System of Conventional Biomedicine. The main similarities between WMSs and some developments in conventional medicine are as follows: (i) The development of a personalized medicine/individualization approach in addition to the current mainstream protocolled approach [44, 45] (ii) The use and role of professional judgment in some domains of clinical practice (e.g., interpretation of radiographs) [45,46] (iii) The increasing use of complex interventions [47-49] (iv) System approaches in diagnostics and therapy (e.g., systems biology, epigenetics, emergentism, metabolomics, ""network medicine,"" ""polypharmacology,"" and ""polytarget treatment"") [5, 50-52] (v) Shared decision-making [45, 53] (vi) A holistic dynamic health concept [5, 54] (vii) The use of pattern recognition methodologies [55,56] (viii) The notion that RCTs are not applicable everywhere [57,58] with a shift towards more pragmatic trials [45, 48, 58, 59] and other study types [48, 60] (ix) The notion that conducting clinical studies for multiple clinical conditions and their respective diverse therapy options has its limitations, due to excessive complexity and prohibitive costs (x) The increasing role of patient preferences and patient autonomy (xi) The real-world situation that, in many medical fields (e.g., paediatric surgery, emergency medicine, and vaccination), RCT-based practice is only marginal and often critically questioned The main differences between the WMSs and the conventional medicine system are summarized in Table 2 [61]. 3.3. Integration of WMSs and the Conventional Medicine System. The integration of WMSs and conventional medicine entails some key, interdependent factors: (i) Legislation: therapy providers and WMPs (ii) Education: practitioners of the two integrating medical systems that have to work together for a period of years to build up experience and confidence in effective team work (iii) Quality standards for WMS treatment: training of providers, delivery of treatment, and pharmaceutical quality of WMPs (iv) Scientific research on the safety and efficacy of WMP interventions (v) Infrastructure and financial resources Regarding scientific research and quality benchmarking, there are specific issues pertaining to the inherent properties of WMSs: (i) Ontological, epistemological, and methodological issues relevant for the overall understanding and assessment of WMSs (ii) Specific issues relevant for diagnostics, therapy delivery, and outcome assessment in clinical practice These issues are discussed in the following subsections. 3.3.1. Legislation, Quality Standards, Research, Infrastructures, and Resources. Of paramount importance for integration is the recognition of WMSs in legislation, in particular (i) recognition of WMS therapy providers, their training schools and diplomas; (ii) regulatory provisions enabling the registration or marketing authorisation of WMPs. Such recognition is dependent on establishing quality standards: (i) For therapy providers (e.g., WHO benchmarks for training in TCM [26], Ayurveda [62], Unani Medicine [63], and Naturopathy [33]; CEN [French: Comite Europeen de Normalisation] standards for health care provision by medical doctors with additional qualification in Homeopathy [64]) (ii) For the pharmaceutical quality of WMPs (e.g., the Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex [41]). Scientific and societal recognition also depends on high-quality evidence for efficacy/effectiveness and safety of WMPs and nonmedication treatment in WMSs; hence, integration also includes the funding, conduct, and publication of scientific research studies in order to generate and disseminate such evidence. In order to promote quality standards and scientific research, infrastructures and financial resources are needed. In some countries these tasks are given national priority: for example, the Government of India supports research, education, quality standardization, and infrastructure building for seven WMSs (AYUSH: Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy, and Sowa-Rigpa), since 2004 within the newly established Ministry of AYUSH [65]. One example of infrastructure building is establishing Integrative Medicine centers in academic hospitals, where specific WMS modalities (not necessarily the entire WMS) are developed, applied, and tested. This model has been implemented in the USA and organized in the Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine & Health, based on four pillars: (1) the horizontal relationship between the doctor/therapist (coach) and the patient (coproducer); (2) the active role of the patient in prevention (lifestyle), wellbeing, and therapy and healing processes; (3) the use of evidence-based safe and effective conventional and complementary therapies; and (4) the use of healing environments [66]. 3.3.2. Fundamental Ontological Aspects. All studied WMSs take a nonatomistic, holistic ontological position towards the nature of reality. This means that they all conceptualize, each in a different form, in addition to material elements and forces, the existence of nonmaterial forces working in nature and man, which also play a role in health and disease. For example, a central concept of TCM is Qi, a vital energy or life force that moves in the body through a system of pathways called meridians [16]. Similar concepts are found in Ayurveda (""prana"" [67]) and Unani (""arwah"" or vital spirit [29]). AM has the concept of four levels of formative forces working in man: formative physical forces and three nonmaterial forces (life, soul, and spirit) [23, 30]. Homeopathy conceptualizes the nonmaterial effects of high potentized substances [21] and also Naturopathy is based on holistic and vitalistic principles [22]. 3.3.3. Conceptual and Epistemological Aspects. In line with the nonatomistic, holistic ontological position, central concepts of WMS are holistic. Concepts of the human being emphasize the wholeness and complexity of the human being [68]; its emergent, nonlinear dynamic, and epigenetic properties; and its ability of self-organization and adaptation as a network system [69]. Health is conceptualized as the ability to balance and actively restore the wholeness of the human being [5]. Within the WMS practice methods, there is an essential role for intuition and expert knowledge in diagnostics and decision-making [45], while treatment also takes into account context factors and the uniqueness, constitution, and complexity of the individual [45, 70]. In conceptualizing causality, WMSs emphasize systems causality [71], effects that involve global and patterned shifts across multiple subsystems of the person as a whole, and the role of context/placebo and intention effects [69]. 3.3.4. Methodological Aspects. A review on clinical and epidemiological research in CAM [48] demonstrates that, for research on therapy effects, there is consensus that both efficacy and effectiveness studies have their own place, validity, and importance. Some authors argue that efficacy research should be prioritised over effectiveness research to legitimise the use of CAM and to help to increase acceptance. Other authors state that efficacy research to examine specific effects should not be undertaken until overall effectiveness of the therapy in question is demonstrated, in order to prevent misuse of scarce resources. This discussion also reflects different opinions on the importance and value of specific and nonspecific effects within the whole of clinical practice. An integrative research approach has been described as simultaneous research into mechanisms and overall effectiveness of CAM treatments. Contemporary methodological standards of medical research can be applied to CAM research, but it might be necessary to adapt the research designs in some areas, in order to account for the complexity of CAM interventions [72]. CAM-specific challenges must be addressed, such as the problem of strict standardization of diverse treatments and study participants leading to lack of external validity. RCTs do not answer all research questions and are expensive to conduct. Placebo-controlled RCTs might be inappropriate for some specific CAM modalities. There is a need for additional methods, for example, pragmatic studies [73], observational studies, mix of qualitative and quantitative studies, and n = 1 studies. In treatment studies, there is on the one hand the tendency to operationalize WMS interventions into a ""treatment package"" that can be used also outside the original WMS context, and on the other hand the critique that some essential aspects (e.g., individualization) or therapy components may become excluded by such operationalization, leading to reduced efficacy and misperceptions of the ""true"" traditional WMS intervention [74]. Outcomes should be broader than symptom reduction alone, they should contain several levels of the whole human being, including physical, mental, spiritual, and social factors [70]. Health economic evaluation of CAM treatments was seen as particularly relevant in modern healthcare. Research into the mechanisms of placebo, context, or meaning effects were also seen as important to determine appropriate control groups and their respective explanatory power, in order to explain potentially contradictory study results and to maximize these effects in clinical practice. Newer evaluation models such as program theory, the theory on ""the mechanisms that mediate between the delivery (and receipt) of the program and the emergence of the outcomes of interest"" [75, 76], encompass a wide range of health-related changes that include process aspects, such as the emergence of new meanings and understanding during or after treatment, as well as longer term changes in health, wellbeing, and health-related competences and behavior [77]. Another proposed model is a ""reversed research strategy"" for assessing CAM, starting with studies of the context, paradigms, philosophical understanding, and utilization, then subsequently the safety status of the whole system, comparative effectiveness of the whole system, and specific efficacy of components, and finally the underlying biological mechanisms [49, 78]. Other, expressly nonhierarchical models include a circular information synthesis of different evidence forms [45, 60] and an ""evidence house"" [79]. 3.3.5. Clinical Practice Aspects. Main topics with regard to WMS practice methods pertain to the development of whole system diagnostics and interventions; the development and application of quality control systems for individualized diagnostics and treatment and the use of multidisciplinary complex interventions [80]; the role of protocols, guidelines, and expert knowledge in clinical practices of a whole system approach [81]; and the use of double (conventional and WMS) diagnoses. A WMS diagnosis is a diagnosis on the level of the individual patient and is system-based. In practices where WMS is integrated with conventional medicine, we therefore find double diagnoses. Diagnostics on the individual and system level often includes pattern recognition methods which require interrelated expert knowledge, intuition, and system thinking skills [82]. In WMS therapy the focus is on the sick patient in his or her whole complexity, including physical, mental, spiritual, and social factors. These are interconnected and need to be addressed in total and on multiple levels. The repertoire of CAM treatment is often multimodal and complex, and its application highly individualized. CAM treatments and counselling are provided as integrative systems with interacting components. Accordingly, the effects of complex approaches are often larger than the sum of the components' effects. WMS therapy aims to support and stimulate autoprotective and salutogenetic potentials (self-healing and self-regulatory abilities), mostly with the active cooperation of the patient or of his/her organism. WMS practices also require a good patient-practitioner interaction (therapeutic relationship) and cocreation of the patient in varying therapeutic contexts [45]. Clinical evaluation includes patient-determined outcomes as well as patient satisfaction [70]; notably, these outcome measures are also becoming increasingly used in evaluation of conventional treatments. 3.3.6. Quality and Clinical Safety of WMPs. Regarding the pharmaceutical quality and clinical safety of WMPs, there is a difference in the historical development of the older and newer WMSs. In the 20th century, homeopathic and anthroposophic MPs have been marketed in European countries such as Austria, France, Germany, and Switzerland as drugs, manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practice standards, and subject to modern drug regulation including pharmacovigilance. Toxicologically relevant starting materials (e.g., aconite and cinnabar) are highly diluted according to safety requirements of European regulations [83]. Adverse reactions to these MPs are infrequent and usually of mild to moderate severity; anaphylactic reactions occur but are very rare [40, 84, 85]. In contrast, MPs from Chinese, Ayurveda, and Unani medicine have historically been produced for local use. In modern times, industrial-scale production has developed with less rigorous quality control, and MPs have been regulated as food or food supplements or have been imported for use without regulation. Some WMPs have been associated with repeated, severe adverse reactions, including liver and kidney toxicity (sometimes fatal) [86-88], heavy metal poisoning [89-93], epileptic seizures [94], and adrenal suppression from undeclared addition of corticosteroids to herbal products [90]. There are further concerns regarding environmental contaminations (e.g., air pollution, soil contaminations), cultivation practices (e.g., pesticides, fungicides, microorganisms, endotoxins), manufacturing procedures (e.g., microorganisms, endotoxins), and inappropriate use [95, 96]. In order to overcome these problems, pharmacovigilance systems have been established in the main producing countries of Chinese, Ayurvedic, and Unani MPs [97, 98], and there are considerable efforts to improve the quality standards for these WMPs [99,100]. 3.4. Mismatches and Aspects Needing Attention 3.4.1. Mismatches. Currently, based on the described differences, there are mismatches between the current scientific empirical (EBM) and theoretical (biomedical model) demands and the properties and specificity of WMSs. We describe these mismatches here by means of the example of WMPs, with the demands and their application in drug regulation on the one hand and WMPs and the inherent properties of WMS on the other hand. The main mismatches are as follows: (1) WMPs are insufficiently tested because they are not in line with conventional interests and biomedical models. (2) WMPs are generally handled as standardized conventional medicinal product (CMP) interventions, whereas they should also be handled as part of a complex intervention. (3) WMPs are handled as CMPs, that is, symptom reducing, fighting disease therapy, whereas they should be handled as a curative, health promotion therapy that supports the self-healing abilities of the organism. (4) WMPs are tested for conventional indications based on group-oriented taxonomy and diagnostics, whereas they should be tested for individualized WMP indications. (5) WMPs are assumed to have specific biochemical effects like CMPs have, but WMP therapy is directed at higher levels, aiming at the regulation and harmonizing (e.g., Dosha balancing in Ayurveda) of overarching, complex physiological processes, and the transformation of physiological and psychological processes and capacities into more mature and integrated states (Schad, 2008; Simon, 2009). (6) WMPs are often judged on efficacy by regulatory authorities as new CMPs, whereas they should also be regarded as part of a traditional WMS with longstanding use, developed following a reverse pathway compared to CMPs (Fonnebo et al., 2007; Kienle et al., 2011). The main consequences of these mismatches are as follows: (1) The dominance of the biomedical model has resulted in an a priori negative image and rejection of WMPs by scientists of conventional biomedicine, whereby, seen from a reductionist, mechanistic position, effects of WMPs are regarded as mere nonspecific, context effects, not worthy of serious scientific scrutiny. (2) As a consequence of this attitude of rejection, there is an underrepresentation of WMS scientists in academic institutions and scarce public funding of academic WMP research. (3) Many WMPs are not tested in clinical research and can therefore not obtain ordinary marketing authorisation. (4) WMPs are most often not tested according to their theoretical higher order, system level effects but are tested in conventional RCTs with a single product approach. Therefore the precision of the tested WMP treatment is decreased, with an increased high risk of ""false-negative results"" (meaning: in reality the treatment has beneficial effects but these are not captured in the research study). (5) WMPs often do not appear in guidelines for treatment of specific conventional indications since many WMPs are not in line with mainstream biomedical theories, are not tested in clinical research, and are not part of the expert knowledge of the developers of conventional treatment guidelines. This development is not restricted to WMPs: there is an increasing call for excluding all WMS modalities from healthcare and for stopping the development of Integrative Medicine, since many WMS interventions are perceived to lack a plausible scientific efficacy model and because relevant results of clinical studies are lacking, for reasons described above. However, as described previously, there are also positive examples of the integration of WMSs and conventional medicine in practice, examples of high-quality evidence of specific effects of WMS treatment for conventional indications, and WMSs theoretical models that appear to be content-wise in line with the systems approach in science and medicine (see Introduction). 3.4.2. Aspects That Need Attention to Promote the Integration of the Conventional Medical System and the WMSs. From this overview of the differences between the conventional medical system and the WMSs, a number of issues can be deduced that should be dealt with in science and clinical and regulatory practice, in order to overcome the differences and facilitate the integration processes of the best of both worlds. (i) Ontological issues (a) Future research and scientific discussion should focus on the nature of reality (matter, organism, mind, ...), the tenability of the nonatomistic holistic position of WMSs within the so-called holism-reductionism debate, and ontological issues to overcome in the integration process. (ii) Conceptual and epistemological issues (a) Future research and scientific discussion should focus on developing and testing theories that are system- and complexity-oriented and that are compatible with both WMS and conventional medicine. (b) Specific theories that conceptually may bridge the two approaches should be further studied: theories of health, disease, healing [101]; individualization in diagnostics and treatment; and health promotion. (iii) Methodological issues (a) Future use of research methodologies/designs should focus on (1) a ""reversed research strategy"" for assessing CAM; (2) taking into account the complexity of CAM interventions and the role of expert knowledge, intuition, and individualization of diagnostics and therapies; (3) the health economic evaluation of CAM treatments; (4) the mechanisms of placebo, context, or meaning effects [102]. (iii) Clinical practice issues (a) Future development and implementation of integrative treatment approaches should take into account (1) alternatives for protocols and guidelines that are in line with the holistic and individualizing treatment approaches; (2) the integrated use of dual diagnoses (from both systems); (3) the integrated use of analytical and system thinking [18]; (4) the optimal integration of ""fighting disease"" and ""health promotion"" treatment options. (iv) Regulatory issues (a) Regulatory frameworks must be modified in order to match the specific features of WMPs. (b) New conceptualizations regarding benefit-risk assessment, research synthesis from different types of evidence (not just RCTs), and the evaluation of WMPs are needed. This in line with the opinion of the EU commission that has acknowledged the need for appropriate regulation also of WMPs [103]. 3.4.3. Lack of Evidence of Specific Treatment Effects and Prescientific or Unscientific Theories. Whereas the main argument of many people from conventional medicine is that integration of WMSs and conventional medicine is unacceptable due to an assumed lack of evidence of specific effects from WMS treatment and because of alleged prescientific or unscientific theories, we here discuss these issues in more detail. Apart from the fact that there are some good quality studies demonstrating specific effects of a single WMS therapy for a conventional indication [104], the described features of WMS approaches demonstrate that WMS therapy most often is aiming at system effects and at restoring balances rather than symptom reduction and often contains different treatments as part of a complex intervention. This situation makes it often difficult to test one single, protocol-based treatment for a conventional indication. If this type of evidence would be mandatory, the precision of the tested treatment would be decreased, with an increased high risk of ""false-negative outcomes"" (meaning: in reality the treatment has beneficial effects but these are not captured in the research study). In addition, it would lead to a feasibility bias against WMSs. This was the reason for the development of the previously described different ""reversed research strategy"" for assessing CAM [49] and the model of nonhierarchical, circular information synthesis of different evidence forms [60]. With regard to the theories, WMSs theories are (nonatomistic) holistic and not reductionistic and therefore often regarded as prescientific or unscientific. However, the current situation is that throughout different fields of research, scientists increasingly question the ability of pure reductionist theories to describe and explain the complexity of biological organizations [51]. Therefore, new theories (e.g., systems biology, emergence, and epigenetics) originating from the research fields of the biological complexity in organisms and the genome project demonstrate a shift from reductionist towards more holistic concepts. [21] To our opinion, based on these shifts in science, more openness and acceptance towards (nonatomistic) holistic theories is warranted. 4. Discussion There is an increasing need for a worldwide professional integration of conventional medicine and traditional/complementary whole medical systems. However, in many Western countries, the integration is perceived by conventional medicine as problematic and not acceptable. We therefore reviewed the literature on the features of WMSs, the similarities and differences between conventional medicine and WMSs, and future scientific and clinical practice issues that should be dealt with in order to promote the integration process. Key factors for the integration of WMSs and conventional medicine are as follows: legal and regulatory frameworks for therapy providers and WMPs; quality standards for the training of therapy providers, the delivery of treatment, and the pharmaceutical quality of WMPs; high-quality scientific research on the safety and efficacy of WMS interventions; and adequate infrastructure and financial resources in order to carry out these tasks. For scientific research and quality benchmarking, there are fundamental issues pertaining to the inherent properties of WMSs: ontological, epistemological, and methodological issues relevant to the overall understanding and assessment and issues relevant to diagnostics, therapy delivery, and outcome assessment in clinical practice. Many of these issues are as yet unresolved, with contradictory positions among scientists and stakeholders of conventional biomedicine and WMSs, respectively, and with mismatches for resource allocation and drug regulation. The main contribution of this article is that it will provide (more) overview and clarity on this topic for both WMSs and conventional medicine. It will give objective input for rational discussions on the integration topic. In addition, it will support organizations in their preparation and decision-making during the integration process. A limitation of the article is that we did not include all WMSs, for example, Yoga medicine, osteopathy, Campo, or WMSs from Africa or South America. Also we did not employ all possible search terms, for example, Ayurvedic (in addition to Ayurveda). A topic that is beyond the scope of this article is that we did not discuss the (supposed) lack of evidence on specific effects of WMS treatments and the (supposed) lack of tested theories of WMSs [15] in depth. However, we described the fundamental (ontological, epistemological, and methodological) underlying differences between WMSs and conventional medicine that are related to these issues (evidence of specific effects and lack of tested theories) and made clear why both sides have different perceptions on these issues. Future research activities not only should be directed at the ""forefront issues"" of quality assurance and generating the necessary data on safety and efficacy/effectiveness of WMS interventions but also should address the more fundamental (ontological, epistemological, and methodological) issues, in order to overcome the differences between WMSs and conventional medicine. https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/4904930 Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.

Record the time taken, to the nearest hour, to complete the quiz and any associated research. Introduction Interest in complementary medicine (CM) has increased in the past decade, in parallel with the public's demand for more autonomy and involvement in healthcare, plus the desire to optimise health and prevent illness (1). This continuing education quiz is the first of a two-part series and covers the broader principles of CM. It has been estimated that 50% of the Australian population use at least one non-medically prescribed complementary medicine, and 20% visit a practitioner of CM annually (2). In Australia, complementary therapies are now being prescribed in around 15% of all mainstream general practice consultations (2). Despite moves to support complementary therapies, in practice it seems that there are two distinct healthcare systems in Australia operating in parallel and without much interaction. It is estimated that of the patients who go to complementary practitioners, over 50% do not inform their doctor they are doing so (3). Even if you do not particularly advocate CM this continuing education quiz provides dietitians with basic information on CM including the place of complementary medicine in the Australian health system. The second part of the quiz in the next issue will concentrate on the current legislation designed to maximise the appropriateness and safety of CM use, and how CM may be used to optimise the nutrition management of your patients. Those dietitians working in private practice, as well as in the hospital sector, will find the information valuable in these quizzes and particularly useful references for further reading. 1.

Complementary Medicine Evaluation Committee http://www.tga.gov.au/cm/cm.htm c. Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database www.naturaldatabase.com/default.asp d. Australian College and Nutritional and Environmental Medicine http://www.acnem.org/ e. all of the above Answers 1. d. Complementary medicine (CM), alternative, unorthodox or unconventional medicine generally refers to the use of interventions that complement the use of drugs and surgery. In Australia, the key types of CMs include herbal medicines, nutritional medicines, naturopathic medicines, naturopathic medicines, traditional Chinese medicines (TCM), homoeopathic medicines and acupuncture. The range of complementary therapies includes treatments based on philosophies, manual techniques, medicinal systems, mind-body techniques and bioenergetic principles. These therapies vary widely with respect to levels of efficacy, cost, safety and scientific validation, yet they often share common principles, including the concept of supporting the body's homeostatic systems, as well as acknowledging the role of lifestyle practices, personal creativity, group sharing, the mind-body connection and the role of spiritual practice in health (4). While the range of available therapists is vast, there is a common benchmark for all therapies including conventional and CM, which is 'reducing human suffering' (4). 2. d. It has been estimated that in 2000, 50% of Australians took a non-medically prescribed complementary medicine and about 20% formally saw a complementary medicine practitioner (3). The public spent AUD$2.3 billion on CMs (nearly four times the public contribution to the cost of pharmaceutical medicines) (3) with the Australian government providing no formal budget allocation for research into the area, and there is no subsidy for any CMs via the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). In addition, a goods and services tax is charged on these medications, unlike prescription medicines. Patients who have private health insurance with the appropriate level of cover may receive a selected rebate for CM services provided by an accredited CM practitioner. Suitably accredited medical practitioners can receive a specific Medicare rebate for the practice of acupuncture. However, most doctors offering CM within general practice do not receive a specific rebate for these services. Despite moves to support complementary therapies, in practice it seems that there are two distinct healthcare systems in Australia operating in parallel and without much interaction. It is estimated that of the patients who go to complementary practitioners, over 50% do not inform their doctor they are doing so (3). The lack of communication about complementary medicine is potentially hazardous, as it raises the possibility of adverse treatment interactions (5). 3. d. In Australia, professionally trained practitioners of CM include chiropractors, osteopaths, herbalists, homoeopaths, naturopaths and Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners (4). Professional training is usually a four- to five-year full-time program that incorporates a basis in western medical sciences and clinical medicine as well as extensive CM. Teaching has been in private colleges until the last 10 years, when courses began to be established in universities. Currently about one third of all students in CMs graduate from universities (e.g. Southern Cross University, RMIT, Swinburne University, University of Western Sydney) and two thirds from private colleges (e.g. Southern School of Natural Therapy, Naturecare College, Australasian College of Natural Therapy, Australian College of Natural Medicine). The short four- to six-week introductory courses offered by some of the private colleges are generally not recognised by the professional associations regulating each of the CM practitioners. If you have further questions concerning the training of CM practitioners check with the associations listed on the next page. Also in Australia there are no formal requirements for doctors, or any other conventional medical practitioners, to receive training in the use of CM (1). Therefore doctors tend to formulate their own methods of accessing available evidence. A recent survey showed that 15%-25% of GPs in Victoria use some form of acupuncture, hypnosis and meditation (6). 4. e. The rational use of medicines has recently moved toward 'evidence-based care' and recognises that this relies on the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of the best available evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients (7). An evidence-based approach recognises different levels of evidence and that the most rigorous types are not always available. As such, many clinical questions cannot be answered by reference to well conducted trials and require additional information such as that obtained from experience and historical use (4). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have only been commonly performed since the 1950s and are a complex and costly process that requires large investments of time and money as well as access to specialised infrastructure and technical and clinical skills. These hurdles are often placed at even higher levels for herbs and natural supplements compared to pharmaceutical medicines, as the lack of patent protection for these products means there is little incentive. The lack of evidence for a particular effect may simply mean that the research has not yet been conducted. This may be due to a lack of funding and specialised resources, methodological or logistical constraints and a general lack of opportunity (4). Other limitations includes the application of scientific evidence when assessing the effectiveness of individualised therapy which is generally the focus of CM and the difficulty in provide scientific evidence for measures designed to move people from 'average health' toward 'enhanced' or 'optimal health'. In summary evidence-based 'patient-centred' care, is becoming more widely adopted, the chief principles of which are in unison with the integrative medicine approach to incorporating evidence into clinical practice (4). 5. c. A lipid extract from the New Zealand green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus) has been shown to reduce pain in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, according to a double-blind RCT. Professor Chak Lau of the University of Hong Kong and researchers at the Queen Mary Hospital randomised 80 patients with knee OA to receive either two 50 mg doses of the stabilised lipid extract (commercially known as Lyprinol[R]) or placebo (olive oil) twice daily doses for two months, then half that dosage for the remaining four months of the study. Patients had also been asked to discontinue their NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) therapy and commence 2 g paracetamol daily, with an additional 2 g/day available for break-through pain. Paracetamol use was recorded at regular visits throughout the study, when assessments were made of OA symptoms and drug safety (8). Both groups showed improvement in almost all the OA assessment parameters studied, but there was a greater and statistically significant improvement in the perception of pain as measured by a visual analogue scale, and patients' global assessment of OA, in those who took Lyprinol[R] following adjustment for paracetamol use (8). Previous (in-vitro) studies have shown that the extract exhibits its anti-inflammatory effects through inhibition of the synthesis of inflammatory leukotrienes and possibly some prostaglandins. As with previous trials on green-lipped mussel extract, the beneficial effects were apparent four weeks after commencement of treatment. Lyprinol[R] was also found to be well tolerated, with no significant differences in the overall incidence of adverse reactions, or dropout as a result of drug toxicity. The researchers concluded the lack of upper GI toxicity may be an advantage over NSAIDs and although no such comparison was made in this study, it should be considered in future studies (8). 6. e.

In the past few years interest has skyrocketed in unconventional treatments designed to help manage chronic medical conditions; cut back on drug use and surgeries; and strengthen the mind, body, spirit connection. Considering the multi-faceted benefits associated with what experts now term integrative therapies (i.e., an alternative-complementary combo), these health care tools appear to be tailor-made for our elderly population. From sick care for acute physical ailments to well care enhancing stability, mobility, and proper body mechanics, chiropractic promotes autonomy. Select herbal medications are safe and effective treatments for osteoarthritis. (1) T'ai chi, an ancient Chinese martial art akin to slow-motion kung fu, improves balance and coordination, lessening the likelihood of falls. (2) (See ""A hearty menu of healthy choices,"" below left, for a general breakdown of CAM options.) Despite the potential of CAM to improve seniors' overall well-being, these practices remain largely unattainable to long term care residents. How important are integrative therapies for facilities? Why are services such as chiropractic and acupuncture scarce within these settings? How might the tables be turned? Answers to these and related questions follow. Healing alternatives According to Faith T. Hemsey, DC, a practicing physician in Little Falls, NJ., while chiropractic has become widely accepted into mainstream medicine, it remains obscure for the average long term care resident. 'Seniors have shoulder, hip, knee, and back problems. Many have difficulty getting out of bed or have such stiffness in the spine and extremities that walking unassisted is difficult,"" she says. ""They sit for long periods of time, increasing loss of muscle tone and decreasing flexibility of the joints."" She adds: ""Chiropractic care not only increases range of motion of the spine and reduces pain but also offers hands-on therapy via rehabilitative care that in-house exercise classes can't provide."" Robert Decker, LAC, a licensed acupuncturist with Mind, Body, Spirit Clinic, a complementary-medicine clinic affiliate of Fairview University Systems in the Twin Cities, Minneapolis, believes acupuncture can offer remedies for an assortment of conditions common among the elderly (see ""Common conditions amenable to acupuncture,"" page 23). Among his regular clients are patients at Redeemer Residence, a 147-bed skilled nursing facility in Minneapolis. ""Whether I'm treating post-stroke or osteoarthritis pain, managing anxiety, depression, or insomnia, residents and staff there respond positively to my services."" And like other CAM, he emphasizes, acupuncture offers the opportunity for reduced drug use. Massage therapies are ideal for long term care, asserts Charlotte Eliopoulos, RNC, MPH, PhD, a specialist in holistic and long term chronic care, in Glen Arm, Md. Therapeutic massage stimulates circulation, relieves stress, and relaxes the body physically and emotionally, she says. ""Simple comfort measures such as back rubs and foot and hand massage allow nurses to connect with residents in a more holistic fashion while helping to curtail resident complaints and attention-getting behaviors."" Mary E. Lindenmuth, RNC, director of nursing at Levindale Hebrew Geriatric Center and Hospital, a 288-bed nursing home hospital facility in Baltimore, Md., says residents at her facility look forward to treatments such as massage therapy, aroma therapy, and music therapy. 'These activities have a particularly potent stress-reducing effect on dementia patients,"" she says, ""and can improve the effectiveness of medications."" The laying on of hands Long term care facilities are just beginning to recognize the healing properties of reiki, reports Michael William Smith, a reiki master who teaches this practice to health care facilities around the Baltimore area. Reiki involves a practitioner holding his or her hands over parts of a patient's body to release and channel energy, ""which helps treat physical, mental, and emotional disease,"" says Smith. Smith recalls a particularly successful reilti encounter with an Alzheimer's patient during a visit to a nursing home in Maryland: ""Nurses asked me to comfort an agitated woman who was hearing voices foreboding her impending death. She wouldn't eat and had isolated herself in a comer, refusing care."" After just one session, he says, ""she calmed down, ordered lunch, and let a nurse fix her hair."" T'ai chi is another practice showing great potential for older adults. According to Robert Levine, director of the Balance Institute (a Baltimore training facility for PTs, OTs, and CRTs), ""This martial arts activity, based on softness and balance rather than strength, speed, and endurance, teaches people how to maintain balance, observe what's going on around them, and avoid impending danger."" Because t'ai chi takes years to master, Levine developed PsychoPhysical Balance Therapy (PPBTh therapeutic skills based on t'ai chi principles that can be taught in a weekend workshop. He then collaborated with Keswick Multi-Care Center (a CCRC) and Sheppard-Pratt Hospital Center (both in Baltimore) on a yearlong research project to demonstrate (1) health professionals with no t'ai chi expertise can learn and apply PPBT effectively, and (2) PPBT is a potent restorative activity for people with equilibrium difficulties. Results were positive on both fronts. ""Participants from Keswick increased their ability to be mobile, stay mobile, and know when they were losing balance and likely to fall. Some residents also reported increased relaxation and ease in falling asleep without medication."" Use of herbal remedies has increased by as much as 380 percent since 1990. (3) ""Typically, these therapies are much less costly than prescription drugs and trigger fewer side effects,"" notes Eliopoulos. ""A few facilities are starting to stock herbs and homeopathic remedies in their pharmacies and to develop formulary systems for them."" Residents of The Paims of Largo, a 96-acre, intergenerational CCRC campus in Largo, Fla., benefit from a mixed bag of alternative therapies, notes John Goodman, chairman of The Goodman Group (Chaska, Minn.), builder of this and other multifamily and health care facilities for seniors and children. Besides regular therapies such as chiropractic, massage therapy, meditation, yoga, and t'ai chi, Goodman says seniors at The Palms experience remarkable health benefits from reflexology and watsu (a warm-water therapy designed to improve range-of-motion and energy levels). Stumbling blocks Insufficient Medicare reimbursement remains the biggest obstacle preventing increased integration of CAM into long term care, according to experts. Time limitations and fear of the unknown are among other stumbling blocks noted. Hemsey notes the current fee structure for chiropractic discourages colleagues from servicing long term care organizations. ""Medicare pays chiropractors for only a set number of spinal manipulations per patient and offers no reimbursement for exams, spinal x-rays, and the time needed for 'rehab,'"" she explains. For now, she adds, only chiropractors and physical therapists who work under the guidance of a corporation headed up by a medical doctor receive fair-rate reimbursement. According to Mary Jo Kreitzer, PhD, RN, director of the Center for Spirituality and Healing, Academic Health Center, at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, future reimbursement for alternative therapies hinges on upcoming scientific evidence. ""As researchers continue to announce the safety and efficacy of certain therapies, more third-party payers will be inclined to reimburse for them."" Some long term care personnel note lack of time as a common impediment to progress, says Eliopoulos. ""Many integrative therapies can be offered along with basic nursing care, however."" She suggests initiating therapeutic stretches while walking with residents. ""Music- and aromatherapy require little more than getting residents comfortable in a quiet area and pushing a button or lighting a match,"" she adds. ""There's a definite gray area where specific CAM guidelines are concerned,"" Eliopoulos asserts. ""Which activities can staff conduct on their own and which require contractual agreements with outside practitioners? How do facilities ensure they're developing the right policies and procedures? What risks are associated with individual therapies?"" For instance, according to the literature, acupuncture can cause weakness and dizziness, increasing risk for falls. Massage can induce an anticoagulant effect, and its tendency to increase the flow of body fluids can enhance the flow of toxins, placing added stress on the liver and kidneys. Certain herbal remedies are associated with adverse effects, too.(4) Researchers believe some 3 million Americans age 65 and older are at risk for potential drug/herb interactions.(3) ""We must view integrative therapies as consultative therapies,"" Eliopoulos advises. ""Call state health departments to learn what to do to guarantee resident safety."" She reminds readers the licensure requirements for certain practitioners, such as massage therapists and acupuncturists, vary from state to state. Not just a 'blip' ""With proper nutrition and the right mix of alternative therapies, people are growing younger and enjoying their lives more than ever before,"" Goodman contends. He believes the key is to keep introducing new health care techniques into the communities and combining customary and unconventional medicine. ""When you look closely at the needs of long term care residents, it's evident these facilities can't afford not to incorporate integrative therapies into standard protocols of care,"" Eliopoulos asserts. ""CAM helps our elderly manage the overwhelming stress associated with chronic illness and living in an institutional setting. It also brings out the healer instinct in personnel,"" she says, ""many of whom get excited about assuming responsibility beyond traditional physical tasks and following doctors' orders. Implementing CAM spells better staff recruitment and retention, and improved health for all involved."" If life-altering initiatives such as t'ai chi enable even a few residents to stand with confidence, take baths without assistance, or walk to the lunchroom alone, then the money spent for staff training is money well spent, says Levine. Kreitzer feels alternative medicine is much more than just ""a blip on the screen. It's here to stay,"" she says. ""Our country, therefore, needs to produce graduates more attentive to holistic care."" Her university, in fact, has received a $1.6 million, 5-year grant from the National Institutes of Health to integrate content on complementary, cross-cultural, and spiritual care into the curriculum for the medical school, college of pharmacy, and school of nursing. Fortunately, says Kreitzer, ""our country's health care system is shifting from managed care to personal medical savings accounts, which will give consumers the freedom to spend a portion of their health care dollars on complementary approaches to healing, if they choose. I'm hopeful this realignment in the system will be a step in the right direction for our elderly."" References (1.) Long L., Soeken K, Ernst E.

RELATED ARTICLE: A hearty menu of healthy choices The term complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) was developed by the National Institutes of Health to represent a wide range of healing philosophies and therapies generally not taught in medical schools, not administered in hospitals, and not reimbursed by insurance. Some therapies are considered holistic. Many also are considered preventive medicine. According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, CAM practices can be grouped within five major domains: Alternative medical systems These therapies include complete systems of theory and practice that have evolved independent of conventional biomedical approaches. They include acupuncture, herbal medicines, and t'ai chi. Mind-body interventions These techniques help the mind influence bodily function and symptoms; however, only a subset of these interventions (such as meditation, music and art therapy, certain uses of hypnosis) are considered CAM. Biological-based therapies This category includes natural and biologically based interventions and products. Many overlap with conventional medicine's use of dietary supplements. They include herbal and orthomolecular therapies. Manipulative and body-based methods These therapies include methods based on manipulation of the body. Chiropractors, for instance, focus on the relationship between structure and function and how that relationship preserves and restores health. Massage therapy manipulates soft tissues of the body for increased health. Energy therapies These therapies focus on energy fields from within the body or external sources. Examples of the former category include reiki and therapeutic touch. The latter category involves the use of electromagnetic fields to manage pain and treat certain conditions.

This post focuses on the holistic therapies that claim that they can cure the dreaded disease.  Also Read - Brain cancer could be triggered by the healing process that follows a stroke or other brain injury: Study The in Kerala is situated on the lap of nature, atop a cliff that slopes down to the breathtaking Varkala beach. Explains Dr K R Jayakumar, physician in-charge, ‘Cancer is a degenerative disease. Accumulation of toxins through carcinogenic food like fast food, colas, habits like smoking, drinking, paan chewing, stressful lifestyle, toxic medicines and environmental pollution, lowers immunity, causing cancer.’ Naturopathy considers cancer as a systemic disease. Cancer can develop if lesser diseases are suppressed through chemical medicines. Dr Jayakumar says, ‘The human body has the healing power within itself to cure all diseases if congenial conditions are created.’ Naturopathy heals through harmony with nature to attain equilibrium at physical, mental, moral and spiritual levels. Also Read - Cellular 'death by iron' could be a new promising avenue of cancer treatment Diet is crucial in naturopathy. Treatment duration depends on the disease condition. Initially, hospitalisation is required. After discharge, the prescribed diet and lifestyle patterns must be maintained for life. Dr Jayakumar advises cancer patients, ‘If you have any bad habits, quit those with immediate effect, and try to lead a simple sattvic life.’ Also Read - Small delays in cancer treatment can up death risk by 10%, says study Dr Jayakumar has treated several breast cancer cases. College lecturer Asa Babu came after breast removal and chemotherapy. During the difficult chemotherapy, she drank juices of tender coconut, vegetables and amla regularly. Within three weeks, her reduced blood count increased. ‘After three months I was admitted for three weeks at the naturopathy hospital. I had hip bath, spinal bath, mud therapy, yoga and meditation for purification. I fasted for four days by drinking water only. Later, I ate vegetables and no cereals. My weight reduced by seven kilos. My chronic pain and bulge in the lumbar disc disappeared. After one year, I repeated naturopathic treatment for 10 days. I still do yoga and meditation. I developed mental power and confidence. I am now free from all cancer treatment and medicines,’ she describes. Her cancer has not recurred. Another breast cancer patient who had surgery has managed without allopathic treatment for the last six years through naturopathy. Dr Jayakumar’s colleague’s father had cancer of the small intestine. Since 25 years, he has survived without medicines, through naturopathy. The All India Nature Cure Federation, New Delhi, headed by Dr Brij Bhushan Goel provides free cancer consultation. Mrs Dugar, 39, had colo-rectal cancer. She avoided surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. For five years, she has led a normal life with Dr Goel’s naturopathic treatment and some Ayurvedic medicines. German naturopath, Dr Max Gerson, created Gerson therapy, which prescribes fresh organic fruits, vegetables and whole grains along with 13 glasses of fresh fruit juice daily. Coffee or chamomile enemas are used regularly for detoxification. In homoeopathic theory, miasms sycosis, syphilis and psora are responsible for chronic diseases. Miasm imbalance is triggered by harmful lifestyle. Kerala-based homoeo-path, Dr Girisanker, feels that it is best to prevent cancer by way of a healthy diet and lifestyle. Research shows that smoking (30 per cent) and improper diet (30 per cent) cause maximum cancer cases. One should avoid smoking, liquor, fried and processed foods, maida, vanaspati, dairy products and non-vegetarian food. ‘There are rays of hope for cancer therapy in homoeopathy. In homoeopathic cancer treatment, a patient’s mental characteristics like desire, aversion, attitude, behaviour, physical conditions and food habits are all taken into account within the context of a genetic and constitutional approach to enhance bodily immunity to heal the disease. The focus is not on disease, but on the patient as a whole. Homoeopathy cures cancer the holistic way through restoring the vital force. It is safe, simple and inexpensive,’ Dr Girisanker explains. Homoeopathy has three treatment modes: medicinal treatment, managemental treatment, and palliative treatment for acute cases. Homoeopathy can reduce the damages caused by chemotherapy and radiation. Dr Girisanker asserts that patients who try homoeopathy without allopathic treatment can be completely cured. Homoeopathic medicines will prevent recurrence. The fully developed vital force will heal cancer by stimulating the suppressor genes that weaken the cancer-causing oncogenes. A healthy lifestyle must be maintained life-long. Dr Girisanker is treating Sofiya Beevi, 58, who had intestinal cancer. She tried only homoeopathy. She is now 95 per cent cured, and has avoided surgery. She could be substantially cured since she did not undergo toxic modern methods. US National Institute of Health (NIH) and Cancer Advisory Panel for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAPCAM) have recognised the homoeopathic treatment protocol of Kolkata-based Dr Prasanta Banerji and his son Pradip. They cured 70 per cent of brain tumour cases treated. Using basic medicine formulae like cali carbonium and ruta graviolins used in common cold, they created successful protocols for brain tumours. They also treat lung, liver and breast cancers. ‘My medicines can’t kill you. Theirs can,’ Dr Pradip Banerji once told a medical website. Siddha is the world’s oldest medical system mainly practised in South India. Medicines include herbal, metal and mineral preparations. According to Dr Stanley Jones, the seniormost medical officer in Kerala, working in the Government Siddha Hospital, siddha classifies cancer into 24 types according to the area affected. Primarily, it is caused due to the derangement of pitta and kapha. Unlimited increase in pitta and kapha imbalances vata too, leading to cancer.  Eating food with excess of pungent and bitter tastes; contaminated food; eating incompatible non-vegetarian food; food containing hair, bones, mud, soil, stones, thorns.  Tobacco chewing, smoking; suppression of 14 natural urges like yawning, sneezing, cough, etc. Cancer occurring as secondary to the following diseases: Cirrhosis of liver; chronic peptic ulcer; constant irritation due to piles and fistula; trauma; cyst or abscess; ill-treated diseases in genital organs can cause cancer. ‘There are many effective internal and external medicines, as well as various treatments based on ancient methods available in Siddha, which are free from side-effects. That is why Siddha cancer treatment is superior to conventional methods,’ says Dr Jones. Dr Jones recalls one of his successful cases of cancer cure. Mrs Sundarameena, 43, from Tamil Nadu, had malignant uterine cancer. Foul odour ceased by the fourth day of Siddha treatment. Bleeding fully stopped by the second week. By the second month, 65 per cent of the growth was reduced. All symptoms and difficulties stopped and complete cure was attained by the fourth month. Now Mrs Sundarameena leads a cancerfree life. Leukemia in young patients is curable with Siddha at the initial stages. Medication builds up bone marrow tissues and normalises haemoglobin. Siddha is successful for brain tumours too. Delhi-based Ramneek Wig, author of Win Over Cancer, underlines the importance of positivity, faith, hope and self-belief in cancer healing. In 1998, he had Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. He underwent chemotherapy, but had a relapse. He got a bone marrow transplant from the US in 2000. Fearing he would not survive another recurrence and allopathic treatment, he tried holistic smethods. He took yoga classes in South Delhi. He did shavasana and pranayama, including deep abdominal breathing, yogic breath, anuloma-viloma, and kapalabhati. ‘Positive attitude is the key to victory. The words ‘I believe in victory’ gave me immense strength and courage. I did not entertain negative thoughts. I was full of hope and enthusiasm. I constantly reminded myself that with God’s help, I would ‘win over cancer,’’ Wig says. Currently, he is perfectly healthy. His message to cancer patients: ‘Never lose hope whatsoever the odds might be. Never sympathise with yourself. Stop cribbing about your problems. Face them boldly, with strength and courage. With faith in God and in yourself, you will emerge as a winner.Yoga and breathing exercises will give you inner joy and peace.’ His book,  details the positive thinking techniques, holistic methods and yoga techniques he applied to overcome cancer. He conducts counselling and self-help workshops. Dr S P Kaushal established the Sino-Vedic Research Centre, New Delhi, to treat cancer through Indian and Chinese herbal medicines. He has identified about 450 anti-cancer herbs. Aloe vera, hoxsey and essiac are well-known herbs. His books, Fight Cancer With Herbs, and Cancer and Herbs, have gained worldwide acclaim. According to him, carcinogenic and nutritionally deficient diet, chronic stress and radiation from technological devices, are major cancer causes. Chinese doctors use Fu Zen therapy to treat cancer. A Fu Zen formulation that contains six herbs strengthens the immune system to defend against cancer. The Chinese have used Panax Ginseng for 2000 years, which inhibits cancerous growth by inhibiting DNA synthesis. A team of doctors led by Dr Kaushal has been exploring and developing herbal medicines to treat cancer since 1985. Herbal formulations prepared in his centre boost immunity by producing bodily biochemical agents that fight cancer. These herbs destroy the cancer cells without harming normal cells. There have been many instances of cancer being cured through spiritual healing and prayer. Modern medicine usually dismisses these cures as ‘spontaneous remission,’ a term used to denote healing unexplainable by modern scientific dogma. Cynthia Sue Larson, aura healer and member of the Intuition Network that promotes intuitive and spiritual resources, witnessed her grandmother’s terminal liver cancer being cured by prayer. Larson writes, ‘While her own prayers were simply for courage, other people (myself included) were praying for her return to good health. Within a few months, my grandmother’s doctors were astonished to find that her cancer was stabilising. Several months after that, they were completely at a loss to explain why they could no longer find any trace of cancer in her body!’ Some studies show that cancer is linked to a personality style that lives up to the standards of others or social opinion, instead of being true to one’s innermost authentic Divine Self. Developing a spiritual purpose in life helps to manifest a protective effect by drawing divine healing energies through sacred communion with the living earth, the universe and the omnipresent Spirit.

But holistic therapists point out that due to little awareness about natural therapies, many cancer patients consult them at acute stages after toxic conventional treatments. Such patients can mostly be provided palliative care to reduce the adverse effects rather than cure because the severe toxicity makes it difficult to restore immunity completely. It is best to have holistic alternative treatment alone to effect cure according to most alternative therapists. However, those who start holistic treatment at the earliest have great chances of cancer cure and survival even after initial conventional treatment.Cancer does not mean a death sentence.

dc17310c-8cec-4c6d-bd8f-648d0167a12b,"Readers explain why more and more people are turning to 'alternative' medicine In a recent EXPLORE! feature, Unhealthy Options, we examined the controversy over what is known as alternative medicine--treatments such as chiropractic manipulation, acupuncture, homeopathy, megavitamins, herbal therapy and others. A rush of studies to determine if these treatments are indeed effective or merely hype has produced mixed results--some work, some of the time--and yet that hasn't dampened their popularity. Although many in the traditional medical community continue to debunk these treatments, the public clearly doesn't agree. Instead most have embraced alternative medicine as part of their personal health care regimen. A study in the indicated that Americans now visit alternative care providers nearly twice as often as traditional physicians, and the numbers are growing. In 1997, Americans spent an astounding $27 billion on visits to alternative practitioners, an increase of 45 percent over 1990. Sales of megavitamins alone rose from $0.9 billion in 1990 to $3.3 billion in 1997. And most of that money was not reimbursed by medical plans. So why, we asked readers, is the public turning away from the family doctor to dabble in the untested (officially, at least)? The flood of responses we received came from those who swear by various alternatives and from skeptics, physicians and patients, from around the world. The responses are intriguing. The answer, it seems, it that people are alienated from an increasingly impersonal health care system. Traditional medicine is seen as expensive, impersonal and, in the end, not all that effective at promoting health, but rather at treating illness. On the other hand, alternative therapists are viewed as attentive, responsive and willing to give the patient a role in the treatment and its outcome. The common thread is that we are seeking long-term health, not quick-fix cures; prevention, not pills; and, most of all, care. And we are willing to chance the outcome and pay the cost from our own pockets. Even the best bedside manner is no substitute for none, and so the old adage stands: ""An apple a day keeps the doctor away."" Here is a selection of the letters: Health care is a misnomer. We go to physicians for care of an illness, not for health. Therefore health care consumers are on their own to manage their health the best way they can. They have to maneuver through a system that is bewildering and confusing. In addition, insurance policies do not cover preventative care. There are several factors that deter people from using a physician for health care. The high cost of a visit, the difficulty of getting an appointment and the time spent waiting for that appointment are reason enough to seek alternative therapies. Health care consumers must have some medical knowledge to steer clear of the pitfalls and unscrupulous individuals that would take advantage of them. Finally, consumers have to sift through the claims of miracle cures and ultimately experiment on their bodies with compounds that have not been tested or standardized for dosage. It is only a matter of time before an over-the-counter ""herb"" is found to be harmful instead of helpful. The problem is the health care system. The methods of health care that have flourished are not necessarily the best, but the most profitable. This mindset won't change until we shift the emphasis of illness care to health, and value preventative medicine. Then some of these alternative therapies, which are actually preventative measures, will be included in our health care system.. There are two reasons why Americans are turning to ""alternative"" methods. The first regards the price of healthcare. Many people don't have the money or the healthcare plan to pay for expensive methods, so they turn to cheaper alternatives. The second reason is the fear many have of going to doctor's offices. Because of that fear, they want to try less painful remedies. I am not saying that alternative methods are effective or not, but until they are proven ineffective, many will try them. World War II showed the American public that science and technology can win wars and solve problems. That same wartime energy was directed at postwar consumerism, promising great wealth, luxury and fantastic solutions to health problems. Yet we have now had a generation grow up in the world of promises, and they all seem to have fallen flat on their faces. Technological achievements are great, but they create massive unemployment, encourage greater income gaps and increase pollution many fold. Medical drug advances are astounding in their ability to work on the human body, yet new diseases appear every day; drug-resistant microbes abound; and fears of a technology-driven plague have arisen. Americans put a man on the Moon, but now can barely return to space. Doctors used to extol the virtues of cigarette smoking, yet now cancers associated with smoke and other pollutants abound. Basically, the public has been promised everything and let down repeatedly. The scientific community is no longer trusted, due to the arrogance of the scientists just after the war (they KNEW they could solve the world's problems, with a little work) and the public's lack of understanding of how science is done (pursuing research into dead-ends, working towards unknown goals because principles are not yet understood.). The return to holistic/alternative medicines is an attempt by many to rid themselves of the ""deceivers,"" perhaps even to return to a simpler age. In part, they are right--drug companies drive research for profit and care little if the drug works (other than limiting law-suit level side effects) as promised. At the same time, snake-oil salesman abound and turn many a buck from the unsuspecting health consumer. The solution is, of course, a return trust to the medical profession, as long as they operate with open-mindedness towards new therapies, and an acceptance by the public that unbiased studies do show some of the public's beloved alternative treatments are placebos at best, and deadly at worst. I have no idea how that may be achieved, other than having the medical profession start serious clinical trials on a wide range of these alternative therapies. And this may have to be done with public funding, because anything funded by a pharmaceutical company is almost guaranteed to be suspect! Alternative therapies are better than conventional medicine for reaching a real improvement in health. The conventional therapies have failed to do that--even with the tremendous costs for prescriptions and laboratory analysis. After years of taking a lot of antibiotics (that cost a lot of money), I gave up on ""official"" medicine. The example you refer to in the article is an exception. So-called alternative medicine is cheaper, works and doesn't harm our health. It appears that the general public is turning to alternative medicine to find resolutions to issues that traditional medicine has failed to address--primarily preventive medicine. For too long the conventional medical wisdom promulgated in American medical schools was to address the alleviation of disease, not the prevention thereof. With alternative medicine presenting a more balanced approach to both prevention and alleviation, it is intuitively appealing to many people. The medical community is now learning from the masses how to approach healthcare in a more balanced and rational manner. This is, of course, not to mention that there is big money in prevention. More and more people are turning to alternative medicine because the established medical community--in concert with pharmaceutical and insurance companies--cares less about patient health and more about their own profitability. The problem is easily summed up by ""Show me the money."" In a word, greed. It is a rare thing in my experience to find a doctor that is more concerned about my health than his own bank account. That causes me to lose confidence and trust in their motives and their abilities. Therefore, I look to other sources. What have I got to lose? The debate is more than ""my substance is better than yours."" The efficacy of the therapeutic relationship comes into play as well. Some people seem to feel better as a result of the therapeutic relationships they have with non-medical practitioners. The work of Leonard Syme [University of California, Berkeley] and Michael Marmot [University College London] indicates that poor health is often associated with low status. Perhaps it follows that therapeutic relationships that reduce stress and elevate status are sought out wherever they are available. It shouldn't be too difficult to research the nature of successful therapeutic relationships, especially if stress reduction is one of the important features. If the nature of the therapeutic relationship is a factor, what are the key elements? Length of consultation? Genuine communication? Feeling cared for? I submit that research into the efficacy of therapeutic relationships is as least as important as research into the efficacy of drugs. I live in Atlanta, Georgia, which, if I'm not mistaken, is home of the nation's--if not the world's--leading school for chiropractic therapy. A good friend of mine is a student there, and part of the graduation requirements is spending a certain number of hours in a clinic seeing a certain number of patients. So I thought I'd help her out a bit and be one of her patients, receiving treatment every other week or so. I started going over a year ago and, let me tell you, regular adjustments are the best thing that has happened to me from a health standpoint. I would go into the school's clinic if I had a headache. Instead of having to buy expensive over-the-counter drugs, a quick adjustment and I'm on my way, sometimes with immediate results. She's helped me relieve sinus congestion in a mere few hours, improved my posture, suggested certain workouts and stretches considering particular bone or joint ailments that she may be treating at the time, and, personally, it's the most relaxing part of my week. Since my adjustments, I have felt the best I have ever felt physically. I don't get sick nearly as often as I used to, my joints and muscles feel terrific and I feel energized. Of course, as with anything, results will probably vary, and some people are extremely squeamish about getting their spine ""cracked,"" as was I. But for me, at least, at my present state of wellbeing, it's been worth it and I highly recommend it. First, do not call it ""alternative"" medicine. This name suggests a choice between two identical possibilities that will give the same outcome. On the other hand, the term ""complementary"" suggests a extra choice that can be used in addition to what is already available. Unfortunately, the ""pill for every ill"" promise of recent years, makes people have very high expectations of modern medicine. When it fails them, they frantically search for something else that will help. Usually this option doesn't help either, especially if the disease is chronic or severe, but it gives them a sense of being in control of their own lives. If people want to try out ""complements"" to modern medicine (itself rigorously tested for efficacy and safety), then worst case, it will probably only hurt their pockets. But don't expect it to be more than psychological help. Herbal medicine is a partial exception, of course, because many drugs are the active ingredients of plants--willow (aspirin), foxgloves (digitalis) and yew (taxol); they are the foundation of modern pharmacology. However, I would rather take a purified, defined amount of these ""herbs"" without all of the other toxic ingredients that are present in crude whole extracts. A visit to the site www.quackwatch.com is for anyone thinking of parting with hard-earned money to try a complementary therapy. The article on alternative medicine was interesting in presenting both sides. One thing to remember is that Modern Medicine came from some of these age-old practices. Some have better results than modern medical treatments. When I was a boy, my mother would make me an herbal tea out of the book . It would break a fever in about an hour and make me rest. I treat my self mostly naturally now. But I also get checked by a regular physician. I firmly believe that both systems should be integrated. They both have a lot to offer each other. The minute you start to ignore possibilities is when you start to become extinct. There are always possibilities and potentials in alternate thinking. I am a member of the medical profession who practiced General Medicine, which we called general practice (1943-1983). I used all medical approaches available, as well as acupuncture and hypnotism in selected cases with very gratifying results, both for me and my patients. I also used herbal medications in selective cases, again with gratifying results. Unfortunately there are many in our profession who feel that American Medicine is the best (and only) in the world and scoff at those who dare to venture outside the mainstream of medicine. I made four trips to the orient--mainly China to study acupuncture and herbal medicine--and I can appreciate why these methods have survived for thousands of years. I say that alternative medicine methods have a definite place in the armamentarium of the modern physician. I believe people are turning back to traditional therapies, such as herbal medicine, homeopathy, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and many manipulative therapies, for a number of reasons. The medical doctor quite often these days appears to be a peddler of prescribed drugs from the drug companies. How often does one leave a doctors office without a prescription of one kind or another? Of course these drugs can serve us when used in the correct way, but quite often it is just to free us of a possible discomfort of the body, which given time and rest would right itself. Very little advice is given on how to care for our bodies; it is quite often reactive treatment after the disease process is well underway. This then possibly leads to surgery. Even though I have to pay upfront for my healthcare with alternative therapies, I generally walk away feeling empowered in my life, that I am in charge of my own wellness and that the practitioner is my support. Doctors in Australia quite often call herbal medicine quackery, and argue that it can kill. Yes there can be that minimal danger. Yet if you look at the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 12,000 people died in 1997 in public hospitals for drug-related reasons. Fear tactics should not be what motivates us to look at healthcare, but rather the general well-being of the public. This calls for great introspection to see truly if openness of mind is a quality the medical profession can have. I hope so, because then we can have the benefits of all systems. Alternative therapies do work, if you follow certain guidelines. I was fortunate because I had the privilege to experience first hand the benefits of wellness. First you need to find a licensed professional experienced in alternative practices. I happened to hear of a medical doctor in the area that I lived. I was experiencing a number of ailments--aches and pains, poor digestion, lethargy, post surgical toxicity. I just wanted to have an alternative to mainstream medicine because I knew that it wasn't helping. So at any rate I went through the exam. The whole experience was much different from the usual. Despite the normal setting of a waiting room and exam rooms, the atmosphere was less intimidating. I filled out forms with more in-depth questioning and was then led into the exam room to be given a complete physical. I never had a more complete physical in one setting. Then I was led to another room where the doctor performed electroacupuncture, a non-invasive way to test for toxins and allergies. I received the results immediately, when the assistant then sat down to explain the whole thing to me. I went on a cleansing diet for 11 days to remove toxins and to prepare my body for the next, more fine-tuned testing. I lost some weight and felt somewhat improved. I returned for further testing after taking a series of homeopathic formulations, compounded at the clinic specifically for my allergies. Retesting is recommended once or twice a year depending on symptoms. The doctor's patients swore by it. For many, it was their only hope. People that went to that little clinic in the middle of a small midwestern town came from near and far, and I know because several years after I went to that doctor, I ended up working for her for nearly six years. I learned so much. I met so many wonderful people, some of whom I keep in touch with to this day. Many have passed on and I'll never forget their stories, hopes and prayers for health. It's never too late. Health is a gift from God and we have the power to choose how to live. Eat well, get oxygen, drink pure water and enjoy love and laughter. That's how to stay healthy. Growing up in the poor country Vietnam, my family had no access to western medical doctors. If there were doctors in my town, I doubt my family could have afforded it. Therefore, I grew up relying only on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Not only did TCM help keep me and my family healthy, it cured lots of people who were critically ill. Among them were some patients that were sent home from hospitals to prepare for death, because there was nothing those hospitals could do. It sounds unbelievable to those who have not seen it happen. It is even harder to accept when the Chinese try to explain their TCM theory in terms of Yin and Yang, things which we can't see or feel. I hope that some day research will prove that TCM really works. And in the meanwhile, I will continue to see TCM doctors whenever I get sick. Although alternative medicines should be scrutinized, they should be tried for oneself. I am a Physics undergraduate student at the University of Massachusetts, but I am also a second degree Usui-Gray Reiki Practitioner. I heal people by transferring energy from my hands to people's bodies. From my own experience, I had gone to an allergist for five years to treat my allergies and asthma. After getting years of shots with little or no result, I gave up on it. My own medical doctor assured me that there was no possible way to cure allergies and asthma. Yet for the past two and a half years, I have been practicing Tai-Chi and have noticed a significant improvement in my general health. This, added to my recent acquisition of Reiki skills, has enabled me to live through the past two winters with clear sinuses and almost no asthma attacks. This is compared to traditional medicine, which also offers treatments, but not cures or preventions to colds and flu (I got a mild flu last year one day after I got a flu shot). People are going towards alternative medicine because doctors are capitalists first and healers second. In a word, they are too expensive. Traditional medicine has gotten too expensive for the average person. Pharmaceutical companies charge outrageous prices for medicine. In contrast, if one has the knowledge, he or she is free to pick herbs. And if one practices preventive medicine, they will not get sick. I am a vegetarian, I eat right, breath right (yes, there is a right way) and exercise regularly via Tai Chi and Kung Fu. Living a healthy life leads to healthy body. I believe the reason that people are going to alternative health care providers is threefold. The first reason is that it actually works. As a user of chiropractic care, I can vouch for its effectiveness. I know many others that have visited other ""alternative"" health care providers and feel the same. The second reason is that it is often less expensive than conventional health care. The third, and to my mind the most important, reason is that when you go to an ""alternative"" health care provider, they BELIEVE you when you say you hurt. Conventional doctors are masters at making you think you are a hypochondriac. They don't believe you when you say you hurt or feel ill. If they say you may have a condition or injury, and you are impudent enough to look up information on the subject, they treat you as if you wish to be ill. Conventional doctors want you to sit down, shut up and let them do all the thinking. This is especially true for female patients. My mother, who is chronically ill, went to doctors for many years until she found someone who would believe that she was really in pain. Because there were no visible symptoms, they refused to believe her. They would pat her on the head and send her on her way. (As an interesting side note, the doctor that finally believed her, ordered the tests and discovered her fibromyalgia was female.) It is attitudes like this that make people loath going to a conventional doctor. This is why we are happy to embrace an alternative. I have found that they really want to take care of patients. They don't just want to collect an exorbitant fee. For the lower-financial and independence-loving USA citizens, the cost of much of US medicine is destructive and alarming. A person can travel to a third world country and receive acceptable health care for the cost poorer US citizens can pay--one forth as much. US medicine is for the wealthy US citizen and not the average world citizen. It is little wonder that many US citizens consider alternate health cares and health routes. We have ""Cadillac medicine,"" when many citizens only need to find simple ""Chevy medicine"". The advance of alternative medicine should be a warning that things are not right. Certainly any endeavor that directly impinges upon our continued well-being should undergo periodic investigation. Alternative medicine is being widely embraced because patients find that it works. Not only do they feel better for the attention they receive, they are persuaded by the practitioner's manner that he/she is genuinely focused on their best interests: painless recovery from whatever ill-health is plaguing them. This is not always the case with the harried specialist. In 50 years, perhaps, all of these distinctions will disappear. You will present yourself to any clinic of your choice, run your card through the reader and your entire history from anywhere in the world will be available for a team of varied medical practitioners to plan a schedule of treatments in consultation with you and/or your relatives. Those designated as immediate family will be contacted minutes after you enter the clinic. All clinics will be directly connected to larger facilities, to which the patient will be transferred if, and only when, it becomes absolutely necessary. Herbalists, masseurs, acupuncturists, yogis, reflexologists and even shamans from diverse ethnic backgrounds will be as fundamental to healthcare as ear, nose and throat specialists, surgeons and craftsmen who make the most advanced prosthetics. Everyone will be geared to the single goal of the patient's comfort, cure and continued longevity. Whatever works is best. The reason Americans are turning away from traditional medicine is because traditional medicine does not seem to work for them and alternative medicine does. Also, alternative medicine puts so much emphasis on wellbeing--something we materialistic Americans do not really have. Whatever the case, extensive studies should be done to see which kinds of alternative medicine really works and which don't. I began using alternative medicine when I was uninsured and working for a health food grocer. I was introduced to Chinese and western herbs, both of which proved effective. Later, after I got a job that did provide insurance, I found that my very busy doctor prescribed remedies that on several occasions were less effective--and much, much more expensive--than homeopathics. For instance, I had a long-term, severe rash. The hurried doctor ($10 copayment; one-week wait for an appointment) didn't know what caused it, but prescribed a steroid cream. My HMO didn't cover the medication (it was a ""cosmetic"" problem) and a small tube cost $75. It relieved, but did not cure, the rash. When the tube ran out, my doctor renewed the prescription; I went to an herb store instead. There, the resident ""herbalist"" (free, walk-in) prescribed tea tree oil soap ($4) and some kind of anti-inflammatory ointment ($15). She also asked if I had changed my diet, household detergents or cosmetics in past months. I had changed my laundry soap; she recommended I change it back. The rash cleared up within two weeks. The fact is, there are not enough regular doctors to handle the demand; the AMA restricts the number graduating every year. This, besides being immoral and, as my holistic practitioners might say, ""bad karma,"" has pushed many of us into the arms of the numerous alternative doctors available. The effectiveness of their treatments keeps us coming back. Don't get me wrong--I love having access to doctors and hospitals and would do anything to keep my insurance. But until doctors have the time, and patients have the money, to reach modern medicine's vast potential, I'll have to look for alternatives.

Vitamin C plays an important role in the formation of collagen, a protein that gives your skin its elasticity.  Optimizing your skin’s level of vitamin C can help to counteract wrinkle formation by increasing collagen production amounts. Another common skin concern that can be corrected with vitamin C is.  Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant; it can reduce the amount of sunburned cells and reduce age-related damage to cells.  Although vitamin C does not replace sunscreen, it may protect against further sun damage and repair discoloration and fine lines. Topical vitamin C is the best formulation (rather than supplement or food sources) to target signs of aging.  When purchasing vitamin C, look for products that contain between 3%-10% of the active ingredient ascorbic acid or L-ascorbic acid.  Apply topical vitamin C once a day, ideally after exfoliation in the morning.  You can expect to see a noticeable difference in your skin within 4-8 weeks of beginning topical vitamin C.  Maximum benefits are achieved with 6 months of use.

Symptoms of celiac disease can vary greatly amongst individuals.  Digestive symptoms are more common in young children and may include chronic diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain and bloating and weight loss.  In adults, the following symptoms are more likely:  iron deficiency anemia, fatigue, bone or joint pain, depression, anxiety, dermatitis herpetiformis and canker sores.   Some patients with celiac disease have no symptoms.  Even if no symptoms are present, long-term complications include liver disease, malnutrition and cancers of the intestine.  Treatment for celiac disease involves eliminating all gluten from the diet.  This is a lifetime requirement. Dr. Anne Hermann, a holistic internal medicine physician, offers celiac and food sensitivity testing to her patients.   Offices are maintained in Tampa and Saint Petersburg Beach, Florida.  Please contact the office at for more information or to schedule an appointment.

Certain factors are released when these mast cells break down, causing the surrounding capillaries to leak.  This leakage leads to fluid pooling, swelling and inflammation.  When the intolerant foods are eliminated, the skin becomes noticeably smoother with less dryness, flaking and irritation.  Acne has also been shown to markedly improve once chronic inflammation is decreased.

Reduce your consumption of processed, fatty and refined foods. Eat plenty of fiber rich foods such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  These foods assist the gut in decreasing inflammation.

If you are post-menopausal, you may also be at greater risk for developing osteopenia and osteoporosis. Osteopenia and osteoporosis are diagnosed with a special type of x-ray called a bone mineral density scan There are no symptoms in the early stages of osteopenia and osteoporosis. However, with a large amount of bone loss, you may notice pain and loss of height due to broken bones. To reduce your risk of developing osteopenia and osteoporosis you should: consume 1500mg of calcium and 800mg of vitamin D daily, limit alcohol use, do not use tobacco products, and do daily weight bearing exercise. Fosteum is a vegetable based medical food product approved by the FDA for “dietary management of the metabolic processes of osteopenia and osteoporosis.” It is a blend of genistein aglycone, citrated zinc bisglycinate and cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3). Fosteum is given under physician supervision. It is indicated when diet and calcium plus vitamin D supplements are not enough, but prescription medications are not yet needed. Dosage is one tablet twice a day. The most common side effect of Fosteum use is minor upset stomach with nausea.

How can vitamins and minerals help depressive symptoms?  Magnesium helps regulate mood.  Zinc and serine both regulate neurotransmitter function.  Antioxidants (vitamins A, C, and E, Co Q10, and lipoic acid) help protect neurotransmitter functions from oxidative stress.  Deficiencies of the B complex vitamins (biotin, B2, B6, and B12) have been linked to depression.  Vitamin D acts as a hormone precursor – and thus may improve symptoms of depression.  Finally, chromium elevates serotonin levels    with in the brain (serotonin is our feel good hormone).  Chromium also affects blood sugar regulation, and thus may alleviate the depressive symptom of carbohydrate craving.

The thyroid is a small butterfly-shaped gland located in the front of your neck.  Thyroid hormones are triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4).  These hormones affect all aspects of metabolism in your body.  Your doctor will order blood tests to determine if your thyroid is functioning properly.  If you are found to have hypothyroidism, the hormones can be replaced with daily synthetic or natural replacement medication.  Treatment is usually lifelong; your physician will order periodic thyroid hormone levels to assess for any needed dosage changes.

Researchers have theorized that sensitivities to foods may produce fatigue as part of a generalized immune reaction.   The chronic inflammatory response or immune reaction overburdens our bodies.  This leads to oxidative stress, which in turn affects the mitochondria or energy –producing parts of our cells.  Thus, excessive fatigue ensues.  Once the offending foods are eliminated, most patients experience immediate improvement in their energy level.

Integrative medicine, for instance, accounts for the body, mind, and spirit in order to identify the best therapies for healing. Doctors of integrative medicine are known for using natural, effective, and less invasive interventions whenever possible, and conventional medicine when needed, while also promoting health and prevention of illness. These doctors recognize that strong medicine is based in science and constantly evolving inquiry to better understand the human body and mind. Patients who seek integrative medicine will find that lifestyle changes, smart diet decisions, natural herbs and vitamins, acupuncture, and other safe and preventative measures form the foundation of health, while a strategic blend of conventional and alternative treatments work to tackle specific health issues. Overall, integrative medicine treats the whole person, not just the disease, which has helped it soar to popularity in recent years. Continue reading “Trust Your Health with a Doctor of Integrative Medicine” Once upon a time, cancer was a rare disease that only impacted the unfortunate and unhealthy, and most people felt that cancer would never have the audacity to impact their own lives. But times have changed, and cancer will now touch one in three lives directly, and every single life indirectly. We all know someone who has fought cancer, and we all know people who have succumbed to cancer. This startling change of pace has led cancer fighters to seek alternative cancer treatment options using herbs, supplements, and other holistic practices. The decision of many patients to turn down the option to treat manageable cancers with chemotherapy has caused immense controversy in the past 15 years and drawn great attention to the benefits of traditional versus natural cancer treatments.

Continue reading Naltrexone is a synthetic drug that blocks opiate receptors in the                                                                                                    central nervous system, which are responsible for the sensation of pleasure derived from narcotics.  Naltrexone is typically used for heroin addiction and is FDA approved at doses of 50mg. It is also used in alcohol and drug addiction. In recent years, lower doses of naltrexone have been used to treat autoimmune conditions such as MS (multiple sclerosis), rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and crohn’s disease. The lower dosing of naltrexone is commonly referred to as LDN (low dose naltrexone). The typical dose ranges from 3.5mg to 4mg and is recommended to be taken at bedtime. Low dose naltrexone is inexpensive and well-tolerated. LDN was first used by a physician in 1985 who found that it boosted the immune system in AIDS patients. It is thought that by briefly blocking opioid receptors, LDN causes an increase in endorphins and enkephalins (our body’s natural pain killers). These natural opioids are believed to influence our immune system as we have opioid receptors on immune cells. In particular, blocking the opioid receptors at night is thought to cause a longer up regulation hence LDN is recommended to be taken at night. At Hermann Wellness we offer Holistic Primary Care to our patients including Low Dose Naltrexone. Our offices are located in Tampa and St. Petersburg.

Craniosacral therapy is a treatment modality based on the concepts of both cerebrospinal fluid flow and skull suture flexibility.  It is also called cranial balancing, cranial osteopathy, and craniopathy.  This therapy was developed in the early 1970’s by chiropractor John Upledger. Proponents of craniosacral therapy (CST) describe it as a subtle manipulation of the cranial sutures to release deep muscle tension and improve overall health and homeostasis.  With very light manual pressure applied by a trained provider, cerebrospinal fluid that is palpated at the cranial suture lines can be redistributed to re-establish holistic balance.  The core concepts of CST are the inherent motility of the cerebrospinal fluid and the mobility of the cranial bones. During a session, the CST provider places their fingertips along the cranial sutures and focuses on the subtle pressure variances.  Soft touch is exerted with allows the provider to balance the pulsing and shifting along these areas.  Craniosacral therapy can be utilized for such conditions as , insomnia, pain, and It is often used as an adjunct to other treatment modalities (acupuncture, massage, medications) rather than a first-line treatment.

During people sit quietly, witnessing internal thoughts and external stimuli without getting too engaged with them. There are many forms of this ancient practice. The origins of meditation are in ancient spiritual and healing practices – mainly from India, China and Japan. Relaxation and meditation have been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of many diseases as it improves both psychological and physical health. Individuals who practice meditation view the mind and body as inseparable. The two most popular forms of meditation are Transcendental Meditation (TM) and mindfulness mediation. TM is derived from Hindu tradition and promotes relaxation through the use of a mantra. A mantra is a word or sound used for concentration. Mindfulness meditation trains the participant to be an observer by focusing on what is happening in the present moment both internally and externally. There are four basic elements common to medication techniques – a mental device (such as a word), a passive attitude, a comfortable posture and a quiet environment. A number of recent studies have explored to what degree we can exercise control over things that were thought to be non-changeable. Research has found that meditative practice can change the workings of the brain including learning and states of consciousness. Studies have shown that the areas of the brain that govern concentration, mood and memory all experience increased signaling during meditation. Physical functions such as a decrease in the production of stress hormone, and changes in blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory function have all been documented during mediation. Adults with cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer disease may also benefit from meditation, as recent studies have shown that meditation may change the mapping of brain circuitry. Other disorders such as anxiety, depression, chronic pain and sleep disturbances related to may also be improved with meditation.

Vitamin D and Protection Against Autoimmune Disorders Exposure to UV radiation seems to protect against such as MS and Type 1 diabetes.  Studies have shown that the closer you live to the equator, the less likely you are to develop an autoimmune disease.  Individuals who reside in the southern United States are less frequently diagnosed than individuals who reside in Canada and the northern United States.  The early years matter also, if you lived in the south your first 10 years, you have a reduced risk of developing MS even if you move to a northern state or area and reside there the rest of your life. The production of vitamin D is triggered by ultraviolet B rays from the sun.  helps modulate your body’s defense system.  Studies have shown that in individuals who have the potential for developing autoimmunity, vitamin D reduces the risk and may in fact slow the progression of certain autoimmune disorders in their early stages.  2000-4000 IU’s daily of vitamin D is recommended by most experts. Dr. Anne Hermann, a holistic internal medicine physician, offers comprehensive vitamin and nutritional testing to her patients.  As well as alternative treatment options for many health conditions, including autoimmune disorders.  Offices are maintained in Tampa and Saint Petersburg Beach, Florida.  Please contact the office at for more information or to schedule an appointment.

""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. The first nationally representative survey of prevalence, costs, and patterns of use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) involved a random sample of 1,539 adults who were interviewed by phone in 1990. That survey inquired about the use of 16 CAM therapies and reported that one in three respondents (34 percent) had used at least one complementary therapy during the past year to treat their most serious or bothersome medical condition(s). It also found that those who saw providers for CAM therapies made an average of 19 visits per year, that complementary therapies were used primarily for chronic conditions as opposed to acute or life-threatening conditions, and that CAM therapies were predominantly used in addition to—and not as replacements for—conventional medical therapies. Importantly, it also found that 72 percent of CAM therapy users did not inform their medical doctors that they used CAM (Eisenberg et al., 1993). Extrapolation of the results of the 1990 survey to the U.S. population suggests that in 1990 Americans made an estimated 425 million visits to providers of complementary care. This number exceeded the number of visits to U.S. primary care physicians (388 million) and was associated with an annual expenditure of approximately $13.7 billion, three-quarters of which ($10.3 billion) were paid out of pocket. This amount was comparable to the $12.8 billion spent out of pocket annually for all hospitalizations in the United States. A national follow-up survey indicated a dramatic increase in CAM use ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. by the American public between 1990 and 1997 (Eisenberg et al., 1998). (See for a summary of the surveys of CAM use that have been conducted.) Specifically: The prevalence of CAM use increased by 25 percent from 33.8 percent in 1990 to 42.1 percent in 1997. The prevalence of herbal remedy use increased by 380 percent. The prevalence of high-dose vitamin use increased by 130 percent. The total number of visits to CAM providers increased by 47 percent from 427 million in 1990 to 629 million in 1997. The total visits to CAM providers (629 million) exceeded the total number of visits to all primary-care physicians (386 million) in 1997. It was estimated that, in 1997, adults made 33 million office visits to professionals for advice regarding the use of herbs and high-dose vitamins. An estimated 15 million adults in 1997 took prescription medications concurrently with herbal remedies or high-dose vitamins or both. These individuals are therefore at risk for potential adverse drug-herb or drug-supplement interactions. If insurance coverage for CAM therapies increases in the future, current use of CAM services is likely an under-represention of future utilization patterns. Despite the dramatic increases in the rates of use and the expenditures associated with CAM services, the extent to which patients disclosed their use of CAM therapies to their physicians remains low. In both 1990 and 1997, less than 40 percent of CAM therapy users disclosed to their physicians that they had used such therapies. Estimated expenditures for CAM professional services increased by 45 percent, exclusive of inflation. In 1997 such expenditures were estimated to be $21.2 billion. Out-of-pocket expenditures for herbal products and high-dose vitamins in 1997 were estimated to be $8.0 billion. Out-of-pocket expenditures for CAM professional services in 1997 were estimated to be $12.2 billion. This exceeded the out-of-pocket expenditures for all U.S. hospitalizations. Total out-of-pocket expenditures relating to CAM therapies were conservatively estimated to be $27.0 billion. This is comparable to the projected out-of-pocket expenditures for all U.S. physician services. The study also found that among the respondents who in the past year had used CAM and seen their medical doctor, 63 to 72 percent did not disclose to their doctor the fact that they had received at least one type of CAM therapy.

Questions were part of the 2002 National Health Interview Survey. Questions asked about use (ever and during past 12 months) of 27 types of CAM therapies (10 provider-based, and 17 non-provider based). If a CAM therapy was used in the last 12 months, respondents were also asked about: condition being treated; reason for choosing therapy, insurance coverage for costs; satisfaction with treatment; and whether conventional practitioner knew about CAM use. Overall, in 2002, about 62% of U.S. adults used some form of CAM in the past 12 months. 10 CAM therapies most commonly used in past 12 months: 9.6% participation in prayer group for one’s own health CAM most often used for back pain or problems, head or chest colds, neck pain or problems, joint pain or stiffness, and anxiety or depression. Questions were part of the 1999 National Health Interview Survey. Participants were asked if, during the past 12 months, they had used any CAM therapies (from a list of 11). 28.9% of U.S. adults used at least one CAM therapy during the past year. 0.3% other (e.g., qi gong, yoga, chelation, and bee stings) Have you ever used any of the following forms of CAM (16 named) to treat your principle medical conditions?

Random sample of adults in the U.S., n = 1,035, representative of U.S. population Representative, random, n = 1,539, telephone interview nondisclosure, common reasons were “It wasn’t important for the doctor to know” (61 percent), “The doctor never asked” (60 percent), “It was none of the doctor’s business” (31 percent), and “The doctor would not understand” (20 percent). Fewer respondents (14 percent) thought that their doctor would disapprove of or discourage CAM use, and just 2 percent thought that the doctor might not continue as their provider if the doctor knew that the patient had received some sort of CAM therapy. The respondents judged CAM therapies to be more helpful than conventional care for the treatment of headache and neck and back conditions, but they considered conventional care to be more helpful than CAM therapy for treatment of hypertension. Adults who use both CAM and conventional medicine appear to value both and tend to be less concerned about their medical doctors’ disapproval than they are about their doctors’ inability to understand or incorporate CAM therapy use within the context of their medical management (Eisenberg et al., 1998). Paramore (1997) analyzed data from a national database composed of survey data for 3,450 individuals. The survey indicated that in 1994 approximately 10 percent of the adult population (25 million individuals) had seen a professional for at least one of four CAM therapies: chiropractic, ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use.""

Have you used any of the following forms of CAM (17 named) within the past year? In the last year, did you see a professional for one of four therapies? Have you ever used any of the following therapies (16 named) to treat your principle medical conditions? If so, have you done so within the last 12 months? relaxation techniques, therapeutic massage, or acupuncture. The majority of those who sought professional care from CAM providers also saw a medical doctor during the reference year. The study also observed that users of CAM therapies made almost twice as many visits to conventional medical providers as non-CAM users. Astin (1998) conducted a mail survey of 1,035 randomly selected individuals. Forty percent of those responding (response rate 69 percent) reported CAM use during the previous year. Another survey reported by Druss and Rosenheck (1999) investigated the association between the use of CAM therapies and the use of conventional care in a different national survey sample taken from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel survey. They reported that in 1996 an estimated 6.5 percent of the U.S. population visited both CAM providers and conventional medical practitioners. Fewer than 2 percent used only CAM services, 60 percent used only conventional care, and 32 percent used neither. These numbers were considerably lower than the range reported by Eisenberg et al. (1998). The investigators concluded that, from the health services perspective, practitioner-based CAM therapies appear to serve more as a complement than as an alternative to conventional medical care. ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. In 1999, the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) included questions about the use of alternative health care practices. Ni et al. (2002) analyzed the data from the 1999 NHIS which included 30,801 respondents and an oversampling of non-English speakers and those without telephones. A total of 12 types of CAM were asked about in the survey. Ni et al. documented a CAM use prevalence rate of 28.9 percent during the prior 12 months. The investigators concluded that on the basis of these data in 1999, CAM use was somewhat lower than that in previous surveys. Most CAM therapies were used in conjunction with conventional medical services, a finding consistent with prior observations. Lastly, the investigators pointed out that the discrepancies in overall prevalence of CAM use may largely result from the lack of agreement in the definitions of “complementary and alternative medicine.” The lack of consensus regarding a definition as to what is or what is not to be included in the category of complementary and alternative medicine has unquestionably complicated efforts to document, in a consistent fashion, the prevalence, patterns, and costs of CAM use by the American public. Barnes and colleagues (2004) performed the most recent national analysis of CAM use using data from the 2002 NHIS. The survey included 31,044 respondents, drawn from a nationally representative sample. The 2002 survey expanded on the CAM-related questions asked in 1999, inquiring about 27 types of CAM therapies, the condition being treated, the reasons for choosing a CAM therapy, whether insurance covered the CAM therapy, the level of satisfaction with the treatment, and whether the individual’s conventional medical practitioner knew about the patient’s CAM use. As with previous surveys, clearly defining CAM had a large impact on the prevalence results. When “prayer for one’s own health” was included in the definition, Barnes et al. found that 75 percent of adults had ever used CAM and that 62 percent of adults had used some form of CAM therapy within the past 12 months. Excluding prayer from the definition decreased the rate of CAM use to 36 percent. The 2002 NHIS did not collect data about how much money is spent on CAM therapies, but it did report that 13 percent of CAM users chose CAM because conventional medicine was too expensive. The patterns of CAM use described above are all based on nationally representative random samples of the adult U.S. population. As such, their results are more generalizable than data obtained from smaller clinic- and community-based surveys, which typically focus on specific health problems and specific age cohorts (Bair et al., 2002; Davis and Darden, 2003; Lee et al., 2000a), ethnic groups or geographic areas (Cushman et al., 1999; Factor-Litvak et al., 2001; Greendale et al., 2003; Maskarinec et al., 2000; Najm et al., 2003; Vallerand et al., 2003), and special at-risk populations, ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. such as homeless youth (Breuner et al., 1998). These smaller surveys, along with qualitative studies provide insights into the health-care seeking behaviors of local populations. The use of CAM therapies is more common among women (48.9 percent) than men (37.8 percent) (Eisenberg et al., 1998). Wootton and Sparber (2001a,b,c) also noted this trend in their review of surveys on CAM use, as did Barnes et al. (2004) in their survey. The fact that women use CAM therapies more commonly than men is noteworthy. Women’s greater use of health care services in general has been critically examined in the health social science literature in relation to such variables as social class, longevity, patterns of morbidity, symptom reporting, psychosocial distress, and gender-based differences in health care provision (Bertakis et al., 2000; Gijsbers van Wijk et al., 1992; Macintyre et al., 1996; Mustard et al., 1998). Two observations are relevant. First, women tend to be more health conscious than men leading them to invest more time and resources in promotive and preventive health (Hibbard and Pope, 1983; Verbrugge and Wingard, 1987). Second, women tend to serve as domestic health care managers influencing the health care behavior of family members, particularly when they are ill and at home (Barnett and Baruch, 1987; Carpenter, 1980; Clark, 1995; Michelson, 1990; Umberson, 1992; Verbrugge, 1989). This suggests that women’s use of CAM modalities may well serve as an indicator of probable family use of CAM in the future. Eisenberg and colleagues (1998) found that CAM use was higher among those who had some college education (50.6 percent) than among those with no college education (36.4 percent) and was more common among people with annual incomes above $50,000 (48.1 percent) than among those with lower incomes (42.6 percent). Foster et al. (2000), who examined a different aspect of the database of Eisenberg et al. (1998), explored the relationship between income and CAM use. They observed that complementary therapy use varied by income quartile (43 percent CAM use among those with annual incomes less than $20,000; 37 percent among those earning $20,000 to $30,000 per year; 44 percent among those earning $30,000 to $50,000 per year; and 48 percent among those with annual incomes above $50,000). In addition, the average annual out-of-pocket expenditures increased with income quartile confirming that those with ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. higher incomes used more CAM therapies overall. Interestingly, although the data indicating that CAM use appears to be highest among those with more financial resources, the data also show that 43 percent of those in the lowest income group (those with incomes less than $20,000 per year) used CAM therapies routinely, suggesting that CAM use is prevalent in all sociodemographic segments of society (Eisenberg et al., 1998). In the Astin (1998) survey, level of education was positively correlated with CAM use. Astin reported that 31 percent of survey participants with a high school education or less used CAM, and the rate of use increased to 50 percent for participants with a graduate degree. Household income was not a predictive factor of use, and as in the analysis of Foster et al. (2000), Astin found CAM use to be prevalent at multiple socio-demographic levels, ranging from 33 percent among those with incomes <$12,500 to 44 percent among those with incomes >$40,000. Wootton and Sparber (2001) found that CAM users are primarily middle-aged, better educated, and in higher income brackets. However, they report that little is known about the rate of use among the less well to do since only a few small-scale studies of CAM use by low-income groups exist. Their analysis of these small-scale studies found that 29 percent (n = 199) of patients on Medicaid in a family health center used CAM; 70 percent (n = 157) of homeless young people in the Street Clinic youth program in Seattle, Washington, reported using CAM; and 56 percent (n = 187) of patients attending a family practice clinic reported using herbs/supplements. For many types of CAM therapies, Barnes et al. (2004) found that the rate of use increased as the level of education increased. This pattern was seen for biologically based therapies, alternative medical systems, energy therapies, and manipulative and body-based therapies. The analysis of CAM use by income revealed an interaction between the type of therapy and income. Individuals who were poor exhibited a slightly higher prevalence of megavitamin therapy and prayer use than individuals who were not poor (65.5 and 62.6 percent, respectively). However, individuals who were not poor reported higher rates of use of biologically based therapies (excluding megavitamin therapy), mind-body therapies (excluding prayer), alternative medical systems, energy therapies, and manipulative and body-based therapies than poor individuals. “Poverty” was defined by the Census Bureau’s 2001 thresholds. “Poor” was defined as an income below the poverty threshold, and “not poor” was defined as an income >200 percent of the poverty threshold. ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. Eisenberg and colleagues (1998) found CAM use to be less common among African Americans (33.1 percent) than among members of other racial groups (44.5 percent). In Wootton and Sparber’s 2001a review, Dominican patients in an emergency room reported 50 percent use of CAM (n = 50); 94.6 percent (n = 75) of Chinese immigrants reported self-treatment and the use of home remedies; 62 percent (n = 300) of Navajos visiting an Indian Health Service hospital reported that they had used native healers; and 44 percent (n = 213) of Mexican Americans in a convenience sample reported that they had used herbal remedies, and 13 percent reported that they had used . Mackenzie and colleagues (2003) further examined the prevalence of CAM use among many different ethnic groups in the United States. They analyzed a subset of data from the 1995 National Comparative Survey of Minority Health Care of The Commonwealth Fund, a national probability sample of 3,789 people with an oversampling of ethnic minorities. The survey was conducted by telephone in six languages. The use of five categories of CAM within the last year were queried (herbal medicine, acupuncture, chiropractic, traditional healer, and home remedy). Overall, 43.1 percent of the respondents reported using one or more of those five CAM modalities. The use of CAM was equally prevalent among white, African-American/black, Latino, Asian, and Native American populations; but the characteristics of the users varied considerably by specific CAM modality. The predictors of CAM use were female gender, being uninsured, and having a high school education or above. These factors were consistent with earlier surveys involving random samples of all U.S. adults. Ni and colleagues (2002) found that overall CAM use was higher for white non-Hispanic individuals (30.8 percent) than for Hispanic (19.9 percent) and black non-Hispanic (24.1 percent) individuals. Like the findings of Mackenzie et al. (2003), the 2002 NHIS (Barnes et al., 2004) found various patterns of use by race, depending on the type of CAM therapy. Use of mind-body therapies including prayer for health reasons was more prevalent among black adults (68.3 percent) than among white (50.1 percent) or Asian (48.1 percent) adults. However, Asian adults (43.1 percent) were more likely to use CAM (excluding megavitamin therapy and prayer) than white (35.9 percent) or black (26.2 percent) adults. Finally, white adults (12 percent) were more likely to use manipulative and body-based therapies than Asian (7.2 percent) or black (4.4 percent) adults. It may be, however, that surveys of minority cultures underestimate health practices such as the use of home remedies since in many cultures, the consumption of foods (including commonly used herbs and spices) for medicinal purposes is so engrained in everyday folk dietetic practices that it ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. is not recognized as being out of the ordinary or worth reporting. The same may be true for religious-spiritual practices, which serve multiple purposes and which may be reported only under extraordinary circumstances and not as routine ways of coping with adversity or ensuring well-being. There is often a fine line between what members of a minority culture deem normative practice and what outsiders classify as CAM practice. In large surveys with representative samples, there is a need for better, more culturally sensitive questions that will provide more accurate data about CAM use among minority populations. In earlier surveys, people aged 35 to 49 years reported higher rates of CAM use (50.1 percent) than people either older (39.1 percent) or younger (41.8 percent) (Eisenberg et al., 1998). Recently, the 2002 NHIS results indicate that CAM use increases with age. Barnes et al. (2004) found that 53.5 percent of the individuals in the youngest age bracket (18 to 29 years) reported that they had used some type of CAM and the greatest prevalence of CAM use (70.3 percent) was found among those in the oldest age bracket (85 years and older). Wootton and Sparber’s (2001a) review found that the rate of CAM use among elderly individuals ranged from 33 percent of a convenience sample of elderly patients with cancer (n = 699) to 84 percent of a convenience sample of elderly rural women. Foster et al. (2000), using the data of Eisenberg et al. (1998), measured the prevalence, cost, and patterns of CAM use by people aged 65 or older. They observed that during the previous 12 months 30 percent had used at least one type of CAM therapy for the treatment of their principal medical conditions. The complementary modalities most commonly used by individuals aged 65 and older used were chiropractic, herbal remedies and dietary supplements, relaxation and meditation techniques, and high-dose vitamins. As was the case for the general population, the majority of older adults who used CAM services made no mention of this to their physician. Fewer studies have examined the use of CAM by children. Davis and Darden (2003) analyzed a 1996 nationally representative survey of American children and reported a prevalence rate of 1.8 percent. Among CAM users, 76.8 percent were white and 54 percent were female. CAM use increased with age, with older children (ages 10 to 17 years) accounting for 62.6 percent of the use, but the youngest children (ages 0 to 4 years) representing only 21 percent. The investigators noted that the overall estimate of CAM use was lower than that reported in previous surveys and ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. discussed possible explanations. Like other national surveys, CAM is not defined consistently among surveys. This particular survey asked whether a CAM provider was consulted in the previous year, which does not take into account the use of self-prescribed therapies, such as dietary supplements. Studies of the use of CAM for the treatment of specific illnesses have documented the popularity of CAM for the treatment of health problems that lack definitive cures; that have an unpredictable course and prognosis; and that are associated with substantial pain, discomfort, or side effects from prescription drug medicine. For example, back pain/back problem was the most common condition (16.8 percent) identified in the 2002 NHIS (Barnes et al., 2004). CAM use has been identified as particularly common among women suffering from the symptoms of menopause (Beal, 1998; Cherrington et al., 2003; Kronenberg and Fugh-Berman, 2002) and pregnancy-related illnesses (Tiran, 2002), gynecology problems (von Gruenigen et al., 2001), rheumatology problems (Rao et al., 1999; Wootton and Sparber, 2001c), gastroenterological diseases (Rawsthorne et al., 1999), rhinosinusitis (Krouse and Krouse, 1999), attention and hyperactivity problems (Chan et al., 2003) psychiatric and neurological problems (Sparber and Wootton, 2002), cancer (Adler, 1999; Bernstein and Grasso, 2001; Burstein et al., 1999; Henderson and Donatelle, 2004; Kao and Devine, 2000; Lee et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2000b; Lengacher et al., 2002; Patterson et al., 2002; Richardson et al., 2000, Sparber and Wootton, 2001; Sparber et al., 2000; Swisher et al., 2002; VandeCreek et al., 1999; Wilkinson et al., 2002; Zimmerman and Thompson, 2002), HIV/AIDS (Fairfield et al., 1998; Wootton and Sparber, 2001b), asthma (Braganza et al., 2003), and disabilities (Krauss et al., 1998). Still other studies have examined the prevalence of patients who use CAM in various types of nonspecialty clinics such as pediatric clinics (Davis and Darden, 2003; Madsen et al., 2003; Sawni-Sikand et al., 2002) primary-care clinics (Gordon et al., 1998; Kitai et al., 1998), maternity practices (Hepner et al., 2002), emergency rooms (Gulla and Singer, 2000; Rogers et al., 2001; Weiss et al., 2001), and postsurgery clinics (Norred et al., 2000). One reason for conducting such studies has been to identify possible CAM-conventional medicine interactions, especially in cases in which it is vital to a patient’s well-being to know of medications that may interfere with such things as blood clotting time when surgery is being performed (Allaire et al., 2000; Hepner et al., 2002) or with other conventional practices that have been taken or have been prescribed by CAM practitioners or midwives. These examples are not meant to be exhaustive but, rather, representa- ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. tive of the range of studies that have used various sampling techniques and that have been performed with particular U.S. patient populations over the past decade. These surveys confirm the impression that a significant percentage of individuals with chronic or life-threatening illnesses are using CAM at some point during the course of their illness. More difficult to discern are an individual’s reasons for using a CAM modality at a particular point in time over the course of an illness. One cannot tell from survey data whether those surveyed used a CAM modality primarily for curative purposes or primarily for a specific health problem, as a means of reducing the side effects from other types of therapy, or for general health-promoting purposes. Nor can it be determined which type of therapy (conventional or CAM) was sought first. It is worth noting that for many of the chronic conditions listed above, management of patients’ health care needs includes but extends beyond the management of overt symptoms associated with the disease. The importance of this observation may be considered in light of studies on health care expenditures associated with chronic disease. It has been estimated that more than 45 percent of noninstitutionalized Americans have one or more chronic conditions and their direct health care costs account for 75 percent of U.S. health care expenditures (Hoffman et al., 1996). Using a nationally representative sample of 23,230 U.S. residents, Druss et al. (2001) calculated that half of U.S. health care costs in 1996 were borne by persons with one or more of five conditions: mood disorders, diabetes, heart disease, asthma, and hypertension. Notably, of that amount, only about one-quarter was spent on treating the conditions themselves; the remainder was spent on treating coexistent illnesses and health care problems. Those researchers pointed out that each condition was associated with unique patterns of health service use driving those costs. This finding highlights the need for a better understanding of what motivates patients with chronic complaints to seek both CAM and conventional medical services and the cost implications of combined care. In other words, does utilization of CAM reduce or increase the costs of health care for people with different types of chronic conditions? Wolsko and colleagues (2002), using the database of Eisenberg et al. (1998), evaluated the extent to which high-frequency users of CAM contributed to the total number of visits to CAM providers. Notably, they found that individuals who saw conventional health care providers more frequently were also the most apt to use complementary care services. Conservative extrapolation to national estimates suggested that a small fraction of U.S. adults (8.9 percent) accounted for 20 percent of CAM users ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. but that they made more than 75 percent of the 629 million visits to CAM providers. These data parallel observations that a large percentage of the annual U.S. health care budget is routinely consumed by a relatively small percentage of the U.S. population. CAM services can and should be viewed similarly. Notably, however, high-frequency users of biomedicine and high-frequency users of CAM appear to use these modalities for different purposes. Additionally, Druss and Rosenheck (1999) point to a difference between these two populations of high-frequency users: psychiatric disorders are prominent among the high-frequency users of conventional medicine, but the researchers found no such correlate among high-frequency users of CAM modalities. Wolsko and colleagues (2002) also examined the extent to which insurance coverage was independently associated with CAM therapy use. They found that for individuals who sought the services of practitioners who performed physical manipulation (e.g., chiropractors and massage therapists), full insurance coverage, partial insurance coverage, and the use of the therapy for wellness were all associated with the high-frequency use of such providers. Among the survey respondents using the services of CAM providers, 63 percent of those reporting that they had full insurance coverage made eight or more visits to a CAM practitioner during the previous year. Only 17 percent of those reporting that they had no insurance coverage made eight or more visits. For CAM therapies which were not related to physical manipulation (e.g., relaxation therapy and advice regarding herbs supplements), the only factor associated with high-frequency provider use was having used the therapy for wellness. Having any insurance coverage, it appears, is associated with higher rates of use of CAM therapy services. Rates of insurance coverage for CAM services varies significantly by state, treatment plan, and CAM modality (Tillman, 2002). The services of chiropractors are covered by between 41 and 65 percent of health maintenance organizations (HMOs), the services of homeopaths are covered by 4 to 11 percent of HMOs, acupuncture is covered by 9 to 19 percent of HMOs, and massage therapy is covered by 6 to 10 percent of HMOs (Stanger and Coughlan, 2000). Depending on the therapy, Eisenberg et al. (1998) also found various rates of partial and full coverage, with only four modalities (chiropractic, megavitamins, imagery, and biofeedback) receiving some form of coverage more than 50 percent of the time. What are the long-term trends in CAM use likely to be and how do they differ from the trends experienced earlier in history? Kessler and colleagues (2001) analyzed the same dataset obtained by Eisenberg et al. (1998) in their 1997 survey, but focused on questions about first-time use of CAM ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. therapies by all individuals aged 18 and older. They observed that 68 percent of all respondents had used as least one CAM therapy during the course of their lives. Lifetime use steadily increased with age across all age cohorts. Specifically, individuals in the pre-baby boom cohort (i.e., older than age 58 years at the time of the survey) had a 30 percent incidence of CAM therapy use by the age of 33; 5 of 10 baby boomers had used one or more CAM therapies by age 33, and 7 of 10 individuals born after the baby boom reported the use of some type of CAM therapy by age 33. It was also noted that prior use of any CAM therapy was an excellent predictor of current use. Among the respondents who had ever used a CAM therapy, roughly half continued to use a CAM therapy many years later (during the interval of the survey). These analyses also documented the fact that the rate of use of all but 4 of the 20 most commonly used complementary therapies increased in frequency beginning in the 1960s. During the decades of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the use of particular CAM therapies increased at higher rates than the use of others. For instance, the 1970s witnessed large increases in the rates of use of herbal medicine, imagery, energy healing and biofeedback, whereas in the 1980s the rates of use of massage therapy and naturopathy increased most rapidly. Kessler and colleagues (2001) mention that “from an historical perspective, data from 1998 may not necessarily represent a consistent trend of increased use of CAM therapies, but rather a distinct peak in a long trend of constant fluctuation in complementary and alternative medicine use by the American public.” They refer to previous peaks of CAM use such as survey data from the 1920s and 1930s indicating high rates of use of “unconventional” therapies and government statistics from 1900 documenting large numbers of registered “alternative” practitioners. Kessler et al. conclude that the recent high rates of CAM use may in fact be demonstrating a resurgence of CAM use after a period of diminished use during the 1940s and 50s. Even so, use of CAM therapies in recent years by a large proportion of the U.S. population is seen as a result of a historical trend that began at least 50 years ago. Moreover, this trend suggests a continuing demand for CAM therapies that will affect health care delivery for the foreseeable future. Other factors associated with CAM therapy use that further this hypothesis include the observation that CAM therapies are used predominantly for the treatment of chronic disease, which, as mentioned above, accounts for an increasing fraction of the U.S. healthcare burden (Astin, 1998). In addition, an estimated one-third of CAM therapy use is attributed to disease prevention and health promotion (Eisenberg et al., 1993, 1998). These patterns parallel trends in U.S. society to promote disease prevention and to encourage health promotion, especially among those in the baby ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. boom generation, 50 percent of whom already use CAM therapies, usually in the absence of a chronic or a disabling disease. As such, CAM use is quite likely to increase in the coming quarter century as the baby boom generation experiences greater disease burdens. Lastly, the observation that 7 of 10 individuals born after the baby boom generation routinely use CAM therapies by the age of 33 (Kessler et al., 2001) suggests that the U.S. public increasingly views CAM therapies as accessible options and “conventional” lifestyle choices that can no longer be viewed as entirely “alternative” practices. CAM therapies are typically not centered on high-technology interventions and instead include low-cost treatments. This is often offered in support of the idea that CAM may provide more cost-effective treatments than conventional medicine. However, some CAM interventions involve more time with a practitioner, which may be costly (White and Ernst, 2000). Despite the claim that CAM is more cost-effective, there is not a large body of literature that explores the question of cost. White and Ernst (2000) conducted a review of cost description, cost comparison, cost-effectiveness, and cost-benefit studies. The studies in the articles reviewed tended to take two general approaches: evaluation of the cost of a specific therapy and health condition and examination of overall effects, such as rates and total health care costs. With a few exceptions, White and Ernst did not find a rigorous body of economic analyses for CAM. They offer several explanations, including the “intangible and indirect” benefits of CAM, such as patient preference, patient empowerment, and quality of life, as well as the cumulative benefits conveyed through lifestyle changes. Since the review of White and Ernst (2000) was published, a few more economic evaluations of CAM have been published. Sobel (2000) reviewed four examples of mind-body interventions that demonstrated beneficial effects on health and cost-savings for heart disease, chronic disease, surgery, and prematurity among infants. For chronic low back pain, Cherkin et al. (2001) compared the effectiveness of acupuncture, massage, and self-care education. At the 1-year follow-up, patients randomized to receive therapeutic massage reported fewer symptoms than acupuncture recipients, and massage recipients used fewer medications than the other two groups. Finally, follow-up costs for outpatient HMO back care were lower for the massage group than for the acupuncture or the education group, although the difference was not statistically significant. An important limitation of this study was the lack of a no-treatment comparison group. The treatment of chronic headaches with acupuncture was the subject ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. of a recent randomized clinical trial and cost-effectiveness analysis by Wonderling and colleagues (2004) in the United Kingdom. Compared with usual care, acupuncture increased both quality-adjusted life years and health care costs. However, the investigators noted that the cost increase is less than that of another National Health Service-recommended medication for the treatment of migraine headaches. A second randomized controlled trial paired with an economic analysis, conducted in The Netherlands, examined the treatment of neck pain with physiotherapy, manual therapy, and general practitioner care (Korthals-de Bos et al., 2003). At 26 weeks, manual therapy led to a faster recovery. Additionally, at the 1-year follow-up, the analysis showed that manual therapy (i.e., spinal mobilization) cost less and was more effective than physiotherapy (i.e., mainly exercise) or general care (i.e., counseling, education, and medication). It should be emphasized that few studies of the cost-effectiveness of CAM therapies have been undertaken. Survey techniques are useful for finding out the personal and demographic characteristics of people who have tried CAM modalities, the point prevalence rate of people who have used CAM over specified periods of time (ever, last year, etc.), how much they have spent on these modalities, where they have received therapy (if they saw a CAM practitioner) or if they have engaged in self-treatment, and whether they have informed their conventional medical doctor that they are using CAM therapies or modalities (or whether they have informed their CAM practitioner that they are receiving biomedical treatments). They are far less useful as a means of providing information about people’s motivations for using CAM therapies or modalities, given that rationale and rationalization are hard to tease apart on a survey and given that the reasons for using CAM use change over time, are complex, and are multidimensional. A wide variety of motivations for using CAM have been reported in the literature dispelling any simple characterization of why the American public uses CAM therapies and modalities. identifies many of the motivations for the use of CAM that have been identified in the health, social science, and CAM literature (Astin, 1998; Easthope, 1986; Foote-Ardah, 2003; Furnham and Forey, 1994; Furnham and Smith, 1988; Henderson and Donatelle, 2004; Kaptchuck and Eisenberg, 1998; Kelner and Wellman, 1997; Lloyd et al., 1993; Mitchell and Cormack, 1998; “Quality-adjusted life years integrate mortality and morbidity to express health status in terms of equivalents of well-years of life” (Kaplan, 1988).

An important finding noted by Wolsko et al. (2002) was that among the 2,055 study participants, the pursuit of wellness was a major contributor to CAM use. Those who used CAM for wellness purposes frequented CAM providers more often than those who did not. Other researchers have also noted that interest in health promotion and disease prevention appears to be a motivating force driving CAM use (Astin, 1998). Research suggests that obtaining “wellness care” from conventional and CAM providers is important to CAM users. Druss and Rosenheck (1999) found that adults who visit both CAM providers and conventional providers are more likely than individuals who seek care only from conventional providers to report that they monitor their blood pressure and cholesterol levels and undertake timely prostate and breast cancer screenings. Astin and colleagues (2000) surveyed enrollees in a Medicare supplement plan offering benefits for selected CAM therapies and found that the most frequently cited reason for CAM use was “general health improvement” (42 percent), whereas CAM use for “chronic medical problems” was cited by only 18 percent of those surveyed. These findings are consistent with the findings of Eisenberg et al. (1993, 1998), who documented that 58 percent of those surveyed used CAM therapies, at least in part, to “prevent future illness from occurring or to maintain health and vitality,” whereas only 42 percent of those surveyed used CAM exclusively to treat an existing disease. The 2002 NHIS asked participants about their reasons for using CAM. For any type of CAM, 54.9 percent believed that CAM therapy combined with conventional medical treatments would help, 50.1 percent thought that CAM would be interesting to try and 25.8 percent indicated that CAM use was suggested by a conventional medical professional. Alternatively, 27.7 percent believed that conventional medical treatments would not help, and 13.2 percent believed that conventional medical therapies were too expensive (Barnes et al., 2004). Once a patient begins to use CAM therapies, however, how likely is the patient to continue to use them? Cross-sectional surveys carried out after time lapses of some years allow investigators to speculate about continued use for some purpose, be it health promotion, the treatment of periodic illness, or the management of a chronic illness or disability. Kessler et al. (2001) found that 50 percent of all CAM therapy use that had been initiated at least 5 years prior to the interview (Eisenberg et al., 1998) persisted at the time of the interview. This suggests that prior use of CAM therapy is a predictor of ongoing or current use for half of all users. The data also suggest that the persistent use of CAM therapies and modalities may be related to general health and may not be reserved only for the treatment of ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use.""

Those who are fighting aging, trying to stay young user CAM use is related to wide range of functions from retaining or enhancing beauty or flexibility to increasing vitality or removing toxins associated with the aging process The user does not have positive expectations, but is trying anyway; some users maintain negative expectations that they await to be disproved Many consumers of dietary supplements are unaware that what they are taking is not medicine recommended or approved by conventional medicine a particular time-limited ailment. This is consistent with the findings of Astin (1998) that most CAM therapies are used, at least in part, to prevent future illness or to maintain health and vitality as part of lifestyle choices linked to disease prevention and health promotion. Further investigation into the association between the use of CAM modalities and wellness-related behavior is warranted given national public health priorities and the burden of lifestyle-related diseases (DHHS, 2000). What remains unknown is the extent to which different types and levels of CAM use foster or sustain behavioral changes contributing to positive health outcomes. CAM use may be a marker of “packages” of lifestyle changes associated with shifts in identity, or it may constitute little more than an attempt at harm reduction engaged by those who wish to minimize the negative effects of an unhealthy environment, job, or lifestyle (Nichter, 2003). Data on wellness from existing cross-sectional surveys point out the need for long-term longitudinal cohort studies examining large numbers of adults who are routinely asked questions about CAM use as well as diet, exercise, smoking, etc. Such studies, reminiscent of the Framingham Heart Study or the Nurses’ Health Study (both of which are ongoing and which could, conceivably, be expanded to include questions about CAM use) may offer the best opportunity to explore patterns of CAM use over time as well as the role—or lack thereof—of CAM in promoting health, reducing risk, and preventing disease. One hypothesis for why people use CAM is that they are dissatisfied with conventional care. The literature suggests that this is not most user’s ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. primary reason for CAM use (Astin, 1998; Barnes et al., 2004; Eisenberg et al., 2001). Users of CAM often use CAM modalities simultaneously with conventional medicine when they are ill. They typically (70 percent) use CAM subsequent to or simultaneously with the use of conventional medicine, and 79 percent of respondents who saw a medical doctor and used CAM therapies perceived the combination to be superior to either one alone (Eisenberg et al., 2001). A second hypothesis is that CAM users maintain health beliefs different from those of other people, but an answer to this question will require investigation of health perceptions before and after CAM use to determine whether users sought CAM modalities on the basis of their health ideology or underwent transformational experiences. Astin (1998) conducted the only national survey on personal factors that predispose individuals to use CAM. He found that higher levels of education, a transformational experience that changed one’s world view, a holistic health philosophy, and interest in alternative lifestyles were determinants of CAM use. Other studies have also documented an association between CAM use and a holistic (e.g., New Age) health philosophy (Easthope et al., 2000; Furnham and Forey, 1994; Pawluch et al., 2000; Sharma, 1993). Although embracing such a philosophy is undoubtedly a factor related to sustained CAM use by many people, it is most likely not the initial motivation for many others to seek care from CAM practitioners or to use CAM-related resources (Kelner and Wellman, 1997). The research summarized in suggests that people seek CAM modalities for a wide variety of reasons. Some of those attracted to CAM modalities seek a therapeutic relationship with a practitioner in which they have the opportunity to more fully participate in their own health care decision making (Mitchell and Cormack, 1998). For example, cancer patients vary considerably in their preference for participation in decision making. While some of those who wish to share responsibility for care find preferred relationships with practitioners of conventional medicine, many others do not (Arora, 2003). Many who use CAM as supplementary care do so as a way of avoiding passivity and coping with feelings of hopelessness. It might be more productive to investigate the extent to which these individuals are simply trying to marshal all resources at their disposal toward the end of securing optimal health care, a concept that is relative and subject to interpretation in accord with a patient’s needs and expectations. For many people, all forms of health care are options, alternatives to be exploited in an everexpanding health care arena subject to market forces, scientific evolution, and the vagaries of public opinion. Many CAM users access different forms of health care from different places with limited if any coordination between practitioners or knowledge being shared about the eclectic therapies used or medicines taken. Lack of coordination is far from ideal. Research needs to address the multiple factors motivating health ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. care seeking in the pluralistic health care arena that exists at present and the use of eclectic health care resources by the American public. One problem with general characterizations of why people use CAM is that such representations overlook different motivations for initiating CAM and sustaining CAM use over time. They also generate stereotypes about CAM and conventional practitioners that are simplistic and not borne out by the evidence. summarizes information from a nationally representative sample on how dual users of CAM and conventional medicine compare these two broad types of health care and their interactions with both types of care providers. depicts a very mixed picture of how users of CAM feel about their practitioners (Eisenberg et al., 1998). Motivations for using CAM change over time and are influenced by many potentially important intervening variables: frustrations with existing therapies, a desire to try something new, changes in the meaning that one attributes to one’s ailment, changes in self-identity associated with CAM use, the economics of receiving care, and the feedback that one receives from significant others who form an individual’s therapy management support group. The user types highlighted in represent a heuristic. Real users of CAM are likely to approximate different ideal types at different points in their lives as well as to be influenced by multiple motivations to use CAM at any one time. Sirois and Gick (2002) have recently called for a more sophisticated way of looking at CAM users that does not treat them as a homogeneous group with similar beliefs, motivations, and needs and that attends to how their behaviors change over time. They conducted one of the few studies to explore differences in the reasons for using CAM among two groups of CAM users, defined by the length and frequency of CAM use, and a comparison group of users of conventional medicine. New or infrequent CAM users, established CAM users, and users of conventional medicine were distinguished on the basis of health beliefs and sociodemographic, medical, and personality variables. Different patterns of predictors of CAM use for the different groups emerged. In general, health-aware behaviors and dissatisfaction with conventional medicine were the best predictors of overall and initial or infrequent CAM use, while more frequent health-aware behaviors were associated with continued CAM use. Medical need also influenced the choice to use CAM and was the best predictor of committed CAM use, with the established CAM users reporting more health problems than the group of new or infrequent CAM users. An openness to new experiences was associated with CAM use, most notably in the decision to initially try or explore the use of CAM. In a further analysis of their data, Sirois (2002) found that newer CAM users still relied heavily on conventional medical treatments, whereas more experienced CAM users depended ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use.""

Little research has been carried out to investigate Where the public goes to search for information about CAM modalities What sources of information they commonly find and access The effect of CAM advertising on health care seeking behavior What types of the information are deemed credible, marginal, and spurious How risks and benefits are understood and how such perceptions inform decision making What the public expects their providers to tell them Information about CAM modalities appears to be obtained in three major ways. First, it has widely been reported that information about CAM is often spread by word of mouth within social networks and that referral by lay individuals is common. However, the committee found no study that investigated the impact of one person’s CAM involvement on that person’s immediate family or larger social network. Analysis of CAM use among those afflicted with particular health problems and those engaging in promotive health activities associated with CAM is needed. The second source of information is the Internet. It is known that a significant percentage of the American public conducts Internet-based searches to find information about health problems and potential treatments. A recent study estimated that 73 million Americans, or 62 percent of Americans with access to the Internet at the time, have used the Internet to search for information related to health care (Fox and Rainie, 2002). Of these health information seekers, 92 percent reported that the information that they obtained during their last Internet search was useful and relevant (Fox et al., 2000), and 68 percent indicated that it had some role in their health care decision making (Fox and Rainie, 2002). It is reasonable to assume that many of those contemplating or already using CAM modalities access the Internet to find out about these modalities. A few studies have been conducted to determine what a hypothetical health seeker might find on the Internet were he or she to search for common herbal medications. Morris and Avorn (2003) searched the Internet using the five most commonly used search engines and examined what surfaced when they entered the names of the eight most widely used herbal supplements (, St. John’s wort, echinacea, ginseng, garlic, ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. saw palmetto, kava kava, and valerian root). The health content of all websites listed on the first page of the search results were analyzed for a total of 443 sites that met study inclusion criteria. Among the 443 websites, 338 (76 percent) were retail sites. Eighty-one percent of these retail websites made one or more health claims; of these, 149 (55 percent) claimed to treat, prevent, diagnose, or cure specific diseases. More than one-half (153 of 292; 52 percent) of the sites with a health claim omitted the standard federal disclaimer. Bonakdar (2002) conducted a disease-specific search for herbal drugs for cancer. A majority of sites examined claimed that they offered cures for cancer through herbal supplementation with little regard for federal regulations against doing so, with such claims being more common on sites operated from outside the United States. Ashar and colleagues (2003) conducted a third study that evaluated information contained within Internet sites that advertise and market dietary supplements containing ephedra. Thirty-two products and advertisements were identified and systematically evaluated for deviance from truth-in-advertising standards. Of the 32 websites analyzed, 13 (41 percent) failed to disclose potential adverse effects or contraindications to supplement use. Seventeen (53 percent) did not reveal the recommended dosage of ephedra alkaloids. More importantly, 11 sites (34 percent) contained incorrect or misleading statements, some of which could directly result in serious harm to consumers. These and other studies (Matthews et al., 2003; Sagaram et al., 2002) illustrate that consumers are commonly misled by vendors’ claims that herbal products can treat, prevent, diagnose, or cure specific diseases, despite regulations prohibiting such statements. Closer monitoring of web sites, enforcement of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) and Federal Trade Commission regulations, and the creation of a user-friendly authoritative website or criteria for evaluating existing websites on CAM modalities are much needed. A third common source of information about CAM-related modalities is health food stores. A handful of surrogate patient studies have been conducted in which a researcher poses as a prospective client and asks for advice about what type of herbal medicine he or she (or a family member) should take for a specified ailment. In one study conducted by Mills et al. (2003), eight data gatherers asked employees of all retail health food stores in a major Canadian city what they recommended for a patient with breast cancer. The data gatherers inquired about product safety, potential drug interactions, cost, and efficacy. Employees at 34 stores were queried, and a total of 33 different products were recommended. Twenty-three employees (68 percent) did not ask whether the patient took prescription medications, 15 employees (44 percent) recommended visiting some type of health care professional, and only 3 employees (8.8 percent) discussed the potential adverse effects of the products. ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. In another study, Glisson et al. (2003) investigated what products health food store employees recommended for the treatment of depression and how they explained the benefits and risks. Twelve health food stores in the United States were selected for the study. An investigator approached an employee in each store and asked what he or she recommended for depression plus five additional questions regarding product use. All 12 health food store employees recommended a St. John’s wort supplement for the treatment of depression. The employees made numerous comments about St. John’s wort and its use for treatment of depression that were unsafe and inaccurate. Notably, that study and another study of shopkeeper recommendations for medications for children with Crohn’s disease (Calder et al., 2000) found that health food store employees tend to refer to a common resource when making recommendations. If this is a widespread practice, the availability of public access to a website recognized by health food store employees as authoritative might enhance the therapeutic advice given and minimize the potential for dangerous errors to be made when they offer information, especially if the customer was asked to indicate other medications taken at the time. Although reliable data exist on the percentage of people who have used a CAM modality in the last year and how many times the modality was used in general, far less is known about the reasons for CAM use at various times. Existing surveys also provide little information about what proportions of CAM use are Self-initiated: “I go to a provider and ask for .” Provider initiated: “I go to a provider and she recommends or administers .” Provider administered: “She does [massage, acupuncture, chiropractic] to me.” Self-administered: “I read how to do it or someone shows me and then I do it myself in a fashion I find comfortable; I self-regulate [herbs, self hypnosis, yoga, etc.].” Little is known about how individual patients actually use CAM modalities while they are under the care of a CAM practitioner or engaging in self-treatment. The committee was not able to find a single scientific study to date on the rates of compliance or adherence to CAM therapies or supplements purchased over the counter. This stands in stark contrast to a rather robust literature on adherence in conventional medicine (DiMatteo et al., 2002; Donovan and Blake, 1992; Vermeire et al., 2001), a search for ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. which on the PubMed website conducted in December 2003 yielded more than 50,000 citations. Further, we have no information about whether or the extent to which use of a CAM therapy may interfere with compliance in the use of conventional therapies. Having no information about the extent to which patients using CAM adhere to guidelines or directions for treatment produces a major gap in our knowledge. We do not know if patients are using products as directed or even for the purpose recommended. Such information is important, not because we want to assure that patients “follow orders,” but rather to assure that patients are using products and therapies safely and effectively. Even if a therapy is efficacious, it may have little or no effect if it is taken or used incorrectly. Indeed, medicines and other CAM products and procedures may be the source of iatrogenic health problems if they are used incorrectly. It has been routinely observed that a significant proportion of those who take conventional medicine are noncomplaint for a host of reasons. Nonadherence to treatment guidelines may be just as common in the case of CAM. Indeed, patients who believe that herbal medicines are harmless may be more willing to self-regulate their medication in unsupervised ways. Studies of adherence to dietary supplements pose a special challenge. Because of government regulations (DSHEA), supplement labels are not allowed to make claims about the treatment for named illnesses, although they are commonly used for this purpose. Instructions on packages are therefore written to address complaints according to “structure and function” guidelines (see ). At issue is whether users are following the printed instructions or are using these “medicines” for other purposes. On the other hand, are they seeking information on how to use supplements from other sources? On the basis of what criteria can compliance be ascertained? A lack of data on compliance is a major oversight in current CAM research. Use of CAM in Supervised, Unsupervised, and Eclectic Ways Unlike many conventional approaches to health care (e.g., prescription medications, surgical procedures, chemotherapy, and radiation), some CAM therapies are provided by licensed practitioners (e.g., acupuncturists, chiropractors, and massage therapists); others are provided by practitioners or are used by individuals without professional supervision (e.g., meditation and relaxation techniques, dietary supplementation, and dietary modification) and some forms are used without professional supervision altogether. As reported by Eisenberg et al. (1993), in 1990 nearly half (47 percent) of respondents who used one or more CAM therapies for their principal medical conditions did so without any professional supervision, that is, without ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. either visiting a CAM practitioner or discussing their CAM therapy with their medical doctor. It is also known that individuals who use CAM therapies tend to do so rather eclectically and in complex ways. Wolsko et al. (2002) reported that among individuals who used one or more CAM therapies in 1998, 46 percent used one therapy, 20 percent used two therapies, 13 percent used three therapies, 7 percent used four therapies, 5 percent used five therapies, 3 percent used six therapies, and 5.5 percent used seven or more therapies. Of the respondents who used CAM therapies during the prior 12 months, an estimated 48 percent used only self-care-centered CAM modalities, whereas 52 percent had seen a CAM provider. Among those who sought services of a professional CAM provider, 33 percent saw one type of CAM provider, 11 percent saw two types of CAM providers, and 8 percent saw three or more different types of CAM providers. These findings have implications for the design of future clinical trials to assess the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of CAM therapy use by the adult population. Although it is still important to evaluate individual therapies for individual conditions, a research portfolio that is limited to this approach may not adequately simulate CAM therapy use by the adult population. It may therefore be important methodologically to design some studies that offer patients access to multiple CAM therapies across multiple CAM professional groups, as this would be closer to real-life experience. It is also interesting to reflect on the sequence, in which adults use CAM therapies in the context of their overall health care management. Eisenberg et al. (1993, 1998) documented that the overwhelming majority of CAM users also sought conventional medical care for their principal medical conditions. In a separate analysis, Eisenberg et al. (2001) explored the sequence in which individuals seek CAM therapy and found that 70 percent of respondents typically sought the services of a CAM professional concurrently with or after their visit to a medical doctor. Less than 15 percent reported that they had seen a CAM therapy provider before an evaluation of their medical concern by a medical doctor. As such, future research may need to incorporate options for concurrent and concomitant conventional and CAM therapies for individuals to see whether one is better than the other or, alternatively, whether the two together (as usually occurs in common practice) provide perceived or real improvements in clinical outcomes or cost-effectiveness, or both. Knowledge of the basis for decision making by the U.S. public regarding when and how they access complementary therapies either through professional contact with licensed practitioners or some form of self-care is lacking. This represents a relatively unchartered line of inquiry that also has implications for future studies in this field. ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. CHARACTERISTICS OF CAM THERAPIES PROVIDED BY LICENSED ACUPUNCTURISTS, CHIROPRACTORS, MASSAGE THERAPISTS, AND NATUROPATHS Although much of the information regarding the prevalence and the patterns of CAM use comes from surveys of patients, studies of CAM practitioners aimed at documenting the types of patients whom they see and the types of therapeutic options that they offer have also been conducted. Cherkin et al. (2002a,b) surveyed random samples of licensed acupuncturists, chiropractors, massage therapists, and naturopathic physicians and collected data on the patients who visited those providers. Specifically, they collected data on 20 consecutive visits to a random sample of licensed CAM therapists in four states (Arizona, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Washington) and compared the data with data on conventional physician visits from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. The data reported came from at least 99 practitioners in each professional group and were collected for more than 1,800 ambulatory visits. More than 80 percent of the visits to CAM providers were by young and middle-aged adults, and roughly two-thirds were by women. Children made 10 percent of the visits to naturopathic physicians but only 1 to 4 percent of all visits to all other CAM providers. At least two-thirds of the visits resulted from self-referrals, and only 4 to 12 percent of the visits were a result of referrals by conventional physicians. Chiropractors and massage therapists primarily saw patients with musculoskeletal problems (e.g., patients with back, neck, and shoulder symptoms), whereas acupuncturists and naturopathic physicians saw a broader range of conditions (including fatigue, mental health issues, and headaches). Visits to acupuncturists and massage therapists lasted about 60 minutes, whereas visits to naturopathic physicians lasted 40 minutes, those to chiropractors lasted less than 20 minutes, and a routine visit with a conventional physician lasted less than 10 minutes. Most visits to chiropractors and naturopathic physicians but less than one-third of visits to acupuncturists and massage therapists were covered by insurance. The investigators commented on the observation that CAM providers typically did not discuss with the conventional doctors the care that they were providing to patients who were concurrently seeking care from conventional doctors. This finding, they argue, in conjunction with the fact that patients rarely discussed their CAM care with their conventional physicians raises concerns about the coordination and safety of concurrent care. A lack of coordination and safety issues are of particular concern when care is provided by acupuncturists and naturopathic physicians, who might prescribe herbs that interact with medication prescribed by conventional physicians and vice versa. The investigators noted that although the overlap in the types of prob- ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. lems addressed by the four CAM professions is considerable, each profession has unique aspects. Chiropractors and massage therapists see the narrowest range of medical problems. However, chiropractors and massage therapists were the most likely to provide care not related to illness (e.g., care for wellness and prevention). Care for conditions other than illness in massage patients, which represented almost one in five visits, was focused on relaxation and stress reduction. Massage therapists also tend to see a substantial number of patients for self-reported anxiety or depression, some of whom might also want help relaxing and coping with stress. Another distinctive aspect of chiropractic care is the relatively large role that it plays in caring for acute conditions: about 40 percent of chiropractic visits are for acute conditions, whereas roughly 20 percent of visits to other CAM professionals are for acute conditions. As noted above, acupuncturists and naturopathic physicians see a broader range of conditions than chiropractors and massage therapists do and often provide care for such problems as anxiety, depression, fatigue, allergies, skin rashes, and menopausal symptoms. The investigators commented that the most notable differences between the practices of conventional physicians (i.e., medical doctors and doctors of osteopathy) compared with those of CAM providers was the relatively large fraction of visits to the former for routine physical examinations, screening, and diagnostic tests and for symptoms associated with respiratory tract infections. As can be seen from the information presented in this chapter, an estimated 30 to 62 percent of adults in the United States use CAM. A lack of consensus on the definition of CAM has led to inconsistencies among the reports of various surveys on CAM prevalence and patterns of use. Total out-of-pocket expenditures for CAM therapies were conservatively estimated to be $27.0 billion in 1997. This is comparable to the projected out-of-pocket expenditures for all U.S. physician services (Eisenberg et al., 1998). The majority of CAM use is not reimbursed by insurance at present; however, data indicate that prevalence rates are likely to increase as third-party reimbursements for CAM benefits become increasingly available (Eisenberg et al., 1998; Wolsko et al., 2002). High-frequency users of CAM tend to be high-frequency users of health care in general and account for approximately 80 percent of the total expenditures on CAM. Many appear to use CAM for wellness and not just the treatment of disease (Wolsko et al., 2002). Women tend to use CAM more than men, and educated individuals tend to use CAM more than poorly educated individuals (Eisenberg et al., 1998; Wootton and Sparber, 2001a). However, CAM use is common ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. among people in all ethnic groups (Barnes et al., 2004; Eisenberg et al., 1998; Mackenzie et al., 2003; Ni et al., 2002). Although Eisenberg et al. (1993) and Wolsko et al. (2002) did find that a significant percentage of CAM use is unsupervised and engaged in as self-care, existing surveys reveal little about what percentage of CAM use is self-initiated (“I go to a provider and ask for X”), provider initiated (“I go to a provider, and she recommends or administers ”), provider administered (“She does to me [massage, acupuncture, chiropractic]), or self-administered (“I read how to do it or someone shows me, and then I do it myself in a fashion I find comfortable; I self-regulate herbs, etc.).” Furthermore, few data are available on how the American public makes decisions about accessing CAM therapies. Finally, although there is an extensive literature on adherence to conventional treatment, there are virtually no data on rates of adherence to CAM treatment or self-treatment with CAM. This information is crucial to assessments of the real-world effectiveness and safety of CAM use. A majority of patients who use CAM do not disclose such use to their physicians. Nondisclosure raises important safety issues, for example, the potential interactions of medications with herbs used as part of a CAM therapy. In addition, a majority of adults who use CAM therapies use more than one CAM modality and do so in combination with conventional medical care (Wolsko et al., 2002). Most adults who use both conventional and CAM therapies tend to value both for different purposes (Druss and Rosenheck, 1999; Eisenberg et al., 2001). Additionally, given the high rates of use of both CAM and conventional medicine by those with chronic conditions, there is a need for a better understanding of what motivates patients with such conditions to seek both CAM and conventional medical services and the cost implications of combined care. The motivations for using CAM are numerous and are poorly captured by large-scale surveys; however, a major contributor appears to be the pursuit of wellness (Astin, 1998; Kessler et al., 2001; Wolsko et al., 2002). The extent to which CAM use is a trigger for positive behavioral change is unknown, however, and constitutes an important research issue because of the benefit of positive behavioral change to the public’s health and its use as a means to address the escalating costs of health care. Longitudinal cohort studies can clarify people’s trajectories of CAM use and those factors that influence upward and downward rates of use. Research designs that enable examination of patterns of CAM use need to be developed, as the patterns of CAM use are affected by external variables and influence other patterns of behavior important for health (e.g., diet, exercise, and substance use). Studies similar in structure to the Framingham Heart Study or the Nurses’ Health Study (both of which are ongoing and which could be expanded to include questions about CAM) may offer the best opportunity to explore ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. the patterns of CAM use over time and the role of CAM (or lack thereof) in promoting health, reducing risk, and preventing disease. There is also little research on how the public obtains information about CAM modalities; what types of information are deemed credible, marginal, and spurious; how the public understands the information in terms of risks and benefits and how such perceptions inform decision making; and what the public expects providers to tell them. The few small studies that do exist illustrate that considerable misinformation is dispersed by vendors and on the Internet (Ashar et al., 2003; Bonakdar, 2002; Glisson et al., 2003; Matthews et al., 2003; Mills et al., 2003; Morris and Avorn, 2003). It is important to understand more about how the public is accessing information and making decisions about CAM use to move toward informed decision making about such therapies. Furthermore, closer monitoring of websites, enforcement of DSHEA and Federal Trade Commission regulations, and the creation of a user-friendly authoritative website on CAM modalities are needed. As a means to address the lack of information discussed above, the committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other public or private agencies sponsor quantitative and qualitative research to examine The social and cultural dimensions of illness experiences, health care-seeking processes and preferences, and practitioner-patient interaction; How often users of CAM, including patients and providers, adhere to treatment instructions and guidelines; The effects of CAM on wellness and disease prevention; How the American public accesses and evaluates information about CAM modalities; and Adverse events associated with CAM therapies and interactions between CAM and conventional treatments. Periodic surveys, especially in-depth instruments, would allow assessment of aspects of CAM prevalence, cost, and patterns of use that would not otherwise be captured by sentinel surveillance sites or ongoing, federally funded surveys. As discussed throughout this chapter we have little information about many aspects of CAM use. Surveys could, for example, provide much needed information about out-of-pocket costs and insured coverage for individual therapies; about the ingestion of individual prescription drugs, over-the-counter preparations, herbs, and supplements; the frequency of disclosure to one’s doctor, nurse, pharmacist, or CAM provider about use of CAM therapies and the reasons for nondisclosure; and compliance issues including whether or to what extent use of CAM inter- ""2 Prevalence, Cost, and Patterns of CAM Use."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. feres with compliance with conventional treatments. Surveys could explore in depth the motivations for using CAM and investigate perceptions about various CAM therapies (and therapists) as compared with conventional therapies or therapists, stratified by disease, complaint, or CAM modality. Surveys are needed to provide information about how people obtain information about CAM; to investigate the impact of one person’s CAM involvement on that person’s immediate family or larger social network; and the impact of direct advertising to the public or the influence of CAM therapists and retailers of CAM products. Further, the committee recommends that the National Library of Medicine and other federal agencies develop criteria to assess the quality and reliability of information about CAM. When implementing the above recommendation regarding information about CAM, available criteria for assessment of health information in general should be examined and the applicability (or lack thereof) of existing criteria to CAM should be evaluated.

Integration of complementary and alternative medicine therapies (CAM) with conventional medicine is occurring in hospitals and physicians offices, health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are covering CAM therapies, insurance coverage for CAM is increasing, and integrative medicine centers and clinics are being established, many with close ties to medical schools and teaching hospitals. In determining what care to provide, the goal should be comprehensive care that uses the best scientific evidence available regarding benefits and harm, encourages a focus on healing, recognizes the importance of compassion and caring, emphasizes the centrality of relationship-based care, encourages patients to share in decision making about therapeutic options, and promotes choices in care that can include complementary therapies where appropriate. Numerous approaches to delivering integrative medicine have evolved. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States identifies an urgent need for health systems research that focuses on identifying the elements of these models, the outcomes of care delivered in these models, and whether these models are cost-effective when compared to conventional practice settings. It outlines areas of research in convention and CAM therapies, ways of integrating these therapies, development of curriculum that provides further education to health professionals, and an amendment of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act to improve quality, accurate labeling, research into use of supplements, incentives for privately funded research into their efficacy, and consumer protection against all potential hazards. 3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research 4 Need for Innovative Designs in Research on CAM and Conventional Medicine 6 An Ethical Framework for CAM Research, Practice, and Policy Appendix B: Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine Appendix E: Model Guidelines for the Use of Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Medical Practice Appendix F: National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Research Centers You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

Integration of complementary and alternative medicine therapies (CAM) with conventional medicine is occurring in hospitals and physicians offices, health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are covering CAM therapies, insurance coverage for CAM is increasing, and integrative medicine centers and clinics are being established, many with close ties to medical schools and teaching hospitals. In determining what care to provide, the goal should be comprehensive care that uses the best scientific evidence available regarding benefits and harm, encourages a focus on healing, recognizes the importance of compassion and caring, emphasizes the centrality of relationship-based care, encourages patients to share in decision making about therapeutic options, and promotes choices in care that can include complementary therapies where appropriate. Numerous approaches to delivering integrative medicine have evolved. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States identifies an urgent need for health systems research that focuses on identifying the elements of these models, the outcomes of care delivered in these models, and whether these models are cost-effective when compared to conventional practice settings. It outlines areas of research in convention and CAM therapies, ways of integrating these therapies, development of curriculum that provides further education to health professionals, and an amendment of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act to improve quality, accurate labeling, research into use of supplements, incentives for privately funded research into their efficacy, and consumer protection against all potential hazards. 3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research 4 Need for Innovative Designs in Research on CAM and Conventional Medicine 6 An Ethical Framework for CAM Research, Practice, and Policy Appendix B: Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine Appendix E: Model Guidelines for the Use of Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Medical Practice Appendix F: National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Research Centers You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

This chapter provides a context for the committee’s recommendations about research on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) that appear in Chapters and . A brief account of the development of present approaches to evidence-driven clinical and public policy (which includes practice guidelines and coverage policy) is presented. This is followed by a description of the basic ideas of clinical research design, including a taxonomy of study design and a taxonomy of outcome measurements. An account of some features of contemporary data analysis follows. The chapter concludes with an overview of the applicability of contemporary clinical research methods to some CAM therapies. A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH As noted in , over the past twenty years practitioners of conventional medicine have made a marked shift from a reliance on experience (directly observed or as recorded by others in medical journals) to a reliance on more rigorous research to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments. For example, the concept of formal evaluation of therapies through randomized controlled trials is certainly not new (Kaptchuk and Kerr, 2004) but has regularly been applied in Western medicine only since World War II (Byar, 1980; Cochrane, 1972). Some notable exceptions to reliance on experience exist, however. In the middle of the nineteenth century, Florence Nightingale pioneered the ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. application of epidemiological and statistical methods to the study of hospital deaths, and her discoveries of a plausible causal relationship between processes of care and outcomes led to challenges to thoughts about mechanisms of disease prevalent at the time, changes in clinical practice, and improvements in mortality rates. In the early twentieth century, Ernest Amory Codman, a Boston surgeon, argued strongly for the formal study of surgical outcomes in an effort to understand which surgeons, hospitals, and surgical procedures produced good versus bad outcomes (Neuhauser, 2002). This effort did not take root and grow—in fact, it provoked significant hostility among Codman’s colleagues—but it raised the question of the need for formal analysis of treatment outcomes that was picked up again more than 50 years later. The need for formal evidence of effectiveness for common medical and surgical interventions was recognized much more broadly beginning in the 1970s. Passage of Medicare and Medicaid legislation, together with apparent advances in medical and surgical care, contributed to a surge in health care spending. Policy makers and payers asked increasingly pointed questions about the “value” of health care, questions that required more fundamental questions about the effectiveness of interventions to be answered. Even more disquieting questions emerged from a body of work that described striking variations in the rates of common surgical procedures such as surgery for benign prostate disease, hysterectomy, and tonsillectomy, among seemingly similar geographic regions. This work began in the late 1960s in northern New England, where isolated hospital market areas could easily be defined (Wennberg and Gittelsohn, 1982). International differences in the rates of medical procedures were observed; and when the variations countries were adjusted for the overall rate of variation countries, a consistent pattern was detected; a high degree of variation was a marker for a high degree of discretion, and a high degree of discretion was often explained by professional uncertainty about effectiveness (McPherson et al., 1982). At the time, few of the procedures in question had been subjected to randomized controlled clinical trials or other credible clinical studies. Subsequently, variations in the rates of medical admission, physician visits, and diagnostic tests that could not be explained by clinical variables were also found. Taken together, these findings raised new questions about the science base of clinical practice. If decisions were based on science, how could it be that treatment depended more on where one lived than what was wrong or what one cared about? Policy makers wondered if high rates meant overuse and economic waste and if low rates meant underuse and deprivation. “Which rate was right?” became the pressing policy question and the answer required a new investment in clinical research to better define the outcomes of common interventions for common conditions. Thus, the practice variation phenomenon ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. provided the motivation and the rationale for the development of “outcomes research.” The goal of outcomes research was to determine what was known and what was not known about common interventions, thereby setting research agendas for common conditions. Existing evidence was systematically reviewed by using techniques for combining data from different studies previously described in the social sciences. Claims data linked to Social Security Administration mortality and other administrative data were used to glean outcomes information to fill the gaps in knowledge that existed at the time. Patient surveys were conducted to capture patients’ subjective responses to treatments and outcomes. Variations in these responses highlighted the importance of patients’ preferences as a source of warranted variation in clinical decisions. Decision models (a model is a representation of reality) were constructed to test the relative sensitivities of decisions to key probabilities of good or bad outcomes and to patient preferences. Decision support tools were developed; and trials were designed to help patients and doctors choose among treatment options, including randomization in a trial when a well-informed patient was at equipoise, that is, finding each treatment equally acceptable. Other investigators used consensus methods to develop appropriateness criteria that were then applied to the medical records of patients who had undergone procedures with high rates of variation by geographic region. It was common for procedures for 30 percent or more of patients’ indications to be deemed inappropriate. The proportions of procedures deemed inappropriate was essentially the same in high- and low-volume settings, so the low-volume providers were not simply doing a better job of selecting only appropriate cases. This work was extended with a focus on guideline development. Professional organizations such as the American College of Physicians instituted rigorous guideline development processes, increasing recognition of the severe limitations of the evidence base for the treatment of common conditions. The limited evidence base for surgery and other procedures for the common conditions targeted by outcomes research contrasted sharply with the richer body of evidence for medical therapies. This difference can best be understood in the context of the regulation of medications that began in 1906 with the Pure Food and Drug Act, which made misrepresentation of ingredients illegal and which recognized the standardized drug formulae registered in a national formulary or pharmacopoeia. The 1906 act was silent on drug safety and efficacy. ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 extended safeguards by introducing the distinction between prescription and over-the-counter drugs and requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to prove drug safety information before the drug could be released for use. This was a direct response to the elixir sulfanilamide tragedy, in which 107 people, most of them children, died when a new sulfa preparation was distributed without testing of the preparation for safety. In 1951, the Durham-Humphrey Amendment (U.S. Statutes at Large, 1951) made it clear that the classification of drugs as prescription was up to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), not manufacturers. In its initial form, the amendment authorized FDA to test drugs for efficacy as well as safety. However, the efficacy requirement was eventually removed before passage of the amendment. The next significant change in legislation followed the thalidomide disaster in Europe, which was narrowly averted in the United States and which prompted passage of the Kefauver-Harris Amendment (U.S. Statutes at Large, 1962) in 1962. All clinical testing procedures had to be approved by FDA and had to demonstrate efficacy as well as safety. The pharmaceutical industry resisted the efficacy requirement, especially the retroactive evaluation of drugs. However, in 1970, in the court case (422 F.2d 944, 955 [6th Cir. 1970]), the Court of Appeals ruled that commercial success alone did not constitute substantial evidence for efficacy in the case of the Upjohn drug Panalba. Evidence of efficacy as well as of safety had become an enforceable standard for prescription drugs. Over the ensuing decades, the pharmaceutical industry and clinical research organizations (CROs) rapidly built the capacity to conduct those clinical trials necessary to meet the standards set by FDA. As the need for evidence became more evident and funding for clinical research became more available, many academic settings emphasized development and use of methods for gathering clinical evidence. The multidisciplinary collaborations that formed with federally funded “patient outcomes research teams” matured as methodological expertise in clinical epidemiology, decision theory, and other domains of quantitative and qualitative research was honed. The “clinimetrics” work of Alvan Feinstein at Yale attracted more attention. David Sackett and colleagues in Canada and CROs provide a wide range of research and development services. CROs assist pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device companies to produce new medicines and new treatments (). ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. later England defined clinical epidemiology as the “basic science for clinicians.” Courses were devised to teach students and physicians how to critically appraise the medical literature. Fellowship and clinical scholar programs turned out clinical scientists with the skills necessary to generate and accurately interpret evidence. The Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Physical Examination and later the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force developed ratings for “levels of evidence,” which are described in detail later in this chapter. The Cochrane Collaboration was formed in Oxford, England, to systematically examine evidence for the full breadth of medical practice and quickly attracted an extensive international following. Journals with the titles and appeared. By the mid-1990s, the concept of formal, scientific evidence of treatment effectiveness had arrived, at least in some circles. The goal of evidence-based medicine is to ensure that, to the extent possible, individual clinical decisions and broader health policy decisions about tests and treatments be based on the published results of rigorous studies of efficacy and effectiveness. Because not all treatments have been subjected to formal study and because some treatments cannot be studied without investment in massive clinical trials, it will not be possible to base all treatment decisions on published evidence. Nevertheless, the concept of evidence-based medicine asks that decisions be based on published scientific evidence when it is available and that investments be made to gather evidence in as many areas of medical care as possible. In conventional medicine, there is now a general acceptance of the need to carefully study the effectiveness of tests and treatments, even those that have already become frequently used. Just in the past 3 years, prominent studies have challenged the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation and high-dose chemotherapy for breast cancer (Farquhar et al., 2003), arthroscopic surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee (Moseley et al., 2002), and the use of estrogen replacement therapy during menopause (Rossouw et al., 2002). There are clearly treatments for which evidence of effectiveness is immediate and compelling. It may be unnecessary or even unethical to conduct formal effectiveness trials in a variety of situations, for example, when a treatment results in a combination of a clear reversal or elimination of a disease process, has a short latency of noticeable effect, is nearly universally effective in all patients treated, and eliminates clinical symptoms. The use of penicillin in the mid-1940s, surgery for appendicitis, and resection of localized cancers all stand as examples of this sort of undisputed effectiveness. Even in these examples, there may be value in conducting long-term surveillance studies to detect rare or late complications or side effects, and it may be appropriate to conduct formal cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit studies. ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. At the other end of the spectrum are those interventions that have modest effects, if any at all. It is these interventions that require studies with rigorous design and of rigorous execution to determine whether an effect does indeed exist and to estimate its size. The next section examines a variety of research methods available for use in conducting clinical effectiveness research. BASIC FEATURES OF CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH Many factors can influence the outcome of treatment. These include the treatment itself, characteristics of the patient (such as age, gender, and comorbid conditions), other treatments, access to care, adherence to treatment plans, socioeconomic status and education, and the skill of the practitioner. In treatment effectiveness research, the goal is to evaluate the contribution of one of these factors, treatment, to determine whether treatment makes a difference. Doing so can be difficult if other factors are at play, as they often are. The goal of study designs is usually to make it possible to assess the contribution of the treatment after the other influences on outcome are taken into account. In a study comparing two clinical interventions, the goal is to be sure that any difference observed is due to the differences in the two interventions rather than some other factor. The “some other factor” is a “confounder,” because it confounds one’s efforts to draw the conclusion that differences between the interventions are responsible for the differences in outcomes. The best way to be sure that one can draw a strong conclusion from a difference in outcomes is to assign subjects randomly to receive one intervention or the other. If the randomization is successful and the number of patients is large enough, the two study populations will be essentially identical except for the different interventions. If one conducts the study so that, except for the intervention, the study populations are also identical at the end of the study, the researchers can make a very strong inference that the cause of the differences in outcomes is the difference in the interventions. Randomization is powerful because it ensures that the two populations are similar in every respect except for the intervention to which the researchers randomly assigned the patients. This claim means that if the study groups are large enough and the randomization was successful, the frequencies of ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. all known factors (e.g., age, gender, and comorbid conditions) are similar in both groups; in addition, and perhaps more importantly, the frequency of any or factor will be the same in both groups. Randomized trials stand at the top of the hierarchy of evidence because they make it possible to infer a cause-and-effect relationship between an intervention and an outcome. Because the study groups are identical except for the intervention, any effect on outcomes must be due to the intervention. Other methods for studying the effects of two interventions rely on data derived from the observation of care. In contrast to a randomized trial, no one intervenes in an observational study. Instead, researchers use information about the patients to try to make inferences about the relationship of clinical factors (including treatment) to clinical outcomes. Sometimes, researchers collect the information systematically (a prospective study); other times, the data represent patient care as it happened in the past (retrospective study). In either case, the crucial distinguishing feature of an observational study is that receipt of the intervention depends on clinical circumstances and preferences rather than deliberate assignment, as in a randomized clinical trial. These circumstances that influence choice of treatment may also influence the outcomes. Differences in outcomes may therefore be due to the intervention other circumstances, or a combination of both. Observational studies have many advantages. They are much less costly than randomized trials, they can have huge study populations, and the results are more likely to represent practice (Benson and Hartz, 2000). However, the circumstances that influence the choice of treatment often the interpretation of differences in outcomes. The frequencies of potential confounders may differ between those who receive the intervention and those who do not. To evaluate differences in outcomes independently of the influence of possible confounders, researchers perform multivariable regression techniques on the data. The variables used in the statistical model are either the several candidate predictor variables (the treatment itself and other potential confounders, such as demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics of the patient, comorbid conditions, and socioeconomic factors) or the dependent variable (the outcome that the model is trying to predict). These techniques effectively adjust the frequencies of the confounders measured so that they occur at the same rate in both the treatment and the no-treatment groups. If the treatment is still a statistically significant predictor of an outcome, researchers can infer an association between the outcome and the treatment. However, they cannot infer that the treatment causes the outcome because the statistical techniques can ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. only adjust for differences in the confounders that the researchers measured. Unmeasured confounders are thus the bane of researchers who conduct observational studies. Therefore, the possibility that a confounding variable is responsible for observed differences means that one must express conclusions in terms of association rather than causation. Even then, researchers must be cautious in their conclusions because it is possible that the apparent association between two variables is actually the result of a third variable (the confounder) that is affecting the two variables at the same time so that they change in concert. In observational studies, the researchers must guard against concluding that the change in one variable is the consequence of the change in the other variable (cause and effect). Observational studies come in several forms: cohort studies, case-control studies, case series, and cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Each of these is described below. A cohort study (in the context of treatment effectiveness research) is the formal collection and analysis of data on treatments and outcomes for a defined set of patients with similar clinical characteristics. For example, a researcher might study pain and disability levels as outcomes in a cohort of patients older than 70 years of age who received lumbar fusion surgery for severe sciatica. The distinguishing feature of cohort studies is that researchers gather data on treatment and possible confounders at one point in time and measure outcomes at a later point in time. Cohort studies are a relatively powerful form of study design because researchers can often statistically adjust the final outcomes (e.g., levels of pain) for differences in the outcome variable at the beginning of the study (pain levels before surgery) and because they can measure the outcome variable at many points in time (e.g., from monthly pain reports for up to 2 years after surgery). The assembly of a cohort is the first step. It may take place in the present as a deliberate, planned activity in which the researchers gather data on the present state of the participants (prospective cohort), or it may rely upon data gathered in the past (retrospective cohort). In either case, the investigators use specific inclusion and exclusion criteria to define a group of people with many similarities. Even though members of the cohort are similar in terms of the inclusion criteria (in the example cited above, all patients will be older than age 70 years, all will have had fusion surgery, and all will have had severe sciatica before surgery), they will inevitably differ in many other predictors of outcome. For example, some members of the spine surgery cohort may be 70 years old and others may be 85 years old. Some may be overweight and others may be thin. Some will be engaged ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. in regularly physical activity, and others will be sedentary. Some will have a spouse or caregiver available to help with work at home; others will be on their own. All of these factors, and countless others, may have influences on treatment outcomes. Researchers try to identify and record as many of these factors as possible, but inevitably some potentially important factors are not measured. Outcome measurement is the second major step. The researchers measure outcomes at a future time relative to the date of cohort assembly. With a prospective cohort, measurement of outcomes occurs in the future at specific time points relative to the date of treatment. With a retrospective cohort, the outcomes may have occurred in the past relative to the date of treatment and may have to be abstracted from existing data systems or may still occur in the future if members of the cohort are still alive and available for follow-up. The study population in a case-control study in the domain of treatment effectiveness consists of the cases (those with the target outcome, such as complete pain relief) and the controls (those without the target outcome, for example, those with continued pain). Case-control studies are especially well-suited to studies of rare events, because cases (those experiencing the event) are oversampled relative to the controls. Case-control studies are typically retrospective, in that the researchers assemble the study population after the measurable outcome events have occurred. If adequate numbers of patients are available, researchers choose the controls by matching each control patient (or several control patients) to one case patient for variables such as age, sex, and date of entry into the population from which the researchers identify cases and controls. The next step is to measure rates of exposure to a treatment (e.g., a surgical procedure) for the cases and the controls. The ratio of the rates of exposure to the intervention for those who experience the outcome (cases) and those who do not experience it (controls) is mathematically equivalent to the ratio of the outcomes in those exposed to the intervention to the rate in those not exposed to it. Thus, the outcome of a case-control study is a rate ratio or an odds ratio of the target condition frequency in exposed patients versus that in unexposed patients. Researchers may perform regression analysis techniques to adjust the cases and controls for differences in potential confounders. The Achilles heel of a case-control study is confounders, and the researchers’ greatest challenge is assembling the control group to avoid confounders. One way to accomplish this task is to choose cases and controls from a cohort that the researchers assembled using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria (a so-called nested case-control study). A case series is simply a serial collection of patients with ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. some defining characteristic. A typical case series is a group of patients who have a rare diagnosis or who have undergone a new surgical procedure. In the context of treatment effectiveness research, a case series would be a consecutive set of patients who received a particular treatment. Case series do not have controls, so that it is very difficult to make any inferences about whether an intervention (a treatment or surgical procedure) had any effect. An exception would have been the first group of patients with pneumonia who received penicillin and experienced rates of survival that were unprecedented in the era before penicillin. In surgical research, it is reasonably common to publish results of case series studies and to compare the outcomes to those for other published case series for patients with the same underlying condition. These “historical controls” provide a basis for comparison of outcomes for the new treatment, but it is even more difficult to draw inferences in a case series study than in either a prospective or a retrospective cohort study because the patients in the comparison group were treated at a different place and at a different time, so there are confounders related to place and time, in addition to the confounders in the cohort study related to the patients’ clinical and personal characteristics. Cross-sectional studies measure the relationship between variables at a single point in time. Cross-sectional studies are a relatively weak study design for the testing of hypotheses about treatment-outcome relationships because they rely upon a single measurement of each variable. A survey is a typical cross-sectional study design. Longitudinal studies measure the relationship between variables at two or more points in time. In effectiveness studies, longitudinal studies would typically involve the measurement of outcomes at several points after treatment. They are a relatively powerful method for the testing of hypotheses because repeating a measurement many times (or even once) for an individual reduces statistical variation and narrows confidence intervals. Treatment outcomes can be objective or subjective. Objective outcomes are visible or measurable to people other than the patient, and subjective outcomes can be felt or reported only by the patient. One of the major contributions of the outcomes management movement in the late 1980s and early 1990s was to raise the status of subjective measures as valid scientific endpoints in clinical trials and other forms of research studies. Advances in the technology of subjective measurement made that change possible, so that it is now common to find a mix of subjective and objective endpoints in many clinical trials. ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. Subjective outcomes include those symptoms and other aspects of a patient’s experience that are not directly observable by others, but that represent the goals of treatment. Pain, sensations of nausea or dizziness, functional status, ability to perform activities of daily living, and experience of moods or emotional states are examples of subjective outcomes for which well-developed and widely used measures exist (Bowling, 1997; Frank-Stromborg and Olsen, 1997; McDowell and Newell, 1996). Because there is no direct way to validate a patient’s report of pain level or mood state, the development of valid measures requires careful attention to issues of reliability (i.e., whether measures taken at two adjacent points in time yield the same result or whether two closely related versions of the same scale yield the same result) and convergent validity (i.e., whether the results of two presumably related, but different, measures actually yield similar results). Because patients’ responses to single questions or item formats may be affected by idiosyncrasies of wording and interpretation, it is common for measures of subjective outcomes to be based on multi-item scales with different wordings and response formats. Patient reports may also be sensitive to context or contrast effects (for example, a relatively modest “absolute” level of pain may feel uncomfortable if it is new but may feel very minor if it has been preceded by a long period of excruciating, severe pain). The subjective domains for which well-established measures exist cover many of the endpoints of CAM treatments. Existing measures can be and have been used in studies of the effectiveness of treatments involving CAM. Some subjective domains are more unique to specific CAM modalities (e.g., feelings of “centeredness” or “wholeness”) and some additional measurement work may be required for these modalities; but in principle, virtually any subjective experience can be captured either as present or absent or as present as a matter of degree. Because subjective experiences cannot be independently validated, and because they can be significantly affected by context, contrast, and expectation effects, it is particularly important to try to build in features of the study design that minimize these kinds of biases. “Blinding” the patient to the specific treatment that he or she has received, for example, is a way to minimize the effects of expectations on reports of subjective outcomes. Careful selection of patients who are all similar in terms of the level of pain or disability at the time of treatment is a way to minimize contrast effects. Having the outcome assessment done by a person other than the treating clinician is a way to minimize the biasing effects from the desire of a patient to please the clinician. ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. Objective outcomes include those things that can be felt, seen, heard, or measured in some way by someone other than the patient. Status as alive or dead, weight, blood pressure, tumor size, white blood cell counts, and levels of blood sugar all represent examples of objective measures used regularly in treatment effectiveness studies. In conventional medicine, the vast range of tests possible in the domains of laboratory tests, radiologic and nuclear imaging, physical examination, electrical recording (electrocardiograms, electroencephalograms, and electromyograms) are all potential means of obtaining objective outcome measures for specific treatments. Even though the data for objective outcomes can often be stored and made available for repeat testing by other observers (e.g., two independent radiologists reading the same X-ray image), there is still some potential for bias, particularly if the person providing a treatment or studying its effects is the person performing a test or interpreting the results of a test. Many objective tests still involve some judgment or interpretation on the part of the person performing or interpreting the test, so it is important to design effectiveness studies in ways that minimize any biasing effects of those judgments or interpretations. The most common way to minimize bias is to make sure that the person reading an X-ray image, taking and recording a blood pressure, or interpreting an electroencephalogramm is not someone with a vested interest in the results of a study and to try, whenever possible, to blind the person doing the test to any knowledge of the study treatment that the patient has received. Doing these two things minimizes the opportunity for any systematic bias either for or against a particular treatment being studied. To the extent that treatments involving CAM are designed to influence objective endpoints like survival, blood pressure, tumor size, or the alignment and spacing of vertebrae, standard measures of these endpoints, with appropriate blinding and other controls for bias, should be suitable for treatment effectiveness research in CAM. In the last 10 to 15 years, a consensus has emerged about the types of scientific evidence required to establish the efficacy or the effectiveness of a treatment. Doctors and patients adopt health interventions, such as a CAM therapy, because someone will pay the cost (such as an insurance company or Medicare) and because the benefits of the intervention sufficiently outweigh its harms. These benefits and harms are the of the use of the intervention. The outcomes movement or the evidence-based medicine movement in health care is simply the application of the principle that ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. societal and individual acceptance of a health care intervention should depend on the balance of its benefits, harms, and costs. The measurement of those benefits and harms, the balance of harms and benefits, and how that balance compares with the balance of harms and benefits of an established treatment are at the heart of most clinical research. This section discusses some core principles in comparisons and evaluations of health care interventions. Many possible solutions or interventions exist for every human complaint and every affliction. Some interventions gain general acceptance and become standard treatment. Some of these have strong scientific evidence to support their use. That is, investigators have tested formal hypotheses about the interventions according to established principles and have found that they are clearly superior. Others have little or no scientific evidence to support their use but have become accepted as effective because of their long-term use. For practicing clinicians, clinical research often addresses the question asked by many patients, “This treatment has worked for me in the past, so why should I switch to another, less established treatment?” The way to answer this question is a head-to-head comparison of the two treatments. In designing a study to this end and analyzing the results, a number of considerations can be important. This section describes some of these considerations, with particular emphasis on how they apply to the problem of predicting the response to an intervention. The data set from a randomized study of two treatments will contain many different variables. Among them is a measure of outcome (e.g., blood pressure at the end of the study); this variable would be the dependent variable in a multivariable model (the goal of the model would be to predict the end-of-study blood pressure). Another variable would be treatment assignment (Drug A or Drug B); treatment assignment would be a predictor variable (or an independent variable). Other predictor variables might include age, sex, ethnicity, pretreatment blood pressure, and dietary salt intake. One form of a multivariable model would include all of the predictor variables and might show that several predictor variables were significant predictors of the end-of-study blood pressure. One of them would be Drug A and another might be salt intake. In a multivariable regression model, these two would be independent predictors of outcome. This result would not prove that salt intake was a mediator of the response to Drug A, in the sense that Drug A had a greater effect in the presence of a low-salt diet versus high-salt diet. However, the model could be set up in a different way, with so-called interaction terms reflecting the extent to which the effects of Drug A and salt intake vary as the levels of the other variables vary. If the ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. regression coefficient for this interaction term was significantly different from 0, a researcher could say that the interaction between Drug A and salt intake was a predictor of end-of-study blood pressure. In other words, the effect of Drug A on blood pressure was not the same for all levels of salt intake, and the effect of salt intake on blood pressure differed as a function of Drug A’s presence or absence. The search for predictors of response would involve a search for significant interaction terms between the intervention and the predictor variables. A key element of a predictive model is its stability (its ability to give the same result if the study was repeated with a new sample of patients). One of the ways to predict the stability of a model is to count the number of outcome events. If the number of outcome events is small relative to the number of predictor variables in the model (a ratio of at least 10 outcome events per predictor variable is the minimum), the model is likely to be unstable. Thus, a model for the prediction of mortality after a surgical procedure would likely be unstable if the study recorded 15 deaths and the predictive model tested 8 variables. For this model to be stable, at least 80 deaths should have occurred. The reason that a model’s stability depends on the ratio of the number of outcome events to the number of predictor variables is that small samples are likely to differ from the parent population to a greater degree than large samples would (the law of small numbers). One needs substantial numbers of people who experience the outcome, because statistical models for the identification of which potential predictors are good predictors rely upon differences in the frequencies of the potential predictors of outcome in those who experience the outcome and those who do not. Distinguishing Between Intermediate and Distal Outcomes It is important for researchers to decide whether to be satisfied with measuring intermediate outcomes (outcomes that predict death or long-term disability but that are not death or long-term disability themselves) as a result of an intervention or whether to measure the effects of the intervention on the death and disability rates of those diseases directly (distal outcomes). The treatment of hypertension is an informative example. One can compare two antihypertensive drugs by their effects on blood pressure; or one can compare their effects by determining the rates of strokes, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction between the two groups of patients taking the two drugs. Blood pressure is an intermediate outcome, of interest mostly because it predicts outcomes that frighten patients, such ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. as stroke rates. It is much easier and much less costly to measure blood pressure than it is to measure stroke rates, which are typically small and which require many patient-years of monitoring for accurate measurement. Once several studies show, however, that lower blood pressure predicts fewer strokes, the decision to pay for a new antihypertensive drug might well rest on its effect on blood pressure, with the implicit assumption that the lower blood pressures brought about by treatment with the new drug relative to those achieved with standard therapy imply that the patients will experience fewer strokes. Therefore, although distal outcomes mean more to patients, it may not be necessary to measure them to determine whether a new drug is equal to or better than the standard therapy. The usefulness of intermediate outcomes in clinical research rests on the bedrock of a scientifically proven connection between the intermediate outcome and the distal outcome. It involves the assumption that the effect of a drug on blood pressure is the only determinant of stroke rates. A drug that affected blood pressure and blood clotting might have a greater effect on stroke rates than its effect on blood pressure would predict. Standard Outcome Instruments Versus Customized Instruments The rationale for standardizing measures of outcome rests upon the value placed on being able to compare the effects of different interventions. Compartmentalization of health care policy is shortsighted in the long run. For example, Medicare could be concerned about whether to pay for left ventricular assist devices for damaged hearts. If resources are limited, Medicare should consider alternative uses of the money expended on left ventricular devices. If decision makers ask, “What must we give up in order to pay for ?” they need a method that they can use to compare the interventions for one disease with the interventions for another disease. The growth of standardized outcome measurements is a response to the need to compare the effects of treating diseases that have different outcomes. How does one compare a treatment for diabetes with a treatment for back pain? One uses some measure that both diseases affect, such as ability to function in daily life (the SF-36 questionnaire or activities of daily living). Instruments such as the SF-36 have been used in so many studies that scores serve as a way to compare one study population with another. Many disease-specific instruments are also available. Cost-effectiveness analysis is an important tool for evaluating health care interventions. According to Garber et al. (1997), cost-effectiveness is “a method designed to assess the comparative impact of expenditures on ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. different health outcomes.” The importance of cost-effectiveness is its salience to setting policies in a setting in which resources are constrained and people must make choices that involve trading off costs against effectiveness. The salient word in describing cost-effectiveness analysis is “comparative.” The cost-effectiveness of one intervention is always in relation to the cost-effectiveness of something else, even if the alternative is doing nothing. The cost-effectiveness of Intervention A compared with Intervention B is where effectiveness is measured in clinical units and where QALY represents a quality-adjusted life year. A QALY is a year living in a specific state of health relative to the most desirable health state, usually perfect health. The relationship between a desirable health state and a less desirable one is a number, called a , which expresses the ratio of the patient’s preference for a specific health state compared with that for perfect health. Thus, if the patient says a year with heart failure is equivalent to 80 percent of a year spent in perfect health, the utility for heart failure is 0.8. Thus, a year spent by one person living with heart failure counts as “0.8 QALY” and a year spent in perfect health counts as “1.0 QALY.” In large populations of people, one can calculate the total number of QALYs that the population experiences over a period of time by adding the QALY values accumulated by each individual in the population over the time period being considered. When one expresses effectiveness in QALYs, it is possible to compare several different interventions directly (e.g., the treatment of hypertension and screening for lung cancer). This advantage is very important for health care planning, in which those who provide or pay for health care assemble a package of health care interventions, because one can choose interventions on the basis of cost-effectiveness and obtain a package of services whose components have values—expressed as the health benefits obtained for the money expended—that are consistent with one another. The analyst could express cost-effectiveness differently (e.g., the cost per patient death postponed or the cost per case of lung cancer detected). These methods are easier, but their use means that the power to compare interventions for two entirely different health conditions is given up. Estimation of the effect of an intervention on life expectancy, especially when life expectancy is adjusted for quality of life, requires a great deal more work, but most cost-effectiveness analyses calculate the cost per QALY. In a typical cost-effectiveness analysis, the analyst uses a mathematical model to represent the alternative actions (e.g., a treatment, a clinical test, or observation) and their health consequences. The analyst represents the uncertainty of future events (e.g., death or survival after surgery) as a ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. probability ranging from 0 to 1, and the outcome of various sets of events as a health state (e.g., death or survival with heart failure). The value of a given health state at a point in time is expressed on a 0-1 scale as a “utility,” and the cumulative values of health states over a fixed period of time are expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) (time spent in a given health state times the value placed on life in the health state). The QALY is a key element of cost-effectiveness analysis because it expresses length of life in a common unit: healthy years. By using a common unit, one can compare the desirabilities of two different health states. To compare two outcome states quantitatively, one must characterize each one by a number that reflects the desirability of the outcome state. This number is the utility of the health state, usually expressed on a scale from 0 to 1. Several methods that can be used to elicit a person’s utility for a health state exist. In many cost-effectiveness analyses, the researchers adopt a utility obtained from large population-based surveys (Torrance, 1986, 1987). The first method, the standard reference gamble method, is the most theoretically sound method but is also the most difficult for a patient to do. The second method, the time trade-off method, in which the patient is asked how many years in a particular health state are equivalent to the patient’s life expectancy in perfect health is easier. With this method a patient is asked, “How many of your 20 years of expected life in your current health state would you give up to have perfect health for the rest of your life?” The third method is the easiest but is the least sound theoretically: “Point to a place on a scale from 0 to 10 that characterizes your feeling about a health state.” Study populations are necessarily samples of the universe of people who are eligible for a study. If the study population is small, the outcomes are more likely to differ by chance from the outcomes that would occur in the universe from which the sample was drawn. Because the results from any one sample can be atypical, scientists use the concept of the 95 percent confidence interval, which is the range of outcomes that would occur in 95 of 100 samples from the universe. One can calculate the 95 percent confidence interval for the difference between two outcomes. If the 95 percent confidence interval for the difference includes 0 (no difference), the results of the study that gave rise to the difference are consistent with no difference. Statistical tests estimate the probability that a difference in outcomes ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. is consistent with chance, usually expressed as the “ value.” Outcome studies increasingly report the confidence interval of the absolute difference in outcomes related to two interventions. This method provides a graphic measure of the uncertainty in a conclusion. If the confidence interval of the difference includes 0 or a value that is very close to 0, the difference is not statistically significant or is of borderline statistical significance, respectively. If the lower limit of the confidence interval of the difference is far from 0, one can be sure that the difference itself is unlikely to be the product of a chance variation in the samples drawn from the same universe. Confidence intervals enter into the interpretation of predictive models designed to identify clinical predictors of a response to a treatment, such as an element of a package of CAM interventions for a clinical problem. The coefficient of an interaction term has a confidence interval. If it includes 0, the interaction term is not a statistically significant predictor of the dependent variable (e.g., Drug A, salt intake, and end-of-study blood pressure, as in the earlier example). Measurement error adds uncertainty. The inclusion of a measurement error widens the 95 percent confidence interval. Failure to take into account measurement error will lead one to overestimate precision and draw incorrect conclusions about differences in outcomes. Efficacy studies mean, by common agreement, that the comparison of two technologies has taken place under strictly controlled conditions designed to show a difference if a difference is truly present. Typically, an efficacy study will exclude patients who are likely to die of diseases other than the target disease for the technology under study to maximize the information value of each death in characterizing the two technologies. The study population of an efficacy study is typically narrowly defined (and therefore relatively small), which means that the patients are very similar to one another and, therefore, that the results may not apply to a wider population. All measurements take place under optimum conditions, and the doctors interpreting the test results undergo special training so that they give the same interpretation, for example, to the same computed tomography scan, eliminating one source of measurement error. Typically, efficacy studies precede effectiveness studies, and the results are used as a “proof of ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. principle.” After proof of principle, other studies may explore the size of the effect in different study populations, at different clinical sites, and under different conditions of practice. These are effectiveness studies. Effectiveness studies evaluate the technology under real-world conditions of actual medical practice. The study population resembles that which one would see in day-to-day clinical practice, which means that any results are likely to apply to real-world clinical practice. Effectiveness studies have a greater chance of measurement error if the researchers have taken few precautions to standardize the measurements. Although measurement error reduces the precision of effectiveness studies, study populations are typically large, which increases the statistical precision. Some researchers want to prove that their product is better than the standard product. If the new product is very effective, relatively small study populations may suffice to prove that the product is superior to the standard product. Often, however, researchers are content to show that their product is equivalent to the standard product. A typical situation is a minor chemical variation to a standard drug. The minor variation means that the patent on the standard drug does not apply, and the company making the new product can market it, as long as it is as good as the standard product. Thus, some studies are designed to prove noninferiority (the product is highly likely to be as good as the standard product). The designer of the trial tries to estimate the number of patients required to show that the two products do not result in clinically important differences in outcomes. One means to this end is to include enough subjects to be sure that the upper limit of the 95 percent confidence interval of the difference in outcomes (the largest difference that is reasonably possible) is slightly smaller than the minimum clinically important difference in outcomes. This technique almost guarantees that if the two products are truly equivalent, any difference actually observed between them in a particular study will be less than the smallest difference that clinicians would find meaningful. For all intents, the two interventions have equivalent effects. Suppose one is investigating the relationship between eating a particular brand of breakfast cereal and subsequent myocardial infarction. The greater the intake of the cereal is, the greater the incidence of myocardial ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. infarction is. Is eating the cereal associated with myocardial infarction? Now, suppose that cereal eaters and noneaters also differ in the prevalence of diabetes, with more cases of diabetes occurring in the cereal-eating population. The presence of diabetes is confounding the relationship between cereal eating and myocardial infarction. Diabetes is thus a “,” a form of confounder. Medications can also confound a relationship. Suppose that one studies the effects of two blood pressure medications on heart failure. Since high blood pressure is a cause of heart failure, the study will be stronger if the blood pressure in the two study groups is the same. So, the researchers allow the doctors caring for the patients to use medications in addition to the study medications to get a patient’s blood pressure to a target level. The other blood pressure medications are “.” Cointerventions can be confounders if they affect the outcome state, which is heart failure in this example. If the researchers do not adjust for differences in the cointervention medications, which may vary throughout the study, they may form an incorrect conclusion about the relationship of the study medication to heart failure. That is, what appears to be an effect of the study medication may be an effect of the cointervention. Studies that take place in many different clinical sites are increasingly the norm for the testing of major hypotheses about treatments for disease. One reason is sample size. More sites mean more patients, which means greater statistical precision and the ability to make strong statistical inferences about relatively small (and even clinically unimportant) differences (of course, one may lose statistical precision if the clustering of outcomes occurs, but a good study design will allow a larger sample size so that clustering does not reduce the statistical power of a study). The use of more study sites means greater variability in the patients and in clinical care and less risk that the differences between two interventions are due to idiosyncrasies of practice at a single site rather than the intervention itself. The use of more study sites also means that more investigators are talking among themselves and finding ways to strengthen the study that a single investigator might miss. A study at more sites also means greater costs, which often make a study infeasible without a corporate sponsor. Alternatively, the greater costs may mean less thorough data collection and a greater risk that the findings from the study will not be interpretable at its conclusion. Despite the costs, multicenter studies are the norm for the testing of important hypotheses. Relatively few studies of CAM interventions have been performed at multiple sites, so this form of research is an untapped opportunity for CAM researchers. ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. Conventional statistical methods assume that the outcomes for individual patients are independent of one another, so that each patient contributes new additional information about the relationship of an outcome to the two interventions. When the care given by different providers (either institutions or doctors) results in different outcomes, outcomes are said to be “clustered.” When a study takes place in several different institutions, which is common practice, it is possible that care provided at each of the institutions differs, so that knowledge of what institution is providing the care allows one to predict the outcomes for the patients. Under these circumstances, the outcome for each study patient is not independent of those for other patients at that institution, and the assumptions of conventional statistical methods do not hold. The assumption of independence when outcomes are related means that measures of variability, such as the 95 percent confidence interval, appear to be more precise than they really are. The true 95 percent confidence interval is wider than it appears to be from the findings of the study, which means that an apparent true difference may be consistent with random variation between the study patients who receive the intervention and those who do not. The use of an appropriate statistical design can account for the effects of clustering, so that the statistical power of the study and the widths of resulting confidence intervals are accurately known. Widening of the 95 percent confidence interval after this statistical adjustment is made means that clustering of outcomes is present. Clustering of outcomes makes it more difficult to conclude that a difference between two interventions is due to the interventions rather than to chance variation. Clustering of outcomes is especially important in studies in which the deployment of an intervention may vary from practitioner to practitioner or from study site to study site. CAM experts commonly cite the special role of the practitioner as a characteristic of CAM interventions, so it is important to know when outcomes vary in this way. If adjustment for clustering widens the confidence interval, the clustering of outcomes by provider or by site may be occurring. If some providers or sites are doing better (or worse), researchers have an opportunity to discover what makes certain providers or sites more effective. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (1996) and groups organized to develop treatment guidelines have adopted a concept of “levels of evidence” or a “hierarchy of evidence” that they use to rate the strength of the ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. The Evidence Rating System of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Evidence adequate to determine effects on health outcomes but limited by —Indirect character of the effect on health outcomes Evidence is to assess effects on health outcomes because —Limited power of studies (a wide 95 percent confidence interval that leads to inconclusive results) body of published data on a specific test or treatment. The Task Force’s approach to rating evidence appears in . Note that it does not use a hierarchy of study designs ranging from the most powerful (randomized clinical trials) to the weakest (case series). Rather, it uses generic characteristics of a study and of a group of studies. In effect, the term “well designed” reflects a hierarchy of study designs, but a hierarchy is not an explicit part of the Task Force’s evidence hierarchy. The principal product of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is recommendations for using preventive interventions in office-based clinical practice. The Task Force has a hierarchy of rating of the strengths of recommendations, which it has refined over the two decades of its existence. The hierarchy of the strengths of recommendations is important because practitioners, health care organizations, and payers pay attention to the Task Force’s recommendations. An explicit hierarchy of recommendations with definitions that are tied to the strength of evidence makes the Task Force accountable for the strength of its recommendations. A system of accountability reduces the chance that the Task Force will make an arbitrary recommendation. The hierarchy of strengths of recommendations appears in .

Strength of Recommendation and Strength of Evidence, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force evidence; benefits substantially outweigh harms U.S. Preventive Services Task Force makes no recommendation evidence; benefits and harms closely balanced Confidence interval includes clinically important benefits Another hierarchy of evidence, from the National Health Service Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, appears in . In contrast to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force hierarchy, this hierarchy depends on the study design, the number of studies in the body of evidence, and the consistency of study results. In this hierarchy, the combined results of several randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) receive the greatest weight in evaluating treatment effectiveness. The results of a single, well-designed RCT is given the next greatest weight. The combined results of observational studies or other non-RCT study designs comes next, followed by case series or anecdotal reports, and professional judgment or consensus. A recent IOM report (2001) proposed a slightly different approach to levels of evidence for research when the question considered is one of treatment effectiveness rather than efficacy. First, that report describes using an “effectiveness RCT.” Such a study would have the following characteristics: treatment provided by the kinds of providers who would provide treatment in non-study settings; no elaborate data collection (e.g., extra lab test or imaging studies); random assignment with one or more control groups. Further, that report takes the position that when evaluating treatment effectiveness, “the results of a single well-designed outcomes study should ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182.

In this report about CAM, the committee has chosen not to recommend one particular hierarchy; however, it does emphasize the following points: ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research.""

Systematic Review (e.g., meta-analysis of Several Well-Controlled Randomized Trials—consistent results Systematic Review (e.g., meta-analysis) of Several Well-Designed Outcome Studies or “Effectiveness RCTs”—consistent results Single Well-Designed Outcomes Study or “Effectiveness RCT” Consistent Findings from Multiple Cohort, Case-Control, or Observational Studies Single Cohort, Case-Control, or Observational Study Uncontrolled Experiment, Unsystematic Observation, Expert Opinion, or Consensus Judgments In general an RCT is the preferred study design if the issue is establishing treatment efficacy. More studies are better than fewer studies, therefore a meta-analysis of multiple good RCTs is better than one good RCT. Other study designs can provide evidence of efficacy or effectiveness. Meta-analysis of multiple non-RCT studies is better than one non-RCT study. Meta-analysis of multiple non-RCT studies may or may not be better than one good RCT; it depends on the details of the studies and the specific question being asked. If the question is treatment effectiveness, then some features of the typical RCT (stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria; treatment given in high-quality, high-volume clinical sites; detailed, frequent patient follow-up; etc.) create problems in generalizing findings to routine practice settings. Other study designs, including observational studies or “effectiveness RCTs,” may provide evidence that is at least equally compelling as that provided by an “efficacy RCT.” Effect size is another consideration that must be taken into account along with features of study design when one weighs the strength of evidence for a particular therapy. Treatments with clear, dramatic, positive effects in small or less well-controlled studies may be deemed “efficacious” sooner than treatments with more modest effects.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. The remainder of this chapter discusses the context in which researchers will apply these established research methods, including the idea that CAM users may present particular needs for research, that CAM interventions may pose particular problems in applying research methods that have worked well for conventional medicine, and that such interventions may also expose some of the weaknesses of applying contemporary research practices to conventional medicine. Lewith and colleagues (2001) have described the different decisions that various participants in health care make about treatments and how they use different kinds of information to make those decisions. Patients, providers, insurers, government policy makers, and others typically require different types of evidence and different amounts of certainty to decide for or against a particular treatment or treatment modality. The committee recognized that a discussion of evidence of CAM treatment effectiveness must be set in the context of the differences among users of information about CAM in terms of the decisions that they make, the information that they need to make those decisions, and the way(s) in which they think about treatment effectiveness. Researchers are typically interested in understanding cause-and-effect relationships between underlying mechanisms of illness, treatments designed to alter those mechanisms, and patient outcomes. Researchers trained in Western cultures and scientific traditions generally think in terms of linear cause-and-effect and try to identify the simplest possible causal models (i.e., the fewest explanatory variables and the simplest relationships among those variables) that account for the observed associations (Nisbett, 2003). Scientists from other cultures, however, may be more likely to think in terms of more complex “system” models that involve multiple factors and multiple levels of relationships and highly interactive and iterative, rather than linear, relationships (Nisbett, 2003). The results of a given study are taken as evidence of cause-and-effect relationships to the extent that certain criteria are met. These criteria typically include Features of the study design that allow strong inferences to be made about cause-and-effect relationships: ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. a well-defined population to whom the conclusions apply; a well-defined, sufficiently large, and representative sample drawn from that population; a well-defined and controlled treatment(s) administration; a concurrent control or comparison group(s), when possible, that receives either no treatment or some different form or dose of the study treatment; well-defined study endpoints (objectively defined and measured outcome variables); and statistical analysis to assess the likelihood that the findings are produced by chance. Plausible biological mechanisms, that is, the ability to fit the observed relationships into some larger body of theory and evidence on how the body works. Consistency of findings from study to study. A single study is rarely definitive, although some large, well-designed clinical trials may produce evidence that is treated by the scientific community as definitive. Confidence in the existence of cause-and-effect relationships grows with the ability to see them in multiple studies over time. Confidence diminishes when results vary from study to study. Dose-response relationships. In most biological processes, the introduction of a larger amount of a substance produces a larger subsequent effect. There is almost always some upper limit at which no further effect is found or some different or counterbalancing biological process begins to take over. For the most part, however, within a reasonable range of doses, more “cause” produces more “effect.” Clear dose-response relationships typically increase the confidence in the underlying causal relationships between the treatment and the outcome. Medical school, nursing school, and allied health school faculty require evidence of treatment effectiveness to determine how to train students. The standards of evidence for specific treatments are not necessarily the same as those used by researchers, but they are similar. They include The criteria for researchers listed above. Faculty have the responsibility to stay current with the published literature and generally to apply the same criteria to published studies that researchers apply. Personal experience. In addition, however, clinical faculty draw heavily on their own experiences in determining which treatments are effective and which ones are not. This may be particularly true in the context of ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. clinical rotations and residency training, in which much teaching is done on the basis of an apprenticeship model in a specific clinical environment. In this setting, both faculty and students have a chance to observe, directly and together, the effectiveness of specific treatments. The extent to which the treatment in question is a “standard of practice” in the medical community or is moving toward that standing. Students entering a profession become part of a professional community, and part of their learning involves knowing what the standards and typical practices of that community are. There is often a gap in time between the publication of scientific evidence of the effectiveness of a new treatment and the widespread adoption of that treatment by most or all members of a professional community, along with some appropriate caution and skepticism about new findings that seem to run counter to daily experience. Teachers train students in what the members of the professional community typically on a daily basis as well as what the published literature says that they or do. Clinicians treating patients have a somewhat more complex set of information requirements about treatment effectiveness, because they must know not only what has worked or what should have been effective in the abstract but also what they are actually able to do in the context of their own training and skills, their own practice settings, and their own sets of patients. Their requirements for information on treatment effectiveness include All of the preceding criteria, although many active clinicians will not have the same amount of time as their researcher or faculty colleagues do to monitor developments in the published literature. Consistency of a new practice with other aspects of current practice. A psychotherapist may accept the published evidence about the effectiveness of a specific herb for the treatment of depression but may be unwilling to incorporate the use of the herb into his or her own practice because of a professional commitment to therapies based on a different theory and conceptual model of mental illness. The availability of essential equipment, trained staff, supplies, and anything else necessary to provide a treatment safely and effectively. Many treatments require specialized equipment, training, or support staff that are not readily available to all clinicians. Difficulty in learning new skills (e.g., for new surgical procedures).

Opinions of professional peers. In an environment in which it is impossible to keep up with all new advances in treatment, the opinions and practices of respected colleagues are a kind of evidence of treatment effectiveness that is often dominant. Reimbursement policies affecting a new treatment. Even when all other criteria have been met, a new treatment may not be adopted if the provision of it will not be adequately reimbursed. The extent to which the patient population is similar to those studied in clinical trials or other studies of treatment effectiveness. There are always variations in published studies of treatment effectiveness, and clinicians may legitimately believe that what works for many or most patients will not necessarily work for their own patients, particularly if they share some clinically relevant characteristic (Park, 2002). Those who pay for health care through insurance care about effectiveness, but also about cost-effectiveness, since they have at least some responsibility to use the dollars available for insurance to produce the best possible health benefit for covered employees. Evidence of treatment effectiveness relevant to employers and insurers, then, includes The scientific evidence listed above for researchers. The preferences, expectations, and experiences of employees and their families. Employers are not insuring passive and uninformed people. Employees who have positive experiences with specific therapies will ask for such therapies to be covered by insurance plans and may use coverage for those therapies as the basis for choosing one plan over another at open enrollment or even changing jobs. Published cost-effectiveness studies (when available). Employers and insurers may legitimately refuse to cover treatments that are effective but that are so costly that their inclusion prevents the coverage of less costly treatments that provide more health benefit to larger numbers of people. Internal cost-effectiveness analyses (for some larger employers). Large companies with many thousands of employees may be able to use their own databases to study relationships between treatments and work attendance, productivity, or the costs of illness. This information may be more compelling than information in published studies because there is no question about the generalizability of the findings to that employer’s population. ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. Individual patients generally do not have direct access to peer-reviewed journals, and most patients do not have the technical background to interpret the results of published treatment-effectiveness studies. This information tends to be filtered through someone else before it reaches the individual patient. In addition, patients (particularly those with chronic conditions) have their own experiences to draw on and can judge treatment effectiveness by the extent to which their own symptoms or functional status improve with treatment. Information on treatment effectiveness for individual patients, then, comes mainly from Information provided by a clinician(s) in one-on-one treatment encounters, Direct personal experience (particularly for patients with chronic conditions), and The Application of Contemporary Clinical Research Methods to CAM: Some Cautions Although the concept of levels of evidence has generally been accepted and widely used in many domains of conventional medicine, some question its applicability to CAM therapies or to individual treatment decisions for specific patients. These questions particularly relate to the use of RCTs as the “gold standard” of evidence. Given the broad array of modalities that are included within the definition of CAM, it may be that some CAM therapies are more amenable to evaluation than others. Questions about the applicability of clinical research methods to CAM are described and discussed below. As noted above, the distinction between efficacy and effectiveness refers to the extent to which a treatment has a measurable positive effect in highly controlled clinical trial contexts (efficacy) versus whether the treatment has a measurable positive effect in routine daily clinical practice with unselected clinicians and patients (effectiveness). Efficacy refers to what a treatment do under ideal circumstances; effectiveness refers to what a ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. treatment do in routine daily use. Because the highest level of evidence in most evidence hierarchies is the combined results of several RCTs, the resulting recommendations will inevitably be based on evidence of efficacy rather than evidence of effectiveness. Difficult to Apply to Therapies for Which RCTs Are Difficult, Expensive, or Unethical It may be impossible to organize RCTs in situations in which the effects to be observed occur rarely, take many years to develop, or are relatively subtle. It is also difficult to conduct RCTs in situations in which the treatment is already in wide use and is generally accepted as effective. It may also be difficult or impossible to randomize patients to CAM modalities or specific therapies that inherently depend on patients’ belief, faith, or confidence in or relationship with a particular modality or provider. (See the discussion of “preference trials” in for one way to address this problem.) Hard to Apply to Treatments That Become Popular and Widely Used Very Quickly Study participants may not accept random assignment to a placebo or some other type of control groups if the general public believes that the treatment being studied is widely effective. Likewise, institutional review boards may not be willing to approve randomization to a placebo or another control group if the professional community believes that the therapy being studied is widely effective. In addition to the problem of organizing RCTs for widely used treatments, there may also be a problem with all other study designs that involve some form of control condition that involves administration of a possibly ineffective treatment. Relatively Long Delay from First Development of a Treatment to Assembly of Large Body of Evidence The FDA has requirements for research on new drugs before they can be prescribed, but there are no similar requirements for surgical procedures and most CAM modalities. In both cases, there may be a long time lag (several years, in some instances) between the development and the first use of a treatment and the assembly of a body of scientific evidence of effectiveness. For drugs, this lag is invisible to most of the general public, and some evidence from RCTs must have been assembled before a drug is allowed on the market. For other treatments, however, the time required to organize an RCT or collect the results of other types of studies means that a large body ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. of anecdotal experience will have been developed before more formal scientific evidence appears. For many CAM therapies based on traditional cultural beliefs, this time lag may be measured in hundreds of years. Emphasis on What’s Best for Largest Number Rather Than Search for What’s Best for Unique, Individual Patients A treatment is judged effective in an RCT if it is better than a placebo or an alternative form of treatment. “Better” means that the average outcome for the experimental group is superior to that for a control group, as determined by statistical tests that relate the difference in average outcomes to the variation in outcomes in the two groups. Unless the differences between the experimental group and the control group are dramatic, however, there are usually some patients in the experimental group who do worse than some patients in the control group (Park, 2002). What is best, then, for the “typical” or “average” patient is not necessarily best for patient. This approach to identifying effective treatments is fundamentally different from the approach that emphasizes individual tailoring of treatments found in CAM modalities like homeopathy or traditional Chinese medicine. The desire to have objective, well-defined study endpoints in RCTs can lead to a focus on health outcomes like mortality, tumor shrinkage, or change in a measurable physiological parameter like temperature or blood pressure. An exclusive focus on objective endpoints can lead researchers to miss or ignore other effects in the realm of subjective symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue, and cognitive function) and general well-being. For many CAM therapies, the treatment goals include feelings of well-being and mastery of the illness (Jonas and Linde, 2002); these will not be captured in studies with more objectively defined primary endpoints. Wellness Versus Treatment Effectiveness as a Research Objective Recent national surveys (see ; Astin, 1998; Astin et al., 2000) have highlighted the fact that many CAM “treatments” are not used to treat a specific current problem or disease but, rather, are used to either prevent disease or to promote a more general state of health and well-being. RCTs may still be used to assess the effects of CAM on general health or well-being, but such RCTs may be even more difficult to conduct than RCTs of the effectiveness of treatments for specific diseases. RCTs in the domain of disease prevention or wellness enhancement may require much longer time lines (e.g., 10 to 20 years or more), very large sample sizes because of the relatively low incidence of specific medical problems being prevented, or even larger sample sizes because of the potential of loss to ""3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. follow-up or switching of treatment arms over the course of the study (i.e., patients randomized to the presumed active treatment quit taking or doing it, and patients randomized to the control arm begin to take or do the active treatment on their own). Some outcome variables may be hard to define and measure (e.g., “I just feel better”), and effect sizes may be small, again adding to the sample size required for a trial to have a reasonable chance of detecting an effect if it is truly present. Finally, patients will inevitably be doing several things that contribute to wellness (or lack of it) over a multiyear study period, and it will be difficult to isolate the effects of a CAM therapy or modality from the effects of a larger package of lifestyle factors.

Integration of complementary and alternative medicine therapies (CAM) with conventional medicine is occurring in hospitals and physicians offices, health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are covering CAM therapies, insurance coverage for CAM is increasing, and integrative medicine centers and clinics are being established, many with close ties to medical schools and teaching hospitals. In determining what care to provide, the goal should be comprehensive care that uses the best scientific evidence available regarding benefits and harm, encourages a focus on healing, recognizes the importance of compassion and caring, emphasizes the centrality of relationship-based care, encourages patients to share in decision making about therapeutic options, and promotes choices in care that can include complementary therapies where appropriate. Numerous approaches to delivering integrative medicine have evolved. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States identifies an urgent need for health systems research that focuses on identifying the elements of these models, the outcomes of care delivered in these models, and whether these models are cost-effective when compared to conventional practice settings. It outlines areas of research in convention and CAM therapies, ways of integrating these therapies, development of curriculum that provides further education to health professionals, and an amendment of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act to improve quality, accurate labeling, research into use of supplements, incentives for privately funded research into their efficacy, and consumer protection against all potential hazards. 3 Contemporary Approaches to Evidence of Treatment Effectiveness: A Context for CAM Research 4 Need for Innovative Designs in Research on CAM and Conventional Medicine 6 An Ethical Framework for CAM Research, Practice, and Policy Appendix B: Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine Appendix E: Model Guidelines for the Use of Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Medical Practice Appendix F: National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Research Centers You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. Approximately one-third of adults in the United States use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) yet less than 40 percent disclose such use to their physician and other health care providers. Women are more likely than men to use CAM therapies; use appears to increase as education level increases; use patterns vary by race, depending on the type of CAM therapy considered; and those who use CAM generally use more than one CAM modality and do so in combination with conventional medical care (Barnes et al., 2004; Eisenberg et al., 1998; Mackenzie et al., 2003; Ni et al., 2002; Wolsko et al., 2002; Wootton and Sparber, 2001). Some forms of CAM are being incorporated into services provided by hospitals; covered by health maintenance organizations; delivered in conventional medical practitioners’ offices; and taught in medical, nursing, and other health professions schools. Insurance coverage of CAM therapies is increasing and integrative medicine centers and clinics are being established. What do patients and health professionals need to know to make good decisions about the use of health care interventions, including CAM? Of primary importance is determining that they are safe and effective. Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness may be important to both the individual and to society. In this report, the committee has recommended that the same principles and standards of evidence of treatment effectiveness apply to all treatments, with the understanding that certain characteristics of some CAMs and some conventional medical interventions make it difficult or impossible to conduct standard randomized controlled trials. For these therapies, innovative methods of evaluation are needed as are measures and standards for the generation and interpretation of evidence. ""10 Conclusion."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. The committee believes that it is necessary and desirable to use a variety of study designs to research CAM therapies. Given the limited funding, the committee suggests that the following criteria be used when considering the CAM therapies to be selected for testing. No intervention will meet criteria, and a therapy should not be excluded from consideration because it does not meet any one particular criterion, for example, biological plausibility. A biologically plausible mechanism for the intervention exists, recognizing that the science base on which plausibility is judged is a work in progress and that potential science bases for some CAM therapies have not been well studied scientifically. Research could plausibly lead to the discovery of biological mechanisms of disease or treatment effect. The condition is highly prevalent (e.g., diabetes mellitus). Some evidence that the intervention is effective already exists. Some evidence that there are safety concerns exists. Research design is feasible and likely to yield an unambiguous result. The target condition or the intervention is important enough to have been detected by existing population surveillance mechanisms. Ideally, potential new treatments go through a series of scientific challenges that, if met, lead to acceptance of the test or treatment and integration into clinical practice. Many CAM therapies and many conventional medical therapies, however, are already in widespread use without such validation. The committee therefore concluded that, in addition to research aimed at determining efficacy and uncovering mechanisms of action, research aimed at investigating what is occurring in practice (that is, effectiveness) is also needed. This report proposes that such research be conducted within a research framework with four major components: practice-based research networks, a sentinel surveillance system, CAM research centers, and input from national surveys. To ensure that research reflects as much as possible the actual ways in which CAM therapies are practiced, it is important to have CAM practitioners involved. However, most CAM practitioners do not have research training. CAM institutions focus primarily on training for practice; research training is rarely a part of CAM curricula. Investments in such training are crucial. The widespread use of CAM therapies has implications not only for research but also for the education of conventional health care profession- ""10 Conclusion."" Institute of Medicine. 2005. Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/11182. als. Health care professionals need to be informed about CAM and knowledgeable enough to discuss with their patients the CAM therapies that their patients are using or thinking of using. However, there are no guidelines for what should be taught, and there is great variation in the content and the methods currently in use. Suggestions for what to teach frequently emphasize critical thinking and evaluation of therapies as well as understanding of different belief systems. Although the content and organization of an individual educational program on CAM will vary from institution to institution, it is important for the health care professions schools to incorporate sufficient information about CAM into their curricula to enable licensed health care professionals to competently advise their patients about CAM. Furthermore, advances in understanding and applying CAM that derive from basic or clinical research should be incorporated into the pre-professional and continuing education programs of all relevant health professionals. The committee chose to examine more closely the area of dietary supplements because they not only are a prominent part of American popular health culture but also present unique regulatory, safety, and efficacy challenges to consumers, researchers, and practitioners. The committee is concerned about the quality of dietary supplements in the United States. There is little product reliability (Raloff, 2003). Reliable and standardized products are necessary for the conduct of research on safety and efficacy as well as consumer protection, and the committee recommends that the U.S. Congress amend the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) to require the appropriate reliability of dietary supplements. The committee believes that the goal should be to provide comprehensive care that is based on the 10 rules outlined in the Institute of Medicine report (IOM, 2001). A comprehensive system uses the best available scientific evidence on benefits and harm, recognizes the importance of compassion and caring, encourages patients to share in decision making about their therapeutic options, and promotes choices in care that can include CAM therapies when appropriate. Scientific inquiry into little understood or unproven ideas, no matter whether they are from CAM or conventional medical sources, can lead to new information that in turn can lead to improvements in care for the public. Health care is in the midst of an exciting time of discovery, a time when an evidence-based approach to health care delivery brings opportunities for the incorporation of the best options from all sources of care, be it conventional medicine or CAM. The challenge is to avoid parochial bias and to approach each possibility with an appropriate degree of skepticism or belief.

As demand for these services has skyrocketed, many treatment centers and facilities have begun providing holistic therapies and staff who are trained in integrative health. Holistic and Alternative Therapies in Addiction and Mental Health Treatment Despite its many names, integrative health, complementary medicine, alternative medicine and holistic medicine all describe similar services. So what is holistic therapy? Holistic therapy refers to the treatment of a person’s health with regards to their mind, body, spirit and emotional state. Holistic therapy may include non-medicinal treatment methods. It often aims to deliver optimal health by using natural or culturally sanctioned remedies. Physical, spiritual or emotional imbalances can cause disruptions in a person’s overall health. Holistic remedies seek to achieve or restore balance. Holistic medicine is a practice centered around the belief that . Practitioners of holistic medicine believe that positive changes require high self esteem and that people have the power to heal themselves. Holistic medicine asks participants to become self-sufficient and self-reliant, but also to know when to ask for help. This help should use a team approach that involves active listening from a therapist or practitioner. Staying connected to others is important and helps create a sense of grounding. The practice also asks people to be forgiving of themselves and to not expect perfection. One of the most critical principles of holistic medicine is this: Holistic practice asks participants to live life consciously rather than on autopilot. Though they sound interchangeable, complementary and alternative therapy describe two different approaches to treatment. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, the between complementary and alternative therapies is: If a non-mainstream practice is used together with conventional medicine, it’s considered “complementary.” If a non-mainstream practice is used in place of conventional medicine, it’s considered “alternative.” Truly alternative medicine and therapy is not very common, as most who utilize holistic approaches integrate them into conventional treatment. By definition, complementary and alternative therapies are different from conventional medicine. There is not robust evidence that proves their effectiveness or safety (randomized controlled clinical trials are considered the best evidence). However, many people with holistic philosophies use complementary practices along with conventional medicine to improve well-being. There are many different types of complementary and alternative therapies offered for a variety of conditions and purposes. Below are a few common ones. refers to the insertion of small, light needles into the skin. It is a practice that is at least 1,000 years old. The needles are inserted by licensed acupuncturists into areas of the body called meridians. According to the practice, meridians are focal points for energy within certain body regions. A similar effect can be achieved by running current through the needles (electroacupuncture) or by applying manual pressure to an area of the skin (acupressure). Western researchers believe that acupuncture works by stimulating endorphin production. is the intentional manipulation of muscles, tissues and joints for the purpose of relieving pain or tension. It is performed in treatment settings by a certified massage therapist. It is common for people to experience both physical and emotional relief from massage therapy. Chiropractic therapy is designed to treat mechanical (non-infectious, non-systemic) musculoskeletal conditions, especially those of the spine. The most common condition treated by chiropractic therapy is low back pain and the primary chiropractic treatment is spinal manipulation. Many forms of exercise can serve as active therapy alternatives. One study demonstrated that individuals with moderate to high levels of regular physical activity were 56% less likely to suffer from insomnia. Other studies have shown a wide range of as exercise therapy. Registered dietitians can assess for drug-food interactions and help people keep track of their food intake. They can help people make healthier grocery and eating selections as well as cook in a healthy and sustainable way, using good nutrition to support mental and physical health. refers to a multidisciplinary practice of mental, physical and spiritual fitness that originated in ancient India. In yoga therapy, a certified yoga therapist applies the practice and techniques of yoga to address specific health conditions and concerns. In this way, from simply attending a yoga class. is the practice of focusing the mind for the purpose of religious, spiritual or emotional enrichment. It can take place in many ways, such as in silence, with the use of chants or by using rhythmic breathing. This therapy involves inhaling fragrances or essential oils from plants or massaging them into the skin. This can help improve physical or psychological well-being. Common aromatherapy applications include lavender for anxiety relief and peppermint oil as a decongestant and stimulant. Naturopathy is a system of practice that treats medical conditions using natural elements while avoiding medications and invasive procedures when possible. Homeopathy states that a substance that would cause illness in a healthy person can cause wellness in an ill person. Homeopathic practitioners believe that dilution of a substance increases its potency. Reflexology is the application of pressure to the hands or feet to produce effects elsewhere in the body. Reiki is the practice of moving energy around the body with the use of light touch or hand motions. It is based on the ancient Chinese concept of qi — the universal life energy present in all living things — and its ability to be controlled and harnessed. Biofeedback is the practice of measuring bodily functions with sensors and using the information to develop awareness and control of these functions at will. Biofeedback therapy uses these measurements along with relaxation techniques to teach the patient to regulate those bodily functions. Hypnosis ( when used for therapeutic purposes) is the mind’s ability to dedicate focused attention, eliminate peripheral distraction and be susceptible to suggestion. Hypnotherapy appears to be gaining a strong evidence base for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Holistic and Alternative Therapies in Addiction and Mental Health Treatment The goal of many holistic and alternative therapy treatments is to restore balance, making them well suited for . Addiction involves a significant imbalance of energy, resources and priorities. Holistic approaches can be helpful in restoring that balance.

(Dotdash) — All rights reserved How psychologists use holism to understand behavior Kendra Cherry, MS, is an author, educational consultant, and speaker focused on helping students learn about psychology. Amy Morin, LCSW, is the Editor-in-Chief of Verywell Mind. She's also a psychotherapist, international bestselling author and host of the . In psychology, holism is an approach to understanding the human mind and behavior that focuses on looking at things as a whole. It is often contrasted with , which instead tries to break things down into their smallest parts.This approach suggests that we can only understand the parts when we view them in relation to the whole. In terms of psychology, the holistic view suggests that it is important to view the mind as a unit, rather than trying to break it down into its individual parts. Each individual part plays its own important role, but it also works within an integrated system. Essentially, holism suggests that people are more than simply the sum of their parts. In order to understand how people think, the holistic perspective stresses that you need to do more than simply focus on how each individual component functions in isolation. Instead, psychologists who take this approach believe that it is more important to look at how all the parts work together.﻿ As an approach to understanding systems, holism is used in psychology as well as in other areas including medicine, philosophy, ecology, and economics. One key phrase that summarizes the key idea behind the holistic approach is that “the whole is more than the sum of its parts.” The field of holistic medicine, for example, focuses on treating all aspects of a person's health including physical symptoms, psychological factors, and societal influences.﻿ In order to understand why people do the things they do and think the way they think, holism proposes that it is necessary to look at the entire person. Rather than focus on just one aspect of the problem, it is necessary to recognize that various factors interact and influence each other. One reason why it is so important to consider the entire being is that the whole may possess . These are qualities or characteristics that are present in the whole but cannot be observed by looking at the individual pieces.﻿ Consider the human brain, for example. The brain contains , but just looking at each individual neuron will not tell you what the brain can do. It is only by looking at the brain holistically, by looking at how all the pieces work together, that you can see how messages are transmitted, how memories are stored, and how decisions are made. Even looking at other aspects of the brain such as the individual does not really tell the whole story. It is only when taking a more holistic approach that we are truly able to appreciate how all the pieces work together. In fact, one of the earliest debates in the field of neurology centered on whether the brain was homogeneous and could not be broken down further (holism) or whether certain functions were localized in specific cortical areas (reductionism). Today, researchers recognize that certain parts of the brain act in specific ways, but these individual parts interact and work together to create and influence different functions. When looking at questions in psychology, researchers might take a holistic approach by considering how different factors work together and interact to influence the entire person. At the broadest level, holism would look at every single influence that might impact behavior or functioning. A , for example, might consider an individual's environment (including where they live and work), their social connections (including friends, family, and co-workers), their background (including childhood experiences and educational level), and physical health (including current wellness and stress levels).﻿ The goal of this level of analysis is to be able to not only consider how each of these variables might impact overall well-being but to also see how these factors interact and influence one another. In other cases, holism might be a bit more focused. Social psychologists, for example, strive to understand how and why groups behave as they do. Sometimes groups react differently than individuals do, so looking at group behavior more holistically allows research to assess emergent properties that might be present. Just like the reductionist approach to psychology, holism has both advantages and disadvantages. For example, holism can be helpful at times when looking at the big picture allows the psychologist to see things they might have otherwise missed. In other cases, however, focusing on the whole might cause them to overlook some of the finer details. Some of the key benefits of this perspective include: One of the big advantages of the holistic approach is that it allows researchers to assess multiple factors that might contribute to a psychological problem. Rather than simply focusing on one small part of an issue, researchers can instead look at all of the elements that may play a role. This approach can ultimately help them find solutions that address all of the contributing internal and external factors that might be influencing the health of an individual. This is sometimes more effective than addressing smaller components individually. By looking at people holistically, health care providers can address all of the many factors that might affect how a person is feeling, including their mind, their body, and their environment. When researching a topic, it's frequently helpful to step back and look at the big picture. Reductionism tends to focus solely on the trees, but holism allows psychologists to view the entire forest. This can be true of both the research and treatment of mental health issues. When trying to help a client with symptoms of a psychiatric condition, for example, looking at the patient holistically allows mental health professionals to see all of the factors that affect the patient’s daily life, and also how the patient interacts with their environment. Using this type of approach, therapists are often better able to address individual symptoms. Human behavior is complex, so explaining it often requires an approach that is able to account for this complexity. Holism allows researchers to provide a fully inclusive answer to difficult questions about how people think, feel, and behave. While holism has a number of key advantages, there are also some important drawbacks to consider. Some of these include: When trying to solve a problem, it is often important to focus on a particular aspect of the issue in order to come up with a solution. Holism tends to be more generalized, which can sometimes make precision more difficult. Scientists, in particular, must be able to focus their research on clearly defined variables and hypotheses. Looking at something too broadly can make it difficult to conduct tests using the scientific method, largely due to the fact that it incorporates so many varied factors and influences. Because holism is so all-inclusive, it can make scientific investigations very challenging and complex. There may be many different variables to account for, as well as a plethora of potential interactions. This can make this approach unwieldy at times. There are a number of examples in the field of psychology of how holism can be used to view the human mind and behavior. The early schools of thought, , are good examples of reductionist and holistic views. Structuralism focused on breaking down elements of behavior into their smallest possible components (reductionism), whereas functionalism focused on looking at things as a whole and considering the actual purpose and function of behaviors (holism). Throughout history, there have been other perspectives and branches of psychology that have also taken a holistic approach. is a school of thought that is rooted in holism. The not only believed that human behavior needed to be viewed as a whole; they also worked to understand how the human mind itself uses a holistic approach to make sense of the world.﻿ The , demonstrate that the ways in which individual items relate to one another can influence how we see them. When similar items are viewed together, the law of similarity, for example, suggests that people will perceive them as components of a whole. This approach can also be applied to the treatment of mental health problems. is a person-centered approach to treatment that emerged from the Gestalt school of thought. Rather than breaking down aspects of a person's past to understand their current problem, this approach to therapy looks at all aspects of the individual's life in the here and now. is a branch of psychology that emerged in the 1950s partially as a response to behaviorism. Where had taken a reductionist approach to explain human behavior, humanist thinkers are more interested in looking at behavior holistically. This approach to psychology looks at all of the factors that contribute to how people think and act, as well as how all of these different components interact. Abraham Maslow’s famous is one example of a humanistic theory that takes a holistic look at human motivation. This theory doesn't focus on any single aspect of motivation. Instead, it incorporates many aspects including environmental, social, and emotional influences. tends to take a holistic approach since it considers individuals in their social context. In particular, this branch of psychology looks at how group behavior is often different than individual behavior, which is a good example of emergent properties and the sum being more than its parts. One way to look at how holism and reductionism are used is to observe how these approaches might be applied when studying a specific psychological problem. Imagine that researchers are interested in learning more about . A researcher using the holistic approach might instead focus on understanding how different contributing factors might interact, such as examining how thought patterns, social relationships, and neurotransmitter levels influence a person’s depression levels. A scientist using the reductionist approach might look at a highly specific factor that influences depression, such as neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Much of the appeal of holism lies in its ability to incorporate all of the elements that make us who we are. People are infinitely complex and varied, and holism is able to address all of the external and internal factors that influence our past, present, and future. Different areas of psychology often tend to focus on either one approach or the other. While reductionism and holism are often pitted against one another, they both serve an important role in helping researchers better understand human psychology.

Diabetes Self-Management offers over 900 diabetes friendly recipes to choose from including desserts, low-carb pasta dishes, savory main meals, grilled options and more. In recent years, there has been an upsurge of interest within the diabetes community in dietary supplements and other alternative therapies. This development has most certainly been aided by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, in which Congress provided a new regulatory framework under which the industry thrived and expanded greatly. Dietary supplements are now a more than $23 billion industry in the United States. But unlike prescription and over-the-counter drugs, dietary supplements are not approved ahead of time by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for safety and efficacy, and only rarely are they evaluated by the agency at all. This puts a clear burden on the potential consumer, one that may lead to doubts and confusion about whether supplements or other alternative remedies (which are also not routinely evaluated by any agency) should be used at all. This list of resources serves as a guide to information about specific alternative and complementary therapies, as well to the decision on whether – and how much – to trust and explore alternatives to conventional medicine. THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION GUIDE TO HERBS AND NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS Laura Shane-McWhorter, PharmD, BCPS, FASCP, BC-ADM, CDE American Diabetes Association Alexandria, Virginia, 2009 This book is designed to show how herbal and other dietary supplements fit into overall diabetes care. It describes the purpose of each supplement, how effective it is, and how it may amplify or interfere with the effects of prescription drugs. The author is a pharmacist and diabetes educator who previously wrote a doctor’s guide to alternative therapies. An interview in which the author discusses the use of supplements in the treatment of diabetes can be found at the following Web addresses: Part 1 at and Part 2 at .

Home Entertainment New York, 2007 This book, written by a variety of authors associated with the famed clinic, aims to describe which alternative remedies should be used, when they should be used, and which remedies should be avoided. It addresses when alternatives to conventional medicine can be considered as treatment, and when they should take on a minor role or be avoided altogether. The potential of alternative remedies to be used alongside, rather than only in place of, traditional medicine is emphasized throughout the book. PRESCRIPTION FOR DRUG ALTERNATIVES James F. Balch, MD, Mark Stengler, ND, and Robin Young Balch, ND Wiley Publishing, Inc. Hoboken, New Jersey, 2008 Unlike the previous title, this book emphasizes the negative aspects of conventional medical treatments and proposes ways to avoid them. It lists, by condition – from acne to diabetes to osteoporosis – commonly prescribed drugs, and then alternative remedies that can supposedly be used in their place. It should be noted that the book does not recommend ending drug therapy or beginning to use a proposed alternative without first consulting one’s doctor. THE BEST ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE Simon & Schuster New York, 2007 Written by the former director of the Complementary and Alternative Medicine Program at the Stanford University School of Medicine, this book focuses on remedies supported by substantial clinical research and how to use them safely and effectively. It also addresses the mind—body connection, homeopathy, and spirituality, again with a focus on what has been proven to work and what has not – and what is still unknown. The book describes how alternative medicine is viewed in the medical profession and how it may be used in the future, and also has a section devoted to remedies for specific conditions (including diabetes). TRICK OR TREATMENT W.W. Norton & Co. New York, 2009 This book takes a skeptical approach to alternative medicine, examining the scientific evidence – if any – behind acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic treatment, and herbal medicine. It concludes that most – but not all – alternative treatments are of little value, and that those with a proven effect must be used carefully. A short guide to therapies is also included. ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE? A HISTORY Oxford University Press New York, 2008 More a frame of reference than a practical guide, this book traces the history of natural and folk remedies as Western medicine developed and became what we now know as conventional medicine. The author concludes that what is nowadays considered to be alternative medicine has, in many cases, been unwisely excluded from modern medicine.

7e75afc0-40cd-4033-a2c8-eb01e5fa2e61,"» Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) [vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer among American men, after skin cancer. There about 220,800 new cases and about 27,540 deaths from prostate cancer every year in the US alone. However, there are treatment options to address the disease, which depend on patients’ age and expected lifespan, any additional severe condition diagnosed, the cancer’s stage and grade, patients’ feelings and physicians’ opinions on the need to treat the cancer right away and potential side effects associated with each treatment, as well as probability of each type of treatment to cure the cancer. The treatment options for patients with prostate cancer include expectant management () or active surveillance, surgery, , cryosurgery (), , , vaccine treatment, and . However, some patients and physicians may prefer no so conventional courses of treatment, or in determined cases, complementary therapies may be recommended. This type of course of treatment is known as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). What Is Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)? According to the , complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a term that refers to “medical products and practices that are not part of standard medical care.” Standard medical care, which is also known as biomedicine or allopathic, Western, mainstream, orthodox, or regular medicine, is practiced by health care professionals including medical doctors, doctors of osteopathy, physical therapists, physician assistants, psychologists, and registered nurses. However, the use of other options is increasing among prostate cancer patients. “Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is common among adults, and recent reports suggest that 25%-50% of prostate cancer (PCa) patients use at least one CAM modality,” explain the authors of the study “Complementary and alternative medicines in prostate cancer: from bench to bedside?.” Complementary medicine is the term used to classify options used in combination with standard medical treatments, but are not considered standard treatments, while alternative medicine refers to therapies used instead of standard medical care. Integrative medicine is the use of standard medicine in combination with complementary and alternative medicine. There are many different options for complementary and alternative medicine to address cancer, but in the case of prostate cancer, there are three most common approaches. Acupuncture is one of these options, and it is commonly an example of complementary medicine. It is considered part of the Chinese traditional medicine and has been practiced in the United State for about 200 years. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of acupuncture needles in the country as a medical device in 1996 and it can help ease some side effects of the treatment for prostate cancer. Nutrition and dietary supplements can be an example of alternative medicine, since patients may adopt a special diet to treat cancer instead of anticancer drugs prescribed by an oncologist, or as complementary medicine when combined with standard treatment options. The NCI notes that “many studies suggest that CAM use is common among prostate cancer patients, and the use of vitamins, supplements, and specific foods is frequently reported by these patients,” and adds that these supplements include calcium, green tea, lycopene, modified citrus pectin, pomegranate, selenium, soy, vitamin D, vitamin E, among others. Meditation can also help patients ease the symptoms and emotional burden of the disease. The safety of complementary and alternative medicine cannot be generalized, since there are different approaches and places to find them. Regardless of a patient’s preferences, it is important that they seek out the opinion of specialized professionals about which alternative medicines are safe to take. One of the common mistakes identified by the National Cancer Institute is that since it’s natural, it’s safe. However, being natural does not necessarily mean it is safe, and the botanical and nutritional products available may negatively interact with other treatments. “Some CAM therapies have undergone careful evaluation and have found to be safe and effective. However there are others that have been found to be ineffective or possibly harmful,” emphasized the center, which explained that there is currently less research on these therapies due to time and funding issues, difficulties in finding institutions and cancer researchers to work with on the studies, and regulatory issues. “CAM therapies need to be evaluated with the same long and careful research process used to evaluate standard treatments. Standard cancer treatments have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through an intense scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients.” Note: Prostate Cancer News Today is strictly a news and information website about the disease.

55dd352b-fad8-4281-adc5-e6073ad0e3c9,"Natural medicine breakthrough in Switzerland: Five holistic therapies to be recognized alongside conventional medicine and covered by insurance Thursday, April 07, 2016 by: Jennifer Lea ReynoldsTags: , , (NaturalNews) The benefits of holistic therapies to help maintain good health, reverse certain ailments and even completely heal various conditions are something that readers are well aware of.Still, such practices remain the center of controversy throughout most of America, with a great divide often existing between conventional practitioners and holistic ones. Specifically, the issue of health insurance is a biggie; will yours cover co-pays to the hospital where you can receive the ? Of course. Will it cover visits to an acupuncturist? Unlikely.However, over in Switzerland, a natural medicine breakthrough has occurred – and it's something that should be embraced everywhere. There, five holistic therapies – homeopathy, holistic medicine, herbal medicine, acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine – are poised to attain the same health insurance status as conventional medicine by May 2017. This means that people will be reimbursed for such treatments, so long as they're administered by certified medical doctors. Switzerland gets the big picture; why can't the U.S. health system? The decision comes as the result of a six-year trial period that started in 2012 to assess such for their suitability, efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Before then, in 2005, health insurance of therapies was rejected by Switzerland's interior ministry, which cited lack of scientific proof concerning efficacy. Through the years, however, people in the country have thankfully embraced such treatments and therapies; in 2009, two-thirds of the population there expressed the desire for holistic methods to be considered on the constitutional list of paid health services.On the complete flip side, United States residents struggle to make such efforts a reality. While we know that over, say, health-harming Big Pharma drugs that are often prescribed at the drop of a dime, the reality is that many of us still get the deer-in-headlights look when declaring our preference of natural health options over conventional ones.Or worse, as was the case with Maryanne Godboldo of Detroit, Michigan. Child kidnappings, mysterious deaths and disappearances of alternative medicine professionals par for the course in U.S. In 2011, her door was broken down – unlawfully – and her 13-year-old daughter was taken away by armed officers. Child Protective Services ordered such actions, prompting a Special Response Team to engage in these behaviors.Why?Godboldo refused to keep her daughter on pharmaceutical treatments prescribed to treat her psychosis and instead, turned to natural remedies. Her daughter was put on psychotropic drugs after she experienced severe reactions upon receiving routine vaccinations in 2009. She was easily irritated and making facial grimaces – actions she wasn't exhibiting prior to getting the vaccinations. After going to the Children's Center, which supposedly had children's best interests at heart, she was given . However, once her mother took her off the drugs and she started using holistic and natural methods – at the recommendation of another physician – the authorities caught wind of this and acted swiftly, engaging in the aforementioned home invasion.Then there's the been the wave of mysterious deaths and disappearances that have stricken alternative health professionals in the United States in recent years. There was the gunshot wound in the chest – a highly unusual occurrence if it were suicide – which killed Dr. Jeffrey Bradstreet, a Florida physician involved with autism research who was known to challenge the medical establishment. He was found floating in a North Carolina river, his death thought to be linked to the rash of seven other deaths and disappearances involving health doctors throughout Florida.Oh, it should be pointed out that, three days prior to his death, the U.S. government raided his clinic in an effort to take away his , a molecule that may have the potential to cure cancer and improve autism symptoms.What will it take for holistic efforts to be more widely accepted in the United States the way they are in Switzerland? Sadly, and our freedoms to do to our health what we see fit is repeatedly squashed. Even though natural treatments that can dramatically improve our health exist, the sick keep getting sicker.

30ad5bc6-5a7e-4c16-8f1d-dbd096728d5d,"Originally published May 29 2013 Supercharge your brain with foods that stimulate dopamine production by JB Bardot (NaturalNews) The brain neurotransmitter dopamine activates the metabolism helping the body establish a healthy weight. Additionally, dopamine helps the brain generate sufficient energy to run the body. It stimulates the heart, regulates the flow of information through our brains, controls movement, and allows humans to experience feelings of passion and pleasure, according to the website. Dopamine production is boosted by the consumption of certain foods, especially those containing the amino acid tyrosine. Eating these special foods adds to our ability to respond optimally to our lives both physically and emotionally. All foods eaten should ideally be organic to avoid the effects of pesticides, chemicals and genetically modified organisms, or GMOs.Protein are high in amino acids, which are necessary for dopamine production. Include foods such as fish, eggs, chicken, turkey and red meat to supply your body with adequate amino acids. Fermented soy products such as tempeh and miso and other legumes are considered incomplete proteins; however, form complete proteins when eaten in combination with grains, becoming excellent sources for dopamine-related amino acids.Certain vegetables in particular are excellent sources of amino acids that stimulate dopamine production. For example, beets supply the amino acid called betaine, that aids in the regulation neurotransmitters like dopamine. Artichokes and avocados have also been found to increase dopamine levels.Ripe bananas are a major source of tyrosine, explains and as they continue to ripen and become sweeter, their tyrosine component becomes more potent. Tyrosine helps regulate and stimulate levels, increasing memory and alertness. Apples are recommended for being high in quercetin, a potent antioxidant, according to and shown to aid in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases by triggering the of dopamine in the brain. Remember to eat strawberries, blueberries and prunes to round out the best fruits supplying nutrients that trigger dopamine release.Raw almonds, sesame and pumpkin seeds make a great snack and help regulate dopamine levels. Almond butter or tahini, a paste made from sesame seeds, are excellent sources for the amino acids needed for dopamine production.Wheat germ supplies the essential amino acid phenylalanine, that's converted to tyrosine, which then stimulates additional dopamine release. Do not use wheat germ if you are gluten intolerant or allergic to wheat.Several common herbs are known for helping to regulate dopamine levels, according to These include nettles fenugreek, ginseng, milk thistle, red clover, and peppermint. They are best consumed as herbal teas.Adding supplements to your diet to increase dopamine levels may be helpful if you're unable to get those nutrients from foods. Tyrosine, plus several vitamins such as B, C and E as well as iron, folic acid and niacin all help to trigger dopamine release. Check with your health care practitioner before including additional iron in your diet.READ MORE OF JEAN (JB) BARDOT''S ARTICLES AT THE FOLLOWING LINKS: The JB Bardot Archives: Natural News: JB Bardot is an herbalist and a classical homeopath, and has a post graduate degree in holistic nutrition.

And we cannot find a great deal of fault with other items on the list—there are proven benefits to many, if not all, of them. One’s spirituality, like one’s mental outlook, has a great deal to do with one’s health. Tai chi or qigong, yoga, meditation, guided imagery—all of them are extremely helpful in forging a strong body-mind connection, which can indeed be curative. However, we can’t help but note that the Mayo Clinic’s list leans toward the “soft” end of alternative medicine. It’s great that their list recognizes the very potent ability of the human mind to create—or destroy—our health. But what we’re not seeing there is much of the “hard” end of the spectrum: integrative, nutrition-based medicine, backed by scientific studies and peer-reviewed research, to address illness and reverse the disease process. We would suggest a slightly different approach: therapies that have proven medical benefits, but which are usually found in complementary or alternative medicine rather than standard Western allopathic medicine. Our list would include: Emphasis on , together with the general avoidance of prescription drugs Key nutraceuticals like vitamins , , and , , , and CoQ10 Herbs for a great many health issues, including the treatment of allergies and prostate health Annual (which is different from and more extensive than conventional tests), including tests for heavy metal and chemical exposure, and omega 3 and vitamin D levels acid in most cases for stomach problems, not ; the use of probiotics for stomach and colon health rather than conventional hormone replacement products like Premarin, which is a dangerous mixture of horse estrogens Avoidance of harmful heart surgery (research suggests that far too much heart surgery is counterproductive) and other unnecessary elective surgery; avoidance of many conventional General avoidance of ; use of effective and largely forgotten bacteriocidal agents, which do not lead to drug-resistant bugs The fact that the Mayo Clinic has set up a department to deal with alternative therapies is not all that unusual. Many leading hospitals have them. They especially like the kinds of things listed by Mayo Clinic because they don’t compete directly with drugs and surgery. Call it “Integrative Medicine Lite.” So here is a question for you, our readers: What are Top Ten therapies in complementary and alternative medicine? Which integrative medical treatment modalities do you and your family find the most important and effective? Please give us your thoughts in the comments below, and share this article with your friends—we’d love to hear from you! You don’t even have to give us ten—just send us your list of favorites, however long or short. We’ll compile the results and report back in a future issue. 108 responses to “Top Ten Integrative Medicine Therapies” My top ten: Organic Whole Food prepared in a balanced menu Plan. Miso Soup Supplements with Curcumin and Probiotics and Vitamin D as top three. Herbs Essential Oils Pure, clean, cleaning products Exercise Meditation / Prayer Elimination of Food Allergies with NAET Eastern Medicine such as Acupuncture, Medical Qi-Gong The above has helped me stay medicine free for almost 1.3 years. Therapeutic touch, Reiki and Energy workers also need to be included in alternative/complementary medicine. Here’s my top concerns: •healthy food, dietary supplements, and exercise, together with the general avoidance of prescription drugs •Key nutraceuticals like vitamins B, D, and C, fish oil, resveratrol, and CoQ10 I suspect without healthy nutrition all the Tai Chi in the world wouldn’t be enough to keep me healthy. I would like to see superfoods included. Eating more of these is preferable to popping more pills (even supplements!) There are more & more to choose from, too! The supplement that has profoundly impacted my health the most is taking 50 mg per day of a combination iodine/iodide product. It has healed my fibrocystic breasts, helped the quality of my skin, stabilized the beginnings of macular degeneration in my eyes, given me energy to spare, removed any swelling in my thyroid, and improved my hypothryoid condition. I also feel better knowing it is anti-parasitic and anti-cancer. Acupuncture has been very effective for pain; so has chiropractics Vitamins, especially vitamin C Homeopathy Yoga, tai chi, walking, & strength training Reiki Pets & family Energy Therapy is one of the best holistic choices. Why? All living beings have an energy system made up off 3,400 chakras not just the 7 Majors and the meridians that connect the organ and joint chakra energy system. Energy therapy includes Healing Touch that has been accepted by the AMA and the Holistic Nurses Association, Traditional Usui Reiki and Therapeutic Touch. Like all professionals in the health care industry Western or Holistic we have the well trained and not so well trained so look for the best. Remember each of us must be pro-active in our own health for the best results. It is a Perfect Balance. Tarri Otterlee The word is “orthomolecular,” coined by Linus Pauling meaning correct molecules. Conventional Allopathic medicine can’t stand it because their doctors deal with toximolecular solutions. They haven’t a clue about how the body works because their medical education was preordained to teach concepts promoted by companies that control the curriculum of medical schools—pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore the laws governing medicine are corrupted by bias concepts of medical treatments that are supported by insurance companies to exploit the sick. That’s why the public’s ideas about alternative modalities are so feeble … to protect the status quo. Face it, the US is a greedy country that treats people like cattle? 1, Acupuncture 2. Homeopathy (including flower essence therapy) 3. Alternatives to antibiotics, such as ozone, IV C and the scenar device 4. Avoidance of all Big Pharma drugs 5. Dietary supplements (vitamins and herbs) 6. Exercise 7. Energy medicine generally (including the scenar device mentioned above) Digestive enzymes & probiotics Avoidance of antibiotics and prescription medicein herbs Vit. D (drops), B12 (sublingual), C Fish oil Wholefood based supplements, Chlorella healthy food (avoidance of pasteurised dairy products & wheat) No hormone replacement whatsoever (hot flushes keep me warm in winter!) Chiropractic no vaccinations Top Ten: 1 – Reiki 2 – Other energy healing 3 – Vitamins 4 – Diet 5 – Exercise 6 – Herbs 7 – Water (drink lots!) 8 – Spirituality 9 – Affirmations 10 – food allergy eliminations Since I find that I cannot tolerate antibiotics and that both MRSA and candida infections do I remain alive with the help of customized nutitional supplements,daily allicin concentrate,daily probiotic, daily resveratrol concentrate,generic vinegar (used externallyfor draining the MRSA lesions),bulk tissue paper (for sopping leakage from candida and MRSA) paper towel sections (for covering my MRSA lesions while I sleep) and paper tape to hold them in place. Well, Mayo is in the grip of Big Pharma, AMA and so forth. They have too much at stake to bite the hand that feeds them. So they want to look proactive without doing much. When I read a newspaper report yesterday I just shook my head. Your list makes a lot more sense. And, it is not endangering folks. Another protocol of the utmost inportance and significance is heavy metal detoxification and mineral balancing of the tissues. Take a look at our website. Rick Wagner 1. Acupressure/chinese medicine 2. massage 3. Healthy diet(organic, free range poultry/eggs, fish, vegetables/fruit, non-gluten whole grains(soaked), and some nuts/seeds. 4. Eliminating allergens/sensitivities. 5. Holistic exercise(yoga, Qigong, Taiji) and walking/hiking 6. Herbal tinctures and infusions 7. Supplements 8. Eliminating toxic chemicals where possible–such as using natural cleaning and lawn care products 9. Meditation 10. Balance with work/family/play time. 1. DNA custom guided nutrient blend 2. Exercise/stretching/yoga/pilates 3. Massage 4. Chiropractic care 5. Acupuncture 6. Holistic medicine 7. Organic foods 8. Food Allergy elimination/avoidance 9. Detoxification 10. Spiritual counselling I would like to find the natural healing therapies that will take the place of prescription. For instance: What are the alternatives to Plavix? Symvastatin? Why are all heart patients put on blood pressure AND cholesterol medicine even if their cholesterol levels are already low? (204-209) Thank you Leah Nelson As for the therapies: I’ve always been a fitness buff so this would be right up there. Certainly a good diet and supplements for all that is deficient in our foods. Using nutritional therapies before any surgeries are contemplated. In my case, keep the carbs limited. The actual Dr. Atkins diet or the Banting diet of 1860 would be suitable for most people. Limit all drugs, chemicals, Rx, and artificial additives of any variety. And I’d say practice moderation in all things including dedication to one’s health!! Most used by our family and in our practice: Shamanic Healing (we are 30 years active in this field: it is a ‘spiritual’ form of healing). Herbal Healing (we are practicing herbalists) Nutritional Healing, including dietary supplements and dietary guidance such as Blood Type and GenoType diets Regular Exercise Regimes A simple, green, lifestyle avoiding as many extraneous chemicals (in cleaners, cosmetics, foods, etc.) as possible. A focus on sustainability and local sourcing of, where possible, organic foods. You missed Chelation therapy. It saved my fathers legs who was a sever diabetic and was looking at having to remove his legs. Top 10?, wow that’s a lot of therapies. Hmmm. I guess my top 10 might me Clinical Nutrition (not dietetics) Herbology Naturopathy Traditional Osteopathy Massage Accupunture Chiropractic EFT Homeopathy Healing Touch Alexander Technique; Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils; CranioSacral Therapy; Visceral Manipulation (and other work of Osteopath/PT Jean Pierre Barral); and many other things on your list. The beautiful art of Jin Shin Jyutsu is my favorite complementary therapy. It is an all inclusive energy modality that works fully in its most simple techiques, which can be learned by all and implimented on one’s self, as well as it can be a life time study into all its complexity. All tissue, sbutle and physical are addressed by this art and its self help aspect makes it more assessable for home use than some other modalities. I have been a Jin Shin Jyutsu practitioner for 15 years and along with excellent nutritional practices, meditaiton and cranial/sacral work I have maintained better health than I had as a child and young adult for a total of 28 years. I am very thankful to know these harmonizing practices which support the body’s own healing systems. Sheryl My list could be quite long! Vitamins & Minerals/trace Minerals Endocrine Glandulars Chinese Herbals in combination with Ayurvedic, American Indian and Rainforest Herbals Co Enzymes CoQ10, Ribose Amino Acids in powder Green Super Foods in powder Suma G Nathan, Certified Registered Holistic Nutritionist Certified Chinese Herbologist, Holistic Health Journalist 30 yrs Professionally Chiropractic all the way! Especially upper cervical:-) Hi, I nominate ENERGY MEDICINE, which can be defined as working with the subtle energies of the body, including the aura, chakras, the meridians, and the electrical energies in non-invasive ways. Typically, we use specific hand gestures, movements, and acupressure to affect changes. This would include correcting problems related to electromagnetic pollution, stress, and toxins. ENERGY MEDICINE is something that everyone can use on self and others. There are schools that give advance training. Eden Energy Medicine Certification Program is one (started by Donna Eden). See if you are interested for more info. ENERGY MEDICINE is a dynamic and growing field as well as an ancient one. I’m quite surprised homeopathy [which has been my mainstay and that of my cats for the past 45 years] isn’t mentioned. It would be my first one, with acupuncture second. Chiropractic/osteopathy next. As far as I’m concerned, spirituality isn’t a “therapy,” it’s a way of being, a way of life. Thank you for all your constant and diligent work, for your caring, for your integrity. Viviane It is sad that so called Meca of medicine are still on the fringes.my top are Ayurveda tcm & Accupunture naturopathy homeopathy manipulative therapies including massage, chiropractic Mind body medicine, includinding meditation and Yoga nutritional medicine, medicine is your food and food is your medicine Energy medicine All of the above have lot of years of experience with benefits without the side effects of the drugs and the unnecessary surgeries like to hear from other. TCS, MD I would like to see Homeopathic medicine and naturopathic medicine on this list. I also use herbs a lot. You talked about eliminating allergies, and I wanted to recommend a treatment called NAET. It is a very effective combination of kinesiology and accupressure/accupuncture. #Accupuncture, accupressure, chiropractic, therapeutic massage and reflexology # Emphasis on healthy food, dietary supplements, and exercise, together with the general avoidance of prescription drugs and environmental toxins # Key nutraceuticals like vitamins B, D, and C, fish oil, resveratrol, and CoQ10 # Identification and elimination of food allergies # Herbs for a great many health issues, including the treatment of allergies and prostate health # Annual multifactor blood testing (which is different from and more extensive than conventional tests), including tests for heavy metal and chemical exposure, and omega 3 and vitamin D levels # More acid in most cases for stomach problems, not acid blockers; the use of probiotics for stomach and colon health # Natural Hormone Replacement (NHR) therapy rather than conventional hormone replacement products like Premarin, which is a dangerous mixture of horse estrogens # Avoidance of harmful heart surgery (research suggests that far too much heart surgery is counterproductive) and other unnecessary elective surgery; avoidance of many conventional cancer treatments # General avoidance of antibiotics; use of effective and largely forgotten bacteriocidal agents, which do not lead to drug-resistant bugs In no specific order homeopathy reiki chiropractic nutrition herbs supplements tcm ayurvedic You left out oxygen therapies – hyperbaric chambers – ozone injections. I’m being treated for hallax rigidus. Injections into the joint with ozone and other nutrients are resulting in gradual improvement. You left out chelation therapy. Many of us have heavy metal toxicity that is only revealed by a chelation challenge. I had been told that my problems were all in my head. It turned out that I had a high lead level and that my mercury level was off the chart. You also left out important forms of energy medicine – homeopathy, magnets, bio-geometric integration, etc. My chiropractor does BGI. It feels wonderful – balances my energy flow, relaxes tight muscles, drains tension. Before BGI, my chiropractic adjustments would not hold for more than a few minutes. I definitely agree with your assessment of the Mayo Clinic list as the “lite” or soft end of the spectrum of alternative therapies. Certainly, these are no threat to their allegiance to allopathic techniques. I’d include as my own “old reliables” on the “alternative” list the following: * Conscious NUTRITION awareness, including especially keeping sugar and white flour intake low, emphasizing other grains than wheat and corn, like brown rice & quinoa; plenty of vegetables, legumes & fresh fruits. * Yoga, Tai Ch’i, walking, and water-based exercises such as Aquatics * Meditation and a spiritual focus in life * Acupuncture and therapeutic massage * Colonic hydrotherapy and the use of pro-biotics * Homeopathic remedies * Osteopathic (gentle) manipulation of the spine, muscles & joints * Avoidance of antibiotics except in life-threatening situations, and of most prescription drugs * Oral colonic cleansing and fasting periodically Your list sounds about right. I would add vegetable juicing to increase intake of raw foods and certain detox methods. Liver flush, colon cleanse and the much maligned coffee enema can be very helpful. My favorite therapies include: acupuncture & Chinese herbal medicine allergy elimination homeopathy nutritional supplementation Another important factor: Avoidance of GMO foods, fast foods, HFC syrup, meats laced with antibiotics, & hormones Emphasis on organic foods, raw milk, pasture raised meats and eggs, healthy fats, etc. 1Acupuncture and TCM 2Homeopathy, Naturopathic, Aruveydic practices 3Massage 4Chiropractic practice 5Nutritional services including assessment and training for a whole foods diet in line with organic, sustainable practices 6 herbs, supplements with a preventive model and also first line treatment for most minor ailments 7exercis and lifestyle management incorporating cardio workouts and flexibility training 8 mind/body/spirit practices of meditation, tai chi, qi gong, yoga 9Energy medicine including such practices as Breathwork, reiki, etc. 10hypnotherapy and other forms of work to help clear and integrate systems The order is not according to importance! In fact, energy work may be the most essential! Detoxification through herbal cleanses and detox foot baths in addition to the above practices As a research junkie, my research always led me back to the work of Dr. Carey Reams, a biophysicist who discovered the biochemical formula for perfect health. Through a simple test of the urine and saliva, he could identify mineral deficiencies and organ malfunction. Even though he worked with the pharmaceutical based medical industry in his day with amazing results, he was shut down by the AMA and FDA. It is called RBTI. Check out CareyReams.com I like your list but would add Thermography. Squeezing breasts and exposing them to radiology on a regular basis may be harmful; thermography is much safer. On this list you have listed #2,3,4,5,6,7. Our choice in treatments. Mary Dybdahl I would definitely include Homeopathy–very powerful at times! also Chiropractic and nutrition We need to see Homeopathic Medicine, essential oils and emotional balancing on this list. I use thieves oil in my hot tub so I can relax in a spa and not stress about breathing the chlorine fumes. I keep telling my city living daughter to get a water filtering shower head. I want her to stop gassing my grandchildren. We need to get the pesticides ( peoplecides are still made by the same WWII companies that sold to the Nazis) out of our food and personal care. Cancer tumors frequently contain pesticides. One of the original morning after pills WAS a pesticide in a pill. We can not get well if our world is sick. natural/organic/local foods,…vitamins/nutritional supplements,…avoidance of processed/damaged foods and chemical additives,…knowledge of and appropriate use of foods to enhance health,…simple commonsense practices, as appropriate exercise and spiritual matters, that affect our overall health and well-being,…protection of our personal freedom of choice in these matters,…thank you,… Thank you for suggesting therapies more in tune to healthy living. Here are my most important therapies (I consider them basic actions to happy living). 1. Re-establishing some highly desired goal one has lost sight of. Getting that goal back into the forefront of his/her life. This is important at any age. 2. Successfully educate individuals on their own truly desired skills which result in their own competency and creativity throughout their life. Skills that enable them to exchange with others for enhanced survival. 3. Reducing, if not totally eliminating toxic chemicals, polluted air and water from their living environment, reducing the over taxed immune system. 4. Ensuring food is nutritious and free of synthetic pesticides, chemicals and other non-food items in their diet. I consider the above four points basic to attaining lasting results with therapies using complementary or alternative medicines. Bowen Therapy is wonderful and very effective. It will address the whole body. You have most of mine on both lists…I use chiropractic, definitely use nutritional supplements with the assistance of a chiropractic nutritionist and bio-meridian testing. Vitamin D and CoQ10 are on my daily list, too. Have just discovered a therapy that is not well-known, but should be…Prolotherapy. Caring Medical in Oak Park, IL is one of the prime sites for this therapy. I suggest that this be the topic of a future issue. Thanks for all your hard work to keep these issues important and vocal! Personally as a chiropractor, and alternative practitioner of 29 years, for me and my family of 4 kids (2 M.D.s, spouse and 2 other adult children) we use primarily use roughly in this order, but dependent upon condition and availability ( no therapy is ever used exclusively) including 150,000 treatments to 2500+patients; 1. chiropractic spinal manipulation 2. nutritional therapies 3 flower essences( Psycho-spiritual Bach and Flower essences) 4 herbal remedies 5 acupuncture 6 lab testing- hevy metals , detoxifiction, hormone balancing, allergy food and inhalant testing 7 appropriate diet therapy 8 exercise Aerobic, Yoga, Tai Chi Ch’uan My chiropractor is who I depend on. He is well educated in nutrition and natural healing, kinesiology, supplements. I think that chiropractors deserve a big spot on your top ten list – many of your top ten choices seem to be what I was raised on during the past 35 years of chiropractic care. My top ten complementary therapies are: Exercise including Zumba dancing, Vegetarian diet, supplements, tai chi, acupuncture, chiropractic, massage, Bio-identical compounded hormone cream, relaxation techniques, avoiding food sensitivities. Proper AROMATHERAPY application of therapeutic-grade essential oils for physical, emotional and spiritual health combined with eating a varied diet of colorful whole foods and nutritional supplements enhanced with therapeutic-grade essential oils. I have been a Bach Flower Essence counselor since 1985. I guide emotional sufferers toward an effective choice among the 38 English flower essence preparations which Dr. Edward Bach, English physician researched in the 1930’s. They are subtle non invasive adjuncts in droplet form to other natural protocols for body and soul. Bach famously noted that the remedies foster a more conscious connection between the personality and the soul. Therefore, this therapy crosses between the physical and spiritual like a darning needle of wholistic care. The second list is better. However Istudy alltypes of qi gomng and I am now doing Tai Chi short form yang style, Very gentle qi gong followed by tong ren healing—I ahve done Iron shirt QI Gomg, ix healing sounds inner smile, Fusion of the 5 elements–sll very dinamic and very mcuh using guided imagery. Guided imagery is unbeleivably stron. And Tong ren helaing is used in conjunction with chemnmotherapy so the chem does not kill tha patients immjune system. BUT only the mind body things are missing too much. One of the most important elements is our diet. All the JUNK put into our food–even the most expensive meat–tgrasin fed animals have the wrong ratios of omegas 6 to 3. If you ate correctlyu alot of asthma and arthritis and CVD would disappear-so I think tghe ANH list is more comprehensive. We have so much more knowledge and info to go beyonjd the mond body connection approach. This info however tagets big agra and bog pharma aas the culprits ruining our health. Chiropractic saved my liofe when all the MDs could offer me “Was learn to live with it.” At 27 with a blinding headache 24/7 non stop for 2 months after an auto accident that was like a death sentance. Chiropractic saved my life. I also believe that Chiropractic should be at the top of any list of health care traditions. I have been told that it is the second largest healing art profession in America and is the largest one that is safe, natural, gentle and effective. I suspect that M. Cyr is now a Chiropractor himself. “Complementary” and “integrative” medicine: the continued efforts by the medical community to control the innate power of the body to heal itself…. I think Chiropractor is the best treatment for back and many other issues. I to fill chiropractor is a life saver. I would take the healthy food one step further, and emphasize healthy ORGANIC food, which not only has more nutrients but also avoids the toxic overload of our planet and our farmworkers, in addition to ourselves. Avoiding toxins of all kinds needs to be on the list also, so filtered water is crucial, and plenty of it. Exercise!! Sleep!! Love!! As a homeopath, I am also continually astounded by the breadth of problems which homeopathic care can resolve, and the depth of healing which it elicits. Kate, is there any data the can explain what the common factors might be in the conditions that homeopathy can resolve? Inflammation? And if so, brought on by what? Where is the damage done (cells, etc.) ? Likewise, what are the conditions, if any, that you’ve seen for which homeopathy can’t make a dent in? Thanks! DHEA, IV chelation, acupuncture, HBOT, wide range of nutritional supplements and related blood testing, yoga stretch and flex workouts #1 healthy food oganic, raw, mostly vegan, local when possible – I garden too, food combining ie. eat fruit separate from other food, I am trying to learn more about sprouting as a source of micro nutrients and protein. #2 yoga and stretching I Bikram Yoga 3 times a week and at least 20 minutes of stretching everyday #3 walking and using weights #4 social interaction talking to people, hugs, massage, petting my dog, humor, prayer #5 herbs and spices use in cooking and for medicinal purposes esp. like black elderberry syrup, oregano oil, yellow dock, arnica #6 supplements -multi vitamen, lysine, glucosomine sulfate, DHEA #7 time outdoors -gardening, walking # 8 natural cleaning products and body care products ie white vinegar, glycerin etc. # 9 try not do anything that would be harmful and to be helpful when ever possible 1. Faith in God 2. Adequate water consumption 3. Eating whole, fresh fruits and vegetables. Raw dairy, organically raised animals for meat. 4. Exercise 5. Plenty of restful sleep 6. Non-invasive medical treatment; herbs, homeopathy, massage, acupuncture. 7. Traditional osteopathy treatments. 8. Food supplements. The list: Body structure- nutrition- toxins- electromagnetic polution- emotions- allergies and sensitivities- For more healing, light therapy, low level cold laser,( I understand the Mayo clinic uses this also)- exercise, physical and mental. Thanks for including me. Mack NATUROPATHY, the broad use of naturalist therapies and naturalist (plants including herbs, minerals, vitamins, food, etc) substances to keep one healthy. It’s in our best interests to license it in all states. CHINESE BODYWORK. Unpolluted, unprocessed fresh raw FOOD including sprouts, green-juicing, etc. CHIROPRACTIC. HOMEOPATHY. EAV/EDT TESTING to discover the diagnosis and to compare treatments for the individual’s best use. DETOX. OXYGEN THERAPIES such as ozone and hydrogen peroxide. EXERCIZE such as barefoot running and hooping. MUSIC THERAPY. I agree with all on your list ! There is only one therapy I would add. Aromatherapy, using only therapeutic grade essential oils. The grade of oil is very important because 95% of all essential oils distilled in the world have been altered in some way, either with extenders or solvents. Know the company you use. I have had many amazing health benefits using essential oils and I never leave home without them ! Oh, I use the French method of aromatherapy. “Identification and elimination of food allergies” I am assuming would include detoxification and cleansing ? If not I would include those. How about education ? I feel most people really don’t understand how thier bodies work. How can we take care of ourselves and take responsibility for our own health without education? Thank you L. Linda, When you say “most people really don’t understand how thier bodies work,” I think you articulate one of the great truths about the limitations in the assumptions made by practitioners in alternative, complementary and integrative health. There is no reason why people should understand how their body works. Certainly not like many CAM and integrative healers understand it. And yet there is always a sense of disappointment when I read such comments, as though people have no interest in their health; they’d just prefer to take a pill. But I submit there has never been a time when people understand how their bodies work. We are in a powerful evolutionary period right now in which such knowledge can be promulgated and understood. But there has never been an era when personal optimal health and how it is maintained was a common understanding among people. It will be interesting to see how we as individuals, members of families and of communities find and absorb the information that is out there, participate in the experiences that are available, and understand that we are now in fact in an age when technologies enable us to see and understand our own biology and what affects it. So you bet, education about one’s optimal personal wellness needs to get into the K-6 curriculum asap. Top ten so-called Alterntive Medicine to do what? Come back from the nearly dead? Cure cancer or at least contain it? MAINTAIN health? I guess my list will be those that address each. 1. Chelate heavy metals (MCP, Modifilan) We are all loaded with these. 2. Change diet to increase pH 3 bowel cleansing 4. Probiotics and stool analysis to determine good and bad flora status 5. Modify diet to control blood glucose. SERIOUS modification for 95% of Ameicans. 6. Meditation and mindfulness training 7. Incorporate good vibe behavior such as expressing gratitude hourly and expressing appreciation for loved ones……hourly. 8. Exercise and massage 9. Get off Drugs of all kinds gradually by supplementing correctly and with guidance 10 Hormone Balancing None of this is ranked higher or lower. all of these are outside mainsream “medicine” And except for Exercise…only one in 100 M.D.s will advise to pursue these basic lifestyle changes and things to do if a person wants to improve their health. I take a complete nutritional or “food Science” product called Reliv. The original formula was developed by Dr. Theodore Kalogris, a microbiologist who was shot in the back when he was parachuting into Germany near the end of WWII. He spent 18 months in an English hospital and was sent home in a wheelchair with morphine and told that would be his life from then on. However, he thought he could overcome that prediction because he had used to nutrition to help animals. He applied for a ten year grant from the World Health Organization. He tried over 800 formulae until he managed to get up and walk — with a cane, but he finally overcame that, too. This product was the first food product to be patented in this country! Now, our company has six of the eleven food patents. We can’t say that it will “cure” anything, but I know many people who don’t get sick anymore! I used to have a sore throat several times each winter. I have not had one simce I started taking Reliv three and a half years ago. I finally gave in to a friend and had my labs done. They were perfect! I have heard many stories about people who had been given a death sentence and who are still alive! BTW, I also eat broccoli and carrots and drink green tea every day I have found that I don’t crave some of the “bad food” anymore. I do believe that, if your Immune System gets the nourishment it needs, your body can work miracles! However, if I ever do get cancer and incresing my Reliv doesn’t do it, I will brush up on my German and head that way. I liked it over there anyway. Great list you put togeather. I use all these therapies you listed. It costs me a fortune and I get tired of having doctors try to bullie me into using drugs. They don’t want to hear about what your doing if it isn’t their idea. I think it’s really because they don’t have a clue and think Centrum one a day is the gold standard. Please use your list for my vote. Thanks for your good work Lahny McCray in Oregon My top approaches to staying healthy: 1. Tai Chi and stretching every morning. Stretches mostly from “3 minutes to a pain free life”. 2. Vitamins: – probiotics to help me digest everything else – lypospheric C (absorbs more C than any other method including intravenous) – lyposheric AGE (contains mostly B’s and selenium) – iodoral (I have low thyroid) – fish oil – ubiquinol – D – A tab with herbs to help eyesight 3. Good food: – fresh things daily – as much organic as I can get – zero fast food 4. Staying away from doctors – they have been programmed to push things I don’t want, eg cancer screening of people without symptoms (see fabulous book by H. Gilbert Welch called “Should I Be Tested for Cancer? Maybe Not and Here’s Why”) – integrative doctor outrageously expensive, does not use insurance (because they would push her to do things I don’t want), and still pushes for cancer screening. 5. Self reliance, since I am trusting no doctor with my regular health problems – subscribing to at least 5 health newsletters – searching the web anytime I have a problem – thinking about what changed recently anytime there is a sudden symptom. Reversing that change where possible 6. Avoiding as many chemicals as possible – no weed poisoning – pay extra to have a cleaning service that uses no chemicals – no skin cream with a collection of unpronouncable things – I just use virgin coconut oil. – no shampoo. My dry hair does better if I just wash in water every day – no toothpaste. My dental hygeinist says my brushing in water and flossing every day leaves my teeth cleaner than most of her other customers. – Using Brita water filter to drink. Should install reverse osmosis. – using chlorine filter in shower 7. Maintaining a network of wonderful friends and family, of which someone is generally available anytime I need emotional support. – Studies have shown that the #1 thing people over 100 have in common is not diet or exercise, but having a large number of friends. – Recent report showing Hispanics live longer is almost certainly due in large part to stronger family support than non-Hispanics in the US. 8. Playing and listening to classical music. Music keeps me going! Work is what I do to support the music habit, and also to support visiting family around the world. Rhodiola rosea for my husband who has Parkinsons (unfortunately he also need the drug sinemet), eating organic the top 10 pesticide treated foods (such as cranberries, apples,celery,lettuce,spinich,etc.), taking purified fish oil capsules, detox pills made from modified citrus pectin,and lutein&zeaxanthin for macular degeneration,flax seeds daily, multivitamins & minerals, eating whole grains and grass fed beef, and walking a mile/day. Also, taking 1/2 tsp baking soda in 4 oz of water whenever I feel a cold coming on. (Haven’t had a cold in several years. Baking soda makes the whole body less acidic, and colds need acidic environments to prosper). Hasyour husband tried high doses of CoQ10? Check in with your favorite integrative doctor or ND, but there is much research and promise using 400 mg – even 1500 mg or more- CoQ10 with Parkinson’s. I am a 70 year old identical twin. We are both in very good health. He still works as a courier while I am retired but very busy with tasks, projects, wood working, etc. My wife says I am ADHD and I say thank God. When I retired at 65 and began drawing Social Security and using Medicare, I got the initial physical which was my first since my induction into the Navy at age 18. My doctor asked why I had not had a physical since I was 18. I told him that doctors and hospitals kill people so I have always tried to stay away from them. He agreed and emphasized the role hospitals play in killing people. Other than being overweight (5 ft. 10.5 inches and 200 lbs) I was in great shape although he said he would have to put me on blood pressure medicine in a couple of years. He hasn’t! I had a follow up blood test about one year ago and my blood pressure was excellent. I have been interested in alternative approaches to health since the 1980s. Over the years, I have faithfully taken probably 10 to 12 supplements daily but only take egg yolk lecithin and selenium presently. I have eaten only one to two meals a day for most of my adult life (nutritional type is mixed) and have always had plenty of energy. I also have eaten pretty much anything I wanted. When my wife (she’s a nurse! interesting perspectives here but I am the healthy one) experienced pain in her neck whenever she would turn her head to the left and her doctor couldn’t resolve it, I started her on organic grape juice and liquid pectin (Certo). Very quickly the pain went away. She kept taking the treatment for several months preventatively but stopped several months ago. Still no pain. My health has always been so good that I could never tell if a supplement was helping me with anything or not. The only one I am certain helped me was Glucosamine/Chondrotin. I did ten key work at the post office entering zip codes and developed carpel tunnel syndrome. I was struggling with it for a couple of months when I increased my G/C intake to 2 tablets a day. In a matter of a FEW days, I was pain free and free of carpel tunnel syndrome. However, early this year I started the One Minute Cure taking H2O2. At the time, I was having a problem with a wisdom tooth. It had been paining me for a couple of months, was sensitive to cold, heat and pressure. Probably within one to two months (with almost immediate improvement at the start of the program) I had no pain, no cold/heat sensitivity and no pressure sensitivity. I now eat hard foods on that side of my mouth with no discomfort. I still have 3 wisdom teeth. Other benefits of taking H2O2 ( 3 drops of only 35% food grade in 6 6o 8 ounces of distilled water) three times daily was losing about 10 lbs and having endless energy and no evidence of any health problems at all. What’s interesting about all this is that I smoked from age 14 to age 65 when I went cold turkey on the night of my retirement. I don’t know if I am just unusually blessed or if my very loose adherence to alternative health strategies has kept me healthy. I am, however, very happy about where I am! I have been receiving BodyTalk for 10 years. As a Licensed Massage Therapist I have been using the this combo /integrated approach for 16 years, but with BodyTalk systems approach there is a more detailed approach now being used that gives and extra bonus to the treatments. It makes my job a lot easier than before. . The body’s self healing capacity works faster when we use more than one technique per session. For example, when I use the combo work clients notice a faster recovery time. less pain, more movement and better quality life. A preventative approach to getting well and staying well. When using a BodyTalk and Massage combo session that is integrated helps lower the need to take as many pharmaceuticals as the body and mind are functioning better. I do not prescribe or diagnose any medicine craniosacral therapy, nmt, manual lymph drainage, energy work -Reiki , Shiatsu, Reflexology, Direct Fascial Release, and TMJ] sessions for 10 years. I believe it is one of the best modalities in the field that looks at the whole person and allow us to integrate any form of health care to the mix, it has the components that affects the aspects of our spirituality, mental, physical , emotional selves all rolled up into one technique. For my clients, it is one of the quickest and most effective results to help the body and mind balance. BodyTalk is Good for all people- from children to Seniors.. and all those in between. My favorite therapies include: spirituality spinal manipulation good nutrition, avoidance of GMO’s and processed foods naturopathic medicine avoidance of pharmaceuticals including antibiotics exercise First, and by far the most important is sauna/charcoal detox. Second is Vitamin C to bowel tolerance. Third is magnesium, zinc, potassium and selenium supplements. Fourth is sticking strictly to organic food, especially avoiding genetically modified substances. Fifth is avoiding fluoridated water. Sixth is taking the nerve-restoring combination St. John’s Wort, Vitamin B6, folic acid and Vitamin B12. Seventh is use of the good fats: salmon or krill oil, and olive oil, and avoiding hydrogenated fats. Eighth is avoidance of the common sugars from beet, corn and cane sugars, and avoiding wheat, rye, and most other common grains with the exception of occasionally oats and organic corn. Ninth is frequently eating some sprouted organic peanuts or pomegranate seeds and some beans. Eating at least some animal protein is also important. Tenth is particular exercise: 3 – 4 short spurts (each about 4 minutes) of high energy exercise every other day, and to preserve joints, NOT more than 20 minutes of running, repetitive equipment use or walking as exercise routine (though as occasional recreation is OK). Frequent full body stretching and weight lifting are also important. Eleventh is avoiding toxic exposure of any type as much as possible including especially avoiding people’s smoking, use of aluminum for cooking, exposure to solvents and pesticides, lead, mercury, cadmium, BPA, vinyl and phthalates. Twelve is avoiding electromagnetic fields and radiation as much as possible. Thirteen is getting checked for need for bio-identical hormones and getting supplements if needed. CranioSacral Therapy and SomatoEmotional Release as well as Sound Healing definitely needs to added to the top ten list. Karen My top therapies in complementary and alternative medicine would be: Natural path doctors Arcing Light Energy Healing – we manifest what we think and destructive thoughts appear as dis-ease Massage and acupuncture diet and nutrition including vitamins and minerals Exercise Essential oils Osteopath Dr. I agree with your list as well. In general, taking responsibility and charge of your own health. Each person needs to find what works for them. This list of modalities are great and I practice most of them, however, one therapy that I find effective is colon hydrotherapy. The HUGE lacuna in all the “alternative” therapies, and in my opinion what should be the primary modality, is Exercise! I think all readers of this site realize the far reaching effects of movement! In second place would be Nutrition Education. Never mind about all the poor food choices we have. If people were well educated about proper nutrition, my feeling is that fast food consumption would greatly diminish, if not disappear. How can you compile this list and not include chiropractic? Is it no longer consider an alternative? It has be the PILLAR of the fight against the power of medicine since the early 1900s, resisting takeover that homeopathy and osteopathy both fell to. Have you no sense of history or understanding of the natural healthcare market? Chiropractors have been a beacon of true health in this country much longer than we have even had food issues in this country. I agree that the hard end of the spectrum should be studied more. I personally am big on nutraceuticals like omega-3, CoQ10, resveratrol, and supplements that thwart glycation such as carnosine, benfotiamine, etc. Amino acids that raise GH and supplements like SAMe that an indivdual can really feel the difference in energy, stability, etc. I practise Tai chi and other martial arts, I use an inversion table for spinal decompression, and i use an infrared sauna for detox, etc.but, these are secondary to supplementing with anti-oxidants and various nutrients. I would like to hear more discussion about the use of oxygen enriching therapies and their difference with anti-oxidants. Seems to me that some people think that taking anti-oxidants diminshes the oxygen content in your body and they mistakingly take less anti-oxidants in fear of not being oxygenated. Anti-oxidants are just that, anti ‘oxidant’, not anti ‘oxygen’ !! I would like to see more articles with some insight into the pros and cons of the two therapies. The Mayo list includes “spinal manipulation” in which chiropractic would fall. How about an alternative practice of scheduling a regular 1 or 2 or 3 IV chelation sessions a year? Chiropractic and Homeopathy are the 2 I’d ad to that list. Cranial Sacral Therapy is awesome. What about Quantum Feedback? Staying healthy is a full time job, between avoiding what is harmful, purging out the toxins, and finding the right things to do, consume, wear, and believe. I certainly agree with everyone’s comments, but I believe that a few essential things are missing from everyone’s list: 1) Biological Dentistry that addresses biocompatible dental materials, safe mercury removal, focal infections in the jawbones, structural imbalances in the bite, neuromuscular system, and TMJ 2) Therapies and products to reduce the effects of electromagnetic fields or frequencies (EMF). With more wireless technology in use, we have not yet seen the cumulative effects on health. Add that to heavy metal poisoning, and we become our own antennae. 3) Thermography for breast examination pre-screening to reduce the amount of mammographies 4) Far Infrared Saunas and Ionic Foot Cleanses to more safely pull out toxins 5) Education regarding chemical ingredients in foods, personal care and cleaning items, construction materials 6) Getting sunlight especially during cold winter months or use of full spectrum lighting 7) Avoiding the news and volitile politics which tend to be inciteful and stressful 8) Prophylactic chiropractic adjustments – 1-4 times a month 9) Keep bowels regular with probiotics, fiber, and cleansing 10) Lymphatic drainage with massage, chi machine, rebounder augmented with homeopathic lymphatic drainage, liver support and followed up with sauna, foot bath, or other routes of elimination 11) Healing relationships – forgiveness is key 12) Dealing with addictions That’s more than 10, but the list is always evolving. It’s good to see that we are all on this path. 1. Therapeutic bodywork 2. Bio-oxidative therapy 3. pH therapy 4. Bio-genic food 5. Detoxification therapies (colonic irrigation, sweats, natural diuretics). 6. Trace colloidal minerals 7. Vit D3 8. Elimination of processed foods, vaccines, and drugs from normal daily life. Ayurveda is a MUST for anyone serious about total and balanced approach to natural health. This approach is over 5000 years old and only natural and balanced herbal formulas, along with diet, exercise (yoga), seasonal variances, as well as body type special needs to maintain balance in the total body system. Ayurveda is actually the precursor to Chinese medicine practices, from where most of the Chinese herbal uses are drawn. I would also emhpasize TRANSCENDENTAL meditation, since this systematic, natural technique is the technique on which MOST research is done showing the wide range of total body benefits. Both of these above bring far-reaching and widely inclusive benefits. Nutrition is number 1 for me. There may be value to the mind bending therapies but I don’t have much experience with them. In the nutrition category are: >eating home cooked natural food, organic to the extent I can afford it….too many people buy a few items from the health food store, expecting it to counteract the 90% of their diet which is junk..that doesn’t work >take individual supplements…if you depend on a multi, you’ll never learn what is really good for you, or in what amounts and ratios to other nutrients. Everyone is different & has different requirements & tolerances…what you read in a book or on the web can only be a starting point for what you have learn by yourself. >strontium for the bones and teeth….saved me a load of dental bills and lots of misery >a higher intake ratio for magnesium to calcium than I previously used has banished my foot and leg cramps at nite and greatly improved my sleep >increased vitamin D supplementation to keep me from getting sick…going on 15 months now >borage or evening primrose oil + manganese + zinc/copper + biotin to prevent acne. I use energy therapy every day. There are a number: theraputic touch, Reiki, etc. I use Healing Touch. Keeping the awareness of my energetic health has become almost automatic and therefore I am very much in touch with the most subtle indicators of my health. These are still considered ourside the main stream, but are really very natural and there for our well being. The most important alternative medical therapies, Nost of which compete with and hopefully will displace the more costly and marginally effective conventional medical therapies, those which I want to be available to me if I need them are: 1- Chelation Therapy for Removal of Heavy Metals-Hearty Disease etc. 2-Hyperbaric Oxygen-for Stroke-Slow wound Healing 3- Intravenous Vitamin C-rebuilding Immune system 4-Ozone therapy 5-Antineoplastons-Dr.Burzynski’s cancer therapy. The more conventionally accepted modalities such as accupuncture, massage and chiropractic that serve to not displace current high technology high cost medical will always be readily available and even promoted by the major mainstream medical centers in theie public relations effort to say “we’re also alternative”. Great inroads are being made with stem cells but not much is being made public. Stem cell therapy can be done in a doctor’s office and may take an hour or two. The benefits are many. I personally use herbs, neutraceuticals, flower essences, aromatherapy, diet free of common allergenic foods like wheat, dairy, corn etc, organic fruit and veggies when possible and regular exercise. Most certainly 1) Chiropractic care – my chiropractor uses the Pettibon Method, after 20+ years of going to chiropractors, this is the most effective spinal adjustment care I have ever experienced. I am so grateful I found it, it corrected things I’d struggled with since an auto accident 27 years ago! 2) Naturopathy – I use an ND as my “primary care” physician, the perspective is the only one that makes sense to me for true health care. “First, do no harm”! and Education, taking responsibility for my own health – I have the most to benefit from doing so! 3) Clean diet, avoid genetically modified foods wherever humanly possible (unfortunately GMOs are ubiquitous in our food supply) – I buy organic wherever possible. “Unlimited vegetables” if I cannot do anything else (travel alot with work). High protein grains, non GMO of course, such as quinoa. I have followed a vegetarian diet for 33 years, it works best for me. My general diet is high in fiber, and I avoid refined flour breads, and watch carbohydrate intake as much as humanly possible. Protein from almonds, soy, some whey, sunflower and pumpkin seeds. 4) Supplementation – including potent probiotics, a great multi rich in minerals (it’s a doctor brand called q.s. – quantity sufficient – after decades of taking supplements, I’ve never seen anything else quite like it). Big fan of minerals, I am convinced many modern diseases are related directly or indirectly to mineral deficiencies. 5) Exercise – something physical every single day, because I sit alot at computers, in the car, or on planes. Gym, cardio, some weights, swim (at least 3 miles a week), walking the dog bike rides – something physical every day. 6) SLEEP. The best health plan God designed! 7) WATER – good clean water, my ND turned my attention to Kangen water, but any water, Smart water, electrolyte water, pure water – our bodies are 75%+ water, it is by far the BEST health food on the planet! 8)COLONICS AND ENEMAS. Big fan of cleanses, we spring clean, why not clear out the pipes? Fiber, modified fast regularly, I do it once a year and should do it more, with green drinks, powders, fiber, flax meal. 9) Enemas, colonics. If it is true that 80% of all pathology begins in the colon as Dr. Paavo Airola said (and many others have echoed) – and I believe the % is higher than 80% – why not help the elimination system clean out? I notice my eyes and skin are more clear after a cleanse, I think more clearly, feel great, have more energy! 10) LAUGHTER AND JOY! No matter what is going on, I find a way to have a hearty laugh every single day! (and lest the reader question, of course I not avoiding reality and the harshness that sometimes comes our way! One sister of mine is dying of breast cancer, chose chemo, my sis in law is struggling with bladder cancer, my dad passed on from – IMHO- the cocktail of drugs thrown at him for the side effects of the prostate cancer treatment he chose! – and my husband’s mother has dementia and is in assisted living, ) yet – we find a way to laugh daily. 11) NATURE. (some call it GOD) simple things are gifts from the CREATOR WHO RUNS THE WHOLE SHOW – Sunsets. Breathing! Taking moments to simply BE (some call this Meditation). Simply walking. taking a moment to look up at the sky – every single day. 12) GRATITUDE. I am grateful. There are always things to be grateful for. Seek them out daily. LOVE the Chiro, but I also love Digestive Enzymes, general Nutritional Therapy, and Acupuncture. Something I’d like to call anti-toxicology or just: keep it natural whenever possible. It’s helped a lot of my health problems. Would like to expand a little on this: “The fact that the Mayo Clinic has set up a department to deal with alternative therapies is not all that unusual. Many leading hospitals have them.” Hospitals are beginning to incorporate these therapies, into wellness centers or into wellness programs. In large part for their marketing powers — drawing people to standard care services after receiving CAM treatments. But it is unusual for a conventional medical center of the stature of Mayo to actually put it all into a book, which has to be seen within the professions as a bellweather indicator, raising the credibility profile of these therapies — and by inference many of those not on the list but mentioned by commenters above — to the next level. Longer term I believe that this movement — driven completely by consumer preferences and choice (i.e., 99% out of pocket) — will continue down a path on which hospitals will position themselves as a local and regional resources for the wellness-inducing affects of many CAM therapies. Many are already incorporating such language into five year plans; they want to be relevant apart from the restorative work that is their traditional mission. I know that may seem hard to believe (!), but the forces that have driven these therapies into hospitals, at whatever level they now commit to, are also circulating through the med schools, the nursing schools and thus the next generation of health care professionals. After a lifetime of chasing after the symptoms of fibromyalgia, using every imaginable alternative and conventional health treatment, the thing that helped me the most to pull all the benefits of those treatments together and make them work, was discovering ionized alkaline water. I did the mind/body/supplement/manipulation/homeopathic/orthopedic/neurologic/chelation/dental/detox/allergy plus a few drugs, before I started drinking this water, and still had all the symptoms. I spent $20,000 and 35 years of my life, with little improvement; but one week drinking this water and all my symptoms were gone and have stayed gone for over a year. If you study about this water you will see that it works for every health problem, so my vote is for alkaline ionized water as the foundation for every other health care treatment. It makes everything else you do for health, whether alternative or conventional, more effective. My would be the same as your list: 1. Healthy food, supplements, exercise 2. Herbs for specific and general well being. 3. Chiropractic manipulation 4. Avoidance of unneeded surgery and pharmaceuticals. 5. Multifactor blood testing 6. Therapeutic message and acupuncture 7. Meditation Pretty great post. I just stumbled upon your weblog and wished to mention that I’ve really enjoyed surfing around your blog posts.

98929709-7d75-4602-8622-7292d32e35f3,"Mistletoe Therapy and Hyperthermia for Cancer: Turning Up the Heat listed in , originally published in Cancer patients very often seek ways of helping themselves to improve their health and to feel in charge of their treatment process. They perceive the mainstream cancer treatments as invasive and injurious and often look for ways to boost their immune system. Up to 70% of all cancer patients in Europe seek complementary treatment in addition to their recommended cancer treatment. This includes a variety of medicinal plants, but also acupuncture, psychosocial support, yoga, art therapies and others. Most choose herbal remedies and European mistletoe (Viscum album L.) is the most frequently prescribed adjunct treatment in several European countries.[1,2,3] An overview of the role of mistletoe therapy for cancer is contained in a great number of publications and a dissertation.[4,5] Mistletoe is a semi-parasitic plant, and the white berried European Mistletoe () has a well-established naturopathic tradition for treating a range of conditions, such as epilepsy, hypertension, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.[9] For the treatment of cancer, mistletoe was introduced by Dr Rudolf Steiner PhD and Dr Ita Wegman MD in 1917, as they developed anthroposophic medicine. It has since been widely used for adjunct treatment of cancer in mainstream, homeopathic and other complementary medical practice.  A range of products are now available (e.g. Iscador, Abnobaviscum, Helixor, Lektinol), harvested from a number of host trees (Apple, Oak, Pine, Fir, Birch, Ash and may more) - each with different indications.[10,11] Mistletoe extracts have immune-modulatory, anti-angiogenic properties - as well as a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on cancer cells (both necrosis as well as apoptosis), but don’t affect healthy tissue. Several individual constituents have been investigated, for example viscotoxins, lectins, triterpenes, jasmonates and quercetin - that together have an all-round benefit. Mistletoe enhances DNA repair and increases endorphin production, which probably accounts for the improved well-being.[3,4,5] There is a wide variety of treatment protocols that give great flexibility in prescribing, in all settings and at any time of the illness stage. This reflects the nature of the therapy, in that it aims to support the individual as well as address the illness. Also, and as so common in the medical practice, the experience of the centre or physician will inform applications and indications.  Commonly, patients are prescribed a (skin) application; typically, injections are self-administered, given 3 times a week; one prefers to start treatment in advance of surgery, chemo- or radiotherapy. The reason for this is to optimally prepare the immune system, and thereby to improve tolerance recovery - as well as sensitize the cancer itself, which could improve outcome of treatment. However, treatment can start at any time before or during such treatments. If there is time and opportunity, an induction therapy with fever has advantages in ‘kick-starting’ the patient’s immunity in a stronger way than is possible with the traditional approach with lower doses. Other applications are: (for children; brain- and or spinal tumours, patients who don’t tolerate injections); (as a drip): to support febrile induction treatment, as adjunct to the normal injections in case of metastasis, for weak and debilitated patients, to optimize traditional s.c. [subcutaneous] application during radio- and chemotherapy and hyperthermia; (to improve and focus the immunity); Maintenance treatment is usually continued over a number of years. Currently 2-3 years treatment is considered optimal immune support for most, early stage cancers that have been successfully treated with conventional therapy. Depending on the risk of recurrence and the overall health of a patient, mistletoe therapy is continued for longer, with or without regular treatment pauses.  is the most commonly prescribed approach and consists of low doses of mistletoe (typically with of 0.1mg or less), given 2-3 x week, which increasing slowly over a number of weeks / months. This approach is suitable for out-patient settings and carries a minimal treatment burden. Most of the studies cover this approach which is safe in most situations, for all cancer types and can be started any time, also during chemotherapy and radiotherapy or low blood counts. , locally applied, are more likely to affect a disease response than lower doses. Given at the beginning of treatment (induction) higher doses can elicit fever - and this may have distinct advantages, but pose a considerable treatment burden. If palliation and quality of life are the main aim, then lower doses are indicated and pose less of a burden.  In a number of consultant-led centres, off-label intratumoural and intravenous application using higher doses is routinely and safely applied either on its own, or alongside mainstream cancer treatments. In our work in the UK (former Park Attwood Clinic) and currently Ita Wegman Klinik, significant tumour responses were observed with combined regimes of intra-tumoural and intravenous application, more so if fever was elicited. There is evidence emerging that tumour specific immune responses can arise following intratumoural administration of immune modulatory agents (‘’).[5,13-15]    The benefits of fever in cancer treatment and immune-priming in particular are well documented.[12,16] This may offer a rationale for some remarkable results, with remissions that exceed 2-3 years. Fever induction may be an optimal approach for new and reasonably fit patients and ideal in advance of surgery and other mainstream treatments. This approach is accompanied by flu like illness with fever and requires close supervision.   - When mistletoe therapy no longer elicits fever responses, Whole Body Hyperthermia (WBH) offers a non-invasive way to mimic fever and improve outcome of treatments. It has been established that moderate (fever range) WBH improves immune responses. Also, hyperthermia renders tumours more susceptible to other treatments like chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy.  We now routinely recommend WBH combined with Mistletoe therapy, for example 8 or more sessions (at least monthly), starting after completion of mistletoe induction. This can run alongside chemotherapy, and indeed may improve tolerance and efficacy.[17,18]  Also, patients who are already established on Mistletoe may also benefit from WBH at any stage of their treatment, or at time of relapse. - Iscador has a limited licence in the UK and is available on the NHS at standard prescription costs, prescribed by GPs and doctors at homeopathic hospitals / departments that fall within the NHS. However, some PCTs have found the evidence insufficient and have ruled against prescribing. Other mistletoe preparations can be made available on a named-patient-basis, or purchased privately. Mistletoe is one of the most widely studied complementary therapies for cancer and the benefits are well documented. Studies have consistently shown safety and improved quality of life.[2,4] This benefit is particularly evident when mistletoe is used alongside chemo- and radiotherapy: patients appear to tolerate such treatments better, by having had fewer side effects and they recover better.  Also, cancer patients’ resilience and ability to deal with stress (‘self-regulation’) improves over time.  Some studies suggest improved life expectancy, but the evidence for this needs further confirmation. One study showed an estimated 1.8 -2 year survival benefit in a range of cancer types - when using substantial mistletoe for at least two years.[6]  More recently, Iscador was found to significantly improve survival comparable to currently recommended chemotherapy (Serbia).[7] Further studies are in preparation in the US, UK and other European countries. A Cochrane review (2008) found the available evidence for impact on survival weak, called for more research and decisions about mistletoe prescribing to rely on experienced physicians.[2] Since then, more positive studies have been published. To date, 130 clinical studies have been published on the therapeutic effectiveness of mistletoe preparations (Abnobaviscum®, Helixor, Iscador®, Iscar, Iscucin®, Isorel®), and critically evaluated by independent authors[11] – with respect to: (34 prospective comparative studies, 2 cohort studies, 39 retrospective comparative studies) - 16 trials found a statistically significant benefit to using mistletoe therapy; another 16 studies showed a positive trend and 2 studies found no effect. One study reported that survival advantage increased according to duration of mistletoe treatment;[6] (4 prospective comparative studies, 32 cohort studies,[1] retrospective comparative study) -  Two studies reported a statistically significant favourable effect, one study showed a positive trend and one study found no effect; (11 prospective comparative studies, 3 retrospective comparative studies) - Five studies found a statistically significant benefit in favour of mistletoe treatment; two showed a positive trend; one found no effects; one reported a negative trend; one an interim analysis indicated a positive trend (interim analysis); in one study standard medication showed better results than mistletoe treatment; Reducing side-effects of chemo-, radiotherapy and surgery (10 prospective comparative studies, 1 cohort study, 4 retrospective comparative studies) - 7 reported a statistically significant benefit; one trial found a reduction of chemotherapy-related side effects, and one, very small pilot study had mixed results; one study mentioned less side effects and an improvement in quality of life and one reported higher dosage of chemotherapy were given, as fewer and especially less serious side effects occurred with concurrent mistletoe therapy; Across the board was mostly good; reactions at the injection site and mild flu like symptoms or fever are minor, do no harm and are self-limiting effects (see below: safety). One study on malignant pleural effusion, observed less side effects after the instillation of mistletoe extracts compared to instillation of Doxycyclin, Meperidin or Lidocain; (16 prospective comparative studies, 19 cohort studies, 5 retrospective comparative studies) -  13 of which showed a statistically significant favourable advantage, two a positive trend and one study did not report on these endpoints; one study suggested that good coping behaviour (self-regulation) and mistletoe therapy have a positive synergistic influence on each other. Gynaecological tumours (breast, ovarian, cervix cancer, as well as cervical dysplasia; Primary liver tumours, colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, pancreas tumours and liver metastases a recent study shows impressive survival for inoperable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer [7] Haematological malignancies: Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin-lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma of the skin multiple myeloma, CML, myelodysplastic syndromes; Malignant exudates (ascites, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion); The published literature predominantly shows benefits of mistletoe therapy with respect to survival time, quality of life and reduction in the side effects of conventional therapies. While the quality of the studies varies widely, the overall conclusions do not essentially change if only the good quality studies are taken into consideration.  A reduction in side effects of conventional cancer therapies and improvement of quality of life appears to be best substantiated. Survival benefit has been shown, but not beyond critique. Survival is likely to be dependent on the duration of therapy. Mistletoe is used in the treatment of all types of cancer - and the reason for this is that mistletoe draws on the host defences (immunity) as well as having an effect on the cancer itself. The patient's immunity is implicated in the cancer’s behaviour as well as in prognosis - to different degrees in the various types. Therefore, treating the relationship between cancer and the patient's immunity makes common sense and seems to benefit in all settings. For a number of different mistletoe extracts that are used in human studies, the reported side effects have generally been minimal and not life threatening. Most of the effects of Mistletoe therapy are desirable, for instance the transient inflammation at the injection sites, flu like symptoms and raised temperature (even fever). Hypersensitivity (allergic-type reactions) with rashes, generalised itching, hives, swelling of lips and tongue and wheezing are rare - and usually only occur with sudden dose increases and infusions. Anaphylaxis is very rare indeed. Mistletoe is safely used together with all mainstream cancer treatments, including targeted treatments - and adverse interactions are not known.[2,3,8] Mistletoe therapy is a safe and potentially very helpful treatment for cancer patients to help improve life quality and outcomes. Before embarking on this, seek advice from experienced doctors regarding the optimal treatment plan. Mistletoe seems safe to use in combination with all mainstream cancer therapies, as well as other CAM modalities. 1.         Molassiotis A et al.

dc96c456-0bce-42ef-a991-67a7fa2ed4b8,"Cancer Control through Pathology-Based Homeopathic Medicine listed in , originally published in Homeopathy is a system of medical therapy that uses information of biophysical nature and/or very small (infinitesimal) doses of medicines or remedies that are hardly traced even by most modern technology. These remedies are usually prepared from substances found in nature. Because the remedies are highly diluted, usually to the point that no traceable molecules exist ,they are extremely safe. The clinical experience of homeopathy shows  that the micro-dosing /biophysical information approach to diseases is effective. There are literally hundreds of high quality, published basic science, pre-clinical and clinical studies showing that homeopathy works. If someone searches in PubMed, a renowned Medical Literature Record, with the key word “homeopathy”, about 5.000 of publications in medical journals appear; therefore no one may claim that there is not accessible and reliable medical information or that there is no place for Homeopathy in the space of Scientific Evidence. Appropriate Clinical Homeopathic treatment of Cancer case, as ‘complementary medicine’ to conventional oncologic treatment, may successfully apply to and help essential health needs of cancer patients for: Personalized Medicine for individual health problems, while patients are under conventional treatment or after it; Natural reduction of chemotherapy and radiation side effects; Enhancement of immune system activities and defence mechanisms; Individualized and patient-centred holistic approach; Natural remedies that do not interfere with any possible effectiveness of conventional medicine in cancer care; The goal of the homeopath is to recognize through the unique expression of the pathology and symptoms of a patient the pattern of the individual disturbances and to identify the most similar, that is the most suitable to the individual case, remedies. Similarity is a fundamental quality, that may apply from the whole organism, the so called “Totality”, to the level of an organ, to a kind of tissue or cells or even to sub-cellular structures or to specific metabolites or ion balance. The electivity of action on a particular structure or function in the organism is frequently the required “similarity” for treatment of every organ pathology, Cancer itself certainly included. Cancer has nothing of the mysterious or superhuman behind it; it is usually the final outcome of a local chronic physical bioenergetic stagnation, where the defence mechanism employs its last defence: a dramatic change in structure balance itself in a model that is reminiscent of embryogenesis, which anyway is out of current space and time processes of the organism. Development of cancer cells in disorganized stroma This return to embryogenesis patterns recalls the regeneration healing phenomena after a wound, so that certain researchers have used for cancer local phenomena the poetic ,but also objectively true, phrase “cancer, a wound that does not heal”, since wound healing and local cancer progression have striking similarities. These similarities highly indicate that “healing”, of autotherapeutic and  defence nature, phenomena are included in the essence of local cancer progression itself and should be necessarily kept in mind in any scientifically planned cancer treatments, whether they are ‘alternative’, ‘complementary’ or ‘conventional’. It has been also described in the modern medical literature that cancer cells introduced into developing embryos can be committed to a complete reversion of their malignant phenotype. It has been also postulated  that it is unlikely that such effects could be ascribed to only few molecular components interacting according to a simple linear-dynamics model, and that  these facts argue against the somatic mutation theory of cancer. Some 50 years ago, Needham and Waddington speculated that cancer represents an escape from a morphogenetic field like those which guide embryonic development. It is supported that, indeed, disruption of the morphogenetic field of a tissue can promote the onset as well as the progression of cancer. This condition confers to cancer an unusual sensitivity to embryonic regulatory cues. Thus, it is not surprising that cancer cells exposed to specific embryonic morphogenetic fields undergoes significant modifications, eventually leading to a complete phenotypic reversion. Homeopathic remedies, through the employment of  the principle of similarity to a tissue, which in modern terms is translated in a kind of ‘teaching or reprogramming’ of the tissue, might apply in the best way to the “tissue morphogenetic field” where cancer cells appear and  seems to have the best possible chances to pass positive information to this field. Since homeopathic remedies are devoid of any chemical toxicity, homeopathy is the ideal system of medicine for people of all age. Homeopathy has long been established as mainstream medicine in the NHS (National Health System) of many countries. However in the USA today, Homeopathy is hardly even included in the so called ‘Integrative Medicine’ as applied in many renowned Health Care Units, and is ‘frozen out’ by pretending ignorance of the subject; but prior to 1925 many Homeopathic Hospitals were actively and successfully engaged in the US  Health System. Why then is Homeopathy faced with such unreasonable rivalry in US? In the European Union (EU) the whole health policy looks a bit better. In the UK it is estimated that Homeopathy is growing 20% each year; it has been enrolled in the National Health System through an Act of Parliament from 1950 to the present. The Swiss government has a long and widely-respected history of neutrality, and therefore, reports from this government on controversial subjects need to be taken more seriously than other reports from countries that are more strongly influenced by present economic and political constituencies. When one considers that two of the top five largest drug companies in the world have their headquarters in Switzerland, one might assume that this country would have a heavy interest in and bias toward conventional medicine, but such assumptions would be wrong. In late 2011, the Swiss government's report on homeopathic medicine represents the most comprehensive evaluation of homeopathic medicine ever written by a government and was just published in book form in English. This breakthrough report affirmed that homeopathic treatment is both effective and cost-effective and that homeopathic treatment should be reimbursed by Switzerland's national health insurance program. The Swiss government's inquiry into homeopathy and complementary and alternative (CAM) treatments resulted from the high demand and widespread use of alternatives to conventional medicine in Switzerland, not only from consumers but from physicians as well. Approximately half of the Swiss population have used CAM treatments and value them. Further, about half of Swiss physicians consider CAM treatments to be effective. Perhaps most significantly, 85 percent of the Swiss population wants CAM therapies to be a part of their country's health insurance program. It is therefore not surprising that more than 50 percent of the Swiss population surveyed prefer a hospital that provides CAM treatments rather to one that is limited to conventional medical care. Beginning in 1998, the government of Switzerland decided to broaden its national health insurance to include certain complementary and alternative medicines, including homeopathic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, herbal medicine, anthroposophic medicine, and neural therapy. This reimbursement was provisional while the Swiss government commissioned an extensive study on these treatments to determine if they were effective and cost-effective. The provisional reimbursement for these alternative treatments ended in 2005, but as a result of this new study, the Swiss government's health insurance program once again began to reimburse for homeopathy and selective alternative treatments. In fact, as a result of a national referendum in which more than two-thirds of voters supported the inclusion of homeopathic and select alternative medicines in Switzerland's national health care insurance program, the field of complementary and alternative medicine has become a part of this government's constitution. The main pathological goal of Homeopathy in Cancer is primarily the detection and evaluation of everything relevant to individual cancer pathogenesis and the support of Homeostatic Functions and the integrity of the micro-environment of cancer cells. Like in all Chronic Organic Diseases, also in Cancer individualized homeopathic treatment is always applied, which targets both the diseased organ of the body and the whole organism. Chronic Diseases usually represent the progress and adjustment of physiological phenomena and processes of the organism, i.e. of the mechanisms of homeostasis, in adverse conditions and challenges of the environment, natural and social. What we call ‘disease’ actually represents, in most cases, the defence mechanism attempt to maintain the system healthy and alive; this adaptation process covers the whole body, even if it seems focused on a body organ. The latter, however, is of particular importance when it is an important organ for the integrity and survival of the whole system, so that it requires specific pathophysiological-pharmacological support and treatment . Hahnemann, the modern founder of Homeopathy, very correctly defined, as Hippocrates, the first founder of Homeopathy, that the target is the real cure of the pathology of each case and not merely the relief and / or suppression of symptoms. The actual healing of Chronic Diseases for both modern Conventional Medicine and Classical Homeopathy passes necessarily through the functional and morphological disorders of organs, tissues and cells of the body, not simply through the symptoms, necessarily  through the 'Disease' itself, and not simply only through the ‘Patient’, as “The Patient, not the Cure” is still a prevailing dogma in a part of the homeopathic community. From the time of Hippocrates it had been already observed that, when a chronic disease developed in an organ, the local morphological and functional characteristics change, the local physical bioenergetic qualities change, facts  which necessarily demand specific Homeopathic prescribing for the diseased organ, besides the support and treatment of the whole organism, of the “Totality”. Especially in Cancer it is always required to support both the diseased organs themselves and the whole organism, the “Totality”. Concerning the homeopathic treatment of malignant neoplasm-bearing organs, this may be implemented through remedies that control the micro-environment of cancers cells, the intercellular tissue, the matrix, that is the critical field where the process of carcinogenesis initiates , maintained and promoted, according to modern medical literature. My own Doctoral Thesis from 1989 dealt with these phenomena in breast cancer ,employing as parameters the mast cell count and the extracellular metachromatic mucopolysaccharides and collected certain indications  helping to ‘see’ the cancer as ‘process’ before the appearance of cancer as “malignant neoplastic cells”. The medical literature is gradually enriched in publications giving not simply emphasis but prime importance to extracellular substance, especially the so-called ‘matrix’, the shapeless mucous material in which cells swim. Homeopathic pharmacology has a very rich, even not yet not fully understood by most homeopaths, material for supporting the integrity of this so critical ground substance with its network of fibres, which more or less act as a structural template for the architecture of each tissue. When this template is destroyed or disordered because of very stagnant physical bioenergy in an organ or tissue location, then a certain kind of cell each time grows in compensation to retain the structural balance, but in a more or less disordered and unlimited manner, obtaining anyway morphological and functional characteristics reminiscent of embryogenesis or regeneration phenomena. So, although the whole process retains a defensive character, it is expressed through a serious structural imbalance, which usually takes the form of a ‘tumour’. Conventional medicine commences to be engaged from the late phase of the cancer process, when its final product, the tumour, is obvious through modern medical technology, even at an ‘early stage’ as it is still postulated by its followers. Holistic-Hippocratic Medicine, and I believe especially Homeopathy, may detect the ‘cancer process’, the ‘cancer disease’ much earlier, through a sophisticated combination of Holistic/ Homeopathic investigation of the patient and of General Pathology, as was developed by Hippocrates in ancient times and Rudolph Virchow, JC Burnett and HH Reckeweg in previous centuries. On the other hand, the safety of Homeopathy is  unquestionable, since it contains even not traces of chemical, pharmacologically active, constituents. So, it is  not possible to have a reaction to or side effects from Homeopathy and is not possible to have any interference with conventional  treatment, except in limiting its possible serious side effects. This advantage is of great importance, especially in cases of advanced cancer disease, i.e. in  massive metastases in the liver, when hepatic insufficiency does not allow even the usual chemotherapeutic dosing. The modern academic and clinical medical research in the field of homeopathy is almost always based on the pathophysiological action of homeopathic ‘medicines’ on organs, tissues and  cells. Reference to research supporting  the effectiveness of Homeopathy, already published in peer-reviewed medical journals, is included and commented in this article. A prospective observational study was conducted with cancer patients in two differently treated cohorts: one cohort with patients under complementary homeopathic treatment and one cohort with conventionally treated cancer patients. For a direct comparison, matched pairs with patients of the same tumour entity and comparable prognosis were to be formed. It was observed that improvement of quality of life as well as a decreased tendency of fatigue symptoms occurred in cancer patients under complementary homeopathic treatment. Recent Academic Research in USA revealed that  ultra-diluted homeopathic remedies have cytotoxic effects on breast cancer cells. An study was conducted to determine if homeopathic products have any effect on breast cancer cell lines. Four ultra-diluted remedies  against two human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines and a cell line derived from immortalized normal human mammary epithelial cells were studied. The homeopathic remedies exerted preferential cytotoxic effects against the two breast cancer cell lines, causing cell cycle delay/arrest and apoptosis. These effects were accompanied by altered expression of the cell cycle regulatory proteins, which were likely responsible for the cell cycle delay/arrest as well as induction of apoptosis. These findings demonstrated cytotoxic biological activity against cancer cells  of these homeopathic products at their ultra-diluted doses. Ethanolic extract of (PD), used in homeopathy for the treatment of various ailments such as chronic rheumatism, regular conjunctivitis, psoriasis, and in some skin diseases was tested for its possible anticancer potential. Cytotoxicity of the drug was tested on both normal (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and A375 skin melanoma cancer cells. DNA fragmentation, changes in cellular morphology, apoptosis and necrosis, if any, were  recorded. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, if any, and expression study of apoptotic genes also were evaluated to pin-point the actual events of apoptosis. Results showed that PD administration caused a remarkable reduction in proliferation of A375 cells, without showing cytotoxicity on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Generation of ROS and DNA damage, which made the cancer cells prone to apoptosis, were found to be enhanced in PD-treated cells. Overall results demonstrate the anticancer potentials of on A375 melanoma cells. Homeopathic treatment efficiency was studied in patients with advanced . The authors present  cases of various pathologically confirmed malignancies. These patients underwent homeopathic therapy as the primary cancer treatment. In the cases studied, conventional cancer treatments could not be initiated due to the advanced stage of their disease, poor general health performance status, and their financial constraints. This report indicated the clinical efficacy of homeopathic  therapy in treating those cancer patients. Induction of apoptosis of tumour cells by some potentiated homeopathic drugs was  studied  concerning possible mechanism of action. Earlier studies indicated that homoeopathic medicines are cytotoxic to tumour cells and reduced animal tumours. Homeopathic remedies were tested for their ability to induce apoptosis. Similarly, the effect of homoeopathic medicines on apoptosis was measured by microarray analysis. Homeopathic remedies produced morphological changes in the Dalton's lymphoma ascites tumour cells and induced DNA laddering, increased apoptotic gene p53 and decreased antiapoptotic gene Bcl2. Administration of potentiated homoeopathic drugs to tumour-bearing mice induced increased apoptosis of tumour cells. Microarray analysis of cells treated with homoeopathic drugs indicated that many enzymes related to apoptosis were increased by homoeopathic drugs. These data indicate that apoptosis is one of the mechanisms of tumour reduction by homeopathic drugs. A comparison of potentiated drugs with their mother tincture indicated that the potentiated drugs have biological activity similar to that of their mother tincture in spite of ultradilution. A study was conducted on the use of homeopathy in pediatric oncology in Germany. Homeopathy is a frequently used complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatment in Germany. Results were presented comparing responses of homeopathy users (HUs) and users of other forms of CAM (NHUs) in pediatric oncology (PO) in Germany. Differences between these two groups (usage, associated demographic characteristics, previous experience with CAM) were investigated. 186 (45.2%) of the 367 CAM users were exposed to homeopathy. The treatment duration amounted to a median of 601 days for HUs and 282 days for NHUs. Parents with p (127; 76.5%) also used homeopathy for their child's cancer. Nonmedical practitioners played a considerably greater role as source of information than did treating physicians. In the majority of patients HUs received their prescriptions from nonmedical practitioners (56%; 29.4% of NHUs). HUs communicate more frequently with their physicians about the CAM-use (77.7% versus 65.2%) and recommend CAM more often than NHUs (94% versus 85.6%). Homeopathy is the most frequently used CAM treatment in PO in Germany. HUs sustain treatment and therapies considerably longer than NHUs. Most families who had used homeopathy before their child was diagnosed with cancer also used homeopathy for the treatment of their child's cancer. Compared to other CAM treatments, patient satisfaction with homeopathy appears to be very high. A tumour therapy with   for stabilization of B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia was studied. In tumour cells, RNA polymerase II is more active than in other somatic cells. contains amanitin, inhibiting RNA polymerase II. Partial inhibition with amanitin influences tumour cell - but not normal cell - activity. To widen the treatment spectrum, homeopathic dilutions of Amanita phalloides, containing amanitin, were given to  patients with leukemia. Monitoring the leukemic cell count, different doses of amanitin were given. This homeopathic tumour therapy showed high potential to provide a gentle and essential medical treatment. A clinical evaluation of a complex homeopathic injection therapy in the management of pain in patients after breast cancer treatment was performed. In breast cancer patients, post-treatment pain often appearing after several months and strongly impairing health-related quality of life. Conventional methods of pain reduction are often ineffective or even harmful. Injection therapy with a  complex homeopathic  medication with analgesic properties, used for treatment of the pain associated with trauma as well as with mediators of inflammation, was proposed as an innovative approach for pain relief after breast cancer treatment. After the last injection, all patients experienced a marked reduction of their level of pain on average from 7.6 +/- 1.5 to 2.4 +/- 1.4 points on a scale from 1 to 10 points. After a follow-up observational phase of 3 and 6 months, pain score ratings increased slightly again in some patients but remained consistently low in others. In any case, the ratings of pain levels did not reach the values assessed before the start of these injections. Similarly, health-related quality of life improved with this injection therapy. The perception of pain relief with homeopathic injections was high, reflecting an overall perceived positive outcome and tolerability of this treatment. This case series represents one more encouraging approach to using this complex homeopathic injection for pain relief in breast cancer patients. , epithelial-stromal interactions, mediated by the extracellular matrix, play a pivotal role in normal mammary gland function. It is now recognized that a specific environment is necessary for tumorigenesis; indeed, it has been postulated that cancer can be a physiological response to an abnormal stromal environment. An abnormal stroma can be regarded as a classical promoter in the terminology of carcinogenesis, in that the dysfunction of normal epithelial-mesenchymal interactions increases the probability that the pre-neoplastic lesion will progress to malignancy. On the other hand, in the terminology of development, the environment provided by the abnormal stroma may be considered 'permissive' for tumorigenesis by leading to the selection of cells with altered survival characteristics. These views signify that an aberrant stroma predisposes tissue to cancer by increasing the frequency with which an initiated cell proceeds to neoplasia, rather than by increasing the frequency of initiation. Importantly, normal stroma can efficiently inhibit the expression of neoplastic characteristics of tumour cells. Conversely, perturbations in the epithelial-stromal interaction may accelerate the process of carcinogenesis, especially since carcinogen exposure elicits persistent phenotypic changes in stromal cells. These non-neoplastic stromal effects induced by carcinogens can be conducive to the expression of or to the progression of pre-neoplastic phenotypes, just as carcinoma-associated fibroblasts support malignant behaviours. Together these stromal alterations are likely to be essential to the development of frank neoplastic disease. These studies emphasize that the interactions between the epithelium and the stroma evolve dynamically, and thus will require considerable study if they are to be manipulated therapeutically. Together, these recent studies underscore that the stromal-epithelial interface is a critical mediator of oncogenic potential. The heightened awareness of the stroma as an active participant in carcinogenesis has led to ideas for intervening in breast cancer progression by manipulating the stroma. Compared with the multiple routes taken by cells to become cancers, the response of tissues to cancer is relatively predictable. Controlling the early stages of invasive cancer growth may therefore be more readily achieved indirectly via the stroma. So, the facts are not so simple; hunting the cancer cells only does not cover the whole story, moreover when toxic substances for the whole health economy are used, so that necessarily in each one cytotoxic chemical treatment a difficult dilemma always arises for both the physician and the patient: are the gains more than losses or the reverse and in what extent? In this dilemma at least the physician has to reply objectively and honestly, as he is bound both by medical jurisprudence and the Hippocratic Oath. Of course, any nontoxic therapy targeting to kill cancer cells, as the above mentioned cytotoxic action of homeopathic products on breast cancer cells, is certainly remarkable, impressive and promising for present and future research and clinical applications. But, Pathology itself is the Discipline that dictates directions for all of us, either conventional or ‘complementary’ therapists or researchers. Modern Pathology, considering also the principles  founded by Hippocrates and Virchow, dictates us, as above, to give priority not to the cancer cell itself only, but mainly on the integrity of the diseased tissue as a whole field and as it basically expressed by the balance between stroma and cancer cells. This is the battlefield according to both modern medical literature and of modern Holistic / Homeopathic Clinical Conception and, if we want to win, we have to adhere to it. Certainly, conventional medicine has tried to make certain steps towards this direction, including the employment of factors inhibiting angiogenesis in the stroma of malignant tumours and, of course, this is encouraging for all, such as any conventional intervention through immune mechanisms, pathways, etc. affecting possibly cancer cells growth. From our side, the holistic in the wider sense, the homeopathic in the more specific and more familiar to me sense, a long, very long basic research, bio-theoretical approaches and clinical applications  have already offered a very rich and evidenced material ,absolutely accessibly to all the medical community, despite the hard persecutions of many pioneers in the field and their followers in many countries all over the world, unfortunately certain of them included in our European family. An example of relevant holistic /homeopathic application is Homotoxicology, a Pathology-based Homeopathic approach, which was developed certain decades ago by Dr Reckeweg in Germany. Homotoxicology deals with the structural and functional stages that an organ or tissue passes successively from mild reactive disorders, such as acute inflammations and allergies to the most dangerous ones, namely the degenerative ,the autoimmune and, finally, Cancer. According to this systematic pathogenetic chain investigation, any tissue pathology, like Cancer, first starts in the stroma and then is extended in the cells, so that the most suitable strategy is to target first of all to the stroma through appropriate homeopathic remedies’ combinations. The integrity of the whole tissue and organ economy, the totality of any organ or tissue morphologic and functional homeostasis, was the subject of all renown homeopaths in the history of Homeopathy, when they had in front of them a case with deep organ pathology, like Cancer. The Homeopathic and the Homeopathic Repertories themselves are the  cornucopia of marvellous remedies able to face effectively deep pathologies, such as Cancer. The homeopathic secret for the treatment of patients  is very simply the in-depth study of the Homeopathic and Repertories, especially of those remedies with a high miasmatic (i.e. concerning disease predispositions) content and/or a highly eclectic/selective action on organs and tissues. The British Homeopathic history has certain great Medical Homeopaths who pioneered in Pathology-sensitive Homeopathy, such as Hughes, Burnett, Clarke etc., not of course to neglect E Bach for his homeopathic bowel nosodes, in addition to his much more known Flower Remedies. Last but not the least ,the correct spelling  ‘Homoeopathy’ has been arbitrarily changed to ‘Homeopathy’, a term objectively disorienting people from the Classic Medical Tradition, the Hippocratic one, which is the solid and indisputable foundation of our Homoeopathic Medical Conception. All Homoeopathic Institutions, Societies, Associations, etc. all over the world should return to the correct spelling: if they wish to comply first with their Medical Tradition.

Thank you for this well researched and positive article about homeopathy and severe pathology. I am happy that you mention Switzerland, my country of birth, where all my family and friends always used and still do use homeopathy.I wonder if homeopathy has something to do with nano particles? MM MD PhD MFHom Consultant Pathologist DIHom HMD is holder of Diploma  (DIHom) and Postgraduate Diploma (HMD) in Homeopathic Medicine and Fellow of the British Institute of Homoeopathy in the UK(FBIH) . He is Member of The Faculty of Homoeopathy (MFHom),UK , the highest  statutorily recognized title of Homeopathic education for Medical Doctors  in the UK, renowned throughout the European Union and worldwide - evidence of high quality medical specialization in Homeopathy. He is also connected with the International Liga of Homeopathic Medicine and to the European Committee of Homeopathy through the Faculty of Homeopathy. He also completed  additional training in Medical Phytotherapy (Specially Structured Diploma Course) in the College of Phytotherapy in the UK. His medical homeopathic work has achieved international recognition: awarded the ""Irene Baha"" Prize by the Hellenic Society of Homeopathic Medicine and selected to join UK celebrities in a Letter of Appeal for the establishment of a Natural Medicine Hospital in UK. For this reason he was also invited at the Scottish Parliament in 2001 for a relevant reception to officially launch the Appeal. In his practice and methodology  he complies with the modern, scientific face of Homeopathy and has promoted “Pathology-based Homeopathy” in order that Homeopathy may be acceptable in National Health Systems as a discipline enrolled in mainstream medicine. He has essentially developed new perspectives from “homeopathic”, integrative and systemic perception and evaluation of the pathology of tissues and organs of the body, so that  pathology itself may be appropriately assimilated for Homeopathic therapeutic applications. He has continuously worked clinically  throughout the past 25 (twenty five) years in Medical  Homeopathy ,establishing  “Homeopathic Estia” initially and currently directing ""Homeopathic Health Care"" for the treatment of all Chronic Diseases.
