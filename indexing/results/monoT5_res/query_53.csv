a9ef428c-a299-4586-9c4e-d690ceeed776,"» A meta-analysis of 12 RCTs that assessed the efficacy of psychotherapy in patients with advanced, incurable cancer found that psychotherapy moderately improved depression scores (SMD, -0.67; 95% CI, -1.06 to -0.29; = .0005), although the researchers determined the quality of the evidence was low. A Cochrane review of RCTs of women with nonmetastatic breast cancer determined that 3 of the 4 analyzed studies reported improvements in depression scores after psychotherapy; however, a meta-analysis could not be performed— and the analyses did not include patients with clinically diagnosed depression. Among men with prostate cancer, a meta-analysis of 11 RCTs found that an intervention of some type improved depressive symptom scores. Psychotherapy and/or peer support, specifically, improved scores significantly (SMD, -1.09; 95% CI, -2.05 to -0.13). The data regarding the effect of psychotherapy on cancer-related fatigue have been mixed. A Cochrane review of 27 RCTs evaluating psychosocial interventions for fatigue among patients receiving active treatment for cancer found that 7 studies reported a significant improvement in fatigue. Psychosocial interventions were more efficacious if they were specific for fatigue. Similarly, a Cochrane review of psychosocial interventions for patients with incurable cancer receiving treatment with palliative intent found that psychosocial interventions had no effect on reducing fatigue after the intervention was compared with controls, although there was a small benefit at first follow-up that was not sustained at second follow-up. The authors concluded that the evidence supporting the effectiveness of psychotherapy was of low quality. A meta-analysis of 113 RCTs of adults with cancer that assessed different types of interventions for cancer-related fatigue found that, among the appropriate studies, psychological interventions significantly reduced cancer-related fatigue (weighted effect size [WES], 0.27; 95% CI, 0.21-0.33; < .001). Psychological interventions plus exercise also demonstrated benefit, but pharmacologic interventions did not. Two meta-analyses found that psychotherapy improves pain among patients with cancer. One study that included 37 RCTs of adults with cancer found that psychosocial interventions improved pain severity (WES, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.23-0.45; < .001) and pain interference (WES, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21-0.60; < .001). Another meta-analysis of 26 RCTs of women with breast cancer similarly found that psychosocial interventions improved pain, though the effect size was more conservative when adjusted for potential publication bias. Two RCTs demonstrated that psychotherapy can reduce fear associated with cancer recurrence. A study of 164 patients with a history of melanoma were randomly assigned to a psychoeducational intervention that included 3 telephone-based sessions over 1 month or usual care. The psychoeducational intervention resulted in lower fear of cancer recurrence severity, trigger, and distress scores compared with the control group at 6 months. In another RCT, 222 patients with curable breast cancer, colorectal cancer, or melanoma were randomly assigned to receive psychotherapy with 5 face-to-face sessions or attention control (relaxation therapy). There was a greater improvement in the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Index scores and severity subscores with psychotherapy compared with attention control interventions. Data regarding the association between psychotherapy and survival are mixed. In a Cochrane review of 10 RCTs of women with metastatic breast cancer, psychological intervention was associated with a 1-year overall survival benefit (odds ratio [OR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.07-1.99), but a benefit was not seen at the 5-year follow-up point 5-years (OR, 0.103; 95% CI, 0.42-2.52). The authors reported that a clear pattern cannot be distinguished because there was a wide variation in outcome measures and duration of follow-up across the studies that were included in the review. Another meta-analysis of 15 RCTs of adults with cancer found no association between psychosocial interventions and survival, although a subgroup analysis based on results from 6 of the 15 trials revealed that psychoeducational intervention was associated with prolonged survival among patients with nonmetastatic disease, resulting in a 41% reduction in the risk of dying of cancer (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.49-0.71). Most studies suggest that psychotherapy interventions may benefit patients with cancer or survivors of cancer for various QoL-related complications associated with disease. Importantly, most meta-analyses deemed the existing evidence as low quality, suggesting that more well-designed studies are needed to definitively evaluate the potential benefit of psychotherapy in this population.

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening children (seven to 11 years of age) for MDD. .  Enlarge     Print Screening and Treatment for MDD in Children and Adolescents: Clinical Summary of the USPSTF Recommendation Screen (when systems for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up are in place) Grade: B No recommendation Grade: I (insufficient evidence) Risk factors for MDD include parental depression, having comorbid mental health or chronic medical conditions, and having experienced a major negative life event. The following screening tests have been used successfully in adolescents in primary care settings: Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A) Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care (BDI-PC) Screening instruments do not perform as well in younger children. Among pharmacotherapies, the SSRI fluoxetine has been found to be efficacious. However, because of the risk of suicidality, SSRIs should be considered only if clinical monitoring is possible. Various modes of psychotherapy and the combination of pharmacotherapy with psychotherapy have been found to be efficacious.

Screening and Treatment for MDD in Children and Adolescents: Clinical Summary of the USPSTF Recommendation Screen (when systems for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up are in place) Grade: B No recommendation Grade: I (insufficient evidence) Risk factors for MDD include parental depression, having comorbid mental health or chronic medical conditions, and having experienced a major negative life event.

Evidence on the balance of benefits and harms of treatment of children is insufficient for a recommendation. : For the full recommendation statement and supporting documents, visit . MDD = major depressive disorder; SSRI = selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; USPSTF = U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. MDD among youth is a disabling condition that is associated with serious long-term morbidities and risk of suicide. However, the majority of youth with depression are undiagnosed and untreated. There is adequate evidence that screening tests accurately identify MDD in adolescents. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening tests accurately identify MDD in children. Adolescents (12 to 18 years of age): The USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), psychotherapy, or combined therapy (SSRIs and psychotherapy) leads to decreases in MDD symptoms in adolescents. Children (seven to 11 years of age): The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to support the benefits of treating MDD in children. SSRIs (fluoxetine) reduce MDD symptoms in children; however, there are limited data on the benefits of psychotherapy and the benefits of psychotherapy plus SSRIs. Adolescents: There is convincing evidence that taking SSRIs may lead to harms (risk of suicidality [i.e., suicide ideation, preparatory acts, or suicide attempts]) in adolescents. Limited evidence exists regarding the harms of combining SSRIs and psychotherapy. However, there is inadequate evidence about the harms of screening and psychotherapy in adolescents, which are probably small. Children: SSRIs (fluoxetine) demonstrated harms in children (risk of suicidality); however, there is limited evidence on the harms of psychotherapy or the harms of combining of psychotherapy and SSRIs (fluoxetine). There is also limited evidence about the harms of screening children. The USPSTF judged that the overall evidence is inadequate regarding the harms of screening and treatment of MDD in children. In adolescents (12 to 18 years of age), there is moderate certainty that the net benefit of psychotherapy is moderate. In children (seven to 11 years of age), the evidence is lacking, and the balance of benefits and harms of psychotherapy cannot be determined. This USPSTF recommendation addresses screening for MDD in adolescents and children in the general population. There is a spectrum of depressive disorders. This report focuses only on screening for MDD and does not address screening for various less severe depressive disorders. A variety of factors contribute to the development of MDD. Most persons who develop MDD have multiple risk factors. However, risk factors for MDD can be difficult to assess. As a result, researchers have focused on identifying youth subgroups at increased risk of developing MDD. Important risk factors that can be assessed relatively accurately and reliably include parental depression, having comorbid mental health or chronic medical conditions, and having experienced a major negative life event. Instruments developed for primary care (e.g., Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents [PHQ-A], the Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care [BDI-PC]) have been used successfully in adolescents. There are limited data describing the accuracy of using MDD screening instruments in children. Among pharmacothera-pies available for the treatment of MDD in children and adolescents, SSRIs have been found to be efficacious. Treating youth with depression using SSRIs is associated with an increased risk of suicidality, and therefore should be considered only if judicious clinical monitoring is possible. Psychotherapy trials indicate that a variety of psychotherapy types are efficacious among adolescents, including cognitive behavioral and interpersonal therapies. Harms of psychotherapy are believed to be small. Choose a single article, issue, or full-access subscription. Log in >> Purchase Access: To see the full article, log in or purchase access.

We describe a common infrastructure that underpins all schools of psychotherapy. Source: Photo by Possessed Photography on Unsplash Ben Johnson and I wrote an article two years ago including the pathology we aim (primarily) to change and the mechanisms by which psychotherapeutic change can take place. The article in its present form (revised after one round of peer review) just passed 800 reads on ResearchGate, though we have not yet found a publisher. The article describes the common infrastructure that underpins essentially all schools and orientations of . Having a common model makes teaching and learning simpler and more efficient. Conceptualizing the common infrastructure provides a kind of Rosetta Stone to translate between seemingly incompatible constructs belonging to diverse schools of therapy. The model describes components of psychotherapy theory that have historically been the least thoroughly described, and thereby supports, rather than challenges existing schools and techniques. The core concept of the model is the hypothesis that entrenched maladaptive patterns of response (EMPs), which are the primary targets of psychotherapy, are universally triggered by deep emotions located mainly in the limbic system. These deep emotions are essentially always of negative valence because that is how the brain signals threat and EMPs constitute protective responses to threat. In other words, the problems psychotherapy aims to change represent some form of “coping gone awry.” This brief statement requires a bit of explanation. First, in the article, we call them EDPs, with the “D” standing for . The Convergence SIG of SEPI has settled on EMP, where the “M” is for to emphasize their evolutionary purpose. Otherwise, the two are the same. Furthermore, the avoidance of deep emotions comes in many forms. The most primitive are responses like freezing, , and , which have evolved far up the evolutionary tree before humans or even primates existed. Next are responses that become embedded in patterns and traits. These are often responses to adverse conditions during the first years of life. They may have a genetic component as well as representing adaptation to the human environment. The avoidance strategies they represent often reflect the limited cognitive abilities of very young children. Third, are problems resulting from developmental deficits. Development is the result of experience and developmental deficits are often the result of a lack of exposure to important experiences. The result is a failure to develop important skills. The absence of an adaptive response or the resultant expression of a more primitive response (for example the emotional breakdown of a borderline patient) is, in fact, a form of entrenched maladaptive response. Further along the developmental scale come an impressive variety of automatic thoughts, feelings, impulses to act, and visceral changes, any of which can secondarily trigger the consciously chosen avoidance patterns that are the targets of . In this way, the wide variety of maladaptive responses that can be addressed in psychotherapy can all (we believe) be explained as the mind’s attempts to mitigate threats through avoidance of the mind’s proxy for danger, namely, deep emotions of negative valence. For clinicians, the best indicator we have of the activation of deep emotions is , defined as conscious feeling accompanied by visceral changes. For this reason, we have called the model the “Affect Avoidance Model.” This is important because, as it turns out, change in existing maladaptive patterns requires that the triggering emotions must be activated. More on this below. Now that we have a universal description of the pathology that is the primary target of psychotherapy, we can look further at the characteristics of EMPs. Most important, as implied by the word “pattern,” these problem responses tend to be repeated. The implication is that they must therefore be stored in , mainly implicit memory and we can describe psychotherapy as an operation aimed at replacing old patterns stored in memory with new ones learned through experience or conscious learning. As it happens, this is where notions from the world of psychotherapy converge with recent neurophysiology. Detailed studies of the learned response, among others, show, so far, that there is only one known mechanism for modifying already laid down patterns of appraisal and response. That mechanism is memory reconsolidation, which happens when the old pattern is neurologically activated in a context where new information contradicts what is predicted. This converges precisely with what Alexander and French described in their analysis of the Corrective Emotional Experience, as well as many other formulations of therapeutic change. An old response is elicited in a context where new information such as the surprising response of the therapist, contradicts what is expected. The new information can be but can also consist of newly acquired skills, sometimes learned through cognitive acquisition as well as experience. It is also important to note that, while memory reconsolidation is currently the only known mechanism for changing existing patterns, the mechanism of extinction may also play a role in therapy. This pathway is neurophysiologically distinct from memory reconsolidation in that response patterns are not changed but are blocked by inhibitory signals sent from the cortex to prevented their outward expression. This inhibition is temporary and must be reinforced if it is to be maintained. It may play a significant role in psychotherapy but is distinct from change due to memory reconsolidation in that the latter is rapid, permanent, and does not require effort to maintain. What the Affect Avoidance Model means to the clinician For us clinicians, this means we have just a few objectives to pursue, which we can do using techniques from many sources. Support activation of relevant deep emotions as evidenced by affect. Simultaneously help the patient to experience or learn surprising new information relevant to the maladaptive pattern being targeted. Help regulate arousal within an optimal window as required for change. Support to do the taxing work of change. Maintain the therapeutic relationship, which plays a vital role in all of the above. We would love to hear what our readers think of this model and the role a universal model of psychotherapy might play in our field. To find a therapist near you, visit the .

Full text available at: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325871396_The_Affect_Avoidance_Model_An_Integrative_Paradigm_for_Psychotherapy_Major_Revision_Final Submitted by reader on November 19, 2020 - 2:10pm interesting, learned a lot about different views I very much enjoyed reading on memory reconsolidation and the mechanism of extinction i'm of a view that if a client needs a brief therapy, a therapist should have enough maturity not to make days into years just because it fits his/her therapeutic framework... and vice versa of course i would think that freezing and panic attack are not actually avoidance of deep emotions in many cases but overly-heightened belated emotional response in response to past trauma, especially panic attacks which would steam more often from adult experiences than childhood experiences i wouldn't necessarily agree that the absence of an adaptive response or the resultant expression of a more primitive response (for example the emotional breakdown of a borderline patient) is, in fact, a form of entrenched maladaptive response person may have fully developed healthy adaptation capacities that break down when experienced threat or trauma is greater than capacity to cope, or capacities are put under strain for a long time and exhausted, so the issue is not that person never had them or didn't develop them, same stands for reactive psychosis and ptsd - breakdown would actually be a healthy adaptive response, weird as it may seem avoidance can be extremely healthy as a coping mechanism, too, and life-saving Submitted by Jeffery Smith on November 22, 2020 - 12:07pm Thanks for engaging. I'm afraid you may have missed the main point, which is that having a simple, universal model can simplify practice, training, and, ultimately, research on how best to foster change. That being said, your point about breakdown of previously learned skills is a valid concept that goes back to Freud. When that happens, people do fall back on responses that are more primitive and instinctive. These are often looked at as failures of coping. They do represent failures, but they are also regressions to some earlier and less effective response. Thus, these breakdowns can be seen as the reappearance of an entrenched maladaptive pattern.

The Post Traumatic Stress Response Helps People Avoid Danger The Intriguing Psychological Puzzle of Tesla Ownership Dreams have been described as dress rehearsals for real life, opportunities to gratify wishes, and a form of nocturnal therapy. A new theory aims to make sense of it all. The Post Traumatic Stress Response Helps People Avoid Danger The Intriguing Psychological Puzzle of Tesla Ownership How to Talk With Your Parents About Getting Counseling If your parents don't understand why you want counseling, read this. A lot of parents don't understand why you'd want to talk with a counselor. It might be they think they should be enough support for you, or they might not believe that getting can help. There are countless reasons it can be hard to talk to your parent(s) about getting counseling, and hopefully, you'll find some advice here to make that conversation go better. Telling your parent(s) that you want to talk with a counselor means letting them know something is not feeling okay in your life. That can be really scary, especially if you don't trust that they'll react well.  If they react by telling you that you shouldn't feel the way you do, or that your problems aren't real, that's called . It's the opposite of accepting how you feel or what you're going through. The first thing to remember is that your feelings are . After talking with a counselor, you might find that your thinking and feelings change. That's great. However, when a person is in distress, that's just a signal that they need some care and support. The bad feeling has a , which is to let you know to get some help. If your parent(s) react in this way, it's possible to respond to them by saying, ""I wish I didn't feel like this too. That's exactly why I want to talk with a counselor."" If Your Parent(s) Thinks They're All the Support You Need Some parents really wish they could help you, and they might feel worried about you wanting support from another adult. They might think it means they're failing as parents, or that it'll undermine your relationship with them. In reality, some people are blessed with parents who are exceptionally warm, open, and . However, most of us aren't as lucky. We have parents who might get defensive, angry, or freaked out if they hear about our problems. The good thing is that you don't need to tell your parent(s) that they're bad listeners to explain why you want to see a counselor. The truth is as simple as this: . By talking to a counselor, you'll get a new perspective or a different type of listening. It doesn't matter if your parents are great at this or awful. We all struggle sometimes, and getting extra help is never a bad idea. The most important thing to know about finding a good counselor is that the right match is important. Some counselors are much better than others. Some can be good for one person, but not the next. There is good research that shows you will be able to predict if a counselor is a good match for you after one or two sessions. If someone isn't a good match, you should feel empowered to talk to someone else.  A good counselor is someone that you believe can help you. They are usually warm, authentic, and you feel that they understand you.  Your school or university might have counselors or psychologists available, or you might be able to find people through your insurance company. There are some free counseling communities where you can talk to volunteers (like  or ), and there are some low-cost alternatives to .

Abby Ellin wrote an article in the New York Times that attracted considerable . Yet that title sums the of what is a major problem. Psychotherapy does a helluva lot more than take “a load off minds,” particularly of the elderly. Mental health in the population, and especially older people. About 30% of American adults get clinically depressed; many argue the rate in the elderly is higher. and drug dependence are also common – and uncommonly treated. Chronic diseases, from pain and arthritis to sleep disorders and coronary disease, have major, mutually reinforcing effects on physical and mental health. Add on the side effects of standard medical treatments and medications - and the encroaching public health disaster of Alzheimer’s – and the mental health problem in older folks is simply huge. Demographics and money. People are living longer. Their physical, mental and social problems increase as they age. Plus there are more older people – a result of the post WWII baby boom. And as always, there is the issue of Mental health parity – equal coverage for mental and physical illness - was supposedly “signed into law” over a decade ago. Thanks to the inventive actions of insurance companies, much of the implementation is only now affecting older people. Things start to happen when somebody actually pays for a service. Families have changed – often dramatically. The extended family of grandparents, parents and children now looks a historical remnant throughout much of America. Despite the economic ravages of the Great Recession, our generations generally live apart. Yet many of today’s elderly remember the family structures of earlier times. They are often hurt and angry that they live alone, that their children are not around to help them throughout the day. Formerly much of elder-care was performed by the female members of the following generation. Women who in previous decades worked at child rearing and elderly support while at home now labor for pay packets outside. They recognize that they should be treated equally with men in business and work. Many households would not survive without their income. Meanwhile, many working men are unwilling – or cannot conceive - of leaving the workforce to take care of parents. That leaves fewer family members able to take care of older parents – though many working women, especially, still feel the responsibility keenly. The result – great intergenerational and much . And loneliness is not merely painful – it is often a killer. Now add on the sad truth that half of people 85 and over will suffer from Alzheimer’s. Family problems – social, economic, psychological – simply mount. And psychotherapy is an obvious place for family intervention. Why Is Mental Health in the Elderly So Poorly Addressed? Because we continually go back and reinvent the wheel. Psychotherapy research on older folks goes back decades. I remember work by Emily Mumford in the 1980’s showing that psychotherapy not only worked well in the elderly, but was more effective in that group than in younger patients. Perhaps most telling, her data showed marked decreases in medical costs for those getting psychotherapy. In an age where every headache deserves an MRI scan, we’re talking big bucks. How Could Psychotherapy Save Us Health Care Money? The ways are relatively limitless. Let’s just take a look at – the second highest economic cost to global economies of any diagnosis, eclipsed for now only by heart disease. Depression has multiple, manifold physical manifestations. Norman Geschwind, when chief of neurology at Harvard, often lectured on how depression could mimic almost any neurological disease – down to “pathognomonic” physical stigmata of stroke. And depressed people get lots of symptoms. They also get more medically ill (one reason the insurance companies love to cherry pick people with mood disorders off their lists). They even get more Alzheimer’s disease. Treating depression effectively – through psychotherapy, family psychotherapy, and non-pharmacologic techniques like light, physical, and social activity, can save a lot of lives and money. Why Is Psychotherapy Particularly Powerful in the Elderly? One big reason is . Old folks take a lot of drugs. And effects and side effects of drugs are multiplied by age. Aided by Big Pharma, many physicians routinely give older people , anti- agents, even potent anti-psychotics as the “main” treatment for a host of mental problems – even symptoms as common as . It’s usually faster to prescribe pills than taking “all that time” to take about their overall problems, family issues, and behavioral means that could make people better. Meanwhile, more hospital admissions arise from drug “side” effects.  Psychotherapy has many effects, but it does not create drug side effects. It can be used readily, for example, to get people off - and other addictive drugs. And people also greatly benefit from talking with somone, social support, intelligent advice and sympathetic understanding. Psychotherapy for the elderly can and does do a lot more than take “a load off the mind.” It can treat common problems like insomnia and depression, knit families together, mitigate the effects of polypharmacy, alleviate loneliness and isolation, and at the same time provide major physical health benefits.  Elderly folks need to regenerate their bodies just as much as young folks. Humans bodies and brains rebuild - or die. And psychotherapy can also save money. These days, that looks like a deal we shouldn’t pass up.

A new theory aims to make sense of it all. 7 Gaslighting Phrases Used to Confuse and Control The Psychology of Deception: Asking Questions to Spot Liars What to Do (and Not Do) After You’ve Been Cheated On How Gabby Giffords Used Music to Regain Her Speech  >  PET is a form of for post- disorder (). Originally developed by Edna Foa, Ph.D., PET is endorsed by both the American Association and the Department of Veterans Affairs and Defense. After a traumatic event, some people experience unwanted thoughts, disturbing nightmares, feelings of hopelessness, , and hypervigilance. If you have these symptoms, you understandably want to avoid thoughts, feelings, and things that remind you of the trauma. The goal of PET is to gradually help you reengage with life, especially with things you have been avoiding. By doing so, you will strengthen your ability to distinguish safety from danger and decrease your PTSD symptoms. PET is appropriate for anyone who has experienced or witnessed a event. Many people who experience a traumatic event do not develop , and PET is not necessary for those without a PTSD diagnosis. Additionally, given that the completion of PET requires a person to speak about the trauma and to encounter trauma-related thoughts, feelings, and objects, you may experience moderate distress. This distress is often brief, and people typically feel significantly better because of treatment. Narrative Consciousness, Memory, and PTSD in Westworld PET is conducted by a single clinician through one-on-one . Sessions typically last 90 minutes and occur once a week for approximately three months, though treatment can be shorter at two months or longer at 15 weeks. PET treatment involves Imaginal Exposure and In Vivo Exposure. During Imaginal Exposure sessions, you will discuss some of the events of your trauma. A therapist might ask you to write down your traumatic experience, read the experience aloud—in and out of session. Your therapist will guide you through the retelling of your trauma. You will explore your thoughts and feelings, which is called processing. This will help you decrease the unwanted traumatic reminders, as well as feel less distress when recalling the trauma. In Vivo Exposure, meaning “in life,” sessions involve your real-life interaction with safe things that you have been avoiding. In these sessions, your therapist will first ask you to make a list of the things you have been avoiding (sounds and places, for example). You will create an “exposure hierarchy” by ranking these avoided things based on how much distress they cause you when you encounter them. PET is based on associative learning theory, when two things appear together the brain learns to connect or associate them. Ivan Pavlov created the most famous associative learning experiment by repeatedly ringing a bell before presenting his dogs with food. The dogs began to salivate at the sound of the bell, as they learned to associate the bell with food. To break this association, Pavlov then repeatedly rang the bell without giving the dogs any food; the dogs eventually stopped salivating when they heard the bell. This same process is behind PTSD. When a trauma occurs, there are many things in —smells, sights, sounds—that the brain associates with the trauma. When we encounter those things outside of the trauma, the brain expects danger, causing and . What to Look for in a PET Therapist Health providers can receive training and certification for PET. Some institutions, such as university clinics, provide intensive workshops or seminars in PET, with therapists completing one-on-one consultation therapy cases. McLean, C. P., & Foa, E. B. (2011).

Courage to Think the Unthinkable: The Pandemic Might Get Worse How to Find Empathy for People You Don’t Understand  >  Multicultural addresses the concerns of those whose race, , religion, identification, income, disability, or other social factor falls outside of the majority. Issues that arise for minority groups, such as oppression, , and marginalization, are relevant and recognized. The therapist is more culturally aware, and there is more emphasis on individualism than in some traditional therapy settings that take a more universal approach. Multicultural therapy is a form of talk therapy, but it may be combined with therapies that involve other activities, such as art or music, if these interventions can help clients communicate better. Members of minority groups, including immigrants and refugees, and others who feel marginalized by majority members of society can benefit from multicultural . Multicultural therapy can be applied to cognitive behavior therapy, couples counseling, family therapy, and other types of therapy appropriate for children, adults, individuals, or families, as long the therapist understands the psychosocial issues that affect the development of marginalized clients and the unique problems they face. When therapy is eclectic, the influence of the client’s culture must be weighed throughout every aspect of the therapeutic process. Welcoming Refugees and Immigrants Is Good for the U.S. At first, time may be spent developing trust and mutual respect as you come to understand the therapeutic process and the therapist comes to understand your issues, needs, and expectations. Your therapist can then begin to help you understand which aspects of your problem may be rooted in the relationship between your culture and the majority, dominant culture, and which may stem from something else. Together, you work to find appropriate solutions. Multicultural therapy recognizes that psychosocial development is not necessarily the same for people of different cultures and backgrounds, and that minority groups are underrepresented in the mental health professions. So it is essential that counselors and therapists who work with varied populations are knowledgeable about, sensitive to, and comfortable with, cultural differences. Otherwise, it is impossible to establish the trust necessary to work with clients of different races, religions, orientations, geographic locations, ages, socioeconomic backgrounds, and family types. Multicultural therapists must reflect on their own biases, lack of awareness or lack of understanding of the issues affecting specific groups of people. At times, there may be a need for the therapist to refer the client to a different therapist who shares the same culture. In multicultural therapy, the quality of the relationship established between the therapist and the client is key to success. What to Look for in a Multicultural Therapist A multicultural therapist is a licensed mental health professional, social worker, or therapist with additional training in cultural competency and multicultural counseling, generally through graduate work or continuing . Developing cultural sensitivity and competency is an ongoing process, so it is important to look for a therapist who also has experience in multicultural therapy. In addition to training and experience, it is important to find a therapist who communicates an awareness of your particular culture, beliefs, and practices, whose and expectations for treatment are in line with yours, and with whom you feel comfortable discussing personal issues.

Courage to Think the Unthinkable: The Pandemic Might Get Worse  >  Narrative is a form of counseling that views people as separate from their problems. This allows clients to get some distance from the issue to see how it might actually be helping them, or protecting them, more than it is hurting them. With this new perspective, individuals feel more empowered to make changes in their thought patterns and behavior and “rewrite” their life story for a future that reflects who they are, what they are capable of, and what their purpose is, separate from their problems. Individuals, couples, and families can all benefit from narrative . Those who define themselves by their problems, whose lives are dominated by such feelings as “I am a person” or “I am an person” can learn to see their problem as something they have but not something that identifies who they are. Your therapist will encourage you to direct the conversation by asking what you prefer to talk about and, on an ongoing basis, checking to see if the topic, which is most likely a problem, is still something you are interested in discussing. After some time, your therapist will lead you to tell other, more positive stories from your life to help you discover inherent traits and skills that can be used to address your problems. The goal is for you to see how there are positive and productive ways to approach your life and your future when you stop identifying yourself by your problems. In narrative therapy, the events that occur over time in a person’s life are viewed as stories, some of which stand out as more significant or more fateful than others. These significant stories, usually stemming from negative events, can ultimately shape one’s . Beyond this identity, the narrative therapist views a client’s life as multitiered and full of possibilities that are just waiting to be discovered. The therapist does not act as the expert, but rather helps clients see how they are the experts regarding their own life and, as such, can uncover the , values, , and skills that define who they really are, separate from their problems. These are the buried stories that can be rewritten and woven into the ongoing and future story of their lives. What to Look for in a Narrative Therapist A narrative therapist is a licensed mental health professional, social worker, or therapist who has additional training in narrative therapy through academic programs, intensive workshops, or online continuing . In addition to checking credentials and experience, you should feel safe and comfortable working with any narrative therapist you choose.

A New Big Five for Psychotherapists An EFT therapist observes the dynamics between clients in the setting, ties this behavior to the dynamics in their home lives, and helps direct new conversations and interactions based on more honest feelings. To accomplish this, your therapist will encourage you to look at your current emotional issues and then help you discover feelings and emotions that you may not realize you have. You may discover deeper past feelings and vulnerabilities that are blocked by the more immediate emotions you display in your current relationship. You will learn to express these emotions in a way that will help you connect, rather than disconnect with your partner or family member. You will learn new ways to listen and stay attuned to another’s emotions and discover more productive ways to respond to emotional situations. EFT focuses on the present time to makes changes in the here and now. There are three steps, or stages, of EFT. The first is to de-escalate the couple’s or family member’s negative cycle of interactions, and help them see and understand what is happening in their relationship. Clients come to see that the problems lie in insecurities and distance. The next stage is to restructure interactions, wherein the therapist helps clients discuss their fears in the relationship, using language that doesn’t push the other away. Clients learn to turn toward each other and discuss their needs and they become more open and responsive to each other. Consolidation is the third stage of EFT, wherein the therapist helps clients see how they got into negative patterns and points out how they were able to change those patterns and can continue these types of conversations in the future.

Why College Prestige Matters and Why It Shouldn't Courage to Think the Unthinkable: The Pandemic Might Get Worse How to Find Empathy for People You Don’t Understand CBS 60 Minutes News on Treating Depression: Sorting Through the Confusion What if We Held Psychotherapy to Same Standards as Medication? In well-phrased soundbites, psychologist Irving Kirsch repeated his familiar claims that his research challenged the very effectiveness of antidepressants. Irving Kirsch: The difference between the effect of a placebo and the effect of an antidepressant is minimal for most people. Lesley Stahl: So you're saying if they took a , they'd have the same effect? Irving Kirsch: They'd have almost as large an effect and whatever difference there would be would be clinically insignificant. Are the 17 million Americans taking antidepressants to relieve their mood disorders misguided? The inept response from the American Association in the following days was not particularly reassuring, unless one accepts the authority of psychiatrists without question. ""...not just wrong, but irresponsible and dangerous reporting,"" said the President of the American Psychiatric Association John Oldham, M.D. If the effects of antidepressants are ""clinically insignificant,"" what does Kirsch propose in their place? In a recent article he recommended alternative treatments be exhausted, presumably psychotherapy, before prescribing to depressed persons. And from his : Psychotherapy works for the treatment of , and the benefits are substantial. In head-to-head comparisons, in which the short-term effects of psychotherapy and antidepressants are pitted against each other, psychotherapy works as well as medication. This is true regardless of how depressed the person is to begin with. Only as well? Does that mean that psychotherapy is no better than sugar pills? How could the effects of antidepressants be ""clinically insignificant,"" while the effects of psychotherapy are ""substantial"" when they are just as good as medication? What if we applied his criterion evenhandedly to both antidepressants and psychotherapy for depression? Clearly, previous estimates of the efficacy of antidepressants versus pill placebos based on meta-analyses of published clinical trials have been exaggerated. That was shown by former FDA employee and psychiatrist Erick Turner and colleagues who extracted data for 12 antidepressants approved for antidepressants approved by the FDA between 1987 and 2004 starting with fluoxetine. In a  article, they compared FDA's regulatory decisions to what was reported in the literature. According to FDA analyses, only half of the trials were positive, but according to the published journal articles, almost all of the trials were positive. In almost a dozen cases, trials that were negative or questionable according to the FDA were published as if they were positive. Once unpublished reports were taken into account, the overall effect size (ES) for antidepressants relative to placebo was reduced from 0.41 to 0.31, where ES is the standardized mean difference in improvement. However, in all cases, antidepressants were significantly superior to pill placebos. So, Turner and colleagues found that antidepressants were not they are cracked up to be, but they would not go so far as  to dismiss them as ineffective. As Turner was later quoted, ""the glass is far from full but far from empty."" Shortly afterwards, I drew upon FDA data for four of the 12 drugs examined by Turner and his colleagues—SSRIs paroxetine and fluoxetine, the 5HT antagonist and weak SSRI nefazodone, and the SNRI venlafaxine. They found essentially the same effect size of ES = 0.32 as Turner's group. However, Kirsch and co-authors applied the criterion of ES= 0.50 for clinical significance and judged the effects of antidepressants as not being clinically significant. They cited the UK National Initiative for Clinical Excellence (NICE) standard, but by the time of Kirsch's interview on 60 Minutes, the standard of ES = 0.50 had quietly been abandoned by NICE. We are left guessing why, but maybe, with its new turn to what examining actually happens in with treatment in the community, not just in clinical trials, someone recognized that an ES=  0.50 is not often attained. I emailed a number of prominent psychiatrists and health services researchers in the UK ,asking them about the former NICE criteria of ES= .050.  Simon Gilbody replied: ""I never believe any study these days which finds an ES > 0.5. it usually means the science is wrong and we haven't found the (es) just yet."" questioned Kirsch and colleagues' decision to pool the data from the particular four antidepressants because venlafaxine was widely regarded as being more effective than SSRIs. Moreover, Bristol-Myers Squibb withdrew nefazodone from the US and Canadian markets in 2004. Re-analyses of the same data found that both venlafaxine and paroxetine surpassed the NICE criterion of ES = 0.50. In an  Turner commented upon the contrast between Kirsch's and his interpretation of essentially identical effect sizes. He noted that the NICE criterion of an effect size of 0.5 had been taken from Jacob Cohen's designation of it as ""medium"", but Cohen himself had distanced himself from  his own designation of effect sizes as ""small,"" ""medium,"" or ""large"" with ""The values chosen had no more reliable a basis than my own ."" Turner suggested that Cohen would undoubtedly have rejected NICE's rigid distinction of 0.5 as a  categorical cutoff between ineffective versus effective treatments. Indeed, Cohen who is now deceased, offered no hint that he would have welcomed becoming the arbiter of categorical judgments of clinical significance and famously lampooned the categorical p<.05 for deciding the world is flat rather than round. It seems unfair that pharmacological, and not psychotherapeutic, treatment has become the usual first line approach to depression merely for economic reasons. But before we embrace any treatment as first line, it is prudent to ask whether its efficacy is beyond question. For psychotherapy trials, there is no equivalent of the FDA whose records we can examine, so how can we be sure that selective publication is not occurring here as well? It is noteworthy that the producer for the CBS 60 Minutes program, Rich Bonin, approached Turner about appearing on the program, apparently after his team had interviewed Kirsch. When Turner explained why he thought that matters were not as simple as Kirsch had presented, the CBS producer began thinking out loud with his co-producer about whether they should proceed with the story, ""or is it too murky... Is it good murky, or is it just murky?"" The question was resolved by leaving Turner out of the program. Better a dramatic even if inaccurate message rather than a ""murky"" one. What if we applied Kirsch's standards to psychotherapy? Unfortunately with no FDA-like registry of psychotherapy trials, so we cannot be sure we have accessed all unpublished, as well as published, psychotherapy studies. We do know there's ample evidence of , even if we can't quantify it with much precision. Rosenthal's calculation of the extent of ""file drawer problems"" is generally rejected outside of psychology, and so we should be skeptical of estimates of how many trials need to be left in file drawers in order for estimates of the efficacy of psychotherapy to be revised. Just as published reports of the efficacy of antidepressants can be shown to be exaggerated, so too, reports of the efficacy of psychotherapy have been exaggerated, particularly when they are largely based on the many trials conducted by developers and promoters of particular therapies. There's ample evidence of , although the exact extent of it is not known. There is also evidence of confirmatory bias in published studies, selective reporting of outcomes, and that is more predictive of the outcome of a psychotherapy trial than to what a particular trial is being compared. For instance, aof psychotherapy for depression had to exclude a particular problem-solving therapy conducted by its originator because it is such an extreme outlier. I am sure more such examples out there await discovery. Dutch psychologist Pim Cuijpers has shown that when you take quality of psychotherapy trials into account, estimates of effect size plummet. An overall effect size of 0.68 grows  to .74 when only low-quality trials are examined, but then drops to 0.22 when only high-quality trials are considered.  And Pim Cuijpers also showed that differences between particular psychotherapies and active treatment conditions are rarely above 0.20, well below Kirsch's standard of 0.50. In , I argued that pill placebo conditions are not inert because they involve arousing positive expectations and providing considerable support to patients. We probably cannot expect sugar pills to perform well without the positive expectations and social support, but we cannot find many comparisons of psychotherapies to pill placebo conditions in the literature. My colleagues and I conducted such a from the community and found significant, but only modest differences between psychotherapy and pill placebo, ES = 0.34. Currently, I are working on a meta-analysis of psychotherapy versus pill placebo, but we shouldn't expect the differences to even approach Kirsch's 0.5, given the effect sizes found in the individual trials that are available for entry into the meta-analysis. Because pill placebo should be considered an active treatment condition, we should expect differences from psychotherapy to be less than when psychotherapy is compared to a waitlist or no treatment control. Consistent with this argument,  showed that cognitive behavior therapy for disorders was superior to control conditions, but that cognitive behavior therapy and pill placebo were not significantly different. But he only had a few comparisons to work with. The bottom line is that if we applied Kirsch's criterion to psychotherapy in an evenhanded fashion, we would have to accept that psychotherapy has only clinically insignificant differences from a sugar pill. But in the midst of the raging culture wars pitting antidepressants against psychotherapy and psychiatrists against psychologists and social workers, nobody really wants to make that claim, and certainly not Kirsch, and maybe we need to reconsider his evaluation of antidepressants. The 60 Minutes program about antidepressants has created quite a stir, and most of my fellow psychologists have been wildly enthusiastic about Kirsch's claims, and endorsing them without giving them a needed critical look, even many who are outspoken about their commitment to being evidence-based skeptics. In the end, they are proving more loyal to their guild than to being evidence-based or evenhanded. Regardless, in the current the current culture wars, I'm not confident that many psychologists can be encouraged to take a critical look at Kirsch's claims or that they will be persuaded by evidence contrary to their position on the superiority of psychotherapy. Antidepressants versus psychotherapy is an emotional issue around which battle lines are drawn and the troops deeply dug in. Evidence is immediately classified as either for or against, and judged before it is carefully evaluated... Erick Turner fittingly quotes George Bush employing the false dilemma fallacy: ""either you're with us, or you're with the terrorists."" But we need to overcome the strong inclination to ignore the implications of an evenhanded application of Kirsch's criterion, even if we admit that that this criterion is somewhat arbitrary, if we are true to the principles of evidence-based practice. My take away message is that on average, no treatment for depression is entirely satisfactory, but individual patients may nonetheless demonstrate improvement. In a future blog, I will take a critical look at Kirsch's other claim that the superiority of antidepressants over pill placebo emerges only with severe depression. But for now, I think it's important to point out that what we mean by ""severity"" is not adequately encompassed by a score on a single rating scale. Severity can also involve length of current episode and the severity and number of past episodes. If people have experienced severe depression in the past, I don't think it is necessarily advisable to them to wait until they attain some arbitrary point on a rating scale before getting . And as was shown by our clinical trial with mildly depressed patients referred by community physicians, both behavior therapy and antidepressants benefit some mildly depressed patients. The trick is figuring out which individual patients, and deciding what to do until we can figure them out. As is more commonly recognized in Europe than in the United States, much mild depression in the community resolves itself without intensive intervention like medication or psychotherapy. In Europe, the preferred strategy is to exhaust simpler alternatives before initiating medication or psychotherapy, and this makes particular sense if people have no previous history of depression. Submitted by Cynthia on February 29, 2012 - 2:58pm One of the things with placebos is that they're often called ""sugar pills"" But people in studies can often tell whether they're getting the placebo or the real medication, because the real medication causes actual side effects (as opposed to sugar pills, which don't). I'd like to see every study use placebos that cause some kind of side effect. Load 'em up with niacin for a niacin flush. Or something that causes dry mouth. Then let's compare these placebos to the medication being studied. Methinks we're going to find even more placebo effects. Submitted by Nathan on February 29, 2012 - 4:24pm My understanding of Kirsch's claim is not the effect of taking antidepressants is not clinically meaningless, just that it is not clinically more meaningful than placebo pills. The conclusion he draws is that taking antidepressants makes people feel better because of the placebo effect, not due to the active chemicals in the drug. This still means that taking antidepressants makes people feel better. He never claims that just taking sugar pills will have similar effect. What he does claim is that when people are given placebo sugar pills, told that they are just sugar pills, but research suggests (and it does) that even taking inert pills are helpful for people with depression, they show large effects and don't have side effects. In regards to psychotherapy for treating depression, Kirsch does equate psychotherapy to a placebo, with their connecting theme being that both psychotherapy and plaecbos make people feel more hopeful that they can and will get better, and therefore help them do so. He identifies hopelessness as the key component in maintaining a depressive episode, and psychotherapy as a ""placebo"" to help people me more hopeful. In his book I believe he is pretty up front about that, and when practicing, explains psychotherapy in that way, basically that psychotherapy's primary mechanism of change is placebo (for depression at least). He believes that doing psychotherapy is more ethical than prescribing antidepressants because psychotherapy is a placebo treatment by his definition and upfront about it (""in psychotherapy we are going to work together to support you becoming more hopeful"" , while antidepressant treatments work by having to mislead people. @Cynthia - There are studies that do compare antidepressants to what are called ""active placebos"" as opposed to ""inert placebos."" Kirsch's analysis of them showed that there is no difference between placebos and antidepressants when antidepressants are compared to active placebos. This supports his claim that it is the side effects of medications that make people who take them believe they are working, so they start to feel better because they think they are taking something chemically helpful. It also explains why perhaps drug effects in antidepressant vs inert placebo studies show some antidepressant effect, because participants and doctors can and do break the blind by identifying side effects, so people know they are on antidepressants, not just hopeful that they are, so they are more confident they will feel better. Submitted by Altostrata on February 29, 2012 - 10:22pm Kirsch's analysis has a crucial corollary in that when the benefits of antidepressants are overstated beyond placebo, a proper risk-benefit assessment cannot be conducted to decide whether a patient should be subjected to medication. Psychiatric medications incur substantial health risks, increasing the incidence of diabetes, stroke, heart problems, and osteoporosis -- among other serious medical problems. While not entirely risk-free, psychotherapy does not incur the same health risks. It's by obscuring the risk-benefit balance and making doctors into patsies that pharmaceutical companies have been able to make billions of dollars on unnecessary prescription of medication. Kirsch's work uncovers the smoke and mirrors used to push the commercial agenda. Would that psychotherapy was also overprescribed! As a placebo, it might have done some good and much less bad than the excessive distribution of risky psychiatric drugs. Submitted by Brett Deacon, Ph.D. on March 1, 2012 - 12:21am Thanks for this interesting and provocative analysis. You raise an excellent point – what would Kirsch say if asked to defend the reality that the psychotherapy-placebo difference is similar to the antidepressant-placebo difference? Fortunately, we don’t have to speculate because he directly addressed this issue in a 2002 paper (Kirsch, Scoboria, & Moore, “Antidepressants and Placebos : Secrets, Revelations, and Unanswered Questions,” in Prevention and Treatment). I quote the key paragraph below: “It may well be that the effects of psychotherapy are due to expectancy, conditioning, and other psychological factors that have been hypothesized to be the basis of placebo effect (Kirsch, 1997). Indeed, changing maladaptive expectations is an essential cornerstone of cognitive therapy. But this does not negate its effectiveness. The contention (e.g., Salamone, 2002; Thase, 2002) that the logic of placebo-controlled evaluation should be extended to psychotherapy is mistaken (Kirsch, 1978). In drug research, placebos are used to distinguish the pharmacologically produced effects of substance administration from its psychologically produced effects. However, there are no pharmacologically produced effects of psychotherapy. The effects of a psychological intervention can only be due to psychological factors. Control conditions consisting of alternative psychological treatments (including those erroneously called placebos) are useful in establishing which psychological factors are important in producing the effects of a particular therapy but not in evaluating the efficacy of that treatment. Like placebos, effective psychotherapies may accomplish their effects by changing expectations (Kirsch, 1985, 1990, 1999), but unlike placebos, they do so without deception.” To summarize, the observation that a medication fares little or no better than a placebo pill is devastating; it indicates that the chemical in the pill is therapeutically inert. Alternatively, comparing psychotherapy with a placebo pill is both illogical and less threatening because psychotherapy is supposed to work via psychological factors (like the placebo effect). Your analysis also ignores, as Altostrata pointed out, the critical issue of risk-benefit analysis. Compared to antidepressants, our best psychotherapies are of approximately equal short-term effectiveness. But why stop at this one metric when so many others are at least as important? Relative to antidepressants, psychotherapy is substantially more effective in the long-term after treatment discontinuation, produces no adverse effects vs. the many and often severe adverse effects of antidepressants (e.g., sexual dysfunction, suicide, blunted emotional experience), is more cost-effective in the long-term, and does not induce a state of biologically-induced chronic depression that renders users nonresponsive to subsequent medication treatment in 30%-50% of cases (El-Mallakh, Gao, & Roberts, 2011). Kirsch’s basic point is that given the uninspiring efficacy of antidepressants relative to placebo, and the existence of alternative treatments (e.g., physical exercise, cognitive therapy, behavioral activation) that work just as well in the short-term, work better in the long-term, and have no adverse effects, why should antidepressants be considered a first-line treatment for depression? Among the statements of the many Kirsch-bashers and defenders of biological psychiatry, I have yet to see a compelling argument against this point. In fact, I have yet to see this point directly addressed at all. You certainly won’t find it in the APA statement in response to 60 Minutes. The APA wants us to think that Kirsch is a liar and a fraud, and to forget about the fact that the findings he discussed have been largely replicated by numerous research groups using divergent methodologies and are generally well-accepted in the scientific community. The argument is not whether antidepressants are barely better than placebo, but what the significance of “barely” is. Submitted by Anonymous on March 1, 2012 - 1:01pm Psychotherapy is unlikely to have a long-term negative impact (especially brief treatment) but taking a drug every single day is indeed likely to cause negative impact on the brain. When someone takes a drug every single day and it's an illicit drug, we expect brain damage. Why do we expect that an SSRI would not have this effect? Submitted by disequilibrium1 on February 13, 2014 - 5:23pm Psychotherapy is unlikely to have a long-term negative impact (especially brief treatment).... I'd definitely argue that assertion. Psychotherapy is an artificial relationship that can distort thinking, a one-sided contrivance disguised as intimacy. It can present the practitioner as nearly godlike while promising strength and autonomy. And most relevant here, it can foster self-obsession with wounds, defects, anger, sorrow and helplessness, actually habituating the client to be chronically depressed. disequilibrium1.wordpress.com/ Submitted by James C. Coyne Ph.D. on March 8, 2012 - 8:26am First, it is a pity that if you document Kirsch's shoddy science and wild inferences, you become a ""Kirsch basher"" and that for some people, that label filters any evidence that you present and any holes in his arguments that you uncover. Many of these comments reflect a confusion between Kirsch's opinions about the data and the data themselves. His selection of the criterion of ES = 0.50 was arbitrary and one that many medications widely judged as effective for nonpsychiatric conditions would not meet. Similarly, many psychotherapies would not meet the criterion in comparisons with active treatment conditions, including pill placebo. If the performance of antidepressants is ""uninspiring,” then so too is the performance of psychotherapy, unless someone wants to admit considerable inconsistency in application of a ES = 0.50 criterion. But I don't see Kirsch or people buying into his interpretations typically wanting to extend his criterion. His assertion that the logic of placebo-controlled interventions should not be extended to psychotherapies is a rejection of the basis for the whole evidence supported treatment movement. Maybe he intends that, but it is a radical opinion that should separate him from many of the advocates for evidence supported treatment who uncritically endorse him just because he seems to take their side in the medication versus psychotherapy culture wars. Think about the logic of claims that placebos with side effects are more effective than placebos without them. This has been contradicted in the literally thousands of studies in which drugs under development with appreciable side effects time and time again fail to be different in efficacy then pill placebos. If one checks back to Kirsch's articles in Prevention & Treatment (1998, 2002), one can see an extraordinary consistency of his position, even when it was based on thoroughly inadequate meta-analyses that essentially avoided peer review. Similarly, one sees his past dismissal of critics and refusal to address their claims. To borrow a malapropism from Yogi Berra, “déjà vu all over again.” See my next blog for more extended discussion and documentation. Submitted by Nathan on March 8, 2012 - 9:36am I hope my comments did not come across as labeling you a ""Kirsch Basher.""I certainly did not intend to, greatly respect your work, and take seriously your concern about assessing psychotherapy by the same standard as pharmacotherapy for depression. the ES=.50 is indeed arbitrary, but for assessing changes in depression severity on the HAM-D, it seems pretty reasonable. I agree that there is danger in preselecting effect sizes without a good understanding of the measures being used and the context of the the variables being assessed. Looking at the meaning of a .3 effect size (a common ES Kirsch found) in regards to the HAM-D, translated back to a raw score on the HAM-D, it is only 1.8 points beyond placebo on the 51 point measure. NICE's recommendation that at least 3 points (ES=.5) of change is required to show convincing evidence of clinical significance seems reasonable given the measure, that 3 points is only about 6% change, and differences less than that would be hard for patients/mental health professionals to clinically assess. With this in mind, a lessening of depression severity as indicated by a 1.8 point change on the HAM-D being attributed to a specific drug effect to me does not warrant the risks of being exposed to that drug, if psychological interventions can produce similar overall effects. As a supporter of the EST movement, I think it is important to do controlled experiments on psychological intervention efficacy. If a psychological treatment only produces 1.8 point greater change over TAU, without increasing risks of adverse effects of deterioration, the extra reduction of severity of depression is valuable and preferable. However, if participating in both TAU and the other treatment being studied are both associated with big gains in depression reduction, the study may also provide evidence that both the studied treatment and TAU are effective for treating depression, while one may be more effective than the other (and considered more strongly as a firstline treatment). If an active treatment can only produce a 1.8 point greater change over no treatment, than the benefits of participating in the treatment over risks (cost, time, adverse effects, etc) may not be all that worth the trouble. My biggest critique of the EST movement is the claims that ESTs have known mechanisms of change, when many ESTs (as listed in division 12 of APA's website), an only show that that participating in them show changes in outcomes. It could be that placebo is a big contributor to their effect, and it is tough to do placebo-controlled studies of psychological interventions. I believe that research on psychological treatments should be rigorous, experimental, and controlled as possible, but conclusions drawn from them should not extend beyond the methodological limits of the studies. I believe the debate about EMDR meeting criteria as an EST highlights this critique, as rigorous studies of EMDR have shown that participating in EMDR shows greater reduction in PTSD symptoms beyond no treatment and similar to comparitors, but many people are critical that the active/key component of EMDR, rapid-eye movement, is a mechanism for change. It may be a placebo effect. It nonetheless seems to work, and without increasing risks in comparison to other PTSD treatments. I don't know the research that contradicts Kirsch's speculation that placebos with side effects (active placebos) have similar effects to antidepressant medication for depression, but he seemed to do a pretty thorough survey of the medication indicated for treating MDD. Perhaps for depression, and not for other conditions, this ""side-effect effect"" is present. ES = .0.5 is arbitrary and many accepted medical treatments wouldn't make it Submitted by James C. Coyne Ph.D. on March 8, 2012 - 10:19am What is special about an effect size of .5 and why use it to mark the difference between effective/not effective? Many accepted medical treatments do not achieve it. As Kirsch well knows, mean differences in a clinical trial are not very predictive of individual treatment response. Can be greater or smaller. I agree with you about the exclusion of EMDR from the label ""evidence supported."" Psychotherapy on average has a modest effect (no effect by Kirsch's standard, and people can make intelligent, informed decision to opt for antidepressants as an alternative. In our German trial, evidence for efficacy of antidepressants with mildly depressed was better than evidence for behavior therapy. I would not necessarily recommend one over the other, but would respect patient preference and watch to see if chosen treatment actually worked. But for mild depression, best to wait before committing to intervention anyway. Submitted by Nathan on March 8, 2012 - 1:23pm I agree that setting an ES=.5 as always being a medium effect size is quite arbitrary and definitely not correct. However, determining what amount of effect is worthwhile, worth the risk, or ""enough"" change, is always contextual, and is never static. Getting a statistically significant change with a p-value of <.05 does="""" not="""" necessarily="""" say="""" so="""" much="""" about="""" to="""" what="""" effect="""" a="""" treatment="""" is="""" associated="""" with="""" change="""" in="""" outcome.="""" the="""" drug="""" trials="""" show="""" that="""" small="""" effects="""" can="""" be="""" statistically="""" significant="""" without="""" having="""" clinical="""" relevance.="""" i="""" am="""" saying="""" of="""" antidepressant="""" because="""" it="""" have="""" an="""" es="""">.05, I am saying it is small because of on the particular measure of effect, the HAM-D, the size of effect, while statistically significant, just isn't clinically discernible (Kirsch comes up with 1.8 points). I hold that the meaning of effect sizes are not standard, but in this particular instance of where an effect size of .5 corresponds to a change of 3 points on the HAM-D, I think that is a reasonable minimum amount of change to expect for drug effects to be in antidepressants, because anything less does not have a lot of value in practice nor worth the known risks. This is up for debate, but I think it is very reasonable. As for how this relates to psychotherapy studies, if they use the HAM-D to study changes in depression severity as the primary outcome measure, then a similar effect size would be useful for determining clinical relevance, especially in comparisons against no treatment/the waiting lists. I mean, if engaging in a treatment cannot get depressed people to score 3 points less on the HAM-D than doing nothing, then even the study can show statistical differences, those differences aren't that meaningful and that treatment has not shown a lot of promise. I am willing to accept smaller effect size differences for studies comparing a newer treatment to an established EST, and for treatments that have shown no/little risks/costs. I strongly support evidence supported treatments and the movement behind them, but I think it is a little off-based to claim great effect of particular ESTs if the evidence that supports them does not show that effect. I think it is better to have evidence of small effect than no evidence to determine effect at all, but having the evidence does not make a treatment a necessarily good one (though without evidence no treatment should be implemented.) If psychotherapy studies are not showing great effect after collecting evidence, that is important to know. To your point on pooling effects across studies. If doing meta-analyses of the studies used to seek FDA approval of drugs do not find a meaningful effect of drugs on average, then let's reanalyze the data to see how many people need to be treated in order for some to get meaningful benefit, and how many people experience side effects and deteriorate in the process, and determine if we think that is worth approving (and think about how we would go about determining that, which would come down to an arbitrary but reasoned cut off based on the context of the studies, the disorder being treated, the outcomes being assessed, the outcome measures use to assess those outcomes, and a benefit/risk ratio of the risks/costs that may be involved in a treatment.) I think antidepressant approval trials are perfect trials for analyzing effect across studies because they are designed so similarly and use the same outcome measure, the HAM-D. Being evenhanded With the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Submitted by James C. Coyne Ph.D. on March 12, 2012 - 8:51am We can jump to a discussion of efficacy as measured by changes in the Hamilton Depression Scale, but the conclusions will be the same. The measure has been established administratively by the FDA, but it has serious limitations as a measure of severity and of therapeutic change, as Darcy Santor and I demonstrated in an item response theory analysis of it and Michael Bagby demonstrated in a more systematic review. And the criterion of the three points difference makes no sense in a randomized controlled trial with mildly depressed primary-care patients like I did with Ulrich Hegerl and colleagues. But when we performed a meta-analysis of published studies of psychotherapy versus pill placebo specifically focusing specifically on the Hamilton depression scale, psychotherapy performed no better than antidepressants. so if we limit our discussion To the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, we again have to concede that antidepressants and psychotherapy performed similarly in comparison to pill placebo. I agree, differences are relatively small, but I don't see the basis for labeling them as Kirsch does for antidepressants, clinically insignificant or trivial. And to ply the label only to antidepressants is a matter of of an ideologue being inconsistent in the face of evidence. We can convert effect sizes to the number needed to treat (NNT) a useful comparative statistic, that I routinely include in meta-analyses and systematic reviews. For a condition like depression, NNT = 7 for both antidepressants and psychotherapy versus pill placebo. One has to be careful about interpreting NNT out of context. Based on available evidence, my colleagues and I estimated that one would have to screen about 700 primary-care patients to get one of them to have clinically significant improvement, so the corresponding number needed to screen is 700 one clinical improvement, hardly a recommendation for screening. For patients with hypertension being treated with a cholesterol-lowering drug in order to prevent cardiovascular event, the number needed to treat to avoid one event is 99.74 over 3.3 years, at least in one major trial. Submitted by Jeff G. on March 12, 2012 - 10:58am I agree that the HAM-D is limited, but I do think it is important to not make claims beyond the evidence gathered. Finding richer ways to assess change in depression severity I think would be great and should be pursued and used, they just haven't been used by the FDA and the data we have on antidepressant outcomes for the approval process comes primarily from the scale I still think we are talking around each other on the meaning of the effect of pill placebo. Pill placebo in the FDA approval studies (and other studies) for antidepressants is robust across scales of initial depression. Treatment with just pill placebo seems to be a pretty strong treatment. So if psychotherapy and antidepressant medications show similar effects to pill placebo, then the total effects of those treatments I think are strong. Kirsch only claims that because pill placebo duplicates at least 80% of effects of antidepressant medications, and the remainder of effect that could be attributed to the chemical compounds of the medication is clinically indiscernible (though statistically significant by conventional standards), the primary mechanism of change of antidepressant medications, which have robust effects, comes from placebo. The argument for being cautious about antidepressant prescribing, especially with milder depressions, is that the risks of adverse events are high, costs are often high. Additionally, the common narrative (though not necessarily the narrative of the academic community) is that the antidepressant medications work by drug effect, and the data just doesn't show that. However patients are told this by their doctors and other mental health professionals and believe it. The dilemma is that people who take medications experience strong benefit, but because that benefit comes from placebo and not the drug, the believed mechanism of change looks false. The fear is that the placebo effect will diminish if they know this. It becomes truth vs. benefit, and whether or not it is ok to maintain misinformation for patients benefit. This is not a clear cut debate, but I tend to side that the more truthful we can be with research, we will eventually pursue better treatments overall. Kirsch cited studies that people do respond very well to inert pills when told that while inert, people who take pills every day to treat depression do receive substantial benefits. Though unorthodox, the claim happens to be true (as seen in the data), avoids many of the risks of antidepressant medications, and is truthful. I think this is a more ethical way to alleviate depression symptoms than having to mislead people. Kirsch does not separate placebo effect from psychotherapy for treating depression in the same way he does for antidepressant medications, the reasoning being that mechanism for both are considered psychological. I think there is a debate here in deciding whether this is fair to do or not, especially in light of the EST movement that tries to establish applied treatment efficacy and effectiveness beyond placebo or comparison treatments. I think we do agree that there are essential differences in researching efficacy or psychotherapies and drugs, but to what extent those differences mean that they can be judged by dissimilar standards is debatable. I believe Kirsch falls on the side that you don't have to give misleading information about psychotherapy outcomes or mechanisms for treatment to be effective and for the current ESTs there are very limited risks, so the placebo effect does not have to be separated from total effect (placebo and active mechanism) when determining treatment effect. Placebo is harder to differentiate in psychotherapies because of methodological limits, but I think this lends to Kirsch's argument that you don't have to disentangle them for psychotherapy effects for treating depression. So while drug effect of antidepressants are determined by separating that effect from the placebo effect, psychotherapy effects can be assessed by the additive effects of placebo and specific effects. I think this can be ethically applied in treatment, as I don't think anyone would say specific effects are all the effects of particular psychotherapies, and hope and expectancy of treatment effect plays a role all treatments. I would expect people to get less benefit from treatment if they do not believe that their condition can change or that the treatment they are in will be at all helpful than if they do. So no matter which EST a clinician utilizes in treatment, a clinician and truthfully and helpfully make a claim about the specific mechanisms believed to be involved in treatment and that because the data is strong for an effect, change/relief can be likely. I think this is an ok place to start from, but more research should be done to determine which treatments are most effective, cheapest, quickest, with fewest risks. The biggest problem I see with this is that the EST movement presumes that specific mechanisms of change are the primary components of change, and Kirsch's argument may make the specific effects of treatment less important if TAU or nonspecific treatments reproduce a substantial amount of treatment effect. I do think we should follow the data, and if that is true, it may be that placebo effects are the strongest or at least strong part of the effect of depression treatments. I don't think it is necessarily problematic if psychotherapy treatments perform similarly to pill placebo for treating depression if the effect is still strong. It may make pill placebo the preferred first treatment for depression because it would be cheaper and perhaps quicker than psychotherapies, but because not all treatments work the same for everyone, evidence for certain psychotherapies that can produce similar effects allow for more treatment options. I have found some of your logic in past posts and this one to come down to ""If we judge antidepressants do not perform better than placebos, and psychotherapies do not perform better (or even as well) as antidepressants by the same criteria, then that would make psychotherapies not particularly effective. Because we believe psychotherapies to be effective, then we have to reject the interpretation of data that shows antidepressant medications do not meaningfully outperform antidepressants."" Forgive my simplicity, but I hope I have laid out what at least I think why Kirsch thinks we may not have to assess them similarly. Even if we do, I think we need to risk the idea that pill placebo may be almost or as effective as many psychotherapies for various severities of depression. If our goal is enhancing health outcomes, easing burdens of and access to treatment, and keeping costs and side effects down, pill placebo may beat many psychotherapies if their primary outcomes are the same but some secondary outcomes for pill placebo are more valuable. As for NNT and NNH (number need to harm), I agree that there are risks of using them as primary ways to assess treatment outcomes because like effect sizes their meaning and what people are willing to accept are contextual on the disorder, treatment, outcome measure, severity risks, etc. I raised the issue in response to your previous comment regarding that people's individual outcomes can vary a great deal from the averaged outcome of a trial group, I certainly don't disagree that people's individual experience often varies from the average effect across a group or even meta-analysis, but that we could use NNTs as an additional way to assess treatments, and that it is just as contextual/arbitrary, but can be well reasoned.

Recipients of the feedback are trained to consciously control aspects of their physiology—using relaxation techniques to slow down heart rate, for example—and this learning is used to help manage symptoms of a variety of medical and psychological conditions. Neurofeedback is a form of biofeedback that involves the use of information from the brain detected using a method such as EEG. Biofeedback may be helpful in treating , , certain pain disorders, tension and migraine headaches, constipation, urinary incontinence, and some other conditions. Scientific evidence has accumulated for the efficacy of biofeedback in addressing a range of symptoms, though a 2014 review highlighted the need for further standardized, controlled research on its effective use in the treatment of disorders. Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback for Anxiety Biofeedback for PTSD A therapist may use electronic sensors that attach to a patient’s skin or fingers or a belt that wraps around the waist to provide feedback on the patient’s physiological state, which is presented in the form of visuals or sounds. In a typical session, which may last up to an hour, the therapist will explain what the sensors are tracking—heart rate, breathing, blood pressure, muscle tension, electrical activity in the brain, or one or more other physiological markers. The therapist will show the patient how the signals relate to different physical or mental states, such as feeling more or less . Ultimately, a patient can be taught to employ certain techniques, such as or breathing exercises, to modulate these states, using the feedback as a guide along the way. Biofeedback may be used in combination with other forms of psychotherapeutic intervention. By harnessing real-time information on one’s bodily state and demonstrating how it connects to conscious behaviors—such as thinking about certain images, breathing in a certain way, or relaxing muscles—biofeedback is designed to help patients take more control over the functioning of their bodies. In the course of therapy, they may learn to better manage symptoms linked to the observed physiological activity. What to Look for in a Biofeedback Therapist Patients should consult a doctor or health care professional for a referral to someone who can offer biofeedback therapy. The person offering biofeedback should be a licensed clinician and may have a certification for the use of biofeedback, in addition to other degrees and qualifications.

Courage to Think the Unthinkable: The Pandemic Might Get Worse How to Find Empathy for People You Don’t Understand  >  Hypnotherapy is guided , or a trance-like state of focus and achieved with the help of a clinical hypnotherapist. This trance-like state is similar to being completely absorbed in a book, movie, music, or even one's own thoughts or meditations. In this state, clients can turn their attention completely inward to find and utilize the natural resources deep within themselves that can help them make changes or regain control in certain areas of their life. Since hypnotherapy is an adjunct form of therapy, used along with other forms of psychological or medical treatment, there are many applications. Hypnotherapy can be used to treat , phobias, including tobacco, dysfunction, undesirable spontaneous behaviors, and bad habits. It can be used to help improve sleep, learning disorders, communication, and relationship issues. Hypnotherapy can aid in pain and help resolve medical conditions such as digestive disorders, skin issues, and gastrointestinal side effects of and chemotherapy. It can also be used by dentists to help patients control their fears or to treat teeth grinding and other oral conditions. Although there are different techniques, clinical hypnotherapy is generally performed in a calm, therapeutic environment. The therapist will guide you into a relaxed, focused state and ask you to think about experiences and situations in positive ways that can help you change the way you think and behave. Unlike some dramatic portrayals of in movies, books, or on stage, you will not be , asleep, or in any way out of control of yourself. You will hear the therapist’s suggestions, but it is up to you to decide whether or not to act on them. Hypnosis is not a psychotherapeutic treatment or a form of , but rather a tool or procedure that helps facilitate various types of therapies and medical or psychological treatments. Only trained health care providers certified in clinical hypnosis can decide, with their patient, if hypnosis should be used along with other treatments. As with psychotherapy, the length of hypnosis treatment varies, depending on the complexity of the problem. What to Look for in a Hypnotherapist Look for a hypnotherapist who is a member of the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis (ASCH) or the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis. To be a member of either of these organizations, a hypnotherapist must have a doctorate level degree in medicine, dentistry, or psychology, or a master’s degree in nursing, social work, psychology, or marital/family therapy plus a specific number of hours of approved training in hypnotherapy. In some cases, accredited, doctoral-level practitioners of alternative health care, such traditional Chinese medicine, may also be approved for membership. Of course, in addition to looking at qualifications, you should also find a hypnotherapist with whom you feel confident and comfortable in a therapeutic relationship.     Society for Clinical & Experimental Hypnosis  American Psychological Association Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy Get the help you need from a therapist near you–a FREE service from Psychology Today.

A new theory aims to make sense of it all. When Is the Best Time to Meditate for Better Sleep? The Post Traumatic Stress Response Helps People Avoid Danger The Intriguing Psychological Puzzle of Tesla Ownership Shifting a pronoun can make all the difference. Source: ""Worry Tornado,"" worry drawing from the collection of C. Malchiodi, PhD @2014 Can talking or writing about art expressions in the third person rather than first person pronouns be a better strategy to reduce stress? Some recent studies about may be providing important information for how therapists should direct individuals to speak or write about their art expressions. In brief, a growing number of studies have found that non-first-person self-talk improves through self-distancing and reducing self-focus. To be clear, first person talk involves using pronouns such as “I,” “me,” or “my.” In contrast, non-first-person pronouns are “you,” “it,” or a name (including your own name). A good example of non-first-person positive self-talk would be “Keep going, Cathy, you are doing great. You have this” (something I say to myself before facing an audience of 500 or 1000 people to prevent ). While athletes and others have applied non-first-person self-talk to enhance performance and support , variations of this type of talk may be effective in other situations, particularly those that involve painful memories or distressing events. Two recent studies demonstrate how this simple strategy may help us to self-regulate and reduce stress. One study conducted at Michigan State University (MSU) indicates that referring to oneself in the third person may lead people to perceive themselves in ways more similar to how they think about or perceive others. In other words, this simple shift can help individuals get a bit of psychological distance from experiences and thus can be helpful in emotional regulation. Moser, key researcher in the MSU study, demonstrated this finding using brain scan technology to measure and compare differences between first person and non-first-person self-talk. Another experiment at the Emotion and Self-Control Lab at the University of Michigan (U-M) evaluated how brain activity (functional magnetic resonance imaging or FMRI) differed in participants who reflected on distressing experiences using first and third person language. When using third person language, participants showed less activity in the brain region related to distressing emotional memories when using third-person self-talk, indicating better emotional regulation. In both the MSU and U-M studies, researchers concluded that third-person talk is an accessible form of emotional regulation. These outcomes also complement previous research that demonstrated third person self-talk improves heart rate variability which results in a healthy tone, a physical response relevant to trauma intervention, positive and emotional regulation. How does this translate to practice? Expressive arts and imaginative play easily support opportunities to shift perspectives as needed through how we assist individuals in talking about these experiences. , a form of parallel communication developed by Milton Erickson, is one way to encourage a shift without direct confrontation. In the field of art therapy, the term has been used to describe a shift in perspective from a first-person narrative to a third-person one. It is an accepted way of encouraging a child or adult to communicate uncomfortable memories in a safe manner; for example, I may ask a child to show me a “worry” through a drawing or clay sculpture, then ask, “if that worry could talk, what would that worry say?” I am not requesting first person disclosure; I am instead encouraging the child to develop a safe distance from the experience being conveyed. Similarly, I may ask an adult to write down five words that come to mind after completing a drawing or movement experience; the five words can be used to create a story or poem to verbalize an experience or perception from a third person stance. So art therapy colleagues and other professionals who introduce art expression into a session, consider how you ask individuals to speak about their creations and why you may make the choice to use one form of talk or writing (first person v. non-first-person) over another. Clearly, using a non-first-person approach is not always the most effective strategy to meet therapeutic . Direct (first person) ownership of specific experiences, perceptions and feelings is a key part of discovery and growth within the context of any therapeutic alliance. But when the goal involves supporting and reducing emotional distress due to memories, loss or other challenges, taking a non-first-person stance is proving to be a good strategy to decrease distress, at least in the short-term. I believe we can all look forward to future studies on this approach, perhaps introducing arts expression into the mix, to determine just what type of “talk” is best to use to support reparation and recovery as well as to enhance self-regulation for health and well-being.

With an understanding of normal human development, an integrative therapist modifies standard treatments to fill in development gaps that affect each client in different ways. By combining elements drawn from different schools of psychological theory and research, integrative therapy becomes a more flexible and inclusive approach to treatment than more traditional, singular forms of psychotherapy. Integrative techniques can be incorporated into almost any type of therapeutic work with children, adolescents, and adults, in individual practice or group settings. An integrative approach can be used to treat any number of psychological problems and disorders, including , , and . The therapist matches evidence-based treatments to each client and each disorder. Integrative therapy is more inclusive of the client than traditional forms of therapy, where the client plays a less active role in treatment. Integrative psychotherapists consider the individual characteristics, preferences, needs, physical abilities, beliefs, and level of their clients and use their professional judgment to decide the best approach to therapy for each client. Different approaches may be used consecutively throughout different stages of the therapeutic process or they may be used as a single combined form of therapy throughout. There are more than 400 different types of psychotherapy, differentiated by their approach, the clients they serve, and how long and how often the therapist typically meets with clients. Research shows that even though each of these approaches vary somewhat, they can all result in similar outcomes. And because a single approach to psychotherapy does not always provide the best benefit to the client, therapists—who are trained in one particular therapeutic model, such as , family, or gestalt therapy—often use tools borrowed from other therapies to come up with a unique and effective form of treatment that is suitable and effective for individual clients. Some psychotherapists simply refer to themselves as integrative therapists, rather than identify with one therapeutic model. Although similar in style, integrative therapy differs from eclectic therapy in that it uses techniques backed by scientific research and proven to treat specific disorders, whereas eclectic therapy focuses more on the effectiveness of a technique and is less concerned with whether or not scientific evidence has proven its effectiveness for specific problems. What to Look for in an Integrative Therapist There are training programs for integrative therapists, but since integrative therapy is more of a movement within the general practice of psychotherapy than a form of psychotherapy in and of itself, any licensed, professional psychotherapist can take an integrative approach. A therapist’s specific method of integrating approaches will depend on their individual educational background, skills, and experience. Zarbo C, Tasca GA, Cattafi F, Compare A.

Courage to Think the Unthinkable: The Pandemic Might Get Worse How to Find Empathy for People You Don’t Understand  >  PET is a form of for post- disorder (). Originally developed by Edna Foa, Ph.D., PET is endorsed by both the American Association and the Department of Veterans Affairs and Defense. After a traumatic event, some people experience unwanted thoughts, disturbing nightmares, feelings of hopelessness, , and hypervigilance. If you have these symptoms, you understandably want to avoid thoughts, feelings, and things that remind you of the trauma. The goal of PET is to gradually help you reengage with life, especially with things you have been avoiding. By doing so, you will strengthen your ability to distinguish safety from danger and decrease your PTSD symptoms. PET is appropriate for anyone who has experienced or witnessed a event. Many people who experience a traumatic event do not develop , and PET is not necessary for those without a PTSD diagnosis. Additionally, given that the completion of PET requires a person to speak about the trauma and to encounter trauma-related thoughts, feelings, and objects, you may experience moderate distress. This distress is often brief, and people typically feel significantly better because of treatment. Narrative Consciousness, Memory, and PTSD in Westworld PET is conducted by a single clinician through one-on-one . Sessions typically last 90 minutes and occur once a week for approximately three months, though treatment can be shorter at two months or longer at 15 weeks. PET treatment involves Imaginal Exposure and In Vivo Exposure. During Imaginal Exposure sessions, you will discuss some of the events of your trauma. A therapist might ask you to write down your traumatic experience, read the experience aloud—in and out of session. Your therapist will guide you through the retelling of your trauma. You will explore your thoughts and feelings, which is called processing. This will help you decrease the unwanted traumatic reminders, as well as feel less distress when recalling the trauma. In Vivo Exposure, meaning “in life,” sessions involve your real-life interaction with safe things that you have been avoiding. In these sessions, your therapist will first ask you to make a list of the things you have been avoiding (sounds and places, for example). You will create an “exposure hierarchy” by ranking these avoided things based on how much distress they cause you when you encounter them. PET is based on associative learning theory, when two things appear together the brain learns to connect or associate them. Ivan Pavlov created the most famous associative learning experiment by repeatedly ringing a bell before presenting his dogs with food. The dogs began to salivate at the sound of the bell, as they learned to associate the bell with food. To break this association, Pavlov then repeatedly rang the bell without giving the dogs any food; the dogs eventually stopped salivating when they heard the bell. This same process is behind PTSD. When a trauma occurs, there are many things in —smells, sights, sounds—that the brain associates with the trauma. When we encounter those things outside of the trauma, the brain expects danger, causing and . What to Look for in a PET Therapist Health providers can receive training and certification for PET. Some institutions, such as university clinics, provide intensive workshops or seminars in PET, with therapists completing one-on-one consultation therapy cases. McLean, C. P., & Foa, E. B. (2011).

Courage to Think the Unthinkable: The Pandemic Might Get Worse  >  Human givens is a new approach to that encompasses the latest understandings from neurobiology and psychology. Popularized by the 2004 book by Joe Griffin, Ivan Tyrrell, and Denise Winn, human givens offers a holistic, scientific framework for understanding how individuals and society work. Just as humans have physical needs for water, food, and shelter, they are born with emotional needs that they must meet. According to human givens, there are nine main emotional needs ranging from the need for security, autonomy, status, and privacy, to feeling connected to others through , exchange, and a sense of belonging. People also have an innate set of resources, an instinctive knowledge that drives them to meet these needs. Together, these needs and resources make up the human givens approach. Human givens is unlike other types of , psychotherapists who use this approach offer practical help that deals with mental and emotional distress in the here and now. They are not interested in spending a great deal of time exploring the past and its influences on patients’ issues or going on long, complex voyages of self-discovery into the patients’ psyche. In a short number of sessions, they aim to give patients the coping skills to address the immediate issue. Thriving After Depression How to Have Better Arguments When people’s resources are used properly, and is healthy, their emotional needs are more or less satisfied. They are emotionally well, their lives have meaning, and they flourish.

Why Your Abusive Narcissistic Mate Claims to Be the Victim How to Build Happier Workplaces After the COVID Era What Is Your ""Style"" For Dealing With Conflict At Work?  >  Culturally sensitive emphasizes the therapist's understanding of a client’s background, , and belief system. Therapists can incorporate cultural sensitivity into their work to accommodate and respect differences in opinions, values, and attitudes of various cultures and different types of people. Cultural sensitivity also allows a therapist to gain and maintain cultural competence, which is the ability to first recognize and understand one’s own culture and how it influences one's relationship with a client, then understand and respond to the culture that is different from one’s own. The need for this understanding may be based on characteristics such as age, beliefs, ethnicity, race, , religion, , or socioeconomic status. Cultural sensitivity practices can be applied to any type of ; these practices may help the client feel more comfortable, making the treatment more effective. Research has helped document the positive effects of cultural sensitivity practices and has also outlined examples of how therapists can be more culturally competent in their interactions with clients of different backgrounds. For instance, one study noted that therapy with Latino clients was less effective when the therapist was misunderstood as distant. Understanding and applying the cultural expectation of disclosing, for example, some personal information may help clients connect with their therapist. Other studies show that certain behaviors, such as familiar use of language and a general display of personable traits, can play an important role in some cultures; avoiding these approaches can alienate clients. Race-Related Trauma Disrupts Psychological Well-Being Why Transgender People Experience More Mental Health Issues A culturally sensitive therapist follows guidelines for working with diverse groups of people and understands that racial, cultural, religious, , and identities interact with one’s beliefs and behavior. The expectation and ultimate for both the therapist and the client are notable progress and improvement despite cross-cultural boundaries and differences. Because they have acquired the necessary knowledge and skills, therapists who successfully integrate cultural sensitivity practices into their treatment recognize and respect differences and can communicate and interact successfully with clients from diverse backgrounds. Advocates for cultural sensitivity believe that it is more effective to vary the therapeutic approach from person to person, depending on a client’s culture group, than to simply use the same standard treatment approach for everyone. Although therapists who practice cultural sensitivity may deviate from standard therapeutic methods, they must also adhere to their profession’s ethical guidelines, for example, when it comes to disclosure of personal information. While some therapists argue that highlighting differences between individuals may offend some clients, and therefore damage the therapeutic relationship, it is generally believed that openly showing respect for someone’s culture and beliefs can result in more effective treatment and a more positive outcome for both client and therapist. What to Look For in a Culturally Sensitive Practitioner Look for a licensed therapist or counselor who communicates an awareness of your culture, beliefs, and practices, and whose goals and expectations for treatment are in line with yours. At times, the practitioner must be able to determine whether it is appropriate to treat a particular issue any differently than if you were from the same ethnic or cultural group. Make sure you feel comfortable discussing personal issues with the practitioner, and expect anyone who is not familiar with your ethnic or cultural group to refer you to a more culturally sensitive professional.

How Gabby Giffords Used Music to Regain Her Speech  >  Person-centered uses a non-authoritative approach that allows clients to take more of a lead in discussions so that, in the process, they will discover their own solutions. The therapist acts as a compassionate facilitator, listening without judgment and acknowledging the client’s experience without moving the conversation in another direction. The therapist is there to encourage and support the client and to guide the therapeutic process without interrupting or interfering with the client’s process of self-discovery. Anyone who would be better off gaining more , a stronger sense of , and the ability to build healthy interpersonal relationships and to trust his or her own decisions could benefit from person-centered . This approach, alone or in combination with other types of therapy, can also be helpful for those who suffer from , , , , abuse, or other mental health conditions. Person-centered therapists work with both individuals and groups. Since the client must do a lot of the work in person-centered therapy, those who are more motivated are likely to be more successful. Person-centered therapy is talk therapy wherein the client does most of the talking. Your therapist will not judge or try to interpret what you say, but may restate your words in an attempt to fully understand your thoughts and feelings. When you hear your own words repeated back to you, you may then wish to self-edit and clarify your meaning. This may happen several times until you decide that you have expressed exactly what you are thinking and how you feel. There may be moments of silence to allow your thoughts to sink in. This client-focused process facilitates your self-discovery, self-acceptance, and a provides a means toward healing and positive growth. Person-centered therapy, also known as Rogerian therapy, originated in the work of the American psychologist, Carl Rogers, who believed that everyone is different and, therefore, everyone’s view of his or her own world, and ability to manage it, should be trusted. Rogers believed that all of us have the power to find the best solutions for ourselves and make appropriate changes in our lives. Person-centered therapy was a movement away from the therapist’s traditional role—as an expert and —toward a process that allows clients to use their own understanding of their experiences as a platform for healing. The success of person-centered therapy relies on three conditions: Unconditional positive regard, which means therapists must be and non-judgmental to convey their feelings of understanding, trust, and confidence that encourage their clients to make their own decisions and choices Empathetic understanding, which means therapists completely understand and accept their clients’ thoughts and feelings Congruence, which means therapists carry no air of authority or professional superiority but, instead, present a true and accessible self that clients can see is honest and transparent. What to Look for in a Person-Centered Therapist Licensed mental health professionals from a variety of disciplines who have training and experience in the Rogerian approach can use person-centered interventions in therapy. In addition to finding someone with the educational background and relevant experience, look for a therapist or counselor who is especially empathetic and with whom you feel comfortable discussing personal issues.

A new theory aims to make sense of it all. 7 Gaslighting Phrases Used to Confuse and Control Do You Often Feel Disappointed in Your Relationship?  >  Mentalization-Based (MBT) is an evidence-based treatment for people with borderline and other mental health issues that draws from several different psychotherapeutic approaches. Mentalizing, or the ability to focus on and differentiate between your own emotional state of mind and that of others, and understand how one’s mental state influences behavior, is a normal cognitive function that is limited in those with borderline disorder. Enhancement of mentalization and improved are at the core of MBT treatment. MBT can be an effective treatment for increasing the capacity to mentalize in people with borderline , antisocial , , eating disorders, and , even when other treatments have been unsuccessful. Although there may also be a genetic basis, an inability to mentalize often stems from an insecure to a parent, or abandonment issues early in life. If you lack an understanding of your own and other people's feelings, you may have difficulty both regulating your own problematic emotions and behavior, and correctly identifying the thoughts and feelings of others. You may not understand the intent behind other people’s behavior and respond impulsively and inappropriately in ways that can disrupt your relationships. Family may incorporate aspects of MBT to help heal relationships between parents and their children. Identity in Borderline Personality Disorder: A New Approach MBT borrows common elements and techniques from psychodynamic, , systemic, and social-ecological therapies. MBT practitioners work to establish a secure therapeutic attachment with patients, and create a safe environment in which patients can begin to deeply explore their own feelings and those of others, ultimately developing their capacity for mentalization. One intervention commonly used in MBT treatment is , or directing a patient’s emotions toward the therapist to facilitate analysis of those emotions. MBT helps patients think before they react to their own feelings or to the perceived feelings of others. With an improved ability to mentalize, patients not only process their own thoughts, feelings, and related behaviors differently, but also better understand that another person’s thoughts, feelings, and behavior may be different than the way they are interpreted by the patient. The goal of MBT is for patients to not only mentalize themselves but also mentalize others and think about what may be driving other people’s thoughts and behaviors so as to not misinterpret the meaning and respond inappropriately. What to Look for in a Mentalization-Based Therapist Look for a licensed, experienced mental health professional with an understanding of borderline personality disorder, and some training and experience in mentalization-based interventions. In addition to finding someone with the appropriate educational background and relevant experience, look for a therapist with whom you feel comfortable working on personal, family, and relationship issues.

But while the choice to pursue therapy will be, in a large number of cases, solely up to the individual, it is possible for concerned others to offer emotional support as well as concrete assistance. This can mean connecting them with educational resources about therapy, helping them identify potential clinicians in their area, setting up appointments, or providing transportation to their first session. For more on facilitating the process for a loved one, visit What type of therapy is right for me? Many types of therapy have been shown to be effective at treating common mental health challenges, and determining which approach is “best” for a particular person often comes down to their particular concerns, the alliance they’re able to form with their therapist, and their personal preferences. Clients who are coming to therapy with specific mental health concerns—such as disorder or post- —may benefit most from a clinician who specializes in the area or who employs a type of therapy specifically designed to treat it, while those seeking help with relationship or family problems may benefit from and family therapy. To learn more about different types of therapy, visit Will I be able to afford therapy? The cost of therapy, and whether it can fit into a client’s budget, will likely depend on a few factors, including the individual’s insurance coverage, their location, and their income. While some therapists charge a set fee per session, others offer a sliding scale based on clients’ income. In many locations, low- or no-cost therapy is available for low-income clients, often through universities or other therapist training programs. Prospective clients should verify their insurance coverage, along with the therapist’s fee structure, before setting up an appointment. To learn more about the finances of therapy, visit What will the first session of therapy be like? The first session of therapy can be -provoking, and it’s normal to feel nervous or unsure of what to expect. Luckily, most patients will find that the first session of therapy follows a predictable format. Most therapists spend the first session asking general questions to get a sense of the client’s background, their past experience with therapy, and what issues they’re hoping to address. They will also likely discuss their own modality or style and offer an outline of what the client can expect. Logistical details, such as verifying insurance coverage and setting up a payment schedule, may happen in the first session as well. To learn more about what to expect when starting therapy, visit Will I receive medication if I go to therapy? is often used in conjunction with psychotherapy—particularly for cases of severe , anxiety, or —but it’s not a given for every client. If a therapist thinks a particular client could benefit from medication, he or she will discuss it with the client before referring him or her to a prescribing professional such as a psychiatrist or nurse practitioner. While the client will likely need to attend periodic meetings with the prescribing professional to discuss any side effects and dosage adjustments, they will also continue to see the therapist to build coping skills and strategies to further support their mental health. What are the red flags of an unqualified or unethical therapist? Even the best therapists aren’t perfect, and it’s possible for effective, ethical therapists to make mistakes or inadvertently upset a client. But there are some therapists, unfortunately, who are not suited to the profession. Common warning signs of an ineffective therapist include talking too much—to the point where the client feels unable to talk about their own concerns—or sharing inappropriate details about their own personal life. Therapists who are judgmental or condescending to the client are also likely not good fits, as are therapists who frequently appear or distracted. Unethical therapists are much rarer than unqualified or ineffective ones, but they certainly exist. An unethical clinician may make or romantic overtures toward a client, threaten or blackmail them, or breach confidentiality agreements without just cause. Clients should report such therapists to their licensing board and end therapy as soon as possible. Therapy typically ends when the client feels they have achieved their or when they feel they are no longer making progress; in some cases, logistical issues, such as changing insurance coverage, necessitate the end of therapy. Alternatively, it is possible for a therapist to determine that they are not the best practitioner to aid a particular client. When this occurs, the therapist will typically refer the client to another provider, where they can continue work if they so choose.

A new theory aims to make sense of it all. 7 Gaslighting Phrases Used to Confuse and Control Do You Often Feel Disappointed in Your Relationship?  >  Strength-based therapy is a type of positive and counseling that focuses more on your internal strengths and resourcefulness, and less on weaknesses, failures, and shortcomings. This focus sets up a positive mindset that helps you build on you best qualities, find your strengths, improve and change worldview to one that is more positive. A positive attitude, in turn, can help your expectations of yourself and others become more reasonable. Anyone with poor , or who has emotional issues resulting from an abusive relationship with a parent or partner, can benefit from strength-based . This includes people with serious mental health issues such as , , and schizophrenia, who can use strength-based therapy to build and reduce the of living with such a condition. Strength-based therapy can be used as an intervention for individuals of all ages, couples and families. Strength-based therapy is talk therapy that guides you toward a retelling of your personal history of , stressors, and pain with more emphasis on yourself as a survivor than as a victim, and more emphasis on your strengths and survival skills than on your weakness. The goal is for you to recognize that you already have the skills and strength to survive and can use those same strengths to deal with tough situations in other areas of your life. American psychotherapist Donald Clifton became known as the “father of strength-based therapy” because of his many contributions to the field in the late 1900s and early years of 2000, but the practice evolved from the work of people in various disciplines, including social work, counseling psychology, positive psychology, solution-focused therapy, and narrative therapy. The theory behind strength-based therapy is that through adversary, people discover their inner strengths. How people deal with life’s challenges depends on whether they feel they are operating from a position of strength or a position of deficit. Those with a strength mindset focus on their positive qualities, while those with a deficit mindset focus on weaknesses and flaws, both in themselves and others. Each mindset influences future thinking and behavior in a different way. Strength-based therapy emphasizes the patterns and circumstances in a person’s life, rather than the negatives. It helps determine what works for each people by seeing people for who they are as individuals, not who they are by nature of their diagnosis. What to Look for in a Strength-Based Therapist Strength-based therapy techniques can be incorporated into different types of counseling and therapy. Look for a licensed, experienced counselor, social worker, psychotherapist, or other mental health professional with training in strength-based therapy. In addition to finding someone with the appropriate educational background, experience and positive approach, seek a therapist with whom you feel comfortable discussing personal issues.

Why? What's so great about journaling? The Psychology Today blogs are 10 years old this year, and so is In Therapy. Today I'm sharing a few lessons I've learned along the way. Are you breaking a therapy rule if you do? Is it in your best interest? There are potential harms and benefits, depending on the details. Is our evidence-based therapy bias hurting or helping? An interview with Dr. Enrico Gnaulati. Therapy can be incredibly helpful. Unfortunately, we're still in a time where recommending it can seem like an insult. Here's one gentle approach. All the good stuff has already been covered (or so it seems). Where should you go from here? What should you talk about in therapy? Awkward. In an ideal world, all therapy would provide a good ending, where loose ends are tied up, take-away points are clarified, and we share a clean goodbye. Sounds nice, doesn’t it? Gambling maintains the fantasy of success while denying some harsh, cruel realities. You spend money, time, and emotional energy going to therapy—so why not tell the truth? How do you cope with financial stress? Ever tried talking about it? A Letter to Therapists 2: Finance Language Lessons “If you knew my income, my debt, my bad decisions, my cover-ups, you definitely wouldn’t like me.” A Letter to Therapists: Beware of Financial Stress Despite all of our research and experience, the field of psychology continues to ignore an issue hidden in plain sight. Every therapist has a story or twelve about clients who seem to be connecting and doing well in therapy and then they suddenly disappear. Poof. How do physical disabilities impact psychological treatment? How do they impact the therapist? Dr. Deborah Buckwalter shares her thoughts in this Moments of Meaning video. Dr. Martin Hsia describes his compassionate CBT intervention for resolving guilt in this Moments of Meaning video. What really happens behind the closed doors of a therapy session? Six therapists share stories. Should we keep screens away from kids? Or give them full access and let them work it out? Is there a middle ground? Dr. Jennifer Kunst shares the warmer, friendlier side of Kleinian psychology in this interview and book review. You are the common denominator in all your relationships; improving yourself is bound to enhance the lives of everyone you meet as well. You say goodbye and step out into the world. But by the time your key hits the ignition, it's gone. The notepad is as much a part of the lore of therapy as the clock, the couch, and the bottomless box of Kleenex. But is it really necessary? If your goal is beyond symptom reduction and more along the lines of wellness, prevention, and improved quality of life, therapy can be a wonderful experience. Terminating Therapy, Part V: Therapist Termination I can’t act as an apologist for all therapists. It's clear that not all therapists were taught how to provide a good termination, and even if they were, not all practice it. Psychological and medical research is filled with data supporting the idea that holding a grudge has negative long-term consequences. It’s better to endure five minutes of stress than months or years of resentment. Therapy helps, but can there be too much of a good thing? Is long-term therapy a cause for concern? If you're about to embark on a profession where your own psyche is a primary tool, you should spend some time in the other chair. But don't expect it to be easy. A recent article pointed out eight warning signs that warrant a trip to the therapist. But isn't therapy about more than just treating disorders? Laugh away in your therapy sessions, but ask yourself if you’re laughing to avoid your issues or laughing your way through them. When is the best time of day for therapy? Is your therapy dollar better spent morning, noon, or night? Or is it about something other than the clock? On Christmas Eve Eve, otherwise known as Pruning Day, we pause to reflect upon all the crap we've accumulated through the year, and get rid of it. , is a clinical psychologist, writer, musician and professor at Fuller Graduate School of Psychology in Pasadena, California.

A new theory aims to make sense of it all. An Attitude of Gratitude: Why Saying ""I Am Grateful"" Matters AI Gains Social Intelligence; Infers Goals and Failed Plans How Visualizing ""Hoped-for Future Selves"" May Affect Destiny 10 Tips for Turning Procrastination into Precrastination Why Some People Don’t Seek Mental Health Services Why therapy is an art that should rest on a solid scientific foundation. During the last 60 years, the practice of psychological therapy has moved increasingly away from unscientific methods towards evidence-based and empirically supported ones. Indeed, owing to the pioneering contributions of visionary psychologists and psychiatrists like Arnold Lazarus (who coined the term “behavior therapy” to replace traditional “”); Albert Ellis (who pioneered Behavior Therapy as an alternative to and Rogerian ); and (who laid the groundwork for cognitive therapy), the science of psychology was finally merged with the practice of therapy. Nevertheless, although clinicians now have an impressive array of scientifically validated techniques to draw from, psychological therapy remains as much an art as it is, ideally, a science. (I state “ideally” because despite the fact that there are proven treatments for a variety of conditions, many therapists still cling to antiquated methods like psychoanalysis and others that have no scientific backing like past-life  or “energy” treatments.) The science of therapy has its roots in the soil of the work that Arnold Lazarus and Joseph Wolpe did in Johannesburg, South Africa during the late 1950s. Wolpe and A. Lazarus took the lessons from conditioning research (e.., Pavlov) and applied them to the practice of therapy. Thus, “systematic ” (a scientifically based treatment for ) was introduced into the clinical repertoire and the of psychological research and clinical practice began. Some 60 years later, we now have incontrovertible treatments of choice for several common problems that many people seek help for. For example, exposure therapy for most anxieties like , panic and phobias; cognitive therapy and behavioral activation therapy for most depressive conditions; -I for ; for many -related problems; and medical treatments for most psychoses and illnesses. Hence, in the current era, the science of psychological therapy clearly points to treatments of choice. Failing to use these approaches when there is unassailable and unequivocal data to support them as first-line interventions is, in my opinion, remiss if not outright negligent. In essence, the science of therapy is the preferential use of empirically supported and evidence-based methods. That is, treatments of choice that have received experimental validation. While using scientifically verified interventions is important, it is just a part of doing good therapy because there are vital aspects of the process that do not easily lend themselves to scientific inquiry—namely, the art of therapy that has yet to be dismantled by research. Therefore, even when clinicians use evidence-based treatments, a great deal of artistry is usually required to produce optimum results. In essence, the art of psychological therapy includes of the following factors: As Professor Arnold Lazarus stated, “The therapeutic relationship is the soil that enables the techniques to take root.” No matter how knowledgeable, experienced, or skilled a therapist is, without a solid relationship underpinning the therapy process, results are likely to be sub-optimal. Because just as there are scientifically validated treatments of choice, there are also relationships of choice that have yet to be established by research findings. Hence, knowing how to cultivate and strengthen the therapeutic alliance with each unique client involves a great deal of artistry since it’s a skill that cannot be easily taught or, as of yet, determined scientifically. In fact, referring a client to another therapist with whom they may be more compatible, and have a better fit, can be seen as an important . 2.  Knowing when to use a proven method or technique. Even when a good relationship has been established, and a therapist is knowledgeable about treatments of choice, knowing when to introduce and use a specific treatment is highly individualistic and requires the therapist to possess another element of therapeutic artistry. If the method is implemented too soon, it might overwhelm the client. Too late, and precious time will have been lost and the client’s distress needlessly prolonged. 3.  Knowing how to best use a proven method or technique. It is also important for a therapist to know how to best use a scientifically proven method. For instance, it is well established that ERP (exposure and response/ritual prevention) is by far the best treatment for most cases of OCD. But how it is implemented needs to be individualistically determined. With some people, a “decapitation strike” right at the top of their exposure hierarchy (i.e., the list of their anxiety triggers from least challenging to most challenging) can be successfully done. With others, a far more gradual ascent up their hierarchy is better. And for some, before doing even the least anxiety provoking ERP challenge, laying the groundwork with relaxation training and imaginal exposure is best. This is related to the concept of “readiness for change.” Some people enter therapy ready to take on significant therapeutic assignments right out of the gate. Others need a long runway before they can reach takeoff speed⁠—and even then, some can undertake only mildly challenging tasks (or discussions). Hence, knowing just where a given person is on the readiness for change spectrum is another element of therapy that is more of an art than a science. Knowing when and where to set healthy boundaries in a therapeutic relationship is also an aspect of therapy that the laboratory has yet to elucidate. This involves matters of therapist self disclosure (sharing some personal information with a client), between-session contact (with whom is it helpful to text or talk with between appointments?), accepting or giving gifts and cards, giving some extra time to someone during a session, and accepting invitations to special events (e.g., the local college graduation of a person who had been in treatment with a therapist for academic problems since 6th grade). Similarly, knowing when to include other important people in the therapy is an important consideration. In other words, when to suggest that a spouse or other family member come into the process of an initially individual therapy, or when to have individual sessions within the context of a relationship or .  In summary, the science of therapy rests on the foundation of evidence-based and empirically supported methods and techniques. These are the well established treatments of choice that are best used as first-line interventions. The art of psychological therapy is far more nuanced and individualistic. It involves factors like establishing a strong therapeutic relationship, referring to another provider if there is not a good fit, knowing when to use a method, how to best use it, and within what boundaries it should be used.

Submitted by Deborah Hellerstein on September 3, 2019 - 1:39pm It is very disturbing to hear the PR term “evidence based therapy “ repeated over and over since there is clear evidence that the research for this evidence is far from reliable and only measures symptom relief . These evidence based short term treatments ignore the under lying issues that will likely pop up again . It’s like telling the cancer patient that one puts on morphine that they’re fine because their symptoms of pain have temporarily subsided. Psychoanalysis and psychodynamic treatment have helped many people . Yes like all treatment modalities it isn’t for everyone . For those it is for it can be transformative Submitted by Nick G on September 3, 2019 - 4:51pm And to adapt the Lazarus quote that the author used in this blog post, 'Subpar research is the soil that allows fraudulent claims of superior treatment to take root.' Submitted by daryl mahon on September 4, 2019 - 2:53am So much wrong with this article. For start, theory/techniques contributes the lest amount of variables to client outcome. The often called EST when compared to other bona fide therapies in RCT with all other things being equal in methodology have equivalent outcomes. The internal validity in these studies is so tightly controlled as to be useless in routine practice. When the supposedly specific ingredients of these EST are removed in dismantling studies the component treatment has outcomes equal to that of full treatment. the variance within group is often much larger than between groups, indicating therapist effect produce larger outcome variables than theory. Finally, but far from all that can be said, the research alligence in these studies is hardly ever acknowledged or procedures put in place to counter it, alligence can add up to 12% of variance in outcome. overall, I'd suggest you go look at what the evidence actually states Well there is this at least this backing (plus more)....

Submitted by Michael Kurtz on September 4, 2019 - 11:37am Thank you Vincenzo for taking the time to point out the hideous inaccuracies of this article. Like you said, those 78 references are only SOME of the scientific backing for psychoanalytic therapy. He’s making a point from the mid 90’s. He may wish to start with Westen’s hallmark 1998 article re: the scientific standing of psychoanalysis and move forward from there into this millennium. Submitted by Christopher B. Wiegand on September 7, 2019 - 1:15am Thank you for this reply - the short-sightedness of the so-called ""evidence-based"" [read ""cheapest option available""] camp needs to be pointed out and corrected. Submitted by Marion Rollings, PhD on September 4, 2019 - 9:26am I was planning to refute several of the erroneous statements made by the author but I see that my esteemed colleagues have already done that. The evidence is clear that psychoanalytic and depth psychotherapeutic approaches to treatment are effective in treating a wide range of disorders. In private practice I integrate a number of dynamic treatments that are not only helpful, but very engaging and fun for my patients. Dream analysis, free association, active imagination, and more. Sticking to a symptom based, cognitive behavioral approach is just putting on a bandaid where one needs surgery. Concerns about this article -- from Psychotherapy Action Network Submitted by Linda Michaels on September 4, 2019 - 6:02pm Dr. Lazarus’ opinion piece seems to suggest a lack of awareness or understanding of the evidence we have about psychological treatments. To put psychoanalysis in the same phrase as past-life regression shows a troubling ignorance of science. To further state that “failing to use [evidence-based] approaches …is… remiss if not outright negligent,” also is a concerning statement, that fails to use the science and the evidence that we have at hand. There is substantial evidence showing the efficacy of psychoanalytic treatments. There is also data showing how faulty the evidence base is that underlies “evidence-based” or “empirically supported” treatments. These messages may not be welcomed by those such as Dr. Lazarus or his father, Arnold, but the data are clear and the times are shifting. One of the most recent powerful meta-analyses, conducted by Steinert et al, analyzed 23 randomized control trials (RCTs) for a variety of psychological diagnoses. The clear result was that psychodynamic treatment was as efficacious as short-term treatments, namely CBT and medications. Researcher allegiance is a common factor that skews results, and most CBT studies have been found to have a high risk of allegiance bias. Steinert controlled for this by putting together a research team that included researchers with a variety of theoretical orientations. In a re-analysis of the landmark NIMH Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program data set, a mere 24% of depressed pts receiving short-term, evidence-based treatments demonstrated sustained recovery at the 18-month follow-up period. That means that most of the patients – 76% -- did not get well, (Shedler, 2015). Further, in a massive study of 7,000 people, most of them needed medium to long-term treatment to show improvement. Key findings: long-term treatment did considerably better than short-term treatment; no specific modality of psychotherapy did better than any other for any disorder; patients whose length of therapy or choice of therapist was limited by insurance or managed care did worse. Much as we might wish to believe in quick fixes and magic wands, there are no shortcuts to complex problems. Interestingly, as Dr. Lazarus writes about the “impressive array of scientifically validated techniques,” he also goes on to describe in detail the “vital aspects of the process that do not easily lend themselves to scientific inquiry.” He calls these aspects – the therapeutic relationship, self-disclosure, communication with the patient – the “art of psychological therapy.” In some ways, maybe they are art, but they are also skills that can be taught, evaluated and assessed. They are often the focus of psychodynamic education, supervision and consultation, and the most valuable things that one takes away from one’s own experience as a patient. Thus, avoiding or dismissing these “vital aspects” of psychotherapy because they seemingly do not fit into the box of “scientific inquiry” is troubling in many ways. Training that is primarily focused on evidence-based techniques and tactics is likely to lead to under-prepared clinicians and under-served clients, raising, in our view, critical ethical questions. Given what we know about the importance of common factors and how central the therapeutic relationship is in helping people, it’s time for this field to acknowledge the breadth and depth of evidence at our disposal, and to stop referencing and perpetuating outdated and irrelevant ideas. This will only mislead people who are suffering and seeking help, and make our field look out of step with the times. Nancy Burke, PhD Linda Michaels, PsyD MBA Janice Muhr, PhD • Gnaulati, E. (2019).

New York, NY: Routledge Author's lack of knowledge about psychoanalysis is disconcerting Submitted by Jacob Rusczek, Ph.D. on September 4, 2019 - 6:22pm The author states, ""many therapists still cling to antiquated methods like psychoanalysis and others that have no scientific backing."" I would like to refer the author and others to a presentation by Mark Solms, a neuropsychologist and psychoanalyst. I can't post the url but if you search for ""Psychoanalysis & Neuroscience Mark Solms (2015)"" on youtube you will find it. In it he demonstrates that the core claims of psychoanalysis fit very neatly with the findings of neuroscience and that the rationale for treatment is supported by our current understanding of how the brain works. This is, of course, all in addition to the many outcome studies that show robust results for psychoanalytic approaches to various clinical presentations (see Shedler, 2010, The Efficacy of Psychodynamic Psychotherapy for more on that). That the author confidently dismisses psychoanalysis in the face of ample scientific credibility is disconcerting.

Why Your Abusive Narcissistic Mate Claims to Be the Victim How to Build Happier Workplaces After the COVID Era What Is Your ""Style"" For Dealing With Conflict At Work?  >  Relational therapy, sometimes referred to as relational-cultural therapy, is a therapeutic approach based on the idea that mutually satisfying relationships with others are necessary for one’s emotional well-being. This type of takes into account social factors, such as race, class, culture, and , and examines the power struggles and other issues that develop as a result of these factors, as well as how they relate to the relationships in a person’s life. People who are experiencing distress from their family, intimate, professional, or social relationships may benefit from relational therapy. This includes those who are experiencing mood disorders, such as , , or , that are causing relationship issues and those who suffer from low , eating disorders, and poor . Relational Models Theory: Business and friendship, and love oh my! In relational therapy, you learn to identify how you may be pushing people away rather than attracting them and also come to understand how these behaviors are related to past experiences. The goal is to develop new ideas about relationships, to build a strong relationship with the therapist, and to use both those new ideas and the therapeutic relationship as a model to create healthier, longer-lasting relationships with others. Relational therapy stems from relational-cultural theory and the work of Jean Baker Miller in the 1970s and ‘80s, that looked at human connection and the ways culture influences relationships. Miller’s work centered on women, privilege, and power, and the dominant and subordinate roles played out in relationships. At that time, there was a movement in the field of away from pure introspection and toward an exploration of the dynamics of human relationships and their effects on individuals. More focus was given to emotional issues, stress, and power differentials from past relationships and how they can interfere with true personal expression and the ability to form solid relationships in the present. Relational-cultural theory focuses therapists and counselors on the cultures and contexts that affect relationships so they can work effectively with more diverse clients. The therapist addresses these issues within the context of the therapeutic relationship and the client’s relationships outside of therapy. What to Look for in a Relational Therapist Look for a licensed, experienced mental health professional with specific training in relational cultural theory or relational therapy. In addition to finding someone with the appropriate educational background, experience, and relational approach, look for a therapist with whom you feel comfortable discussing personal issues. A relational therapist should be a warm, , understanding, and nonjudgmental person, because the success of relational therapy is highly dependent on the client’s ability to form a personal relationship with the therapist. 2017.

Families in conflict, as well as couples and individuals with issues and concerns related to their families of origin, can benefit from family systems . This treatment approach can be helpful for such mental health conditions as , , , , , and food-related disorders. Family systems therapy has also been shown to help individuals and family members better control and cope with physical disabilities and disorders. Intrapsychic Conflict and Dysfunctional Family Patterns During family systems therapy, the family works individually and together to resolve a problem that directly affects one or more family members. Each family member has the opportunity to express their thoughts and feelings about how they are affected. Together, the family works to help the individual in distress and to help relieve the strain on the family. Family members explore their individual roles within the family, learn how to switch roles, if necessary, and learn ways to support and help each other with the goal of restoring family relationships and rebuilding a healthy family system. American psychiatrist Murray Bowen began to develop his family systems theory in the mid-1950s while working as a psychiatrist at the National Institute of Mental Health. Based on his knowledge of family patterns and systems theory, which looks at the parts of a system (such as individual family members) in relationship to the whole (the family), Bowen believed that the personalities, emotions, and behaviors of grown individuals are a result of their birth order, their role within their family of origin and the coping mechanisms they have developed for dealing with emotional family issues. To understand the family system, the family must be viewed as a whole, and that what defines a family is more than the people who make it up but also how they interact with each other to create a unique . What to Look for in a Family Systems Therapist Look for a licensed, experienced mental health professional with a background and understanding of family systems and dysfunctional family patterns, such as power struggles and communication problems. In addition to finding someone with the appropriate educational background and relevant experience, look for a therapist with whom you and your family feel comfortable working on personal and family issues.

How to Weather Psychologically Toxic Conditions Why So Many Are Gambling with Contracting Covid-19 How to Talk With Your Parents About Getting Counseling If your parents don't understand why you want counseling, read this. A lot of parents don't understand why you'd want to talk with a counselor. It might be they think they should be enough support for you, or they might not believe that getting can help. There are countless reasons it can be hard to talk to your parent(s) about getting counseling, and hopefully, you'll find some advice here to make that conversation go better. Telling your parent(s) that you want to talk with a counselor means letting them know something is not feeling okay in your life. That can be really scary, especially if you don't trust that they'll react well.  If they react by telling you that you shouldn't feel the way you do, or that your problems aren't real, that's called . It's the opposite of accepting how you feel or what you're going through. The first thing to remember is that your feelings are . After talking with a counselor, you might find that your thinking and feelings change. That's great. However, when a person is in distress, that's just a signal that they need some care and support. The bad feeling has a , which is to let you know to get some help. If your parent(s) react in this way, it's possible to respond to them by saying, ""I wish I didn't feel like this too. That's exactly why I want to talk with a counselor."" If Your Parent(s) Thinks They're All the Support You Need Some parents really wish they could help you, and they might feel worried about you wanting support from another adult. They might think it means they're failing as parents, or that it'll undermine your relationship with them. In reality, some people are blessed with parents who are exceptionally warm, open, and . However, most of us aren't as lucky. We have parents who might get defensive, angry, or freaked out if they hear about our problems. The good thing is that you don't need to tell your parent(s) that they're bad listeners to explain why you want to see a counselor. The truth is as simple as this: . By talking to a counselor, you'll get a new perspective or a different type of listening. It doesn't matter if your parents are great at this or awful. We all struggle sometimes, and getting extra help is never a bad idea. The most important thing to know about finding a good counselor is that the right match is important. Some counselors are much better than others. Some can be good for one person, but not the next. There is good research that shows you will be able to predict if a counselor is a good match for you after one or two sessions. If someone isn't a good match, you should feel empowered to talk to someone else.  A good counselor is someone that you believe can help you. They are usually warm, authentic, and you feel that they understand you.  Your school or university might have counselors or psychologists available, or you might be able to find people through your insurance company. There are some free counseling communities where you can talk to volunteers (like  or ), and there are some low-cost alternatives to .

The adults learn and practice new skills and techniques for relating to children with emotional or behavior problems, language issues, developmental disabilities, or mental health disorders. Aimed mostly at parents and caregivers, this intervention teaches specific skills they can use to help improve physical and verbal exchanges with their children. PCIT was developed for children ages 2 to 7 and has been shown to be effective for children who exhibit disruptive behavior or have experienced , as well as those on the spectrum. PCIT and PCIT-based programs are also evidence-based interventions for preventing child abuse and neglect and for decreasing the child’s risk of antisocial and criminal behavior later in life. Communicating About Emotion Between Parent and Adolescent Adolescence and Braving the Displeasure of Parents Parents and caregivers play with the children in one room, while the therapist observes and coaches from an adjacent room equipped with a one-way mirror. The therapist communicates with the adults through an earphone, providing training and guidance. Parents and caregivers are discouraged from using negative language and encouraged to ignore harmless negative behaviors while showing enthusiasm and giving praise for positive behaviors. They also learn other skills, such as reflecting the child’s language back to him or her to help with communication, describing out loud what the child is doing to increase the child’s vocabulary, and imitating the child’s good behavior to demonstrate approval. By learning specific techniques, parents and caregivers can build a better relationship with a child, and the child may start to demonstrate improved behavior. Overall, PCIT can help improve family dynamics by working to reduce negative behavior and interactions within the family and to practice new behaviors and ways of communicating that are more encouraging and reassuring. When practiced consistently, these new skills and techniques can instill more , reduce anger and , and encourage better individual and interactive behavior in both parent and child. What to Look for in a Parent-Child Interaction Therapist PCIT therapists, social workers, and counselors work in private practice and in community mental health settings. A therapist certified by PCIT International is a licensed mental health service provider with a minimum of a master’s degree and additional training and experience in the principles of PCIT. In addition to finding someone with the appropriate educational background and relevant experience, look for a therapist with whom you feel comfortable working on personal and family issues.

Courage to Think the Unthinkable: The Pandemic Might Get Worse  >  Cognitive Processing (CPT) is a type of therapy found to be effective for treating post- disorder (). With PTSD, you may find yourself thinking very differently about yourself and your environment, particularly in the following five areas. Safety: You may doubt your ability to protect yourself and others. Trust. You may question your judgment and, or, the judgment and intentions of others. Control: You feel unable to control your own life and, or, to influence the lives of those you care about. Esteem: You view yourself and, or, others differently, perhaps seeing yourself as broken or others as evil. : You may feel incapable of connecting with or being understood and accepted by others. These thoughts lead to negative emotions, such as , , , and , and can halt your recovery. CPT focuses on teaching a set of skills that will help you challenge these negative thoughts and gain control over the impact they have on your life. CPT is considered to be effective for anyone who has received a diagnosis of . Some researchers and clinicians believe that CPT might be particularly beneficial if you anticipate encountering additional events—say, in the military or as an emergency worker, such as a firefighter, police officer, or EMT—as it aims to alter the way you interpret and process trauma. CPT is not recommended if you have not received a diagnosis of PTSD or if you have literacy difficulties, as it involves written homework. In this instance, another research-supported trauma treatment, such as Prolonged Exposure (PET), is often recommended over CPT. CPT can be conducted in individual or group therapy sessions, or a combination of the two. A full course of CPT typically involves 12 weekly sessions, though this can vary depending on your needs. In CPT, you will work with your therapist to identify and explore the ways that the trauma may have altered your thoughts and beliefs, affecting both the way you feel and how you act. Your therapist will specifically help you pick out thoughts that keep you fixed in the trauma and create barriers to recovery. You will learn a set of strategies to challenge and modify thoughts that are inaccurate and, or, unhelpful and will practice these strategies with your therapist and on your own with worksheets and exercises. You may find it helpful, though it is not required, to write about the specific events of your trauma. CPT, based on the social cognitive theory of PTSD, focuses on repairing the damage done by a traumatic event to your beliefs about yourself and the world. By offering specific cognitive restructuring skills, CPT allows you to challenge these negative thoughts and interpretations (stuck points), gain a healthier perspective about the trauma (While I can’t trust my abuser, I can trust other people), cope better with any future trauma, and move forward with your life. What to Look for in a CPT Therapist Mental health providers can receive training and certification for CPT. Some institutions, such as university clinics, provide training seminars and workshops in CPT. Additionally, several CPT treatment manuals have been developed to assist clinicians in delivering the therapy. Chard, K. M. (2005).

Transpersonal therapy is a holistic healing intervention that evolved from the humanistic work of American psychologist Abraham Maslow in the 1960s. It integrates traditional spiritual rituals into modern psychology and emphasizes positive influences and role models rather than concentrating on negative experiences. This intervention is based on the idea that humans are more than mind and body but are also composed of intangible, or transcendent, factors that make up the whole person.

Ellis believed that most people are not aware that many of their thoughts about themselves are irrational and negatively affect the way they behave in important relationships and situations. According to Ellis, it is these thoughts that lead people to suffer negative emotions and engage in self-destructive behavior. At the same time, humans are capable of challenging and changing their irrational beliefs, if they are willing to do the work. While specific life events may contribute to mental health issues, REBT therapists believe that it is an individual’s own faulty and irrational belief system that causes the most problems.

This form of play therapy is practiced along with talk therapy, using the sandbox and figures as communication tools. Sandplay is often used with those who have suffered some form of , neglect, or abuse. Although sandplay is especially well suited for working with young children, who often cannot express their inner feelings in words, it is also a technique that is helpful for some teens and adults who are having trouble expressing themselves and who may have suffered some form of severe trauma. Sandplay therapy takes place in box-like containers referred to as sand trays. The trays are filled with sand that clients use, along with miniature toys, to create a play world that reflects some aspect of real people and real experiences in their own lives. The client chooses from a large collection of toys and builds a small “world” in the tray that reflects what is going on in their lives. The therapist observes the choice and arrangement of toys without interruption, allowing the person to find answers within themselves. After sandplay is completed, the client and therapist analyze and discuss the client’s toy choices, their arrangement pattern in the sand, and their symbolic or metaphoric meanings. Upon discussion, the client often chooses to make changes to the world they have created in sand. Sandplay therapy may consist of a single session or last as long as several years. Sandplay therapy was developed in the late 1950s by psychologist Dora Kalff, who combined several techniques and philosophies to come up with her own therapeutic approach. Kalff learned what became known as the World Technique from pediatrician and child psychologist Margaret Lowenfeld, who developed the original sand-tray intervention. Kalff incorporated the use of sand trays into her own form of therapy, which was based on her Jungian training and Eastern philosophical beliefs. With the help of sand trays, clients, guided by the therapist, begins to understand the connection between the world they created in sand and their own inner world. By making changes in their make-believe world, clients are often empowered to make similar changes in their real world. Today, some therapists and counselors choose to modify Kalff’s parameters for sandplay and incorporate a similar technique into their own therapeutic process. What to Look for in a Sandplay Therapist No certification for sandplay therapy is required in the U.S., though certification programs do exist. Look for a licensed, experienced mental health professional, therapist, or counselor with advanced training in sandplay therapy. In addition to finding someone with the appropriate educational background, experience and sandplay setup, look for a therapist or counselor with whom you or your child feel comfortable working.  Accessed April 14, 2017.

NLP is intended to help clients understand their own minds, how they came to think and behave the way they do, and to learn to manage their moods and emotions and reprogram the way they process information so that it leads to more acceptable and successful behavior. At the same time, NLP is designed to help clients see ways they have been successful in the past and determine how they can most easily and efficiently repeat that success in other areas of their lives. NLP therapists believe that their clients have the answers to their problems within themselves; it is simply a matter of helping them draw out those answers.

The client-therapist relationship is based on developing or rebuilding trust and centers on expressing emotions. An attachment-based approach to therapy looks at the connection between an infant’s early attachment experiences with primary caregivers, usually with parents, and the infant’s ability to develop normally and ultimately form healthy emotional and physical relationships as an adult. Attachment-based therapy aims to build or rebuild a trusting, supportive relationship that will help prevent or treat or . An attachment-based approach can be used in individual, family, couple, and group , with both children and adults, to helps clients mend or recover from fractured family relationships. Those who may benefit from attachment-based therapy include adoptees, children in , children of mothers, and victims of , such as children of or children who have been sexually abused or otherwise mistreated, particularly at the hands of a . Attachment-based family therapy (ABFT) has been shown to be helpful in treating adolescents who are depressed and/or thinking about suicide. Adolescents, Parents, and the Power of Self-Esteem Since the goal of ABFT extends to repairing the family relationship, the therapist will work with the individual adolescent client alone, and also with the family as a group. The therapist works with the family to build and strengthen the parent-child bond and help the child to develop into an independent, self-sufficient adult. With individual adults, the therapist aims to help the client overcome the effects of negative early attachment issues by establishing a secure bond between the client and the therapist. Once this relationship is solidified, the therapist can help the client communicate more openly and better explore and understand how their current feelings and behaviors are associated with earlier experiences. Attachment-based therapy as described here should not to be confused with unconventional, unproven, and potentially harmful treatments referred to as ""attachment therapy"" that involve physical manipulation, restraint, deprivation, boot camp–like activities, or physical discomfort of any kind. Attachment-based therapy developed from the 1960s work of British psychologist , who first proposed that strong early attachment to at least one primary caregiver is necessary for children to have a sense of security and the supportive foundation they need to freely interact with their environment, to explore, to learn from new experiences, and to connect with others. Without a healthy foundation, babies may grow to be fearful, confused, and insecure, ultimately becoming depressed or even as adolescents. Theoretically, by forming a trusting relationship with parental figures or with the therapist, the client is better prepared to form strong bonds in other relationships. Attachment-based therapy may be used in conjunction with other forms of therapy. What to Look For in an Attachment-Based Therapist A qualified attachment-based therapist is a psychologist, psychotherapist, clinical social worker, and family therapist, or other licensed clinician with an attachment-based treatment approach and experience in the field. Once you have established that a therapist has the credentials and experience you are looking for, it is important to make sure you are comfortable working with that person.

A new theory aims to make sense of it all. 7 Gaslighting Phrases Used to Confuse and Control How Narcissism Distorts Self-Image via Self-Concept Clarity The Intriguing Psychological Puzzle of Tesla Ownership LEGO Braille Bricks Help Blind Children Learn to Read  >  Narrative is a form of counseling that views people as separate from their problems. This allows clients to get some distance from the issue to see how it might actually be helping them, or protecting them, more than it is hurting them. With this new perspective, individuals feel more empowered to make changes in their thought patterns and behavior and “rewrite” their life story for a future that reflects who they are, what they are capable of, and what their purpose is, separate from their problems. Individuals, couples, and families can all benefit from narrative . Those who define themselves by their problems, whose lives are dominated by such feelings as “I am a person” or “I am an person” can learn to see their problem as something they have but not something that identifies who they are. Your therapist will encourage you to direct the conversation by asking what you prefer to talk about and, on an ongoing basis, checking to see if the topic, which is most likely a problem, is still something you are interested in discussing. After some time, your therapist will lead you to tell other, more positive stories from your life to help you discover inherent traits and skills that can be used to address your problems. The goal is for you to see how there are positive and productive ways to approach your life and your future when you stop identifying yourself by your problems. In narrative therapy, the events that occur over time in a person’s life are viewed as stories, some of which stand out as more significant or more fateful than others. These significant stories, usually stemming from negative events, can ultimately shape one’s . Beyond this identity, the narrative therapist views a client’s life as multitiered and full of possibilities that are just waiting to be discovered. The therapist does not act as the expert, but rather helps clients see how they are the experts regarding their own life and, as such, can uncover the , values, , and skills that define who they really are, separate from their problems. These are the buried stories that can be rewritten and woven into the ongoing and future story of their lives. What to Look for in a Narrative Therapist A narrative therapist is a licensed mental health professional, social worker, or therapist who has additional training in narrative therapy through academic programs, intensive workshops, or online continuing . In addition to checking credentials and experience, you should feel safe and comfortable working with any narrative therapist you choose.

Courage to Think the Unthinkable: The Pandemic Might Get Worse  >  Internal Family Systems (IFS) is an approach to that identifies and addresses multiple sub-personalities or families within each person’s mental system. These sub-personalities consist of wounded parts and painful emotions such as and , and parts that try to control and protect the person from the pain of the wounded parts. The sub-personalities are often in conflict with each other and with one’s core Self, a concept that describes the confident, compassionate, whole person that is at the core of every individual. IFS focuses on healing the wounded parts and restoring mental balance and harmony by changing the dynamics that create discord among the sub-personalities and the Self. IFS is used to treat individuals, couples, and families. It is an evidence-based approach that has been shown to be effective for treating a variety of conditions and their symptoms, such as , , phobias, panic, and physical health conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, as well as improving general functioning and well-being. IFS is talk therapy in which you work with a therapist to identify and understand the specific sub-personalities or families that make up your internal mental system. Once you identify these parts, the therapist will help you acknowledge your feelings about these suppressed emotions, learn how to release these feelings so you are freer to address the actual problem, and ultimately find more positive ways to manage conflicts on your own. The therapist may suggest certain tools to help you do this, such as relaxation exercises, , keeping a journal, and creating a chart that illustrates the relationship between Self and the different parts of you. IFS was developed in the 1990s by family therapist Richard Schwartz, Ph.D., who developed the concept of an undamaged core Self that is the essence of who you are, and identified three different types of sub-personalities or families that reside within each person, in addition to the Self. These include wounded and suppressed parts called exiles, protective parts called managers, that keep the exiled parts suppressed, and other protective parts called firefighters, that distract the Self from the pain of exiled parts when they are released. For example, an exiled part may be the and of earlier abuse, emotions that are suppressed by the manager, while the firefighter may be an or behavior such as overeating that distracts the client from facing and re-experiencing those uncomfortable emotions. These parts can be healed, transformed, and better managed by the Self by achieving the three of IFS: 3) Coordinate and harmonize the Self and the parts, so they can work together as a team with the Self in charge.

Courage to Think the Unthinkable: The Pandemic Might Get Worse How to Find Empathy for People You Don’t Understand  >  Eclectic therapy is an open, integrative form of that adapts to the unique needs of each specific client, depending on the problem, the treatment goals, and the person’s expectations and . An eclectic therapist draws from a variety of disciplines and may use a range of proven methods to determine the best combination of therapeutic tools to help the client. In effect, an eclectic therapist customizes the therapeutic process for each individual by using whatever form of treatment, or combination of treatments, has been shown to be most effective for treating the particular problem. Any type of psychotherapist can successfully practice eclectic . The therapist should be familiar with the evidence-based techniques used in different types of therapy that have been proven to help with specific problems. Scientific evidence, as well as knowledge and training on the part of the therapist, should always be the basis behind the decision to use any type of therapeutic technique. An eclectic approach can be used in both individual and group therapy settings. Eclectic therapy may seem unstructured at first. Working with the therapist, you may try different techniques before treatment becomes more consistent. For instance, a therapist (CBT) might call on principles of sensory therapy and ask questions about your physical well-being, then go on to suggest a form of relaxation therapy to help you focus on any physical discomfort you report. The goal, in this case, might be to uncover any emotions that may underlie the physical sensations you have, such as tension in your shoulders or neck. Once emotions are identified, the therapist can switch back to CBT techniques that can help you change the negative thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that are causing your problems. One of the early proponents of eclectic therapy, cognitive therapist Arnold Lazarus, used the term “multi-modal” to describe his method, because he would use different “modes,” or approaches to help different clients. Lazarus proposed that the most complete form of therapy evaluates seven different modes: behavior, affect, sensation, imagery, , interpersonal relationships, and consideration of drugs and client biology. Using a flexible approach, rather than a more traditionally structured, narrower, and straightforward one, the eclectic therapist tailors the therapeutic process to the needs of the client and determines which modes and methods will be most helpful for that person. The therapist is not restricted to a one-size-fits-all perspective and is not looking for universal behavior patterns but, instead, gathers very specific information from the client, then matches the form of treatment to the individual and his or her disorder. What to Look for in an Eclectic Therapist Look for a licensed psychotherapist or mental health professional who is trained or certified in different types of therapeutic strategies and is able to explain the eclectic or integrative approach in a way that makes sense to you. A majority of therapists surveyed who practice eclectic therapy preferred the term to the term , so practitioners may refer to themselves as eclectic therapists, integrative therapists, or integrationists.

It is used to enhance and complement the benefits of traditional therapy. Animal-assisted can be a useful intervention for individuals or groups.

Another review of randomized, controlled studies found that animal-assisted therapy can be helpful for those battling illnesses like , schizophrenia, or . Anyone who dislikes or fears animals or is allergic to them, is not a likely candidate for this particular intervention. Depending on the nature of your therapy and the type of animal involved, you may keep a dog, cat, or other pet at home and at your side throughout the day for emotional support, or you might learn to ride and care for a therapy horse that is housed at an equestrian school. You and your therapist may discuss your animal while you are working with it, or you may set aside another time to talk about your experiences. If you are in a hospital, school, nursing home, rehabilitation center, or another type of community center, you may not have a relationship with a psychotherapist, but a volunteer with a trained therapy pet might visit you. Animals can provide a sense of calm, comfort, or safety and divert away from a situation and toward one that provides pleasure. Advocates of animal-assisted therapy say that developing a bond with an animal can help people develop a better sense of and trust, stabilize their emotions, and improve their communication, , and socialization skills. What to Look for in an Animal-Assisted Therapist Animal-assisted therapy often serves in conjunction with traditional work done by a licensed psychotherapist, social worker, or other mental health–care provider. Dogs are the primary animals used, although various animal-assisted programs offer different animals for people with different physical and emotional needs. Service dogs may come from animal shelters or be raised in selective breeding programs, but they must undergo formal training to be certified. In some cases, it may be necessary to obtain a written prescription or a letter from a medical doctor, licensed psychotherapist, or social worker to certify or register your own therapy or emotional-support animal. You can find information and groups that provide trained service dogs in your area through Assistance Dogs International. A professional mental health–care provider who is familiar with animal-assisted therapies can help you get certification for your own pet or locate a program or animal that is right for you. Therapists may also partner with an animal-therapy program, such as Pet Partners, to provide individuals or groups with trained therapy animals. Nimer J., Lundahl B.

A new theory aims to make sense of it all. The Continuing Stigma Around Medical Marijuana Use Young Adults Remain at Serious Risk of Mental Health Crises How to Benefit from Psychedelics Without Even Taking Them Unified Psychotherapy: An Introduction and Overview A brief overview of the unified psychotherapy movement. Welcome to the Unified (UP) blog! This is a space where leaders in the UP movement will offer insights and commentaries on developments pertaining to psychotherapy. In this opening post, we provide an overview of the movement, including how it was formed, where it fits in the landscape of psychotherapy, and our hopes for its future. Currently, the vast array of psychotherapy interventions exist as a “cacophony” of different approaches that rest on different philosophical and theoretical assumptions and emphasize different domains of human functioning and adaptation. The leaders of the UP movement offer new perspectives in and psychological “metatheory” that allow researchers and practitioners to view the big picture and to navigate the current jungle of different approaches in a way that allows them to make music out of the noise and effectively coordinate diverse treatment options in a systematic and logical way. In simplest terms, a metatheory is a theory of theory. “Meta” refers to that which is beyond, transcending, or more comprehensive. Thus, metatheories are theoretical frameworks of a more comprehensive order—at a higher level of abstraction—than traditional single theories. A key advantage of this higher level of abstraction is that, unlike single-system theories that necessarily disagree with or contradict other single-system theories on key points, metatheories operate from a conceptual space beyond the single-system theories such that relativism is transcended by conceptual frameworks that can unify the spectrum of psychotherapies. These approaches also allow utilizing of and capitalizing on, the strengths of both single-school approaches and integrative approaches. How did the Unified Psychotherapy movement get started? In a seminal 1980 article on identifying general therapeutic change principles, the integrative psychotherapist Marv Goldfried issued a call for an imaginary conference in which individuals of different backgrounds would dialogue about steps toward consensus in basic principles and processes of therapy. The participants in the unified psychotherapy movement attempted to realize this conference in two summits, held in Cape Cod, Massachusetts in 2015 and 2017. At the first summit, a consensus was reached regarding the definition and goal of the unified psychotherapy movement (UPM). It was agreed that the UPM represents a new approach to the field of psychotherapy that seeks to enhance practitioners’ capacity to draw from the diversity of approaches, processes, techniques, and research findings by providing an evolving, comprehensive, and holistic framework. During the second Cape Cod summit in 2017, was paid to identifying the key areas of focus that constitute the core of the movement. Where does Unified Psychotherapy fit in the larger field? From the vantage point of the UP , UP represents the next stage in the natural evolution of the field. Through the 1970s psychotherapy was dominated by single schools (e.., behavioral, , ) and proponents vigorously challenged those who adopted different orientations. Then a different attitude began to become prevalent among a significant proportion of scholars and practitioners, namely that of eclecticism and the possibility of a more cooperative stance between the schools. By the end of the 1980s, the formal movement systematically exploring psychotherapy integration had emerged, and four pathways to integration had been articulated (i.e., common factors, technical eclecticism, assimilative integration, and theoretical integration). Recently, unification was recognized by the as representing the fifth approach. Unified approaches seek metatheoretical perspectives that afford scholars and practitioners holistic frameworks that allow for greater unification of the various orientations and approaches. Such unified psychotherapies represent a paradigmatic shift in the field’s understanding of all domains of human functioning, their interrelationships, how they impact health and psychopathology, and how to most effectively intervene (Magnavita, 2008). What is the relationship between Unified Psychotherapy and the science of psychology?       Scholars in the UP movement attempt to ground psychotherapy in the science of human psychology. Topic areas of interest include: A) The nature of psychology as a field (its definition and subject matter); B) Theory and key domains of adaptation and functioning (e.g., Habits and Lifestyles; Emotions and Emotional Functioning; Relational Quality and Interpersonal Style; Defenses and Coping; , Ego Functioning, and Beliefs and Values); C) the Bio-genetic, Developmental, Interpersonal, and Socio-Cultural Contexts and Forces that influence human functioning; D) Psychopathology (its nature and classification); F) Human Change Mechanisms and Processes, especially in the context of therapy; and How do unified psychotherapists approach psychotherapy?  A Unified Psychotherapist uses their knowledge in the context of therapy to foster psychological adjustment and more optimal psychological functioning for individuals in need of psychological care. To do this, a UP engages in a comprehensive assessment that examines key domains of psychological adaptation (e.g., habits and lifestyles; emotions and emotional functioning; relationships and interpersonal styles; defenses and coping; and identity), places those domains in bio-physiological, learning and developmental, and social and cultural contexts to delineate a clear case formulation of the person and the problem in a way that leads to a treatment plan, which is developed—in with the client, taking into consideration their values, level of functioning, and stage of change—from a menu of bona fide interventions that might be appropriate. Such interventions can be taken from a number of perspectives and are chosen based on the conceptual understanding of the case, the client’s values and stage of change, and on the expertise and training of the therapist. Through a process of awareness, acceptance, and active change efforts, a unified psychotherapist works with the client to meet appropriate , which are set relative to prognosis based on the conceptualization. Progress toward those goals and the quality of the relationship is monitored. If successful, the focus turns to maintenance and ultimately, when appropriate, termination.  Who are the Leaders of the UPM (and the authors of this blog)? Drs. Jack Anchin and Jeffrey Magnavita are pioneers in the field. They have authored many articles on unified psychotherapy and recently the book Unifying Psychotherapy: Principles, Methods, and Evidence from Clinical Science. These individuals also founded The Journal of Unified Psychotherapy and Clinical Science. Dr. Anchin is a clinical associate professor (core faculty) in Medaille College’s doctoral program in clinical psychology and an adjunct professor of psychology at the University at Buffalo/SUNY. Jeffrey Magnavita is the leading figure in the Unified Psychotherapy Project and Psychotherapedia (launched with the help of Steve Sobleman). Dr. Kenneth Critchfield specializes in Interpersonal Reconstructive Therapy, a method of unified psychotherapy that places special emphasis on relational patterns, developmental history, and . While the method can be used with many different populations, it has primarily been used to bring about change with “complex cases” involving chronic or severe psychopathology and . He is Director of the Combined-Integrated Doctoral Program in Clinical and School Psychology at James Madison University, a program devoted to training individuals to be unified health service psychologists. Dr. Jeff Harris is the originator of Multitheoretical Psychotherapy and is author of the book Integrative Multitheoretical Psychotherapy. Dr. Harris is an associate professor of psychology at Texas Woman’s University, where he teaches students how to operate from a multi-theoretical perspective. Dr. Gregg Henriques is a professor of Graduate Psychology at James Madison University in the Combine-Integrated Doctoral Program. He has developed a novel approach to unifying the science of psychology, which he argues can be used to provide the framework for the assimilation and integration of the major paradigms in psychotherapy. He is author of the blog Theory of Knowledge on Psychology today and the book A New Unified Theory of Psychology. Dr. Barbara Ingram is a professor of psychology at Pepperdine University in Los Angeles. She is author of Clinical case formulations: Matching the integrative treatment plan to the client. In addition to teaching a systematic framework for organizing case formulations, she developed a list of “core clinical hypotheses” that provide the bridge between assessment and selection of best-fitting intervention strategies. Dr. Andre Marquis is one of the founding members of the Integral Institute and has authored several works exploring why Ken Wilber’s Integral Theory provides a valuable meta-theoretical framework for understanding psychopathology and psychotherapy. Dr. Marquis is an associate professor at the University of Rochester where he is using, teaching and researching an integral approach to psychotherapy. Kristin A. R. Osborn, LMHC founded the Certified APT™-Training Program and is a lecturer (part-time) in at Harvard Medical School (HMS) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and is the Director of HMS Psychotherapy Research Program. Her passion is teaching clinicians how to integrate research in their clinical training and she developed several research skills to study the interplay between clinician an therapist and they are featured in her book, Paraverbal Communication in Psychotherapy: Beyond the Words, Rowman & Littlefield (2016).  What is the Unified Psychotherapy vision for the future of psychotherapy? We are envisioning a shift in how the field of psychotherapy is conceptualized. Currently, many students are taught about the various schools of thought separately and then given the option to practice from one or another or are left up to their own devices to generate an eclectic blend. We foresee a time when individuals are provided a meta-theoretical overview that allows practitioners a way to understand where the various paradigms are in relation to one another and how they might be interwoven to inform practitioners in a more coherent way. This has enormous implications for training, research and practice, and this blog will be devoted to exploring many of these issues.

The list serv is basically an email list, your blog is over here on psychology today, but your main website is the UPP homepage. I wonder if you have looked into transferring everything (including the UPP page, which has an old look) to one site. For example, a WordPress site can integrate a forum (instead of the listserv) and a blog (so you don't have to go to Psych today to read blog posts). The Asgaros forum, I believe, is free, and integrates well with WordPress. You can have multiple forums with disparate topics, making it easy for many people to participate with many different threads, and avoids overwhelming participants with email notifications. There are many other reasons for creating an integrative web presence, and i think it will help you achieve a lot of your goals. Just ask the youngest person you meet today to guide you through it! Submitted by Jeremy Halstead on March 6, 2018 - 5:03am As a mainly retired psychologist and psychotherapist, I maintain my interest in the field and have the time to surf the net and occasionally post comments. Just as younger people like to believe that they have found ""answers"" that avoid having to go through the grind of experience and work of their older peers; older people (a category with whom I identify) hope that all there accumulated knowledge is not redundant. Unified Psychotherapy points to two facets of the psychotherapy enterprise that are important but not always grasped by all consumers and practitioners - i. e. having a metatheoretical perspective cf. philosophy on differing approaches and what we might call techniques (sometimes alluded to as the toolbag). Digressing slightly I met someone the other day who on pressing me for my former occupation remarked ""there are so many"" (psychotherapies). Searching for a metaphor I said if you want to be driven across difficult terrain you will seek a competent driver - and one you can trust to keep you safe. The brand of the car is very much secondary. To extend the comparison as a driver or owner you may be very interested in the brand or model of the car. As therapists (and sometimes car owners) we invest a lot in a particular brand the brand allegiance becomes mixed up with our views of self, we may even denigrate other brands for no very good reason or feel anxious that we made the wrong choice. As consumers we just want to feel better and brand talk is just confusing. Part of the project I fell must be understanding the forces including those coming from vested interests that act on individuals to take on brand allegiance. I am not dismissive of particular techniques that also happen to provide kudos and cash for their originators but I am a little wary. Branding and packaging may improve the product. On the otehr hand what are we to make of a practitioner whose selling point is a training course in BLAH therapy. Would we employ a plumber simply because she had a certificate in plastic pipe fitting. As I have moved on, I am convinced that the setting (including commercial) in which therapists and counsellors operate will be vital to the question as to whether they become broadly educated broadly knowledgable creative practitioners with science based critical thinking. OR franchisees promulgating a particular brand with zeal because it is the only thing they know, they have invested a lot in it, and it brings home the bacon (other nutritional metaphors are available). Anyway Power and Peace. Submitted by JAK on March 6, 2018 - 11:12am This project seems similar to the effort in physics to unify, integrate, and reduce the various concepts into a single Theory of Everything (ToE). It would seem prudent for the UPP to integrate all therapies with physics (the 'mother' science) in preparation for the anticipated UPP. The seed for this might be Erwin Schrödinger's 1944 paper, What Is Life? (I know that Dr. Gregg Henriques has already done significant work in aligning psychology with physics.) Overall, the varies concepts within the UPP are puzzle pieces which must be fit together. It would seem that the UPP needs a structure where all can contribute and work. This structure would show relationships between the various 'pieces'. A website would seem ideal. A Wiki page could even be a point of integration which would increase participation. However, a private website would facilitate better control over entries. Submitted by JAK on March 6, 2018 - 11:17am Spellcheck/grammarcheck would be handy, too: ""Overall, the various concepts ..."" Submitted by Marylynn Munrow on March 11, 2018 - 12:16am What if, instead of being so satisfied with research-driven results these professionals would also speak to clients. What if 100 or 500 actual clients were interviewed. Many such as myself could tell you exactly what would work better for us and what made things worse in therapy. What's the advantage of research without interviews? Did some therapists decide clients voices aren't important here?

This focus sets up a positive mindset that helps you build on you best qualities, find your strengths, improve and change worldview to one that is more positive. A positive attitude, in turn, can help your expectations of yourself and others become more reasonable. Anyone with poor , or who has emotional issues resulting from an abusive relationship with a parent or partner, can benefit from strength-based . This includes people with serious mental health issues such as , , and schizophrenia, who can use strength-based therapy to build and reduce the of living with such a condition. Strength-based therapy can be used as an intervention for individuals of all ages, couples and families. Strength-based therapy is talk therapy that guides you toward a retelling of your personal history of , stressors, and pain with more emphasis on yourself as a survivor than as a victim, and more emphasis on your strengths and survival skills than on your weakness. The goal is for you to recognize that you already have the skills and strength to survive and can use those same strengths to deal with tough situations in other areas of your life. American psychotherapist Donald Clifton became known as the “father of strength-based therapy” because of his many contributions to the field in the late 1900s and early years of 2000, but the practice evolved from the work of people in various disciplines, including social work, counseling psychology, positive psychology, solution-focused therapy, and narrative therapy. The theory behind strength-based therapy is that through adversary, people discover their inner strengths. How people deal with life’s challenges depends on whether they feel they are operating from a position of strength or a position of deficit. Those with a strength mindset focus on their positive qualities, while those with a deficit mindset focus on weaknesses and flaws, both in themselves and others. Each mindset influences future thinking and behavior in a different way. Strength-based therapy emphasizes the patterns and circumstances in a person’s life, rather than the negatives. It helps determine what works for each people by seeing people for who they are as individuals, not who they are by nature of their diagnosis. What to Look for in a Strength-Based Therapist Strength-based therapy techniques can be incorporated into different types of counseling and therapy. Look for a licensed, experienced counselor, social worker, psychotherapist, or other mental health professional with training in strength-based therapy. In addition to finding someone with the appropriate educational background, experience and positive approach, seek a therapist with whom you feel comfortable discussing personal issues.

Psychological testing and evaluation consists of a series of tests that help determine the cause of psychological symptoms and disorders, to determine the correct diagnosis and follow up with the appropriate course of treatment. When a child is having behavioral, social, or academic problems, it may be due to a learning disorder, an or even an emotional problem, such as or . Specific types of psychological tests can help a psychologist rule out some conditions while honing in on an accurate diagnosis. Psychological testing and evaluation is also used with adults, for instance, to determine the extent of a brain injury or disorder, or to decide if a person is mentally competent to stand trial. Some businesses and organizations use psychological testing and evaluation to decide whether or not an applicant is likely to be a good candidate for a position within the company, or to determine the needs of an active employee. Generally, a medical doctor, social worker, or government employee provides a referral for psychological testing and evaluation that takes place in a mental health center, hospital, university medical center, school, or private office. It may take up to several hours and more than one visit with a clinician to complete in-depth psychological testing and evaluation. During this time, the client takes a series of standardized written tests that may take the form of questionnaires, ability ranking lists, surveys and checklists. While clients may take the tests on their own, there are usually follow-up interviews with the tester. If testing sessions are lengthy, there will be breaks. Psychological tests are not the type of tests one can or should prepare for. The psychologist uses information from the tests and interviews to write up an overall evaluation, determine a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan or provide referrals, necessary. What to Look for in Psychological Testing and Evaluation A mental health professional with advanced training in test administration and interpretation is qualified to perform psychological testing and evaluation. The health professional who administers the tests and conducts the interview may or may not be the treating therapist. Once a diagnosis is made, the testing clinician may refer the client to another specialist for treatment. In addition to checking credentials, it is important in all cases to find a mental health professional with whom you and your child, if involved, feel comfortable working with.

Courage to Think the Unthinkable: The Pandemic Might Get Worse How to Find Empathy for People You Don’t Understand  >  Gestalt therapy is a client-centered approach to that helps clients focus on the present and understand what is really happening in their lives right now, rather than what they may perceive to be happening based on past experience. Instead of simply talking about past situations, clients are encouraged to experience them, perhaps through re-enactment. Through the gestalt process, clients learn to become more aware of how their own negative thought patterns and behaviors are blocking true self-awareness and making them unhappy. Gestalt can help clients with issues such as , , , relationship difficulties, and even physical ones like migraine headaches, ulcerative colitis, and back spasms. Good candidates for gestalt therapy are those who are interested in working on their self-awareness but may or may not understand the role they play in their own unhappiness and discomfort. Gestalt techniques are often used in combination with body work, dance, art, drama, and other therapies. The Empty Chair Goofing Off: Psychological & Physical Benefits of Having Fun A gestalt therapist focuses on what is happening in the moment and finding solutions in the present time. For examples, rather than discuss why something happened in the past, the therapist will encourage you to re-enact the moment and discuss how it feels right now. In other words, you will be asked to experience your feelings, rather than simply talk about them. The therapist will ask you questions like, “What’s going on in this moment?” or “How does this make you feel now?” Your therapist may experiment with dream work, guided , role-playing, confrontation, and other techniques that can help bring past and current struggles to life in the therapeutic setting. Your goal, as you become more aware of yourself and your senses, is to take more responsibility for yourself, accept the consequences of your behavior, and learn to satisfy your own needs while still respecting the needs of others. The word “gestalt” means whole. Gestalt therapy was developed by psychotherapist Fritz Perls on the principle that humans are best viewed as a whole entity consisting of body, mind, and soul, and best understood when viewed through their own eyes, not by looking back into the past but by bringing the past into the present. Gestalt therapy emphasizes that to alleviate unresolved , pain, anxiety, resentment, and other negative feelings, these emotions cannot just be discussed, but must be actively expressed in the present time. If that doesn’t happen, both psychological and physical symptoms can arise. Perls believed that we are not in this world to live up to others' expectations, nor should we expect others to live up to ours. By building self-awareness, gestalt therapy helps clients better understand themselves and how the choices they make affect their health and their relationships. With this self-knowledge, clients begin to understand how their emotional and physical selves are connected and develop more to start living a fuller life and more effectively deal with problems. What to Look for in a Gestalt Therapist Look for a licensed, experienced psychotherapist with a gestalt approach toward therapy. In addition to fulfilling their general and licensing requirements, some therapists may take continuing education courses and training in gestalt therapy techniques. Once you have established that a therapist has the credentials and experience you are looking for, be sure you understand and are comfortable with the process as explained by the therapist.

Why You Have Romantic Feelings for Someone You Hardly Know The Intriguing Psychological Puzzle of Tesla Ownership LEGO Braille Bricks Help Blind Children Learn to Read  >  Unlike traditional psychology that focuses more on the causes and symptoms of mental illnesses and emotional disturbances, positive psychology emphasizes traits, thinking patterns, behaviors, and experiences that are forward-thinking and can help improve the quality of a person’s day-to-day life. These may include , , hopefulness, , , perseverance, justice, and the practice of . It is an exploration of one’s strengths, rather than one’s weaknesses. The goal of positive psychology is not to replace those traditional forms of that center on negative experiences, but instead to expand and give more balance to the therapeutic process. Positive psychology can be applied to children and adults in educational settings and mental health facilities, as well as in private counseling practices. There is also a place for positive psychology outside the realm of therapeutic practice, such as in human resource and business administration. Surprising Benefits for Those Who Had Tough Childhoods Positive psychology is sometimes referred to as “the science of .” One of the questions positive psychologists try to address is: “Can a person be happy and realistic at the same time?” While acknowledging the problems of the world and of the individual, positive psychologists believe one can still lead a productive, meaningful, and satisfying life. The goal is to minimize negativity in one’s thinking and behavior, to develop a more attitude that will enhance, rather than disrupt one’s social, professional, and life. Positive therapists and counselors use a variety of exercises and interventions to help their clients become more self-aware and identify their own positive traits and strengths. To a large degree, the positive psychology movement began back in the 1950s and ’60s, with the introduction of a humanistic approach to therapy. Soon afterwards, psychologists began to realize that looking only at the damage already done to adults was not helping to prevent mental health problems that often begin in . In the late 1990s, psychologist recognized that, for the sake of prevention, researchers and practitioners had to start looking more closely at human strengths and virtues, not just weaknesses, and figure out how to instill positive traits in younger people who may be at risk of developing the unhealthy emotions and behaviors that signal mental illness. Seligman proposed that successful in the future would not only be a process wherein people talk about their troubles, but also where people examine and learn to use their strengths. He suggested that exercises in happiness can be used to make lasting differences in those who are , , or conflicted. What to Look for in Positive Psychology The science of positive psychology can be incorporated into all levels of , counseling, and psychotherapy. Look for a licensed, experienced professional with training in positive psychology. In addition to finding someone with the appropriate educational background, experience, and positive approach, look for a therapist with whom you feel comfortable discussing personal issues.

At the same time, NLP is designed to help clients see ways they have been successful in the past and determine how they can most easily and efficiently repeat that success in other areas of their lives. NLP therapists believe that their clients have the answers to their problems within themselves; it is simply a matter of helping them draw out those answers. What to Look for in a Neuro-Linguistic Programming Therapist An NLP therapist is a licensed mental health professional, social worker, or therapist with additional training in NLP interventions and techniques through workshops and mentorship programs. In addition to checking credentials and experience, you should feel safe and comfortable working with any NLP therapist you choose. Zaharia C, Reiner M, Schutz P.

What Goes on Beneath the Surface When Narcissists Get Angry How a Celebrity Crush Can Impact Your (Real) Relationship When Is the Best Time to Meditate for Better Sleep? The Post Traumatic Stress Response Helps People Avoid Danger  >  Psychological focuses on the positive aspects of the human condition, much like positive counseling; it does not focus on the negative, irrational, and pathological aspects of life. Coaching is specific and goal-oriented. Like sports coaching, psychological coaching concentrates on individual or group strengths and abilities that can be used in new and different ways to enhance performance, feel better about the self, ensure smooth life transitions, deal with challenges, achieve , become more successful, and improve the overall quality of one’s personal and professional life. There are several different types of coaches, such as executive coaches, health coaches, and personal life coaches. is used in schools, business organizations, performance venues, and individual counseling programs. For instance, a health coach at a worksite wellness program may provide individual and group weight control counseling to employees and provide them with the skills and they need to improve their health and set goals to maintain a healthier lifestyle. Coaching makes use of positive resources, such as hope, , and , all of which improve job satisfaction, performance, and dedication in the workplace. A coach is as much a mentor as a therapist. Most coaching is short-term and consists of straightforward, supportive, solution-based counseling. With the right coach, you will be able to explore ways to alleviate , cope with challenges, survive transitions, and make more positive choices in your personal or professional life. Coaching styles may vary, depending on the type of coaching required, and whether you are involved in private or group coaching. For instance, a worksite coaching program may include both individual counseling and group activities that emphasize the needs of the organization as well as those of the individual within the group. The theory behind coaching is simple: Focusing on inherent strengths helps clients actively express themselves and leads to a more authentic, motivated, and invigorated life of achievement and success. A systematic review of studies, published in the International Coaching Psychology Review, identified five key factors that determine the effectiveness of a positive coaching relationship. These include: 2) The coach’s understanding and ability to manage a client’s emotional responses and problems with 4) The coach’s ability to facilitate and help client’s learning and development to reach goals Because coaching, per se, is an unregulated field—meaning there are no official minimum requirements to become a coach and no certification or licensing requirements—anyone can use the title and practice coaching. Unlicensed coaches may base their practice and advice on their own personal experience. At the same time, many licensed therapists, clinical social workers, and licensed professional counselors are now involved in executive coaching, health coaching, performance coaching, and life coaching, as well as in training other mental health professionals through various methods to become coaches in specific fields. A trained mental health professional has the advantage of an in, and broad understanding of, human behavior as well as the clinical experience required by the profession. Coaches with various educational and experiential backgrounds are certified at the associate, professional, and master level by the International Coach Federation. Coaches may also be licensed by the American Counseling Association. In addition to finding someone with the credentials and experience relevant to your needs, it is important to find someone who provides a counseling environment in which you feel safe and comfortable.

A new theory aims to make sense of it all. 7 Gaslighting Phrases Used to Confuse and Control Do You Often Feel Disappointed in Your Relationship?  >  Expressive arts therapy combines psychology and the creative process to promote emotional growth and healing. This multi-arts, or intermodal, approach to and counseling uses our inborn desire to create—be it music, theater, poetry, dance, or other artistic form—as a therapeutic tool to help initiate change. The difference between expressive arts therapy and art therapy is that expressive arts therapy draws from a variety of art forms, while art therapy tends to be based on one particular art form. Expressive arts is used with children and adults, as individuals or in groups, to nurture deep personal growth and transformation. For instance, expressive arts therapy for children with behavioral issues might include music, movement, or finger painting. The therapist observes the child’s processes, behavior, and impulses, and then encourages the child to talk about the experience. Journaling, storytelling, reading literature and poetry, and making life maps, videos, and books are all forms of expressive art therapy that can help older clients review and make meaning of their lives, and to tell their life story, as well as help them engage with family and other significant people in their lives. In expressive arts therapy, you use multiple senses to explore your inner and outer world through the experience and creation of different art forms. Your therapist or counselor helps you communicate your feelings about the process and accomplishment of art making, and together, you use the creative process to highlight and analyze your problems and issues. Since the therapeutic work is based on the creative process, not on the final result, it is not necessary to have a background or training in the arts to benefit from expressive arts therapy. Throughout the process, you learn new and different ways to use the mostly nonverbal language of to communicate inner feelings that were not previously available to you by simply thinking or talking about them. At the core of expressive arts therapy is the concept of poiesis, a Greek word that is the root of the word poetry, which refers to the natural process of moving from everyday expectations into the world of and creativity that results in art making. Because art comes from a deep emotional place inside you, creative endeavors enable you to undergo a profound process of self-discovery and understanding. Creativity becomes the pathway to the expression of inner feelings, leading to a process of self-discovery and understanding. In other words, your creative process becomes your road to emotional health. What to Look for in an Expressive Arts Therapist Psychotherapists, counselors, and teachers with standard qualifications may use some form of creative arts therapy in their work, but only those with specific training can be registered by the International Expressive Arts Therapy Association (IEATA) and call themselves expressive arts therapists. Registration by the IEATA requires a minimum of a Master’s degree in expressive arts therapy, psychology, fine arts, , or a related field and, depending on the educational background, supervised clinical work and advanced training at an approved expressive arts therapy institute, along with references and other requirements. Qualified and registered expressive arts therapists agree to a code of and to maintaining high standards of professionalism in the field. Caldwell R.

An Attitude of Gratitude: Why Saying ""I Am Grateful"" Matters AI Gains Social Intelligence; Infers Goals and Failed Plans How Visualizing ""Hoped-for Future Selves"" May Affect Destiny 10 Tips for Turning Procrastination into Precrastination Why Some People Don’t Seek Mental Health Services The terms ""creative,"" ""creativity,"" and ""creation"" are often used to apply to making something different, unusual, and pleasant—rather than meaningful art, literature, and science. The emotional basis of creativity in science, art, and other fields involves strong motivation to create—to produce an entity, theory, or perspective that is both new and valuable. Rembrandt created a genre of self-portraiture, which are masterful works of creativity. The theory of natural selection was proposed by Wallace and Darwin, influenced by divergent social attitudes. A new theory is based on the genome. Both patients and therapists are oriented to, and engaged in, facilitating creation. Psychotherapy is a mutual creative process involving both therapist and patient that produces beneficial change in the patient. Together with his son Walter, Nobel laureate Luis Alvarez developed the widely accepted and validated theory of the complete extinction of dinosaurs on earth. Although poetry writing by schizophrenic adolescents can be disruptive and inappropriate, correcting conceptual difficulties can be beneficial for mental illness and literature. A psychological test with female executives and an intensive interview with a female Nobel laureate shows orientation and capacity for creative cognition. Humorous remarks are sometimes considered denigrating or hostile but the use of thoughtful and meaningful use of humor by the therapist can be both facilitative and comforting. Psychotherapy is a mutual creative process producing effective change in the patient's self and behavior. The therapist uses the homospatial process for metaphor and empathy. Are Brilliance and Genius Often Associated with Disturbance? There is a long tradition linking brilliance, genius, and creativity with mental disorders, but the connection is refuted by experimental and intensive interview research. People suffering from OCD are often secretive about their symptoms, which makes it more difficult for them to receive key treatments. Inspiration, Insight, and the Literary Creative Process Although inspiration appears to be a matter of psychological insight, the two phenomena differ radically in the literary creative process. The Unconscious is not simply not-consciousness but is a repository of socially and personally unacceptable concepts and feelings which do not generate creative art or science.

Why College Prestige Matters and Why It Shouldn't Courage to Think the Unthinkable: The Pandemic Might Get Worse How to Find Empathy for People You Don’t Understand Is Long-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Worthwhile? Some proponents argue that long-term therapy does more than reduce symptoms or resolve problems like or , it transforms peoples' lives. himself actually entertained doubts about this, arguing ´One has the impression that one ought not to be surprised if it should turn out in the end that the difference between a person who has not been analyzed and the behavior of a person after he has been analyzed is not so thorough-going as we aim at making it and as we expect and maintain it to be´ (Freud, 1937/1961) Some patients in LTPP are seeking a long term trusting relationship. Therapy is the purchase of a special kind of , and consenting adults should be free to spend their time and money in this way. However, there is a growing clamor from advocates of long term therapy for insurance reimbursement in a time of a need to contain escalating health care costs. So, issues have to be raised whether psychodynamic psychotherapy is worth reimbursing. After all, most people will not seek such long-term treatment, even if it is reimbursed, and so it becomes a potentially costly burden on those who do not want it. But there is the more important issue of comparative effectiveness. There is a wealth of evidence that some forms of psychotherapy work for some conditions, like exposure therapy for posttraumatic disorder or cognitive behavior therapy for depression. Such treatments are typically shorter-term and have fewer sessions and are therefore cheaper than LTPP. Can we justify the cost of long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy when there is evidence that shorter-term less expensive therapies work and maybe even be better? Professor Leichsenring is a passionate advocate of LTPP and these two papers were published in the context of his effort to lobby for reimbursement of LTPP by German insurance companies which had previously rejected reimbursement. The reasoning for not reimbursing LTPP was a lack of evidence that LTPP is as effective or more effective than psychotherapies that were already deemed evidence-based and therefore reimbursed. Leichsenring's advocacy gives the appearance of a potential conflict of interest, so that doubts could be raised whether he was providing an objective assessment. In the spirit of promoting post-publication review and debate, I submitted some of my concerns as a Rapid Response to and they have now been posted at the website. To watch for the likely response from Professor Leichsenring, you can create A new meta-analysis of the efficacy of LTPP has appeared in the March 2012 of . The can be accessed here and the full paper is available by e-mailing the senor author, Professor Arnoud Arntz, . I am quite impressed with this paper, not only as a thorough review of the best evidence, but as an example of exceptionally well done and well reported meta-analysis. The article provides exquisitely detailed specification of the research question; the search strategies used to identify studies; the studies that were included and excluded; how studies were evaluated and the strengths and weaknesses that were found; and the overall effect sizes that were obtained. The quality of this review should not be surprising because one of the authors, Professor is one of the most eminent methodologists and meta-analysts in the world. I encourage people who want to learn more about meta-analyses to evaluate this paper using readily . I wish I could find more such commendable models of a meta analysis of the efficacy of a psychotherapy in the literature, but I cannot. If anyone can find any that even come close, do let me know. The authors defined LTPP as having at least 40 sessions and continuing for at least one year. This different from Leichsenring and Rabung's requirement of at least 50 sessions, but the authors noted that weekly sessions may result in a total of less than 50 sessions in a year, allowing for patients´and therapists´ vacations and missed sessions.The authors struggled with the poor quality of the studies they were able to identify, but came up with an excellent solution. The meta-analysis was conducted with each of the poor quality studies included and then again with each of these studies excluded. As it turned out, whether the studies were included did not influence the results. Results were unambiguous and negative, in terms of the efficacy of LTPP: The recovery rate of various mental disorders was equal after LTPP or various control treatments, including treatments without a specialized psychotherapy component. Similarly, no statistically significant differences were found for the domains target problems, general problems, pathology, social functioning, overall effectiveness or quality of life. The bottom line is that available evidence suggests that LTPP is not worthwhile, at least in terms of the conventional ways of evaluating therapies. The authors noted that many of the studies made comparisons between LTPP and a control condition, which is inappropriate if the critical question is whether LTPP is superior to other psychotherapies. Control conditions were heterogeneous and frequently of low quality, e.. without a specialized psychotherapy component. If anything, this suggests that LTPP is often compared against relatively ineffective ""straw man"" comparator... LTPP comparisons to specialized non-psychodynamic treatments, like and schema-focused therapy, suggest that LTPP might not be particularly effective. All of the studies were conducted by advocates of LTPP and that makes all the more surprising the uniformity of the negative results. After all, investigator allegiance is typically a strong predictor of the outcome of a clinical trial evaluating a psychotherapy. You can better guess the outcome of a clinical trial evaluating a psychotherapy from the allegiance of the investigator than you can from the therapy being evaluated. Although I am greatly impressed with this meta-analysis, I have doubts about the adequacy of the authors' proposal for evaluations of LTPP versus other evidence-based therapies. Future studies should compare LTPP to other highly specialized treatments that are equally intensive, like state-of-the art cognitive behaviour therapy in case of , or schema-focused therapy or dialectical behaviour therapy in case of . If we have the specific research question of whether LTPP is superior to evidence-based treatments for or borderline personality, such a comparative study would be useful and feasible. But most patients in LTPP do not have eating disorders or borderline . Many patients receiving LTPP, like some of the patients in the studies that these meta-analyses evaluated, are simply or have mixed anxiety and depression. Psychodynamic psychotherapists are strongly inclined to see all patients as needing long-term treatment, regardless of diagnosis, although few therapists of other orientation would agree. If someone were to design a clinical trial examining the efficacy of treatment for the more typical patient seen in LTPP with 40 sessions or one-year duration of treatment, I doubt that many therapists practicing a comparison evidence-based treatment would want to commit to the necessity of their patients continuing for this length of time. And unless the therapy were provided free, I doubt that many patients would consent to randomization and be retained. So maybe we won't be seeing anytime soon decisive evaluations of the efficacy of LTPP for the patients typically being recruited to it. Be sure to read the following responses to this post by our bloggers: Oops! Another Flawed Report on Long-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy is a reply by Jared DeFife Ph.D. Submitted by on January 14, 2012 - 4:54pm It seems to me that the biggest problem in researching so-called ""long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy"" is less statistical than practical. How do we define ""psychodynamic psychotherapy""? Certainly not as follows: ""The authors defined LTPP as having at least 40 sessions and continuing for at least one year."" The problem is that what we call psychodynamic psychotherapy varies immensely from practitioner to practitioner, and even from case to case. So what are we really measuring? Certainly, psychodynamic psychotherapy should not be defined on duration alone. A psychodynamic approach can be taken in brief, time-limited treatment too (much less than 40 sessions). Simply seeing a patient for 40-50 sessions per year for a couple of years does not define psychodynamic psychotherapy. Psychotherapy cannot be defined by frequency or duration of sessions, but rather by what takes place in the consulting room. What exactly is going on in those sessions? Are the psychotherapists inclined more to Freud, Jung, Rank, Adler, etc.? Are they psychoanalysts? Are they ""pure"" psychodynamic practitioners, or do they eclectically weave in existential or other orientations as well. (For example, I practice what I call ""existential depth psychology."") My point is that, especially when it comes to depth psychology or psychodynamic psychotherapy, there is no one standardized approach to it. What the psychotherapist brings to the table is crucial, and varies tremendously from clinician to clinician. So where is the reliability in such studies? I believe we would need a much more detailed and sophisticated definition of psychodynamic psychotherapy applied in order to meaningfully measure its efficacy as compared to other treatment approaches. Submitted by Jeff G. on January 18, 2012 - 3:36pm I don't believe that was the only definition of of LTPP used. I believe the 40 sessions/yr was just describing dosage, not the technique. The LTPPs studied by Leichsenring would be considered psychodynamic/psychoanalytic therapy or psychoanalysis. I do agree that even in that spectrum there is huge variation. A common problem with psychodynamic psychotherapy researches is that researchers (often psychodynamic oriented clinicians themselves) do not specify what counts as part of their technique or even organizing/guiding principles. However, as a review of effectiveness research , I think it is fine to not be specific about what constitutes psychodynamic therapy, because real world clinicans aren't. So a broad definition or lack of strong definition may be appropriate because when people seek psychodynamic therapy, there could be a lot of difference between clinicians and the techniques could vary wildly, and there is not a good way for clients to determine what they might experience. Submitted by melissa on January 14, 2012 - 8:49pm The discussion in the blog is largely made on the basis of one study, granted it was a meta analysis, however one study none the less. A criticism of one study does not an argument make. I also think the mantra of psychology lately is CBT and meds, CBT and meds, CBT and meds. We are quick to be critical of the cost of talk therapy, but we are not so quick to ask the unpopular questions about the drawbacks of medicating so many people. Finally, because of the popularity of CBT/meds many studies focus on researching this intervention. Far fewer studies focus on LTPP than other methods of treatment. A lack of evidence because an intervention is not often studied is not the same as a method being ineffective. I am tired of arguments that focus on costs while insurance and pharmaceutical profits soar. Submitted by Anonymous on January 15, 2012 - 12:29am I think the jury is still out, epidemiologically, on the efficacy of long term therapy. The study that begs to be done is to compare a control group of folks on a therapy wait list, to a group of people who simply talked for an hour a week for a year with an untrained person called ""therapist"", to a group who talked for an hour a week for a year with a trained person called ""therapist."" Submitted by Richard A. Lawhern, Ph.D. on November 17, 2014 - 4:28pm How easily we forget. The jury is by no means ""out"" on this issue. The study that Anonymous suggests has already been done several times, as far back as the 1950s. A number of these efforts were summarized and referenced by Martin Gross, in his book ""The Psychological Society -- the impact and the failure of psychiatry, psychotherapy, psychoanalysis and the psychological revolution"" (Random House, 1978). These studies analyzed outcomes for two cohorts of people. The therapy group were admitted to resident facilities and treated six months for moderate to severe depression, using Freudian and Adlerian therapy in both individual and group sessions. The control group were wait listed for admission to resident beds. At the end of six months about half of both groups reported feeling that their depression had improved. There were no statistical differences between therapy and control groups, and no evidence of differences between types of therapy or the setting of therapy delivered. Results such as this appear to have been an element in the move toward medication therapies and the rejection of classical psychotherapy as ineffective. There are clearly problems with the medication and ""disordered brain chemistry"" models, but it is quite appropriate to doubt the effectiveness of so-called ""psycho-dynamic"" therapy delivered over periods of several weeks, even to people housed and treated in highly controlled and supportive environments.

This, I feel, is the case on both sides of this argument (CBT and non-CBT researchers). Submitted by Robert M. Gordon on January 15, 2012 - 2:57pm Behaviorism and Cognitive Behavior Therapists have long attacked the usefulness of the therapeutic relationship and insight, and often use biased research to support their anti-psychodynamic claims. They will argue that psychodynamic theory and treatment (which includes not just behaviors and cognitions, but also feelings, development, history, family dynamics, traumas and the unconscious) is not scientifically supported. When there is scientific support, they claim that it is flawed science. Sometimes studies do warrant concern, but the methodological concerns are true of most outcome research, or as in this criticism- it is a false claim. Falk Leichsenring and Sven Rabung have responded in the professional journals that the criticisms are unfair and based on a mis-reading of their work. And even when they did re-analyze the data in the manner suggested, they got similar results (as expected). People who are bright but not psychologically minded will always be threatened by psychodynamic insights. See my article: http://www.mmpi-info.com/psychology-publications/scientific-renaissance-of-pdt.html Submitted by Jeff G. on January 23, 2012 - 3:26pm I don't have the original paper or the reanalysis handy, but if I remember correctly, their reanalysis did not find similar results. They still found positive results, on par with other psychotherapeutic techniques, but far smaller than their unrealistic first results. Additionally, even in their reanalysis, much of the criticism went unaddressed, making their reanalysis still suspect. I believe that Dr. Coyne coauthored a letter addressing continued concerns with the reanalysis. As to your title that I believe suggest criticism of recent psychodynamic therapy research is just defensive and your last line that such critics are not psychologically minded and are threatened by insight, I don't know how to reasonably respond in a way that could disagree with your view, especially when such assertions are coupled with claims that the criticism is biased. Any retort may just be seen as a defensive move, even this one that tries to illustrate how such assertions make discussion difficult. I just don't understand how being bright and not psychologically minded always leads people to be threatened by insight. Maybe I'm not that bright.

Submitted by Anonymous Consumer on January 25, 2012 - 12:53am I'm responding as a layperson, offering my insight as a long-term consumer of various psychological/psychiatric services over the course of my adult life. I have been exposed to psychodynamic therapies, CBT/DBT, a multitude of medications and, most recently, ECT. I have suffered from depression since the age of fifteen, and although I went through more than a decade of inpatient hospitalizations, I'm grateful that I am now a successful professional. I don't have a particular allegiance to psychodynamic therapy, but I must say that the obsession with immediate symptom-resolution is misguided. In fact, the few fantastic longer-term therapeutic relationships I've had helped me maintain at ""baseline,"" often during periods when I was in grave danger of getting progressively worse. When I was engaged with these therapists (most of whom I would categorize as eclectic), the fact that I refrained from destructive behavior for periods of time was a great form of progress; although my symptoms, per se, may not have been greatly alleviated. The most (and I don't say this lightly) destructive evidence-based modality I've been in engaged in is Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. I languished for years, not getting better, and eventually got worse. The focus on simply teaching skills in a didactic manner and reviewing a mood chart in individual sessions was, for me, barely useful. My questions: when is the relationship itself, in fact, the curative factor? Why only seek to match diagnoses with therapeutic modalities when, it seems to me, learning and personality styles may be equally or more important? And, for those of us who have many years of major psychiatric problems, when is focusing on maintenance a worthy-enough endeavor? The other problem I've seen is the artificial binary between medication and psychotherapy. I recently (this week)tried ECT and after two sessions, have begun to feel better for the first time in years. I've been to some of the best psychiatric institutions in New York, and this was never offered: it was medication after medication, and CBT/DBT. I don't doubt that CBT/DBT can be highly effective, but for whom and for what reasons? I'm definitely an advocate of longer-term therapy. Maintaining the ""status-quo"" rather than decompensating is a worthy-enough reason for me to advocate for this. And I have found a wonderful therapist who employs some CBT techniques, but it's the relationship itself which has been quite curative so far. Those of us who are lucky enough to have been able to engage in effective longer-term therapies (and I'm not talking about the worried well) need to continue to speak up.

Submitted by Anonymous on May 1, 2012 - 9:58am Hi, I appreciate this discussion. I think it's great. I did re-look at my initial comments, but I don't think I ever said the ter ""status quo."" What I was attempting to hint at was the absolute benefit I received from SOME effective therapist you helped me maintain prevent DECOMPENSATION. I don't think we can expect our therapist to always ""cure"" us much in the same way wouldn't expect a PCP to cure us--there's much value in emphasizing long-term prevention strategies. I do believe part of that are effective I, THOU THERAPEUTIC relationships, not run-of-mill friendships. There is research to support this and I can dig it up. For this suffering gentleman, symptom management was wholly insufficient--useful, but ultimately just not enough. I was a severe cutter, suicidally depressed, at once diagnosed with good ole borderline personality, and landed in dialectical behavioral therapy at one of the best hospitals in the country. Two years later, I attempted suicide, ended up in the ICU in a medicated coma, thoroughly hallucinating--not a good prognosis indeed. Since then, I found good therapeutic relation-based therapists with some great results: some part my responsibility, some the effect of the modality. It indeed worked!--to a point. I've accomplished wonderful things beyond my wildest dreams after being on track for SSDI: an MFA from an ivy league graduate program, an actual career as a nonprofit grant-writer at one of the most successful nonprofits in the country, fantastic private health insurance, a brilliant psychotherapist and psychiatrist, and a healthy disposition. Yet, there the severe depression lingers and I find myself in outpatient ECT. Yet, I have a therapeutic support system, emotional skills and maturity to handle it (sort of) and the will to live. I no longer cut drink, and my first literary novel comes out in august from a patient who once had borderline personality disorder, had a near successful suicide attempt, and hated life. I credit meds, talented therapists, and me. I'm not perfect, and suffer greatly at times, but as an intelligent and suffering consumer, I can't say enough about long-term, talented, therapeutically-relationship based therapy to give patients the time and room to survive. Submitted by Anonymous on May 2, 2012 - 8:55pm I am the person who posted ""From a consumer of LTPP."" For me, long-term therapy has not constituted the purchase of a friendship. It is very different from a friendship. Based on your comment I think that unforunately your experience with LTPP is that it was simply the purchase of a friendship but that is not my experience. I never stated that the goal (or result) I have had with LTPP is or was about ""maintaining baseline."" Even if that were all it was, that is a huge improvement from committing suicide, living in a hospital, and having my illnesses (depression, addiction and PTSD) determine what I will accomplish in my life. Baseline for me prior to LTPP was being suicidal and drunk. I don't have any friends who have expertise in addiction treatment (there is a whole lot more to it than just stopping drinking or using), significant knowledge and experience in treating depression, or how to help someone with PTSD. I'm not rich either but my life is so much richer because of therapy. Therapy is a solution, but it is not a quick fix. It is hard work. It has had long lasting effects on how I think about things and how I react to situations, and that continues to improve. It is a process of change and in essence of ""re-wiring"" my brain. Submitted by Anonymous on December 3, 2013 - 2:30pm Your assumptions about CBT are incorrect. Please learn about the philosophy of the therapy. Why would you want to be in therapy longer when research shows it is ineffective? You sound like you watch too many movies and have an unrealistic view of how therapy really works. Submitted by Anonymous on April 28, 2012 - 12:39am I have been in LTPP for eleven years. Some people would think that this is ridiculous and a waste of money. For me, though, it has saved my life. I started therapy at a time when I was addicted to alcohol and drugs. I was 23 years old. I had been suffering from severe recurrent (nearly constant) depression since I was 12 years old. I started medication when I was 17 years old just prior to spending 6 weeks in a psychiatric hospital. I had PTSD and had previously had an eating disorder. Because of LTPP I have managed to stay sober for nearly 10 of the past 11 years, I have stopped other self-destructive things like cutting myself, I have not returned to disordered eating (had a problem for a short time after stopping drinking and drugs but was able to stop),and have become consistently less depressed. I still have difficulties with relationships and problems related to the PTSD and depression but with my therapist I am working on those, and am getting better. I have been able to complete college and work professionally. I live independently and pay my rent every month. For me, the cost of LTPP is more than worth it. I am living a life that I did not believe to be possible - one in which I am not constantly in distress and trying to seek a way to escape or contemplating suicide. My life is not constantly ruled by depression and addiction and PTSD. I have been on 26 medications over the years and none of them have been as effective in helping me change my thinking and behavior and brought me the peace that LTPP has. LTPP does not cause side effects like insomnia, loss of appetite, difficulty concentrating, drowsiness, liver damage, etc. that medication causes. I have had insurance companies that hardly pay anything for psychotherapy so I have gone into debt in order to pay my therapist - I only have done this because I truly feel that it is necessary for me. I think it must be very hard for researchers to measure effectiveness of LTPP in comparison to CBT (or some other therapy). For starters, you have the problem of every person being unique. You can't take 10 people diagnosed with severe depression and have them all respond the same exact way to medication so how do you think that all 10 people will respond the same way to LTPP or another therapy? Each person has a different life story. One therapist might be a good match for one person but not a good match for someone else. It is so hard to measure something when there are so many variables. Submitted by RelevanceConsidered on May 12, 2013 - 10:05pm The idea of LTPP is so broad and undefined in this article (and the associated meta-analyses, on both sides) that it is difficult to find the ""meaning"" in it--to draw any serious conclusions about the efficacy of these different therapies would be a rather frivolous undertaking (which is precisely what the article sets out to provide). Here are some relevant questions: what does the patient who is entering ""LTPP"" set out to do? Probably they don't set out to score higher on some self-report measure of overt symptomatology, though perhaps I am mistaken about that. What is the ideal outcome of mental health treatment? Perhaps to score higher on a self-report measure of overt symptomatology than at pre-treatment. I don't think everyone should go through long-term treatment, and I fully believe that a great many persons benefit from short-term CBT/manualized treatments--are humans not so varied, so different, that they might benefit from very individualized/varied therapeutic experiences? Shocking Submitted by Discussant on November 25, 2013 - 10:54pm Thank you for having the courage to take an honest, scientific approach, and to blow the whistle on an ineffective, potentially harmful, time and money-wasting scam (psychodynamic psychotherapy). The world would be a better place if more researchers had this kind of integrity, and allegiance to transparency and discovering the truth rather than promoting a profitable agenda. Submitted by Anonymous on December 3, 2013 - 2:22pm The next step is to prohibit licensed mental health professionals from using this unethical approach. People who use this method need to lose their licenses. Submitted by TBond on January 3, 2014 - 10:53am You wrote, ""Psychodynamic psychotherapists are strongly inclined to see all patients as needing long-term treatment . . ."" Do you have documentation for this statement? Psychodynamic psychotherapists are strongly inclined to see all patients as needing long-term treatment Submitted by James C. Coyne Ph.D. on January 3, 2014 - 11:09am Yes, psychodynamic therapy goes on much longer than evidence based therapies for the same conditions, often with poorer results. See for instance.-- A Randomized Controlled Trial of Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy or Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Bulimia Nervosa Stig Poulsen, Ph.D.; Susanne Lunn, M.Sc.; Sarah I. F. Daniel, Ph.D.; Sofie Folke, M.Sc.; Birgit Bork Mathiesen, Ph.D.; Hannah Katznelson, M.Sc.; Christopher G. Fairburn, F.Med.Sci., F.R.C.Psych. Am J Psychiatry 2014;171:109-116. And ""Results were unambiguous and negative, in terms of the efficacy of LTPP: The recovery rate of various mental disorders was equal after LTPP or various control treatments, including treatments without a specialized psychotherapy component. Similarly, no statistically significant differences were found for the domains target problems, general psychiatric problems, personality pathology, social functioning, overall effectiveness or quality of life. The bottom line is that available evidence suggests that LTPP is not worthwhile, at least in terms of the conventional ways of evaluating therapies."" I don't think the excerpt you give here supports your thesis that the efficacy of LTPP is so low as to make it ""not worthwhile."" I also found this part of the article confusing--it seems strongly to imply that LTPP does not work at all, even though the study seems to be saying that it is EQUALLY EFFICACIOUS as other forms of therapy. For LTPP to be completely ineffectual, all the other therapies would have to be ineffectual, too, and I don't think that's what either you or the studies' authors are saying. They're saying it's pretty much the same as all the other therapies, and YOU are the one making the conclusion that, therefore, it is ""not worthwhile""--presumably because of the extended costs in money and time. Is that what you meant by ""the conventional ways of evaluating therapies?"" If so, that was really misleading. I seriously thought you were saying ""LTPP doesn't work,"" not that ""Other therapies are just as efficacious as LTPP and much faster and cheaper to boot,"" which is a very different thesis and one that many patients might consider ""worthwhile"" for themselves for any number of subjective reasons. Since I was already inclined to think LTPP was a bad choice, this lack of clarity played on my existing bias in a way that I don't appreciate at all. I want my information spelled out in a way that is very difficult to misinterpret regardless of bias, and I think that's one of the most important services an informed and discerning science writer can provide to the public.

Courage to Think the Unthinkable: The Pandemic Might Get Worse How to Find Empathy for People You Don’t Understand  >  Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy EMDR is a unique, nontraditional form of designed to diminish negative feelings associated with memories of events. Unlike most forms of talk therapy, EMDR focuses less on the traumatic event itself and more on the disturbing emotions and symptoms that result from the event. Treatment includes a hand motion technique used by the therapist to guide the client’s eye movements from side to side, similar to watching a pendulum swing. EMDR is a controversial intervention, because it is unclear exactly how it works, with some psychologists claiming it does not work. Some studies have shown, however, that EMDR is effective for treating certain mental-health conditions. EMDR was originally developed to treat the symptoms of post- stress disorder, , and phobias. Some therapists also use EMDR to treat , eating disorders, schizophrenia, dysfunction, and stress caused by chronic disease. Why Are Deepak Chopra & EMDR Important for Science and Life? In the early stages of , you will discuss your problems and symptoms with your therapist, but you won’t necessarily have to reveal all the details of your traumatic experience(s). Instead, your therapist will help you focus on related negative thoughts and feelings that you are still experiencing, and decide which of these beliefs are still relevant and which ones you would like to replace with positive thoughts and beliefs. You will learn techniques to help you deal with disturbing feelings. Your therapist will then guide you through a process known as desensitization. While keeping the of a painful or traumatic event in mind, you will follow the therapist’s back-and-forth finger movements with your eyes. The purpose of this technique is to help you fully process your negative feelings and begin to recognize that you no longer need to hold on to some of them. Future sessions are devoted to reinforcing and strengthening positive feelings and beliefs until you get to a point where you can bring up memories of the traumatic event without experiencing the negativity that brought you to therapy in the first place. The goal of EMDR is to fully process past experiences and sort out the emotions attached to those experiences. Negative thoughts and feelings that are no longer useful are replaced with positive thoughts and feelings that will encourage healthier behavior and social interactions. Ultimately, clients learn to handle situations themselves. EMDR therapy occurs in eight phases: 2) Preparation, to establish trust and explain the treatment in-depth 3) Assessment, to establish negative feelings and identify positive replacements 4) Desensitization, which includes the eye movement technique 5) Installation, to strengthen positive replacements 6) Body scan, to see if the client is now able to bring up memories of trauma without experiencing negative feelings that are no longer relevant, or if reprocessing is necessary 7) Closure, which occurs at the end of every session 8) Re-evaluation, which occurs at the beginning of every session What to Look for in an EMDR Therapist Look for a licensed, experienced therapist, social worker, professional counselor or other mental-health professional with additional training and certification in EMDR. The EMDR International Association is one source of credentialing. In addition, it is important to find a therapist with whom you feel comfortable working. .

Coaching is specific and goal-oriented. Like sports coaching, psychological coaching concentrates on individual or group strengths and abilities that can be used in new and different ways to enhance performance, feel better about the self, ensure smooth life transitions, deal with challenges, achieve , become more successful, and improve the overall quality of one’s personal and professional life. There are several different types of coaches, such as executive coaches, health coaches, and personal life coaches. is used in schools, business organizations, performance venues, and individual counseling programs. For instance, a health coach at a worksite wellness program may provide individual and group weight control counseling to employees and provide them with the skills and they need to improve their health and set goals to maintain a healthier lifestyle. Coaching makes use of positive resources, such as hope, , and , all of which improve job satisfaction, performance, and dedication in the workplace. A coach is as much a mentor as a therapist. Most coaching is short-term and consists of straightforward, supportive, solution-based counseling. With the right coach, you will be able to explore ways to alleviate , cope with challenges, survive transitions, and make more positive choices in your personal or professional life. Coaching styles may vary, depending on the type of coaching required, and whether you are involved in private or group coaching. For instance, a worksite coaching program may include both individual counseling and group activities that emphasize the needs of the organization as well as those of the individual within the group. The theory behind coaching is simple: Focusing on inherent strengths helps clients actively express themselves and leads to a more authentic, motivated, and invigorated life of achievement and success. A systematic review of studies, published in the International Coaching Psychology Review, identified five key factors that determine the effectiveness of a positive coaching relationship. These include: 2) The coach’s understanding and ability to manage a client’s emotional responses and problems with 4) The coach’s ability to facilitate and help client’s learning and development to reach goals Because coaching, per se, is an unregulated field—meaning there are no official minimum requirements to become a coach and no certification or licensing requirements—anyone can use the title and practice coaching. Unlicensed coaches may base their practice and advice on their own personal experience. At the same time, many licensed therapists, clinical social workers, and licensed professional counselors are now involved in executive coaching, health coaching, performance coaching, and life coaching, as well as in training other mental health professionals through various methods to become coaches in specific fields. A trained mental health professional has the advantage of an in, and broad understanding of, human behavior as well as the clinical experience required by the profession. Coaches with various educational and experiential backgrounds are certified at the associate, professional, and master level by the International Coach Federation. Coaches may also be licensed by the American Counseling Association. In addition to finding someone with the credentials and experience relevant to your needs, it is important to find someone who provides a counseling environment in which you feel safe and comfortable.

The Gender Gap in Negotiation May Start Very Young What Is Your ""Style"" For Dealing With Conflict At Work? Why College Prestige Matters and Why It Shouldn't Courage to Think the Unthinkable: The Pandemic Might Get Worse How to Find Empathy for People You Don’t Understand The three crucial elements all effective psychotherapies have in common. Given all the different approaches to available today, the obvious question is: Which of them works best? The startling answer, based on decades of research, is that they are all about equally effective. This is a puzzle, as so many approaches are so vastly different from each other in their views of humankind, their assumptions of how psychological problems arise, and their methods of treatment. This was reflected in a prior post, "","" which made clear that two very different approaches to couple treatment were equally effective. If many therapy approaches are so different, yet the majority are equally effective, what active ingredients do they share? Not to get ahead of ourselves, let's first take a look at a recent summary of the literature on just how effective psychotherapy is, and generally what works as they are effective. Wampold and Imel (2015), confirmed a set of things they said, “We know for sure” or are relatively sure about regarding the effects of psychotherapy. They conclude that: The effects of psychotherapy are greater than the effects of many medical practices, including flu vaccines, most interventions in cardiology, and treatments for asthma, some of which are very expensive and have significant side effects. Psychotherapy is as effective as for most mental disorders, without the side effects. As well, psychotherapy is longer lasting than medications (lower rates after treatment is discontinued) and is less resistant to additional courses of treatment. Therapists in practice achieve outcomes comparable to those achieved in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Indeed, they seem to achieve the same benefits, in fewer sessions, then in clinical trials. Factors, such as the working alliance, empathy, expectations, psychoeducation about the disorder, and other so-called “common factors” are robustly related to outcome. Moreover, and importantly, those therapists who can form an alliance with a range of patients, have a sophisticated set of facilitative interpersonal skills, worry about their effectiveness, and make deliberate efforts to improve are the therapists who achieve better outcomes. Providing information about client progress to the therapist and the client improves the quality of psychotherapy, primarily by reducing the likelihood of treatment failures for clients not making expected progress. Monitoring client progress to improve the quality of services, which is often called practice-based evidence, is becoming more widely used. Adherence to a treatment protocol is not related to outcome. That is, therapists who adhere to what is expected in a treatment do not get better outcomes than therapists who deviate from the manual. Actually, it appears that therapists who, regardless of how the client responds, sticks to the treatment have poorer outcomes. It is those therapists who flexibly provide a treatment that achieve the best outcomes. It appears that “treatments” with no structure are less effective than treatments that have deliberate actions focused on the client’s problems. Therapists delivering non-structured treatments are not able to provide the client an explanation for his or her distress nor explain how the work the client does in therapy will help the client with his or her problems; two aspects of therapy that seem to be important for producing benefits. (Wampold & Imel, 2015). Recent research overviews suggest that there are 3 things all effective psychotherapies share A quick survey of major research summaries supports each of these critical components of therapy that works. Laska, Gurman, and Wampold, (2014) suggest the following overlapping elements underlay all effective psychotherapies: (a) an emotionally charged bondbetween the therapist and patient. (b) a confiding healing setting in which therapy takes place. (c) a therapist who provides a psychologically derived and culturally embedded explanation for emotional distress. (d) an explanation that is adaptive (provides viable and believable options for overcoming specific difficulties) and is (e) a set of procedures or rituals engaged by the patient and therapist that leads the patient to enact something that is positive, helpful, or adaptive. The last sentence in the above list suggests that there must be a set of procedures that ""leads the patient to enact something that is positive, helpful, or adaptive."" While this sounds nice, it remains broadly vague. What does adaptive mean, or more clearly, what is effective change? The major message of the book, Unifying Effective Psychotherapies: Tracing the Process of Change (Fraser, 2018), is that change across all therapies that work is a shift or reversal in problem patterns. This was summarized in two earlier posts. The first was titled, """" The second post titled, """" In essence, all approaches to psychotherapy view problems as vicious cycles of solution patterns, which turn back on themselves and only make our problems worse. What's more, these solution patterns inevitably make perfect sense to us. Therefore, it often feels like a risk to confront or shift our tried and true patterns, even in the face of their failure. In the face of the potential risk of doing something new to resolve our problems in psychotherapy, we thus need three interacting qualities in that treatment. A trusted and guide in a therapist who understands our plight and will be there to support us through our journey. Research suggests that this first element may account for as much as 60 to 80 percent of the influence toward positive change. A clear and understandable explanation for our dilemmas that makes senseto us and provides a clear rationale and related tasks toward resolution. Without a compelling explanation that is dynamically conveyed by our therapist, and rings true to us, the risky journey of change will remain tenuous. There is no shortage of different rationales for the wide array of effective treatments to choose from for this match. The bottom line is that match must , or make to us as clients. A clear target for change that acknowledges the vicious cycles of our ongoing failed solution patterns and aims to effectively reverse that cycle. Once the pattern is interrupted, then that shift is further supported and amplified. This key element of change in the way we have been trying to change our problem is the final key element of all psychotherapies that work. Without this final element of problem pattern reversal, no approach will work, no matter how venerable or apparently potent the approach may seem. No matter what approach to psychotherapy might be taken, unless the process of treatment includes the three common elements of a , and success is likely to be elusive. All therapies that work share these three crucial components.

The best fit works best! I'm glad for you. Thanks for your comment. Submitted by Fred on January 25, 2020 - 7:28am ""they are all about equally effective"" Simple logic would conclude either all the forms of therapy aren't significantly different or something common to all therapies, but not the therapy itself, has an effect, like having someone to listen to you or just the effort and hope inherent in going to therapy. ""Psychotherapy is remarkably effective."" Effective at what? No therapist, in their right mind, would use the C word--cure. They certainly don't cure psychosis and at best they can say they ""help"" with neurosis but only via a vague definition of neurosis. The need for a working alliance just supports the theory that therapy is paying for a friend to listen to you and that feels good. The therapy itself, and the therapist's education, is irrelevant. And, of course, there is no ""research"" on the effectiveness of psychotherapy. Depending on self-reporting from the patient and the therapist is not research. It's a survey. Submitted by on January 25, 2020 - 4:58pm I value your skepticism, Fred. That very skepticism fifty years ago fueled the extensive research on psychotherapy over the years. There have been a lot of smart people and fine methodologists engaged in that journey. It is their research that I have based my statements upon. Given your comments, I assume you will not classify yourself as a ""friend and advocate of psychotherapy."" You certainly may not ever seek out therapy yourself, and if you do, your skepticism will likely undercut your potential for gaining help. However, you may be interested in reading more of the extensive literature on the effectiveness of psychotherapy. I might suggest starting with the references in this article. If you are interested in more, I will be glad to point you in the right direction. In short, skepticism like yours is valuable. It drives all of our quests for answers. Thanks for your comment. Submitted by Fred on January 25, 2020 - 7:11pm That's the kind of psychobabble that pervades the profession and has found its way into corporate America. You ignored my words to suit your bias. Nothing I said was skeptical. Psychotherapists pose as professionals, even scientists, and charge accordingly, yet there is no evidence whatsoever that their education produces consistent or positive results. Is that not a scam? Again, simple logic would indicate that if all therapies were equally effective, than it ain't the therapy. Simple logic rarely finds its way into the religion of psychotherapy. And no thanks. I've had more than enough of Wampold and all the other shills for the APA. Submitted by on January 25, 2020 - 9:46pm Submitted by Fred on January 25, 2020 - 10:00pm As if all is subjective.

The problem is when I express dissatisfied while the therapist internalized objects is negative and therapists act like I am out to get them or crazy rather than this is probably the most important time you can help me by holding the space and falling back to methods. If therapists truly have cover of their domain, then they would not appear as detached, withholding and better than you attitude. But again... Hmmm transference.... It is double bind. Allow disobedience and noncompliance and use direct words when validating rather than as weapon so clients can understand cognitively ooh that is what validation is and I can give it to myself, it will seep into their unconscious. And disobedience and noncompliance will teach them they can say no in therapy.... They can say no at home. We tell them or teach them cooperation in therapy so therapist can feel safe but the client who cooperate in therapy.. Stays compliant to addiction, poor decisions and abusive relationships.

Courage to Think the Unthinkable: The Pandemic Might Get Worse  >  Jungian , sometimes known as Jungian analysis, is an in-depth, analytical form of talk therapy designed to bring together the conscious and parts of the mind to help a person feel balanced and whole. Jungian therapy calls for clients to delve into the deeper and often darker elements of their mind and look at the “real” self rather than the self they present to the outside world. Jungian can help improve the lives of those with , , , phobias, relationship or issues, low , or other emotional problems. It is also appropriate for anyone who wants a deeper understanding of themselves and is willing to make a commitment to the work involved in acquiring that knowledge. Jungian Analyst Marion Woodman on the American Psyche In addition to talking, your therapist may use various techniques, such as dream journaling and interpretation, and creative experiences likes art, movement, or music, to encourage self-expression and release your . Your therapist may also try word association tests, wherein the therapist says a specific word and records how long it takes you to respond with the first thing that comes to mind. Your response time can indicate emotions and issues you connect to certain words. Depending on your situation and the agreement you make with your therapist, you will meet for regularly scheduled sessions, one or more times a week. Originating in the work of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung early in the 20th century, Jungian therapy focuses more on the source of a problem than on the manifestations or symptoms. Jung believed that an individual’s repressed experiences and memories, in combination with what he called the “collective ,” or natural traits that affect everyone, result in an imbalance between conscious awareness and the unconscious mind that has a detrimental effect on one’s emotional life. In analysis, one must explore the deep-rooted causes of relationship problems and blocked emotions to achieve “individuation,” or wholeness. If one tries simply to relieve the symptoms, the issues will not be resolved and are bound to resurface. The success of Jungian analysis depends on the client’s commitment to regularly scheduled sessions and intense work. What to Look for in a Jungian Therapist A certified Jungian therapist is a licensed mental health professional who has completed advanced training in a program accredited by the International Association for Analytical Psychology (IAAP). In addition to checking training and credentials, be sure you are comfortable with the therapist you choose, and understand the therapeutic process as it is explained to you. David C.

Courage to Think the Unthinkable: The Pandemic Might Get Worse  >  Motivational interviewing is a counseling method that helps people resolve ambivalent feelings and insecurities to find the internal they need to change their behavior. It is a practical, , and short-term process that takes into consideration how difficult it is to make life changes. Motivational interviewing is often used to address and the of physical health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and asthma. This intervention helps people become motivated to change the behaviors that are preventing them from making healthier choices. It can also prepare individuals for further, more specific types of therapies. Research has shown that this intervention works well with individuals who start off unmotivated or unprepared for change. It is less useful for those who are already motivated to change. Motivational interviewing is also appropriate for people who are angry or hostile. They may not be ready to commit to change, but motivational interviewing can help them move through the emotional stages of change necessary to find their . In a supportive manner, a motivational interviewer encourages clients to talk about their need for change and their own reasons for wanting to change. The role of the interviewer is mainly to evoke a conversation about change and commitment. The interviewer listens and reflects back the client’s thoughts so that the client can hear their reasons and motivations expressed back to them. Motivational interviewing is generally short-term counseling that requires just one or two sessions, though it can also be included as an intervention along with other, longer-term therapies. Motivational interviewing evolved from Carl Roger’s person-centered, or client-centered, approach to counseling and , as a method to help people commit to the difficult process of change. The process is twofold. The first goal is to increase the person’s motivation and the second is for the person to make the commitment to change. As opposed to simply stating a need or desire to change, hearing themselves express a commitment out loud has been shown to help improve a client’s ability to actually make those changes. The role of the therapist is more about listening than intervening. Motivational interviewing is often combined or followed up with other interventions, such as cognitive therapy, support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and management training. What to Look for in a Motivational Interviewer Look for a licensed mental health professional who is and supportive as well as a good listener. Since motivational interviewing is a skill that improves with time, look for an interviewer with both formal training and experience. In addition to finding someone with the appropriate educational background and relevant experience, look for a motivational interviewer with whom you feel comfortable working.

Why the Internet Broke for Bernie Sanders' Mittens We Have Neanderthals to Thank for These Genetic Traits What Goes on Beneath the Surface When Narcissists Get Angry An Atheist Neuroscientist Finds Faith in Bipolar Mania 10 Tips for Turning Procrastination into Precrastination  >  Internal Family Systems (IFS) is an approach to that identifies and addresses multiple sub-personalities or families within each person’s mental system. These sub-personalities consist of wounded parts and painful emotions such as and , and parts that try to control and protect the person from the pain of the wounded parts. The sub-personalities are often in conflict with each other and with one’s core Self, a concept that describes the confident, compassionate, whole person that is at the core of every individual. IFS focuses on healing the wounded parts and restoring mental balance and harmony by changing the dynamics that create discord among the sub-personalities and the Self. IFS is used to treat individuals, couples, and families. It is an evidence-based approach that has been shown to be effective for treating a variety of conditions and their symptoms, such as , , phobias, panic, and physical health conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, as well as improving general functioning and well-being. IFS is talk therapy in which you work with a therapist to identify and understand the specific sub-personalities or families that make up your internal mental system. Once you identify these parts, the therapist will help you acknowledge your feelings about these suppressed emotions, learn how to release these feelings so you are freer to address the actual problem, and ultimately find more positive ways to manage conflicts on your own. The therapist may suggest certain tools to help you do this, such as relaxation exercises, , keeping a journal, and creating a chart that illustrates the relationship between Self and the different parts of you. IFS was developed in the 1990s by family therapist Richard Schwartz, Ph.D., who developed the concept of an undamaged core Self that is the essence of who you are, and identified three different types of sub-personalities or families that reside within each person, in addition to the Self. These include wounded and suppressed parts called exiles, protective parts called managers, that keep the exiled parts suppressed, and other protective parts called firefighters, that distract the Self from the pain of exiled parts when they are released. For example, an exiled part may be the and of earlier abuse, emotions that are suppressed by the manager, while the firefighter may be an or behavior such as overeating that distracts the client from facing and re-experiencing those uncomfortable emotions. These parts can be healed, transformed, and better managed by the Self by achieving the three of IFS: 3) Coordinate and harmonize the Self and the parts, so they can work together as a team with the Self in charge.

The intervention, which can be psychological, physical, or even pharmacological, may be led or guided by a professional interventionist or by friends or family members, with or without the help of a professional, depending on the circumstances. In some cases, an intervention takes the form of a confrontation or meeting between a person who is engaged in self-destructive behavior—and is resistant to help—and concerned friends or family members. In other cases, where individuals are not able to make decisions for themselves, an intervention is a decision to take action on their behalf. This method may not work for every person in need. Interventions can be applied to individuals and used in group settings, such as rehabilitation centers and treatment institutions. Intervention is a tool that may be used with people who have , borderline-, emotional problems, addictions, eating disorders, dangerous habits, or difficulty adhering to a schedule or other type of treatment. An intervention effort is often made to try to prevent people with known problems who cannot or will not help themselves from relapsing into undesirable behavior. Crisis intervention is used when someone is experiencing an immediate crisis, such as a threat or attempt. The Ten Coolest Therapy Interventions The Best Way to Keep Couples Together In the case of self-destructive behavior, a peaceful, respectful confrontation is planned and organized in advance by one or more concerned people, usually family or friends, and sometimes with the guidance of a professional interventionist. The concerned individuals present the problem to the person who is behaving in a self-destructive way, discuss the effects, and present options for help. The intervening individuals must try to get the person to listen to them and accept whatever help is being offered. In other instances, an intervention could take the simpler form of bringing music into an institutional setting, such as a hospital, to help reduce patients’ and regulate other negative emotions. The theory behind intervention is that planned, nonthreatening mediation in a negative situation can have a positive effect on the outcome. Interventions can help modify behaviors that interfere with a person’s well-being and the well-being of family and friends. Although interventions are often staged for individuals, they are also organized for people who reside in institutional settings and for communities at large. For instance, the practice of distributing free and readily available condoms is a common form of behavioral intervention with the goal of preventing sexually transmitted diseases. The goal of any type of intervention is to take action that will make a positive change in the way someone thinks or behaves, to modify or prevent self-destructive behavior. Intervention also gives friends or family members an opportunity to directly approach their loved one in a safe and structured manner. What to Look for in an Interventionist A professional intervention specialist can help plan a safe, effective, and appropriate intervention strategy; help friends and family members express themselves in the most constructive manner; and prepare them for potential outcomes and consequences. Interventionists may be registered or certified in the state in which they practice. Reputable rehabilitation centers and specialists may be able to refer you to a professional interventionist.

Why You Have Romantic Feelings for Someone You Hardly Know The Intriguing Psychological Puzzle of Tesla Ownership LEGO Braille Bricks Help Blind Children Learn to Read  >  Art involves the use of creative techniques such as drawing, painting, collage, coloring, or sculpting to help people express themselves artistically and examine the psychological and emotional undertones in their art. With the guidance of a credentialed art therapist, clients can ""decode"" the nonverbal messages, symbols, and metaphors often found in these art forms, which should lead to a better understanding of their feelings and behavior so they can move on to resolve deeper issues. Art therapy helps children, adolescents, and adults explore their emotions, improve , manage addictions, relieve , improve symptoms of and , and cope with a physical illness or disability. Art therapists work with individuals, couples, and groups in a variety of settings, including private counseling, hospitals, wellness centers, correctional institutions, senior centers, and other community organizations. No artistic talent is necessary for art therapy to succeed, because the therapeutic process is not about the artistic value of the work, but rather about finding associations between the creative choices made and a client's inner life. The artwork can be used as a springboard for reawakening memories and telling stories that may reveal messages and beliefs from the mind. As with any form of therapy, your first session will consist of your talking to the therapist about why you want to find help and learning what the therapist has to offer. Together, you will come up with a treatment plan that involves creating some form of artwork. Once you begin creating, the therapist may, at times, simply observe your process as you work, without interference or judgment. When you have finished a piece of artwork—and sometimes while you are still working on it—the therapist will ask you questions along the lines of how you feel about the artistic process, what was easy or difficult about creating your artwork, and what thoughts or memories you may have had while you were working. Generally, the therapist will ask about your experience and feelings before providing any observations. Art therapy is founded on the belief that self-expression through artistic creation has therapeutic value for those who are healing or seeking deeper understanding of themselves and their personalities. According to the American Art Therapy Association, art therapists are trained to understand the roles that color, texture, and various art media can play in the therapeutic process and how these tools can help reveal one’s thoughts, feelings, and psychological disposition. Art therapy integrates and some form of visual arts as a specific, stand-alone form of therapy, but it is also used in combination with other types of therapy. What to Look for in an Art Therapist An art therapist has the minimum of a master’s degree, generally from an integrated program in psychotherapy and visual arts at an educational institution accredited by the Council for Higher Accreditation (CHEA). The initials ATR after a therapist’s name means he or she is registered with the Art Therapy Credentials Board (ATCB). The initials ATR-BC means the therapist is not only registered but has passed an examination to become board-certified by the ATCB. website accessed December 20, 2016.    Slayton SC, D’Archer J, Kaplan F. Outcome studies on the efficacy of art therapy: a review of findings.

Why Some Children Live With a Persistent Fear of Abandonment How Narcissism Distorts Self-Image via Self-Concept Clarity How Gabby Giffords Used Music to Regain Her Speech Dreams have been described as dress rehearsals for real life, opportunities to gratify wishes, and a form of nocturnal therapy. A new theory aims to make sense of it all. Why Some Children Live With a Persistent Fear of Abandonment How Narcissism Distorts Self-Image via Self-Concept Clarity How Gabby Giffords Used Music to Regain Her Speech Why It’s Important to Get to the Root of Your Emotions New psychoanalytic research demonstrates how needs and emotions are connected. We are all born with needs that are felt and expressed as emotions. Although we all experience the feelings of desire, , , and despair, new research shows how these feelings are connected to our basic needs. We need to engage with the world. This is felt as curiosity. We need to escape dangerous situations. This is fear. We need to destroy those people and things that come between us and satisfaction. This is . We need to attach to those who look after us. Separation from those who look after us can feel like and despair. Developing healthy ways to meet these needs results in a feeling of well-being.  When these are unmet it can result in attempts to meet them in out-moded ways that worked when we were children but are now faulty and unproductive as adults. This can lead to suffering in our current lives, relationships, and at work. Research demonstrates that can help achieve better control over our emotions, more successful relationships, and a more fruitful professional life. In other words, psychoanalytic psychotherapy allows us to unlearn reactions that negatively affect our lives and to learn productive ones. Imagine a baby. When his parents steps out of the room the baby doesn’t have the capacity to know that they will be back.  All he knows is that he needs them. This need is expressed through a feeling of love when they are present and through the feeling of despair when they are gone. He has not yet acquired the capacity to understand that they will be back or the ability to self-soothe. When all goes well developmentally, the baby eventually learns that when his parents leave the room they always come back. But if the parents remain unreliable or neglectful the fear that they won’t come back is reinforced. As this boy becomes a toddler and a teenager his parents continue to be unreliable, and he copes with this rejection by distancing and convincing himself that he does not need them. Now let’s fast-forward. The boy is 40-years-old and finds that he cannot sustain a which brings him into therapy. As the therapy progresses, it emerges that whenever he starts to feel dependent on a significant other, he experiences intense panic and distances himself. This distancing behavior, designed to protect him from the despair, eventually leads to a break-up. The challenge is to unlearn that default reaction with the mind of an adult. The adult mind does have the capacity to understand things that a small child can’t grasp. This is where psychoanalytic psychotherapy comes in. It is designed to address and help patients learn to tolerate painful feelings as they arise. The therapist and patient follow these feelings to their beginnings, where they were originally learned. In this example, the need to distance from an important person goes back to the need for and the fear of losing his parents. To avoid that happening, he leaves the relationship before any real dependency can take place.  Gradually, the patient unlearns the automatic response of flight from dependency. This is achieved through repetition. Research has established that psychoanalytic psychotherapy is just as effective as cognitive behavior therapy () in the short term. However, psychoanalytic psychotherapy shows an increase in its effects after termination of treatment. In other words, people who go through psychoanalytic psychotherapy continue to benefit and grow from the treatment long after it has ended. In the above example, the therapist encourages the patient to share his pain and recognize its origins. He reviews with the therapist his usual coping mechanism of distancing and detachment. The therapist addresses both the underlying feelings and the patient’s attempts to avoid them. Unlike other psychotherapeutic methods that seek to lessen the intensity of the feelings, the psychoanalytic therapist helps the patient to stay with and tolerate these feelings over and over again. Eventually this repetition allows the patient to let go of the original reaction and to practice new options of feeling and coping. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy allows the patient to gain access to unmet needs which are experienced as painful emotions and to learn to regulate them and become increasingly liberated from their oppressive and demanding grasp on our lives. This leads to an increased capacity to live a richer, fuller life. Eva Patrick is a licensed psychologist with a private practice in Los Angeles.

The Gender Gap in Negotiation May Start Very Young An Attitude of Gratitude: Why Saying ""I Am Grateful"" Matters AI Gains Social Intelligence; Infers Goals and Failed Plans An Atheist Neuroscientist Finds Faith in Bipolar Mania 10 Tips for Turning Procrastination into Precrastination A few months ago, a journalist sent me some questions for an article about ending therapy (because of my , I presume). I worked hard writing responses, but the article never ran, so I thought I’d post them here to bring some closure to all this hard work. Well I’ll be. That’s the function of termination as well—to give the therapeutic process a satisfying conclusion. Does that always happen? No, it doesn’t, but in an ideal world, all therapy would provide a good ending, where loose ends are tied up, take-away points are clarified, and we share a clean goodbye. Sounds nice, doesn’t it? So why is this positive ending relatively rare? Sometimes therapists do stupid things that cause clients to leave prematurely. Sometimes clients don’t like saying goodbye so they split without notice. Many times, clients don’t even know there is such a thing as a “termination phase,” so they either or fumble through the final sessions until they find a good reason to leave. And you know what? That’s on us therapists. We should be teaching clients how to end therapy from the very moment they enter our office. Providing a good ending is one of the best things we can do as therapists. More on that below. And so I resurrect for you the interview that never ran for your reading pleasure: Your thoughts on what patients should consider when weighing whether it’s time to stop therapy? Clients should consider ending their time in therapy when their have been met or when it becomes evident that they won’t meet them with this psychotherapist.  Ideally, therapy ends when all therapy goals have been met. If you entered therapy to treat a fear of dogs and you no longer fear dogs, your work is complete. Or you want to communicate better with your partner and you’ve learned to navigate your disagreements constructively, the goals are met. Many people have aims that are less specific, like improving or decreasing . They may choose to leave when they’ve learned the skills necessary to do this on an ongoing basis, and the regular sessions are no longer needed to reinforce these principles.  There’s also the idea of “” the therapist. When a client has worked with a therapist for several months or years, they’ll find themselves encountering a problem and can imagine what their therapist would say about it. We would say this incorporation of the therapist’s voice or mindset is a positive sign for the client, that they have been able to construct a portable version of the therapist who can advise them outside therapy sessions. When a positive, helpful version of the therapist has been internalized, the flesh and blood version may not be as necessary. I know, it sounds funny, but it’s true. On the other hand, some clients realize they won’t be able to reach their goals with their current therapist. They may have a conflict, experience some challenges within the therapy, or they may suffer from a problem that requires a specific set of skills their therapist doesn’t have. Some therapists are highly trained to work with chemical dependency, , or , for example, while others have very little training in these areas. If it becomes clear that the therapist doesn’t have the tools necessary to help the client with their issues, the therapist should make a referral to another clinician who can help. Beyond specialty, there are also times when interpersonal issues become a barrier to the therapy. In therapy, as in all close relationships, problems with trust, communication, and could render therapy an obstacle rather than a conduit to healing. If you’re seeking help with grieving a lost loved one but you don’t trust that your therapist is keeping your sessions confidential, therapy is getting in the way of your healing. In these cases, it can be helpful to discuss the problems with the therapist first, but if they can’t be resolved, leaving therapy is a viable option.  One point to consider is whether the obstacle is central to your issues or not. If you are seeking therapy to address a history of conflict with males, and you find yourself having conflict with your male therapist, you might want to think about staying to resolve this conflict because it becomes a laboratory for your specific problem. If you have and feel awkward with your therapist, this might be just the place to work on it. But if you have a and your interpersonal issues with the therapist are getting in the way, leaving therapy could be a good option.  Any thoughts on whether there is an optimal amount of time or number of sessions should be in therapy? What are the different variables (such as reasons for being in therapy—what would be an example of a reason that should take eight to 12 sessions, what would be an example of a reason that could take months or years)? There are people who will benefit from a single therapy session and others who have been in great therapy for 23 years and have no intention of stopping. As long as someone feels like therapy is beneficial to them and they have the practical means, they should feel free to keep going.  A lot of this has to do with the mindset of the person seeking therapy. I’ll draw an analogy from the world of physical health, where we have two approaches – the . In the illness model, when someone feels sick or has an injury, they go to an M.D. and receive treatment. When the illness clears up, they make no more appointments with the M.D., and all is well. In the wellness model, a relatively healthy person decides they want to make their healthy body healthier, so they go to the gym. They work out regularly and achieve fitness goals and feel great about it. No one says: “You’re in great shape—it’s time to stop going to the gym!” That would be absurd.  is the mental health equivalent of both the illness and wellness model. People come to therapy to treat disorders like phobias, , anxiety, , , , , etc. But they also come to therapy to make a good life great by working on their relationships, finding meaning in their life, becoming a better parent, improving their communication, finding their ideal , increasing their capacity for , enhancing their self-esteem, and so on.  So the question about how long someone “should” be in therapy promotes a mental health stigma. It implies that people “should” be done with therapy in a predetermined amount of time and if they’re not there’s something wrong with them or the therapy. Would someone say the same thing to someone who goes to the gym? ""You’ve gone to this gym for six years, aren’t you done yet? You’re in great shape, so stop working out.” Hell no. Let’s try to apply the same grace to mental health that we do to physical health.  Generally speaking, people seeking relief from phobias, anxiety or depression find some relief within the first three to six months of therapy. People with deeper issues like , relational issues, problems with core , sexual and intimacy problems require months to years of treatment. And if they want a safe, structured place to work on becoming the most self-aware and best version of themselves, they may want to spend much longer in treatment. Do therapists have any responsibility to ask the patient whether he or she should stop therapy (or find another therapist)? As I said above, if a therapist finds that they are working with a client who has needs that exceed their scope of competence, the therapist is obligated to find referrals to someone who does have that skill. All codes say something about therapists only working within their scope of competence. Therapists should also be aware of whether or not therapy is giving any value to the client. This could be a therapist who recognizes that their depressed client isn’t improving despite several months of therapy, or realizing that the ADHD tools they have taught aren’t producing the desired results, or the strategies seem to make matters worse. This should be a collaborative discussion with the client, where they both assess the effectiveness of the interventions and decide whether or not to stop and find outside help.  This is very important. I remember a time early in my training when I was working with an elderly woman and I felt like our work was going nowhere. She was telling story after story and I felt like it wasn’t helping to resolve her depression at all. After several months I told her I didn’t feel I was being effective and suggested we might transfer her to someone with more experience. She nearly burst into tears and told me our sessions were the most important hour of her week, that it had helped her connect with others, and that she was heartbroken that I felt otherwise. I learned then that my experience and my client’s can be very different, and never to assume that my opinion is true for both of us. We repaired from that session, and continued several more months as her depression lifted.  Please provide specific consumer advice tips for patients who are wondering whether they should stop or wind down from therapy, at least one robust paragraph per tip. Just go. If you feel you are being exploited, if you feel unwanted romantic advances, if you feel like your boundaries are violated in any way, if you feel like therapy is going nowhere, make your next session your last. Tell your therapist you don’t feel safe and/or competently served and let them know this is your last session. If the violations are extreme or causing harm look into telling their boss or alerting the licensing board. Like physicians, therapists are ethically bound to “do no harm” in their therapy, and if you’re suffering harm there are avenues to stop the harm and find better treatment. You may feel it’s helpful for you to have a voice and tell your therapist about your complaints, or maybe not. As I’ve said many times before, it’s your time and your dime, you can have closure or choose to split with a voicemail. Whatever works best for your mental health. Start early. I try to talk with my clients about when therapy will end, from the beginning. When you’re talking about the goals for therapy, talk about how and when you’ll know therapy is ready to come to a close. Maybe you’re trying to stop an annoying behavior—perhaps when you’ve been free from the behavior for a month you’ll be ready to wrap up therapy. It can seem odd to talk about the ending of therapy at the first session, but this can free both of you up to work well together and not wonder when and how you’ll end.  Talk about it. Beyond the first session, it can be helpful to bring the topic of ending up from time to time. Let’s say you found yourself dreading therapy this week and had to drag yourself in. This can be great material to discuss and might help you develop your exit plan together. Maybe you can set a date for a final session and plan a good farewell in the meantime. Raise your concerns. Sometimes therapy raises concerns that are speed bumps, but not necessarily reasons to end therapy. Your therapist was late for a session. You forgot an appointment. You had a disagreement. Talk about these issues and see if they are about readiness to end therapy or another problem, like resistance to diving into deeper topics. Sometimes a desire to bail is about an unwillingness to talk about really important issues more than a signal that therapy isn’t important anymore.  Set a date. When therapy has gone well and you’ve been able to internalize the voice of your therapist, it can be helpful to set a date in the future to say your last goodbyes—some make it a month out, some make it 10% of the total amount of time in therapy. I’ve seen that doing this sometimes raises new material in therapy, issues that can be very helpful to discuss. The idea that therapy is ending can raise memories of other endings in a person’s life and give you a chance to talk about them. Make a positive ending. The fact is, there aren’t enough good endings in life. Many relationships end in death, , breakups, or a slow fade away. A good therapy ending is a lot like a graduation—it’s bittersweet. We spend some time talking about the goals achieved, lament about the problems we couldn’t resolve and had to accept, and reminisce about the time we spent together. We make an aftercare plan about what life looks like after therapy, and we end on a positive note. Unlike many relationships where there is no closure, we try to say and feel everything we can to make this as complete as possible. Submitted by Anonymous on December 19, 2017 - 1:00pm I tried therapy for 6 years - it was a complete failure. I certainly hope the therapist has not been internalized - that sounds insane and useless to me. It also sounds completely like you people think a whole lot higher about yourselves and your profession than I do Submitted by Anonymous on December 19, 2017 - 2:54pm I have been in therapy for over 18 months. Along the way to resolving other issues--why I began therapy in the first place--I have learned that I am an avoider. I have been provided with ""tools"" to use to ""avoid avoiding issues."" My marriage is better--not avoiding issues, I am performing better at work--again, not avoiding issues, and I am able to avoid the stress that ""avoiding"" caused. Therapy may not work for everyone, but it is for me. At some point in the future I do see ending the therapy relationship. But not yet. Submitted by Coco on December 19, 2017 - 4:46pm Good article, thank you. My therapist provided a good ending, for which I'm very thankful. We set a date and in the remaining sessions we talked about the termination and how it made me feel. Saying goodbye after all this time hurt very much, but by talking about it and giving it the attention it needed, it was a proper and beautiful goodbye that I'll never forget. It's healing to have experienced a goodbye like this. Submitted by Mom on January 21, 2018 - 1:02pm Would you say this is a combo of luck and hard work?? I'm surely not one to say luck is extremely common but sometimes you do have to be at the right place at the right time and wanting something and working hard is not always enough. Thanks for sharing what happened. Submitted by Swedish Rolls and Buns on February 8, 2018 - 6:44pm I posted this and have been waiting for responses. Luck never hurts. I haven't found someone I can work with yet.. When I say therapy didn't work they still assume it had to be mostly my doing. Why so much BIAS ????? I asked for homeowork. Give me something once in a while if not every session. Submitted by Anonymous on December 19, 2017 - 6:19pm I just told the one I hired that I was not coming back as I was walking out. The last exchange we had was: ""Why do you state the obvious and treat me like an idiot?"" Therapist: ""Nothing I say is magic"" And that was what the entire 6 years had been like. I found use for the woman during the illness and death of my partner, but that was mostly because the therapist could not screw that up - I just needed a place to say things I could not tell others. It did not matter what the therapist did during that time. Submitted by mi on December 21, 2017 - 10:46pm I wish this is what happens. I left therapy on a OK note.But I was dissaponted and expected more from a seasoned therapist. If someone could follow these tips they could learn a lot. It takes two. Of course, Submitted by Shirley Getting It Now on December 27, 2017 - 6:07pm I enjoy learning and reading what you share with us and I thank you. I surely don't want to sign this as Anonymous. Somehow that doesn't seem good, LOL, kidding. You sound fair and concerned. I sincerely think if more therapists were like you therapy wouldn't get a ""somewhat bad rap."" You obviously have many skills and I'd guess you were born with this gift and learned how to learn more and use it wisely. . Submitted by goose on June 7, 2018 - 3:33pm There’s also the idea of “internalizing” the therapist. When a client has worked with a therapist for several months or years, they’ll find themselves encountering a problem and can imagine what their therapist would say about it. I will say honestly this is akin to breaking up with a person and you are obsessed with that person in your head forever! and people say get over it, move on, are you still thinking about him or her blahh An adult, albeit, semi healthy (healthy and functional enough) to pay $300 an hour, does not need to internalize a therapist. That is creepy! babies internalize...adult learn, get insight, and then the insight seeps into subconsciousness. It is like learning how to drive or bike, you struggle, you manuever, and eventually many of the tasks are automatic. No internalization. I never met an adult (and maybe I have narrow life) that had a therapist 10yrs ago that internalized the therapist and still think what would Ryan say on a situation! that is not growing up, that is being possessed...LOL A good therapist, does not get into your head and take over your agency or internalize you...a good therapy, gives you space and a relationship with a time that makes you change fundamental way as an adult. Submitted by Anonymous on July 5, 2019 - 4:17pm Not all of us were raised by supportive people in a nurturing environment. When your internalized messages (Emotions are wrong, never let them show. and Don't ever ask for anything...) steer you towards disaster they must be purged and replaced with healthier thoughts. My therapist has taught me how to challenge those messages, discover a different way to think and apply it to my life. I have internalized her, ""Can you challenge that?"" along with other helpful things she has said. She is in my head and I am much the better for it. She does not think for me but she often reminds me how to begin doing so when I am overwhelmed. This is one of the lasting benefits of therapy. One thing I am sure of... I am not a baby because therapy is working for me. I'm a survivor. The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

Lee Depression is a major public health burden among the aging population. While older adults prefer non-pharmacological treatment, few options for psychotherapy are available in primary care settings, which is where older adults tend to receive mental health services. Indicated prevention is a cost-effective, public health approach to prevent major depressive disorder among people with depressive symptoms who do not yet meet standard criteria for major depression. We critically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the efficacy of psychotherapy among community-dwelling older adults with subthreshold depression (depressive symptoms that do not meet standard criteria for major depression). We examined the intervention types, results, internal validity, and external validity of five studies. We used the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines to rate the quality of the studies and to provide recommendations. Results suggest that psychotherapy is a safe and cost-effective method to reduce the public health burden of depression among older adults with subthreshold depression.

Pharmaceutical medications have many side effects and their long-term health risks are still not fully known. But with psychotherapy for ADHD patients can avoid or limit the amounts of pharmaceutical medications they need to take. Risks of suffering from side effects like upset stomach, weight loss, dizziness, nausea, and psychosis are greatly minimized if psychotherapy works as a treatment for ADHD. Even if the individual is required to be on pharmaceutical medications, they will still benefit from psychotherapy and may be able to reduce how many pharmaceutical medications they need. Involving All Caregivers in Psychotherapy Treatment not only for the person suffering from ADHD but for those living with that person. Therapy involving all caregivers is aimed at helping individuals understand what ADHD is and how to deal with it. Caregiver therapy counsels caregivers on how to recognize when the person with ADHD needs some quiet time or some reminders to stay on track. When working with psychotherapy for ADHD in children, caregivers learn how to help the child and how to manage their own frustrations when dealing with children who have ADHD. Another type of caregiver therapy is called family therapy and involves the whole family taking part in therapy sessions. Learning Life Skills and Anger Management with Psychotherapy People living with ADHD need more assistance in understanding how to manage and organize their daily schedules. They also get angrier and frustrated easier and need to learn how to manage those emotions. Psychotherapy for ADHD aims to aid the individual in expressing their emotions, and teaching them to realize how they can choose other options instead of getting angry. For children with ADHD, psychotherapy works to help them make good choices and to learn how those choices can produce better outcomes than getting angry. Using Art or Music Therapy as a Psychotherapy Option for ADHD Another form of psychotherapy involves expression through a medium such as drawing or music. The individual with ADHD will use writing, painting, dancing, music, drama, poetry and other forms of expression to help sort out their emotions. This type of therapy is beneficial in that it teaches the individual how to express him or herself in a way they understand and can relate to. Group Therapy as a Psychotherapy Treatment for ADHD Individuals can also partake in group therapy sessions to discuss their situation with others who have similar stories. Group therapy allows the individual to realize they are not the only ones with ADHD. In addition it gives them the ability to offer assistance and support to others who also suffer from ADHD. Group therapy is also available to families of people with ADHD. Family members can join support groups to share stories and learn how other people deal with ADHD in their family.

3d620361-9734-4242-be62-2fdbae0f8a49,"An Interview with Michael Linden Can psychotherapy have side effects? Michael Linden believes it can. He launched some of the key studies that shed light on this under-appreciated phenomenon, and discusses them in this podcast-interview. So far, no one has had an allergy to psychotherapy, but psychotherapy can cause side effects, even when it’s done correctly. I was excited to see that the chose psychotherapy as this month’s foxus. But I have to say I found this interview on psychotherapy side effects, well, rather challenging.   One thing that patients struggle in psychotherapy is that they avoid pain, so when I practice psychotherapy I’m often trying to get them to move toward that pain instead of away from it. This might be in exposure therapies – like when I work with trauma or phobias, or with depression – depressed patients will often stay in bed and avoid doing anything because it makes them uncomfortable or anxious. So, the way I see it, psychotherapy is difficult, and it ought to be difficult because that’s what makes it work. So why is Dr. Linden calling that a side effect? You’re not alone in that Kellie. Judging from the reader feedback a lot of people were challenged by Dr. Linden’s ideas. Here’s what I think is going on. We have a bias in our field about psychotherapy – and perhaps about life – and Dr. Linden is coming at this work that particular bias – which is unsettling. The bias is something like what you just said – it’s the idea that the only way to grow in life is through difficulty – and it’s imbedded in a lot of our idioms – “no pain, no gain;” “every rose has its thorns;” “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Or like a therapist said to me once, “The patient has to get worse before they can get better.” So Dr. Linden believes you don’t need to suffer to get better? We’ll he’s also a realist, and he sees “side effects” as a somewhat inevitable consequence of psychotherapy – in fact of any medical treatment. He’s just trying to call it what it is, because for many years we’ve been glorifying them as the royal road to recovery. In other fields of medicine, we don’t do that. When patients have memory loss on ECT we don’t say, “This is part of the cure, you need to forget the pain that is making you depressed.” Well wait I have heard this said in psychopharmacology. Like with mood stabilizers. Some doctors warn patients that they may feel flat or dull on the mood stabilizer, but that this is an inevitable part of treating the extreme highs of mania. Or with SSRIs – sometimes patients feel emotionally numb on them and their doctor will tell them this is because the alternative is to feel anxious and overly reactive. That’s true we do say that sometimes… and perhaps we shouldn’t. I think what’s happened here is that we’ve been so busy trying to get patients to stick with treatment – whether psychotherapy or medication – that we’ve created this mythology around the negative aspects of treatment – the side effects – as though they were inevitable or even necessary to the cure. But really – we can treat anxiety or neurosis without causing apathy like the SSRIs do – there’s bupropion, buspirone, even EMSAM and SAMe – and these don’t tend to make people emotionally numb. And sedation and affective flattening are not inevitable consequences of mood stabilizer treatment. If they were, then anything that makes you feel tired and out of it would treat bipolar disorder. These are side effects to mood stabilizers, not part of the cure. “Well, you know in pharmacotherapy, the assessment of side effects has a long tradition meanwhile. In the early days, it didn’t have a tradition also. But then people learned, and especially regulators were forced to have a closer look at side effects.  And since then side effects in pharmacotherapy are a major aspect of whether a company will market a drug or not. So marketing is very much dependent on side effects. And therefore if you have a drug which is having major or many side effects, will just not be on the market, so there is a limit. For example, amitriptyline, an old antidepressant which is still available, would nowadays never be marketed. So that’s why you have a little bit of time on the topic in pharmacotherapy, while in psychotherapy up to now, there is no such tradition. And so everybody who has a nice thought creates a new psychotherapy, and whether that’s helpful or not well, it’s an interesting question” OK so back to psychotherapy. Let’s talk about exposure therapy – I understand Dr. Linden is himself a CBT therapist and has done a lot of exposure work. So I thought it was necessary for phobic patients to experience anxiety in order to overcome their phobias. Exposure therapy does this, and so do the third-wave behavior therapies like Mindfulness and Acceptance & Commitment Therapy – these all encourage the patient to “be with” the anxious feeling instead of running away from it. You’re right – all of those therapies cause anxiety, and on the other side they all work to improve anxiety disorders. So I can understand how you’d come to believe that – as you put it – you have to go….  Yes you have to go through the anxiety to get to the other side of it.  Well, Dr. Linden is suggesting we stop calling this a necessary step in therapy and call it what it is: A side effect. That makes it sound like there’s something wrong, like exposure is a bad therapy. No – this is another part of his work where it helps to put our biases aside to understand what he’s saying. Dr. Linden defines “Side effects” as unwanted effects of good therapy – these aren’t therapeutic mistakes like boundary violations, and they aren’t the result of bad therapy either. Again, it’s just like with medication. When sertraline causes nausea or sweating, we don’t say that it’s a bad medicine, or that I’m a bad doctor for prescribing it. It’s a side effect. OK I think I’m starting to get it. Exposure therapy is a valid therapy – it’s one of the best we have for phobic anxiety. But it causes a side effect – particularly in the beginning – in that it makes the patient feel worse. In fact they feel more anxiety – the very thing they’ve come to us to overcome. Yes and if they get more anxious during the therapy there are several ways it could turn out. They might get better – if the therapy works – and come out with less anxiety than ever before. But exposure therapy doesn’t work. It could cause flooding – where it makes them anxious beyond the point that they can tolerate and they give up on therapy. Or they might go through all the hard work of exposure and not get better. Or they might even go through exposure therapy – with all the anxiety that entails – and come out feeling worse – in other words their condition could get worse during therapy. Now it’s hard to prove that any of those results are caused by the therapy, just as it’s hard to prove that any given side effect is caused by a medication. But we at least need to think about these possibilities. “In behavior therapy if you are treating anxiety we do exposure treatment. We want to have the patient confront anxiety in order then to learn how to cope with anxiety, and if it’s really a good treatment, in the end, to be able, for example, to go to the subway without any anxiety anymore. To get to that end, you have to expose the patient to situations which are frightening for the patient. Well, if everything comes out fine, the patient will lose the anxiety. But I’ve seen dozens of patients who after that have more anxiety than before, so this can happen.” So we need to think of anxiety as a side effect, rather than a good part of the therapy. But how does that change things? You’re just calling it by a different name. In practice, it shifts us more toward the patient’s experience, because it forces us to recognize aspects of therapy that are negative for the patient. So it’s more compassionate. Like I’ve said, as professionals we tend to venerate some of these side effects – imbuing them with hidden therapeutic mechanisms as though they are necessary for recovery. But patients don’t see it that way. And we also tend to be blind to problems we’re causing with our treatments. Whether you’re a primary care physician or a psychotherapist, it’s easier to see the good we’re doing then then harm. We’re only human. So Dr. Linden’s idea is that we need to intentionally watch for side effects, and even engage the patient in that. He believes in informed consent – he’ll warn patients that they may experience negative effects during therapy. In that way he’s helping them to make rational decisions about their treatment, which is ultimatel y what they need to do in life. Few of the choices we have available to us in life are perfect – they do some good, they do some harm, and we try to follow the path that works best on balance. Why should psychotherapy be any different? So I’m guessing Dr. Linden wouldn’t agree with the idea that everyone should be in psychotherapy.  Well, he’d at least want them to consider the risks and benefits. One thing he said that has changed my practice is that even the act of gathering a history has side effects. “Well, let’s start at the beginning. You see a psychotherapist; the first thing is he’ll start with the anamnesis – so with the history taking, right. And then he starts asking you how you feel about your mother and your father and your spouse, and so on and so forth. And just by talking about all the negative events which you experienced in your life, this may already start to have negative impact on you because all of a sudden you get the feeling your life has been possibly a whole mess.” I think of a few patients I’ve seen who literally refused to let me take a psychiatric history. They weren’t paranoid. They just didn’t want to think about the past – the depressions and psychiatric hospitalizations – it was too painful to talk about. And from my point of view as a doctor I thought this was irrational – How could I help them without taking a history? But after talking with Dr. Linden I see it more compassionately.  Essentially, they were telling me, “Yes I know your medicine can help – and taking a history is part of that medicine – but it causes side effects that I don’t want to experience right now. And I need to be in charge of my own experience.”  Not really.  I had to piece it together – you know – over time, talking to the family and gathering records. But the patient never went through it with me.  And I’ve come to appreciate their honesty as well.  A lot of patients aren’t assertive enough to tell us that they don’t want to go through their history, so they instead they give us a history that’s vague and inaccurate, and we may end up believing they’ve never had a suicide attempt or a manic episode.  These patients were at least alerting me to the fact that there was something big in their psychiatric history – even if they didn’t want to talk about it. “Group therapy by itself has a high rate of side effects just to start with. sit in the group and listen to all of the problems of the other patients. This is burdening. And if you then have to think whether what you hear from the others may also be true for yourself, there is demoralization as we call it. You have maybe, for example, maybe an anxiety disorder. You hope that it will become better. And then there is in the group another person who tells you ‘Well, at your point I had been years ago, and it will not go away.’ Okay, that’s demoralization.” One thing Dr. Linden says that struck me is that nearly every psychotherapy has side effects. He started doing research on this in the early 2000s, and since then others have followed in his footsteps – and in some of the studies they’ve done 90-100% of people have side effects during psychotherapy. Only about 10% of these are significant or lasting however, but that’s still a lot. So even good therapy has side effects, but what about bad therapy – aren’t there therapies that we just don’t do anymore because they nearly always cause harm?  Yes, but it’s not about being good or bad. If we’re going to innovate in psychotherapy and try new things we’re going to run into some blunders that do more harm than good. But if we look at them fully from the get go – and research their side effects as well as their benefits – then we can catch these things before they spread too far. OK last week we talked about a medication that got taken off the market – zimeltidine, the first SSRI. So what are some therapies that have been taken “off the market” – so to speak? The most notorious was recovered memory therapy. This was popular in the 1980’s and 1990’s. The therapist would suggest that the patient may have repressed memories of abuse as a child, and the patient would start to uncover these memories even if they’d never recalled them before. Often the remembered abusers were people close to them, like their parents, and this split up families and even lead to false accusations in court. Then the law suits started to go in the other direction, and some of the aggrieved families starting suing therapists for planting these misperceptions in the patient’s minds. Eventually the courts, and later many professional organizations came out against this kind of therapy, but it hasn’t been pulled from the market. You can’t take away a psychotherapy like you can a drug. “So the therapist tries to answer questions like that. And then he tries to remember. And in the end there will be induction of false memories, just by asking, and if you a patient who is sensitive to that. This is very quick. There is a whole bunch of literature on false memories which can be induced just by asking a patient the history. So this can be a major side effect.” Does recovered memory therapy still go on? Yes. In 2018 there was a survey of over 1,000 U.S. adults who had undergone psychotherapy in the past few decades. 1 in 5 respondents said that the therapist had suggested that they might have repressed memories of childhood abuse. Those suggestions peaked in the 1990’s, up to 27%, but they have stayed between 15-20% in the decades since. And it has a definite effect. True or not, half of the people who received that suggestion ended up recovering memories during their therapy (Patihis L, Pendergrast MH, Clin Psych Sci 2019, 7;1:3-21). We could do a whole podcast on the false memory debate, but let’s just keep it short today and say there is research proving that false memories can be implanted, and that even when people experience a real traumatic event they often have distorted memories about that event. OK So let’s get back to research. What evidence do we have that psychotherapy can cause harm? One possibility that Dr. Linden brought up is that focusing too much on negative events can be demoralizing. He told me about a study where they asked a group of people to recall a time when they had problems. Then, half of them were asked to go on and think about what had happened during that difficult time. The other half was asked to stop thinking about it and instead solve other, unrelated tasks. At the end, mood symptoms got worse in the people who spent their time remembering a difficult time in their life, but mood improved in the ones who were distracted by another task were (Poepel N, DGPPN-Kongress Berlin, 2006). That is something I hear a lot from patients with depression. They say they don’t want to do therapy because it makes them more depressed to talk about their past or their problems. How do you work with that in therapy? To start with you need to understand that what the patient is saying is true – it does make them more depressed! I see this a lot and I call it affective avoidance. People with mood disorders often don’t want to be reminded of their past depressions. They may avoid songs, people, even entire cities that remind them of what they’ve been through. They have strong emotional associations – and are understandably worried that revisiting those memories will send them back in to a depressed episode. So to start this we need to believe them and handle it carefully. We can’t assume it’s the same type of avoidance as PTSD – people with PTSD avoid traumatic memories for different reasons than this affective avoidance. So is that healthy avoidance or not? It can be both. One way to tell is if the patient ruminates a lot about the very memories that they want to forget. Rumination itself is a form of avoidance – it often involves asking “why” questions like “Why did this happen to me?” and approaching painful memories from an overly logical perspective, intellectualizing and rationalizing into abstractions… and all of this is a way to avoid feeling the pain of that memory. So in rumination focused CBT the therapist carefully guides them through a kind of imaginal exposure therapy where they sit with the full details of the memory and allow the feelings to come and go instead of fighting them. So, yes, there may be times when it’s helpful to work on painful memories in depression like this, but it’s difficult work and there are definitely side effects with it. And there are other times where it’s best to let sleeping dogs lie. That reminds me of critical incident debriefing. This therapy was developed to help people who recently went through a traumatic event, like burns or car accidents. Like in the study you just quoted, they would talk about the trauma in this debriefing session. The problem is that – – the people who got this debriefing had more PTSD and anxiety when they were followed up down the road. TCPR: Yes. And this doesn’t mean that debriefing is bad therapy – it just has this negative side effect in people who were recently traumatized. Focusing on the trauma at that point only causes the memory to set in deeper. But a few months later, in someone with real PTSD, it’s a different story, and that’s when careful exposure to the traumatic memory can be curative. What people need in the immediate aftermath of a trauma is support and help getting back into their lives – community, housing, food, necessities, and reassurance. Another place where psychotherapy can backfire is in psychoeducation. Dr. Linden found that out in a study he conducted that compared two forms of CBT – one was conducted as regular CBT therapy with a therapist and patient, and in the other the therapist was encouraged to add written educational materials in to the therapy. It was a large study of 377 patients in a hospital unit with various disorders, mainly depression and anxiety. After 5-6 weeks, the ones who got the additional written materials were more knowledgeable about their health, but they were less satisfied with therapy and had worse outcomes on many psychological measures. They had poorer self-esteem, well-being, and family relationships (Linden M et al, 2019, 6:1612825 They were standard CBT materials about schemas, cognitions, and coping skills, all written at the level of an easy-to-read newspaper. The idea was that these leaflets would support the therapy and allow more time for other discussions in session. But it had the opposite effect. Patients read the materials, and then spent the session asking questions about the what they read instead of doing the treatment. It was more information than the patients could absorb and it ended up making them feel overwhelmed and insecure. Yes. Donna Sudak makes a similar point in the other interview in this issue. She says that many patients receive psychoeducation when they are in severe episodes, such as in the hospital. They’re not likely to remember that later because their cognition was impaired when they got it, so she always makes a point to revisit it down the road and ask what they know about their illness. And we’ll close with one more example of psychotherapy side effects, a particularly important one. In from Edinburgh, Scotland, they tested whether a video education program could help people with schizophrenia. There were 114 patients, and half were randomized watch this brief video about schizophrenia as they left the hospital. When they were followed up a few months later, the ones who saw the video were 4 times more likely to have suicidal thoughts. That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t teach people with schizophrenia about their condition. It just needs to be done carefully, and with a human touch). Suicidality goes down in schizophrenia when the same psychoeducation is delivered as part of a therapy program that teaches skills to cope with the illness, rather than an impersonal video (Donker T et al, BMC Psychol 2013;1(1):6). “Well, the first thing it’s good to know that there can be side effects. The second thing is it’s even better when you know which specific side effects can occur with each technique. For example, exposure treatment – every therapist should be aware that exposure treatment can result in anxiety learning, so he has to monitor that and maybe intervene if he gets the idea that this is going in the wrong direction. Or every therapist should know that psychoeducation can result in terrible misunderstandings, so I have to check what the patient has understood. So there is a side effect-guided treatment. It’s very simple. And, well, one general phrase is: Side effects are negative effects of good treatment. If the therapist does not see side effects, it can’t be a good treatment. A good therapist sees side effects.” is a German psychiatrist and professor of , and in the University Hospital in . He helped developed the concept of on , as well as a therapy for this disorder: .

QT Interval One of the most important measurements on an electrocardiogram or ECG is distance between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave – the QT interval. It represents the time it takes for the ventricles of the heart to depolarize and repolarize, or to contract and relax. In other words, it’s the thump-thump of the heart beat. The QT interval is longer when the heart rate is slower and shorter when the heart rate is faster, so you’ll usually see corrected for the heart rate, in which case it’s called the QTc: C for corrected. A long QT interval can cause a potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia called .               Many psychiatric medications can prolong the QT, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, and stimulants. But a lot of other medications prolong it as well. Electrolyte disturbances – including those caused by bulimia or anorexia – are another cause. It can also be hereditary; some patients are born with a prolonged QT. All of these risk factors can stack up in an additive way, so a psych med that prolongs the QT just a little could be the straw that broke the camel’s back if there are enough other risk factors going on. So how long is too long? Anything above 450 is long, and anything longer than 500 is dangerous. Join us next week for a special child psychiatry edition to the podcast.

Primary care providers play a central role in managing depression and concurrent physical comorbidities, and they face challenges in diagnosing and treating the condition. In this two part series, we review the evidence available to help to guide primary care providers and practices to recognize and manage depression. The first review outlined an approach to screening and diagnosing depression in primary care. This second review presents an evidence based approach to the treatment of depression in primary care, detailing the recommended lifestyle, drug, and psychological interventions at the individual level. It also highlights strategies that are being adopted at an organizational level to manage depression more effectively in primary care. The vast majority of people with depression are treated in the primary care setting, with estimates ranging from 64% in America to 90% in the UK. Primary care providers have a distinct role and skill set that complement but are not substitutes for specialist mental health input. Most primary care providers screen for, diagnose, and treat depression and ensure routine follow-up. Even when specialist mental health input is needed, primary care providers maintain an important role in managing the chronic physical comorbidities, tackling social vulnerabilities, and monitoring psychiatric risk. Depression is broad and heterogeneous and thus can be taken to mean a multitude of different terms (). This review focuses on major depressive disorder (MDD) in primary care and does not cover the management of other depressive disorders. MDD is an umbrella term that covers the constellation of signs and symptoms that constitute a depressive episode and that place a limitation on functioning. The disorder may be graded on severity from mild, through moderate, to severe and psychotic and may present as a single episode or be recurrent. Depression as a multidimensional construct. Depression as a disorder is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, 5th edition, and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 11th revision, according to a characteristic constellation of diagnostic features that limit day to day functioning or impair social interactions. However, as an ontological concept, depression constitutes myriad terms. It may, for example, be unipolar (that is, only depressive episodes are experienced) or bipolar (previously called manic depression). It may be classified by severity as mild, moderate, or severe (with or without psychosis). It may be a single episode or present as a relapsing-remitting illness. Depression may be considered reactive to particular social events or circumstances or may arise de novo in the absence of any external factors. It may be experienced with a high degree of anxiety symptoms (neurotic or agitated depression) or manifest with very few emotional symptoms but many physical effects on sleep, energy, pain, and libido (“somatic syndrome”). Depression may also present as a chronic, unrelenting, subthreshold disorder as opposed to an acute or subacute, discrete episode. These terms are not exhaustive and do not include subclasses of depression such as seasonal affective disorder, perinatal depression, or premenstrual dysphoric disorder As outlined in the first review of this series, MDD commonly occurs with other emotional, substance use, and physical disorders that should be considered when deciding on interventions. We have not detailed here specific treatment strategies adapted to each potential comorbidity. We have, however, emphasized the need to consider the presence of comorbidities when screening for and diagnosing depression in primary care and included, where appropriate, a discussion on interventions known to be effective for patients with such comorbidities. We also have not included specific interventions for subclinical chronic depression (also called dysthymia or dysthymic disorder) or for subtypes of depression such as bipolar depression, perinatal depression, or seasonal affective disorder. The PREDICT-NL study, a prospective cohort study from 2012, examined the natural course and outcome of MDD in primary care (from now on called depression). At baseline, 174 (13%) of 1338 consecutive attendees had depression, of which 17% had a chronic course, defined as still having symptoms after 39 months, and 40% had a fluctuating course; 43% remitted. Those patients with chronic depression were noted to have more depressive and somatic symptoms and greater mental dysfunction at baseline, independent of age, sex, level of education, presence of a chronic disease, and lifetime depression, compared with those who remitted from baseline. Other studies have found a similar range of factors to be associated with chronic or recurrent depression. These factors include a previous history of recurrent depression, a history of dysthymia, psychiatric comorbidities, comorbid chronic medical illness, younger age at onset, family history of mood disorders, greater severity of depressive symptoms at baseline, and incomplete recovery following acute treatments. Low level of social integration and/or negative social interactions also seem to appear concurrently with chronic depression. Given this natural course, depression in primary care should be managed as any other chronic disease. Management requires a clear treatment pathway and the use of evidence based strategies for individual primary care providers supported by organizational strategies at the practice level. To collect and review the evidence available on depression in primary care, we searched the PubMed and Cochrane databases for relevant articles published between 1 January 2007 and 30 September 2017 by using medical subject headings (MeSH) terms including “depressive disorder”, “depression”, and “major depressive disorder” in combination with “primary care” and “general practice”. We did individualized searches for specific interventions thought relevant through the review process. We limited our search to the English language. We reviewed titles and abstracts, excluding publications not relevant to primary care or for which MDD was not the main focus of the study. We then used a pragmatic prioritizing framework to determine which studies to include in the review. This incorporated the level of evidence, with systematic reviews and meta-analyses given priority and interventional studies prioritized over observational studies; recency, with more recent studies prioritized over older studies; and sample size, with larger studies prioritized over those with smaller sample sizes. Where competing priorities existed—for example, a more recent smaller interventional study with similar objectives to a larger but older randomized controlled trial (RCT), we assigned priority by consensus between the authors on the basis of the methodology, study population, aims of the study, and outcome measures. In addition, we searched the reference lists of included studies for further relevant studies. If a study had been conducted before our search timeframe of the past 10 years, we considered it for inclusion if we deemed it important by virtue of its size or methodology or the absence of other research conducted in the area. References to older, but noteworthy, validation studies were made as appropriate. Depression is treated to achieve three inter-related outcomes: recovery, remission, or response. The key measure is remission from depression, conceptualized as a return to a state of normal functioning and minimal symptoms. Recovery is defined as two months of remission and is closely associated with improvement in functioning and quality of life. Recovery should therefore be considered the ultimate aim of treatment. However, when recovery is not achieved, the aims of treatment are less clear. Response is operationally defined as a reduction in symptoms of 50% from baseline. However, patients themselves may consider symptom reduction as less important than improvements in features such as optimism and self confidence, and the correlation between symptom reduction and meaningful improvements is not robust. Nevertheless, residual symptoms are associated with increased risk of relapse, decreased likelihood of recovery over time, and increased psychosocial and socioeconomic impairment. Hence, the reduction of symptoms, either in intensity or in frequency, should be sought when full recovery is not possible. Many psychological, pharmacological, and psychosocial interventions, either alone or in combination, are available to treat a person diagnosed as having depression. Although evidence on the comparative effectiveness of treatments within and between the different classes of interventions is limited, two comparative reviews of psychological and drug treatments concluded that they are of comparable efficacy in primary care. Different guidelines recommend different initial management options. For example, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England recommends avoiding antidepressant drugs for mild depression and combining drug treatment with psychotherapy for more severe forms of depression. The guidelines of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists suggest that psychological management may be sufficient for depression of mild to moderate severity and recommend using antidepressants when this fails or in severe depressive disorder, whereas American guidelines (both of the American College of Physicians and of the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement, the latter having published guidelines specifically for the management of depression in primary care) suggest that drug treatment and psychotherapy can be considered equivalently for initial treatment. One key feature shared among these guidelines is that the management of depression should follow a stepped care approach in which the intervention depends on the severity of presentation. As outlined in our first review, severity is categorized by a subjective assessment of limitation of functioning rather than number of depressive symptoms. Although depression will respond to treatment in most people, at least half will have a further episode of depression after their first episode, and in 10% it will follow a persistent or chronic course. Therefore, the treatment of depression in primary care should often adopt a chronic disease management approach in which symptoms should be tracked at baseline and longitudinally throughout the treatment course, and treatment adherence and side effects should be monitored. Adjustments should be made to a patient’s treatment plan over time, on the basis of these systematic assessments. As the comparative effectiveness of one intervention over another for the treatment of depression is limited, an individual patient’s personal preferences and circumstances should be considered alongside the clinical evidence. Treatment choice should, therefore, ideally be informed by a shared decision making (SDM) approach, in which the clinician and the patient, informed about the range of options available, arrive at a healthcare choice together. A cluster randomized controlled trial in 2015 of 117 patients and 301 primary care clinicians found that the use of a decision aid improved satisfaction with the decision between clinicians and patients, reducing conflict, and improved patients’ knowledge about treatment options without affecting the duration of the clinical encounter. The decision aid had no effect on clinical outcomes or adherence to drug treatment. However, the time for the consultation in both intervention and control groups was 40 minutes, so more practicable approaches to SDM in primary care need to be studied. The SDM approach is consistent with the growing interest in empowering patients to become equal partners in the management of their condition and extends to decisions on when to intervene. NICE, for example, advocates active monitoring for subthreshold forms of depression and in patients who present with mild depression and do not want treatment. It is important to recognize that active monitoring is not a passive process (as suggested by its older term “watchful waiting”) but involves consistent, longitudinal, systematic assessment of clinical state and some degree of supportive counseling and problem solving. An RCT in 2013 of 220 patients randomized to receive active monitoring before starting drug treatment in primary care found that a significant minority (16-22%) recalled that a discussion with their general practitioners changed their thinking or their personal relationships or made them feel more able to talk to family and friends. Psychological interventions have long been established as treatments for relieving or reducing depressive symptoms. Recent decades have seen increasing diversification in the theory and practice of psychological treatments into a variety of individual, group, short term, and long term options. For the purposes of this review, we concentrate on therapies that can be feasibly delivered in primary care settings, defined as those that are time limited, require fewer resources, and lend themselves to being put into practice (). These include low intensity treatments that are brief and have minimal (or sometimes no) input from a trained professional, such as guided self help, computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT), and psychological counseling, as well as high intensity treatments that are delivered face to face by a qualified psychotherapist in group or individual settings and include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy, behavioral activation, and short term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP). Most commonly delivered psychological interventions in primary care. All are brief and time limited (at most 16 weeks), except for short term psychodynamic psychotherapy (20-30 weeks) Several systematic reviews have found little or no difference in the effectiveness of different modalities of brief, time limited therapies—either low or high intensity—compared with longer term interventions such as long term psychoanalytic or psychodynamic approaches. A large meta-analysis of 30 studies covering 5159 participants with a range of depressive conditions from chronic subthreshold depression to MDD in the primary care setting found effect sizes in the small to moderate range for a variety of psychological therapies. Standardized mean differences ranged from –0.24 (95% confidence interval –0.47 to –0.02) for face to face interpersonal therapy and –0.30 (–0.40 to –0.13) for face to face CBT to –0.40 (–0.69 to –0.11) for guided self help (where a negative number favors the intervention). Of all psychological interventions, CBT is the most studied. Evidence suggests that CBT has efficacy over treatment as usual, particularly for the treatment of depression with comorbid physical conditions, but effectiveness over other psychological, or pharmacological, interventions for depression has not been established. We also found good evidence to support the use of problem solving therapy, particularly in situational forms of depression (that is, those reactive to stressful social circumstances) and for interpersonal therapy in treatment of acute depression and in relapse prevention (). Factors affecting the outcomes of psychological interventions Several studies and meta-analyses support the finding that the therapeutic relationship between therapist and client may be more predictive of the outcome of therapy than the actual type of therapy provided. These relational factors include qualities within the therapist such as the client’s perceptions of the therapist’s empathy and credibility (“genuineness”), as well as particular behaviors or skills including empathic understanding, defined as the degree to which the therapist successfully communicates personal understanding of the client’s experience; positive regard, defined as the extent to which the therapist communicates non-judgmental care and respect; and congruence, or the extent to which the therapist is non-defensive and “real.” The possibility of fostering and maintaining this relationship through remote technology, particularly through video messaging and online, has received great interest in primary care. In the meta-analysis of psychological interventions in primary care described above, remotely delivered therapies had equivalent outcomes to those delivered in person, replicating an earlier review in 2011. Until recently, the potential for CBT to be provided online, without regular guidance from a trained psychologist, had garnered mixed results through RCTs. However, in 2017, a meta-analysis of self guided, internet based CBT using individual participant data of 3876 participants from 13 studies found that self guided internet CBT was significantly more effective than controls for treatment response (odds ratio 1.95, 1.52 to 2.50; number needed to treat 8). Adherence to treatment was associated with greater response (β=0.90; P<0.001). In contrast, unstructured psychological interventions such as self help and generic counseling have been found to be less effective when delivered in the absence of a therapist or with minimal therapeutic contact. Overall, the evidence suggests that non-specific factors such as the therapeutic relationship and the client’s expectations are very important for the outcome of most therapies, particularly in low intensity, unstructured interventions such as generic counseling or self help, and that this therapeutic relationship can be maintained through remote technologies. Moreover, emerging evidence shows that for highly structured interventions such as CBT, the therapy may be delivered in a highly manualized form, without the influence of a therapist, and so may be a useful first step for people with mild to moderate depression in primary care. Although there is a dearth of research on the possible harms of psychological interventions, these interventions are not without risk. One recent study found that 1 in 20 people reported lasting adverse effects based on a national survey of 14 587 respondents who had received psychological treatments for anxiety or depression in England. The survey did not qualify the types of adverse effects, but the separate development of a recently validated questionnaire to identify the negative effects of psychological treatments (the Negative Effects Questionnaire) found that the most common harms reported were resurfacing of unpleasant memories (38%), increased lasting stress (38%), and increase in anxiety (37%). The impact of these adverse effects is not known, but primary care providers should make patients aware that anxiety may increase on starting therapy before improvement in depressive symptoms is achieved. Antidepressants are often considered the cornerstone of treatment. However, several guidelines, including those from NICE in England and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, reserve the use of antidepressants for moderate to severe forms of depression, where severity is defined by impact on everyday functioning. Prescription of antidepressants worldwide is increasing. A retrospective analysis of antidepressant prescribing trends in UK primary care in 2016 found that whereas the rate of antidepressant prescribing increased from 61.9 per 1000 person years in 1995 to 129.9 per 1000 person years in 2011, the incidence of new prescriptions did not (21.3/1000 person years in 1995; 17.9/1000 person years in 2011). Therefore, upward trends in primary care may be better explained by the longer use of antidepressants rather than an increase in new prescriptions. This may reflect the growing awareness of depression as a chronic or relapsing-remitting disorder, similar to other long term conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or asthma, and, as for those conditions, drug intervention should be titrated according to routine and regular monitoring. shows the classes of antidepressants. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are recommended as first line agents because of their tolerability and costs, and this is reflected in general prescribing practices over the past few years. In 2010, by far the most commonly prescribed class of antidepressants in America was the SSRIs, followed by bupropion, and the serotonin-norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). In UK primary care, SSRIs were also the most commonly prescribed antidepressants followed by tricyclic antidepressants and SNRIs (bupropion is not licensed for the treatment of depression in the UK). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)—for example, amitriptyline, clomipramine, nortriptyline Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)—for example, phenelzine, tranylcypromine Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (sometimes called second generation antidepressants): Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)—for example, citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)—for example, duloxetine, venlafaxine Serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs)—for example, trazodone, nefazodone Atypical antidepressants (sometimes called third generation antidepressants): Norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI)—bupropion Until recently, several systematic reviews had not been able to establish firm conclusions on the efficacy or tolerability of one antidepressant (any SSRI, duloxetine, mirtazapine, venlafaxine) over another. However, in 2018, a large network meta-analysis comparing 21 antidepressants with placebo or another antidepressant in adults with MDD found comparative differences. The review included 522 double blind RCTs (116 477 participants) and, importantly, included a substantial volume of unpublished data. All antidepressants were more effective than placebo for both remission and response, with amitriptyline, mirtazapine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and paroxetine being the most efficacious (range of odds ratios 1.75-2.13 for response) and clomipramine, trazadone, citalopram, fluoxetine, and bupropion being least effective (1.49-1.58 for response). Agomelatine, fluoxetine, and escitalopram were better tolerated than other antidepressants (range of odds ratios 0.43-0.77), whereas amitriptyline, duloxetine, trazadone, and venlafaxine had the highest dropout rates (1.30-2.32). This review focused only on the acute treatment of depression (eight weeks), and the vast majority of participants (89%) had moderate to severe depression. This is especially relevant to primary care populations, which have a higher prevalence of mild to moderate depression compared with those in specialist settings, and thus such significant differences may not translate across to populations with less severe and/or more chronic depression. The most recent meta-analysis on the effectiveness of antidepressants restricted to primary care analyzed 66 studies (15 161 participants) and found modest effect sizes for SSRIs over placebo (odds ratio 1.69, 1.40 to 2.04). It also concluded that no comparative differences exist between the different classes of antidepressants. Drug selection, therefore, still often depends on the relative side effect profile of the various antidepressants () and the patient’s preference. Relative side effects of antidepressants commonly prescribed in primary care Tricyclic antidepressants have adverse cardiovascular and anticholinergic effects and are particularly toxic in overdose, limiting their use. SSRIs tend to have a more benign side effect profile (except in older adults; see below). The most common side effects are headache and gastrointestinal symptoms. As previously noted, depression is highly comorbid with other conditions, both behavioral and physical, and the risks associated with polypharmacy and antidepressants is an important concern in primary care, particularly in older adults. In 2012 the American Geriatric Society categorized SSRIs as potentially inappropriate drugs for older adults with a history of falls or fractures. Several studies have found an association between the use of all antidepressants, particularly SSRIs, and falls and fractures in older adults. An older longitudinal analysis (1997-2004) of 2948 older people living in the community found an adjusted odds ratio of 1.62 (1.15 to 2.28) for SSRIs and 1.48 (1.12 to 1.96) for antidepressants overall. However, most evidence to date comes from observational studies; and use of antidepressants and falls are both common in this patient population, so causation cannot be inferred. SSRIs also significantly increase the risk of gastrointestinal, and possibly cerebrovascular, bleeds in older adults, although the odds are modest (odds ratio 1.66, 1.44 to 1.92 for upper gastrointestinal bleeding) except when combined with other high risk drugs (for example, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: odds ratio 4.25, 2.82 to 6.42). Taken together, these findings suggest that primary care providers should use antidepressants, and particularly the SSRIs, with caution in older adults and possibly at lower doses and with more active monitoring for side effects. All antidepressants exert maximal effects within the first two weeks of treatment. If no response has occurred by three weeks, the drug should be changed or the dose increased. However, as slow responders have also been described, even minimal improvement at three weeks could suggest eventual response. Depression is a relapsing-remitting illness in 50-85% of patients, and about half of all people who stop their antidepressants immediately on remission will have a relapse within three to six months. Evidence supports continuing treatment for at least six months after remission, as this has been shown to reduce the three year odds of relapse by 65%. At least a third of patients have symptoms on stopping antidepressants. Withdrawal effects can occur with all antidepressants, with the possible exception of the recently introduced agomelatine and vortioxetine. Symptoms are most likely with drugs that have short half lives (for example, paroxetine and venlafaxine) and present as flu-like symptoms, electric shock-like sensations, irritability, insomnia, dizziness, and increased tearfulness. They usually appear within five days of cessation and may be mild and self limiting; however, in some cases they can interfere with functioning. The incidence may be reduced by gradually withdrawing antidepressants over four weeks. Fluoxetine, the SSRI with the longest half life, has the lowest association with withdrawal symptoms of all the SSRIs. Although drugs and psychological interventions are the principal modes of treatment for depression, interest has been growing around reducing the population risk of depression by modifying social factors or enhancing individual wellbeing through lifestyle modifications. Unfortunately, the evidence base for the effect of practical social or self help on depressive outcomes remains poor, although it is growing. Most studied have been the effects of physical activity, sleep hygiene, and measures to reduce social isolation on depression. Of these, the effect of physical activity holds most promise. In 2017 a meta-analysis of 49 prospective cohort studies (266 939 participants followed up for 1 837 794 person years) found that high levels of physical activity (as measured by a composite score of self reported frequency, intensity, and volume of exercise) reduced the odds of developing depression compared with low levels of physical activity in adults (adjusted odds ratio 0.78, 0.70 to 0.87). Overall, the quality of the studies was moderate to high; however, the impact of physical activity on acute depression was less robust. A meta-analysis of 35 RCTs (2498 participants) found a modest effect favoring exercise over no treatment or treatment as usual (pooled standardized mean difference of –0.66 (–0.86 to –0.46) in reducing severity of depressive symptoms. However, when only high quality studies were included, the pooled standardized mean difference was not statistically significant for improvement, remission, or quality of life. A strong bidirectional association has been found between reduction in sleep duration and quality and depression, but few well conducted studies have considered the effect of sleep interventions on depression. A small RCT in 41 participants with depression and insomnia, in which CBT for insomnia delivered by a therapist for four sessions was compared with an eight week self help program, found a significant reduction in depressive symptoms for CBT for insomnia that was maintained at three month follow-up. All participants were also treated with antidepressants. Studies on social isolation are small, lack external validity, or have found no significant effects on depressive outcomes. The evidence supports lifestyle interventions as possible adjuncts to established treatments for depression. They may have more positive benefits on intermediate outcomes such as reducing loneliness, improving self esteem, and reducing fatigue than for improving depressive disorder itself and so could be offered to patients who wish not to have psychological or drug treatments and are deemed suitable—for example, those in whom an active monitoring approach is taken. Physical activity seems to have the strongest evidence base, although further high quality research is needed before it can be recommended as a standalone treatment, even in mild depression. Despite this, primary care providers have an important role in supporting the overall health and wellbeing of patients, many of whom have multiple comorbidities. As such, lifestyle modifications can be an important approach to patient centered care more generally. The approach to the management of depression when the first intervention fails was established by the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial, one of the largest RCTs in mental illness research (n=2876). This set a landmark in proposing the treatment of next choice for people with depression. Over seven years, a series of pragmatic RCTs were conducted to evaluate various drug treatments and CBT as augmentation or switching strategies for patients who did not respond to citalopram (chosen as the index antidepressant) (). The study design limited the randomization of participants at each level of the process to only his/her range of acceptable treatments in an effort to reflect clinical practice accurately. Participants had to have at least moderate depression as measured on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The primary outcome was remission, with response, defined as an improvement of 50% from baseline, as a secondary outcome. About a third of participants achieved remission with citalopram and a further 10-15% responded but did not reach remission. At the second level, about 25% of participants recovered. STAR*D algorithm. At level 1, participants were given the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram for 12-14 weeks. Those who recovered were followed up for a 12 month period during which citalopram was continued. Those who did not recover or could not tolerate citalopram could move on to the next level. Level 2 was designed to help determine an appropriate next treatment step between switching to a different drug and adding on to the existing citalopram. Those who joined the “switch” arm were randomly assigned to sertraline, bupropion, or venlafaxine. These drugs were chosen for comparison because they represent three different classes of antidepressants: sertraline, like citalopram, is an SSRI; venlafaxine is a “dual action” reuptake inhibitor with both norepinephrine and serotonergic actions, and bupropion is an atypical antidepressant that acts on different neurotransmitters. Participants who chose to augment were given either the atypical antidepressant bupropion or buspirone, which is not an antidepressant but enhances the action of antidepressants. Participants could also switch to, or add on, cognitive psychotherapy. Those who did not become symptom free after 14 weeks, or who experienced intolerable side effects, could continue on to the next level. At level 3, those who chose to switch were randomly assigned to either mirtazapine (a tetracyclic antidepressant) or to nortriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant). Both have a different mechanism of action from any of the antidepressants that had been tried before. In the level 3 augmentation arm, participants were randomly assigned to either lithium or triiodothyronine, both of which potentiate the effectiveness of antidepressant drugs. At level 4, participants who had not become symptom free at any of the previous levels (and were therefore considered to have highly treatment resistant depression) were taken off all other drugs and randomly switched to one of two treatments—the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) tranylcypromine or a combination of venlafaxine and mirtazapine. These treatments were selected to compare a first generation antidepressant, rarely used except when other antidepressants have failed, and a combination strategy that had been suggested to have benefit in treatment resistant depression from earlier research. CBT=cognitive behavioral therapy; R=remission; r=response (taken to mean 50% reduction in depression rating scale) Importantly, no significant differences were seen in the strategies tried. Over the course of all four treatment levels, almost 70% of patients who did not withdraw from the study became symptom free, but the proportion who recovered diminished with each further step. The rate at which participants withdrew from the trial was clinically significant and rose with each level, doubling from 21% dropout after level 1 to 42% dropout after level 3. The STAR*D trial established that a stepwise approach to the management of depression is effective, and when one intervention has failed another intervention—whether a switch to or augmentation with a drug from the same or a different class or talking therapy—may prove effective. However, efficacy reduces with each intervention tried, and intolerability increases. Primary care providers may not feel comfortable managing depression by using all the steps trialed in STAR*D—for example, augmentation with lithium or triiodothyronine or the use of tranylcypromine. Most guidelines and professional organizations such as the American Association of Family Physicians have suggested inviting specialist input after two failed interventions in depression (often taken to signify treatment resistance in depression). Given the complexities of managing treatment resistant depression (TRD) in primary care, we support this recommendation. However, individual providers may need to balance these recommendations against ease of access to specialists and other barriers to referral. Several international studies have shown that only about 20-25% of patients with depression are referred for specialist mental healthcare. Primary care providers encounter considerable barriers, both organizational and individual, when referring patients to specialist mental health settings, including availability of and access to the preferred professional, speed of response, and timely provision of information back to the primary care provider. Newer models of integrated care can obviate the need for actual referral by using blended in-reach and outreach approaches—for example, through care coordinators supervised by psychiatrists. The decision to refer patients for specialist input is complex, involving clinician, patient, and practice related factors. Considerable variation exists in individual referral rates, as primary care providers tend to use clinical judgment rather than recommended guidance on when to refer patients. Therapeutic confidence in managing an individual patient’s depression and perceived severity of depression seem to play a strong part. When guidelines are strictly followed, the proportion of people referred increases to about 60%, suggesting that family physicians manage a significant burden of disease. English, European, and Australian guidelines recommend referral to specialist services for severe depression, particularly if mood congruent psychotic features are present and if considerable suicidal risk exists. NICE in England and the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement in the US suggest that earlier referral should be considered when depression co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders (particularly anxiety disorders and personality disorders) or complicates physical illness, or if multiple somatic concerns exist. Most guidelines advocate referral for TRD. TRD is usually taken to mean failure to respond to two antidepressant drugs of different classes taken at adequate doses for at least four weeks each. The STAR*D trial found that 50% of patients, drawn from a combination of primary care and outpatient psychiatric clinics in the US, met this definition. A more recent Canadian estimate of the prevalence of TRD in primary care alone found the figure to be lower at 22%, based on a case report analysis of 1212 patients receiving antidepressants, probably reflecting the milder forms of depression seen in primary care populations. Many of the strategies used to manage TRD are unsuitable in primary care, either because they require specialist input on initiation such as the strategies advocated in STAR*D or other common practices used now such as augmentation with second generation antipsychotics (olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine) or because of lack of provision, for example, for psychoanalytic psychotherapy. However, primary care providers still play an important role in the assessment and management of TRD. Firstly, they can help in distinguishing treatment resistance from inadequate treatment. Multiple studies have found non-adherence to antidepressants to be as high as 40-50% in community samples. Some evidence suggests that most patients considered to have TRD in primary care have not had drugs prescribed at the recommended doses or for the recommended length of time or have not taken them as prescribed. Secondly, primary care providers help in monitoring the effect and some of the side effects of commonly used treatment strategies such as augmentation with lithium or antipsychotics. Finally, given the difficulties in accessing specialist services that some patients encounter, primary care providers may wish to be aware of some emerging strategies for TRD that may be suitable in primary care. For example, the CoBalT study in 2012 recruited 469 participants with TRD from 73 general practices across England and Scotland and compared augmentation of antidepressants with 12-18 sessions of CBT with treatment as usual. It found an odds ratio of 2.89 (2.03 to 4.10) for treatment response at 12 months after augmentation with CBT, giving a number needed to treat of four for response. The study needs to be replicated, but it suggests that drug treatment in combination with psychological input may be more effective than either alone. Strategies for effective management of depression in primary care The management of depression in the primary care setting is often suboptimal, and evidence suggests that as few as 20-40% of older adults with depression or dysthymic disorder prescribed treatment for depression in primary care show substantial clinical improvements at 12 months. Time constraints, conflicting demands, and diverging priorities are major barriers to primary care providers effectively treating depression. Thus, to meet the needs of patients and the expectations for implementing evidence based approaches to care, primary care providers will need to be better prepared to diagnose and treat depression and, perhaps more importantly, be supported by a practice infrastructure that adapts the functionality of the chronic care model. Purchasers and policy makers will also need to develop and implement policies that support and incentivize these structures and activities in the primary care setting. Despite their increasing role in the management of depression,primary care providers typically have minimal training in behavioral health. Poor levels of detection, treatment, and monitoring of depression have been extensively documented. Providers often feel ill prepared to meet the needs of these patients, and training for depression has been perceived as inadequate by some professionals.The delivery of behavioral health services in the primary care setting thus requires a new approach to the way physicians are trained and monitored to practice across the span of their primary care careers. Considerable research has been conducted to identify specific strategies to improve the performance of primary care professionals in recognizing and treating depression. Most efforts that have focused on improving screening, education of primary care professionals, development of clear treatment guidelines, and strengthening referral systems have been ineffective in reducing the burden of depression in primary care overall. Educating primary care professionals on the detection and treatment of depression alone has not been found to improve recognition, treatment, or outcomes for depression. However, a systematic review in 2012 showed that training plus the additional implementation of guidelines and the use of more complex interventions in primary care resulted in a significant reduction in depressive symptoms. Importantly, the consistent use of a measurement based care (MBC) approachto management of depression in the primary care setting has emerged as a strategic approach that involves patients in the decision making process and assures that they do not “fall through the cracks.” MBC, defined as enhanced precision and consistency in disease assessment, tracking, and treatment to achieve optimal outcomes, is an approach that has been used universally in the chronic medical disease management model and offers great potential for the management of depression in primary care. MBC has several key features, which are summarized in . Essential elements for measurement based care in primary care setting Based on psychometrically and conceptually sound clinical measures Action oriented and evidence based for stepped care Flexible to allow treatment revision and adaptation MBC, however, is not without its limitations, and critics cite concerns about a focus on measurement,potentially at the expense of the doctor-patient relationship. An MBC approach should complement the primary care professional’s clinical judgment, and, as with treating any chronic illness, working with patients to improve their adaptive and problem solving skills as well as their capacity for self management and self monitoring should also be a priority.Primary care professionals play an important role in creating a positive experience of careoverall, and they must establish a therapeutic alliance with patients, as well as with families and caregivers. Importantly, when considering their role, primary care providers must determine the level of intervention that the practice can support to manage depression effectively. If a team based approach is in place in the practice, the primary care professional should assume a central leadership role. If a referral is made, he or she must function as the coordinator of care, ensuring timely and consistent communication with the specialist. The nature and quality of collaboration and continuity often depend on communication and the referral relationship itself, which may affect patients’ outcomes and the overall quality of care. These findings support the growing recognition that structural changes within a practice are often needed to appropriately manage depression in primary care. Developed according to the principles of chronic care, models for the pragmatic delivery of care for people with depression in primary care have emerged with a strong evidence base, particularly the collaborative care model (CCM). A recent systematic review found that this team based approach was associated with significant improvement in depression outcomes compared with usual care. In many ways the CCM operationalizes the MBC approach through three core processes (). The CCM can improve physical and mental health outcomes in primary care with little to no net health costs. However, it has not been adopted widely outside well resourced or academic centers, as successful implementation requires alignment of financial incentives to support system redesign, adequate funding to sustain change, and adaptation to local contexts and practices. New evidence from qualitative systems-wide analysis has shown that a multitude of structural factors (for example, co-location of care, electronic infrastructure), processes (team working, care coordination, quality outcome measurement), external contexts (reimbursement, licensing arrangements), and internal factors (organizational culture) interact with each other to either facilitate or hinder effective delivery of mental healthcare in primary care. Integration of primary care and specialist mental healthcare can therefore be considered a product of transformative change that is dependent on internal and extra-organizational systems and contexts. Core processes involved in the collaborative care model A multidisciplinary group of health professionals (usually a primary care provider, care management staff, and psychiatrist) provides care in a coordinated fashion, being collectively responsible for the health outcomes of a defined population of patients The members of the team are empowered to work at the top of their professional training by delivering specifically proven, evidence based treatments in a such manner that the most effective yet least resource intensive treatment is delivered first, “stepping” up or down according to response The team uses systematic, disease specific, patient reported outcome measures (for example, symptom rating scales) to drive clinical decision making In such a complex landscape, primary care providers can feel overwhelmed by healthcare delivery redesign and struggle with how to implement this type of team based care for patients with mental health needs in the primary care setting. To meet the challenge, a framework has been developed that delineates the steps primary care practices can take to build up towards more advanced models of integrated care delivery for people with common mental disorders. With use of a maturity matrix structure, options for implementation include screening and referral processes; multidisciplinary team working; care coordination; systematic quality improvement; measurement based, stepped care; self management; and linking with community/social services, which can be adopted singly or in combination according to local need and the strengths of providers. The framework is being piloted in the state of New York. In addition to preparing providers to apply appropriate clinical strategies at the primary care level and building a practice infrastructure, it is important to establish a set of connections with behavioral health specialists and other resources in the community, along with policies that promote and encourage better outcomes for patients. Primary care practices should have a network of trusted and reliable specialist partners that can provide both formal and informal consultation, as well as ongoing care for more complex or treatment resistant patients whose needs extend beyond the practice’s capacity. Ideally, these partnerships should be characterized by having formalized agreements that specify respective responsibilities, assure access, provide “greased” referral mechanisms, include information sharing arrangements, and detail any financial expectations. Effective care often involves tackling the key social determinants of health, along with behavioral health conditions. Thus, it is important to foster effective linkages to housing, vocational, and other supportive social services and to community organizations and resources, and for relevant social determinants to be incorporated into care plans. Current reimbursement and accountability models generally fail to support and incentivize both the establishment and maintenance of the recommended practice infrastructure and provider behaviors. Payment policies, regardless of the system of care in which they are embedded, need to provide flexibility, start-up cost support, integrated team training, data management infrastructure, and incentives for establishing and sustaining the practices described above. One major mechanism to facilitate such transformative change is the accountable care organizations initially developed in America, and now being translated to European and Australian contexts. These facilitate coordination across a range of provider settings and link reimbursement to improvements in outcomes for a defined patient population. There are clear synergies between accountable care organizations and the processes advanced by the CCM. The key will be adapting newly developed payment policies and accountability mechanisms to instill a sense of shared accountability between behavioral health and general medical providers. Newer payment approaches need flexibility to circumvent limitations in fee-for-service models and support the CCM infrastructure—for example, by incorporation of care coordinators. An essential step will be the development of quality measures at the interface of depression and physical health. At present, ratified measures—and indeed clinical guidelines—tend to focus on single conditions, whereas depression often co-occurs with other conditions, both physical and psychiatric. Work has begun to identify the gaps in the evidence base and prioritize areas of need for the development of quality outcomes, both clinical and personal recovery focused, that could aid primary care professionals in their goal of meeting the physical, psychological, and social needs of their patients with depression. New and emerging interventions have been, or are in the process of being, developed in psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and physical treatments for the management of depression. Most of these are still used principally in experimental or specialist settings, but they may become more widespread in the future. The so-called third wave psychotherapies seem to have the most applicability to primary care. These are a heterogeneous group of therapies that both expand and deviate from traditional cognitive and/or behavioral approaches and include acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Whereas previous modalities have aimed to eliminate or reduce problematic cognitions or dysfunctional behaviors, third wave therapies focus on empowering the patient by increasing skills and behavioral repertoires so as to be able to respond to various stressful and non-stressful events. They have been of particular interest in the treatment of depression co-occurring with complex physical illnesses such as cancer or physical pain. Two meta-analyses of ACT in a variety of mental and physical problems found it to have small to moderate effects sizes over control in reducing depression. However, both analyses suggested serious biases in the published literature. A systematic review found “very low quality evidence” that ACT was as effective as traditional CBT in the treatment of depression. MBCT has weak evidence of efficacy in treating acute depression. However an individual data level meta-analysis of 1248 participants that found fewer patients who received MBCT had a depressive relapse over a 60 month follow-up compared with non-MBCT interventions (including drugs) or control (hazard ratio 0.69, 0.58 to 0.82), suggesting that it may be more efficacious in the prevention of depressive relapse than in the treatment of the acute disorder. New drug treatments for depression have also become available but are not yet routinely used in primary care. Some are unsuitable for use in primary care. Ketamine, a glutamatergic antagonist, for example, has received much attention and may produce dramatic effects in symptom reduction; however, it is administered by intravenous infusion and is associated with significant adverse effects including potential for abuse. Attempts to deliver it intranasally have proved disappointing. However, since the acceptance of this review for publication the US Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of an intranasally delivered form of ketamine (esketamine) for treatment resistant depression. The promise of ketamine has raised the possibility of developing compounds to target neurotransmitters beyond the traditional serotonergic and noradrenergic systems. These include cannabinoid derivatives and anti-inflammatories. Early studies with celecoxib (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) in combination with SSRIs have provided mixed results on efficacy and tolerability. More success has been seen with agomelatine, a melatonin receptor agonist. A large network meta-analysis published in 2018 found that agomelatine was more effective than other antidepressants in head-to-head comparisons and was better tolerated, although both these results may have been skewed by the novelty effect. Primary care providers should generally be aware of the growing interest in the use of non-invasive physical procedures such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to manage depression. A powerful electromagnet is placed on the scalp and produces electrical currents in specific cortical and subcortical structures of the brain. Most of the literature has assessed its efficacy in TRD, in which good evidence shows that it performs better than sham treatment. A meta-analysis of 81 RCTs (4233 participants) found that rTMS was significantly more effective than sham treatment for response, acceptability, and remission (odds ratios varied from 2.48 and 4.95 depending on the location of the nodes and intensity of the rTMS being delivered). However, rTMS did not outperform any active comparators, replicating previous findings that it is not superior to other treatments for TRD such as electroconvulsive therapy. Primary care professionals should, therefore, advise patients that it may benefit some patients with TRD, but not all, and there is not enough evidence to support its use as monotherapy. Effective management of depression in primary care requires strategies at the individual and organizational level. shows our recommendations. At the individual level, choosing the most suitable intervention depends on clinical and person specific factors, including relative benefits and harms, interactions with other conditions or interventions, previous response, and the patient’s preference. Treatment choice should be considered a collaborative venture in which the most preferable intervention is chosen according to the patient’s circumstances and preferences. Collaboration is also needed within the wider system. Adequately training primary care providers in the recognition and treatment of depression and mechanisms to facilitate efficient working practices between specialist and primary care services (such as routine measurement based care) can support primary care professionals to better help their patients with depression. How can we further develop the science of “precision medicine” for depression treatment to inform such questions as: For relatively mild forms of depression, how can patients and their primary care providers differentiate who should receive “watchful waiting” (that is truly watchful, consistent with measurement based care) and who should receive active intervention? How can primary care professionals determine to which drugs a patient is most likely to respond? To which psychological therapy? To which combination of the two? How can primary care professionals differentiate patients who may develop manic symptoms in response to antidepressant treatment? What are the most effective strategies in treating treatment resistant depression? Given the bidirectional impact of depression and social, employment, educational, and economic outcomes, how can primary care professionals best integrate interventions across healthcare and social service settings? What are the best ways to train, support, and incentivize healthcare professionals to recognize, understand, and effectively treat depression? We sought feedback from several different sources in compiling and modifying our reviews. Members of the Wellbeing Network Hounslow Community who live with depression in west London gave us feedback on the written manuscripts. They placed a particular emphasis on being actively listened to by their general practitioners (GPs) when presenting with depression and for GPs to take a holistic view of their condition. Patients wanted to feel included in treatment decisions and to be able to build trusting relationships with their GP. Self management strategies, supportive therapy, and, when needed, targeted psychotherapy were held in high regard. Many people commented on the lack of time GPs had and the need for specific training on assessing and managing mental health needs, especially when co-occurring with other illnesses such as anxiety disorders or physical conditions. Members of the Ealing Primary Care Mental Health Services Service Users Forum also shared insights from their care being transferred from specialist to primary care services in England. Common themes included adjusting to the reduced frequency of contact in primary care (compared with specialist services); how to access care, particularly in crisis; and the level of mental health training available to primary care professionals. Care coordination functions and a single point of contact were frequently proposed solutions to some of these difficulties. Finally, we sought individual and personal insight from a retired GP who has lived with paraplegia from a spinal cord injury for many years as well as with major depressive disorder, which is treatment resistant. The depression preceded the spinal cord injury and is unrelated to it. He told one of the authors (PR) that at times the depression has been more disabling for him than his paraplegia. He spoke about his experiences of living with both mental and physical disability, which exemplified many of the themes identified through the focus groups: “I was taking antidepressants at the time of my accident (although I was not depressed). Early on in my rehabilitation I did become depressed and had suicidal thoughts, perhaps because my antidepressants were stopped and on discharge I became very fed up. The difference between being in a wheelchair-friendly hospital environment and the outside world was stark. This was 30 years ago when things were worse than they are now. After a year or so I did improve on antidepressants and went back to work. For the next 25 years I was fine—not bothered by my disability. Although I continued to have recurrent depression, it was treated successfully with medication. I had an active life filled with holidays, academic interests, and spinal cord injury charities. But over the past two years things have got worse. The antidepressants no longer controlled my depression and the symptoms resulted in me spending most of my life in bed asleep or in a chair. As a result, I became less fit, less strong, and more disabled. The depression and increased disability resulted in less social contact. I resent my disability now.”* *Written permission to use this quote has been granted by the subject.

Overview Holistic psychotherapy utilizes traditional and non-traditional therapies of holistic healing with the purpose of creating an integration of the mind, body and spirit. The idea combines a broad range of different holistic approaches to help the patient reach the deepest level of healing possible. Holistic psychotherapy services include traditional talk psychotherapy and non-traditional therapies including hypnosis, heart-centered hypnotherapy/regression therapy, breath therapy and guided imagery. Traditional talk psychotherapy is used for patients not ready for non-traditional therapies. This approach includes psychoanalytic/psychodynamic, cognitive/behavioral, developmental, educational, family systems and humanistic therapies that utilize a strength perspective to match the individual needs of the patient. Non-traditional therapies are based on a variety of traditions, which tap into different levels of mind-body-spirit healing. These therapies involve energy work, elements from different traditions of healing as well as from the field of transpersonal psychology. All therapies have a strong spiritual component, which utilizes different levels of consciousness and spiritual awareness. : a treatment intervention that induces the client into a relaxed state. The clinician then provides post-hypnotic suggestion for relief from symptoms. A trance is a natural occurring state, so anyone can be hypnotized. Only a light to medium state of hypnotic trance is necessary for effective therapy. or : a form of psychotherapy in which the patient is placed in a hypnotic, altered state of consciousness for the purpose of re-working or re-framing unhealthy behaviors. This process can allow for deep healing to take place because of the energetic or emotional release and the level of insight that can be attained. : is a natural healing method that uses high vibrational energy to reduce stored emotions and past trauma that may contribute to disease. This type of therapy allows the patient to re-introduce breathing as a way to heal and restore the body, mind and spirit and activate healing agents in our body and soul. : is widely used to create tangible changes in a patient’s overall health by actively creating images of well-being. It can help the patient reduce the effects of certain medical and emotional conditions. Holistic psychotherapy is only delivered by a clinician with a license in clinical social work, clinical counseling, or psychology and certification in advanced clinical hypnotherapy. Services are provided at . What To Expect What does holistic psychotherapy treatment involve? During the first session, the clinician will go through a comprehensive assessment with the patient, which includes elements of a traditional bio-psycho-social assessment along with various holistic traditions. This session last between 45 to 50 minutes which allows for the patient and clinician to set goals for treatment. During all sessions, the clinician will best address the patient’s specific needs, allowing for greater flexibility between the different therapies as treatment progresses. What We Treat Holistic psychotherapy can help reduce symptoms of various ailments At the Center for Integrative & Lifestyle Medicine, our holistic psychotherapy clinicians specialize in the treatment of physical illness and disease, emotional issues, family dynamics, stage of life issues, work-related issues, sexual abuse, trauma, addiction (substances, food and unwanted behaviors), and stress and anxiety. It does not take the place of traditional medicine, but does work in conjunction with it to help the healing process. Holistic psychotherapy primarily looks at specific areas of the body from an emotional, spiritual and energetic perspective and is designed to help heal the origin of the disease. Each patient responds differently to holistic psychotherapy. The Center for Integrative & Lifestyle Medicine recommends that patients attend each session with an open mind to receive the full benefits of the process. Patients currently prescribed psychotropic medications for mental health or who are under psychiatric treatment may still benefit from holistic psychotherapy.

Find our information and support and more on our work ""We Need to Talk Wales"": New Coalition launches report calling for improved access to psychological therapies ""We Need to Talk Wales"": New Coalition launches report calling for improved access to psychological therapies A new coalition of mental health charities, professional organisations and service providers in Wales, including Mind Cymru, says that patients in Wales need better access to psychological therapies. While recognising and welcoming recent Welsh Government investment in this area, the ‘We Need to Talk (Wales)’ coalition is concerned that too many people are still waiting too long to access psychological therapies and do not have enough choice over the type, timing and location of this form of treatment. The Coalition haspublished a reportwhich promotes four key priorities in improving access to psychological therapies for patients. The report, launched by the Minister for Social Services and Health, Rebeca Evans AM, says: People of all ages should have access to psychological therapies within 28 days in both primary and secondary care. People should be able to make an informed choice about accessing a full range of evidence based psychological therapies. The views of users should be at the heart of the system – they should be valued, respected and recorded to improve services. The long term impact of psychological therapies on people’s lives should be measured by Welsh Government. The report draws on evidence from across the UK and beyond which shows that improved choice and access to evidence based psychological therapies delivers better outcomes for individuals as well as savings to the public purse in health and social security. Programmes such as The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme in England (IAPT) have provided over a million people with access to psychological therapies on the NHS, with research showing that there have been reductions to individual healthcare usage and use of long-term repeat prescriptions. The cost of mental health problems in Wales is estimated at £7.2bn per year and the National Prescribing Indicators 2015-16 (The Annual Primary Care Prescribing Report) show an average increase of 8.11% of anti-depressant prescriptions over the years 2013/14 to 2014/15, with a rise in all health boards across Wales. Whilst valuing the role medication can play in mental health treatment, the Coalition believes that there should be a greater focus on, and access to, psychological therapies focused on addressing the specific needs in Wales. The We Need to Talk (Wales) coalition has welcomed the investment made by Welsh Government, and the development of the Wales Psychological Therapies Plan for Adult Mental Health, which aims to improve access to psychological therapies. The Together for Mental Health draft delivery plan for 2016-19 reiterates a 28 day target for interventions in primary care and requires health boards to report on the 26 week referral to treatment target in specialist secondary mental health services for all patients. However, the We Need to Talk (Wales) coalition believes that people in need of primary and secondary mental health services should be able to access psychological therapies within 28 days of a referral request as early intervention improves outcomes. The Minister for Social Services and Public Health, Rebeca Evans AM said: “Two years ago, Welsh Government provided a significant funding boost for health boards in order to improve access to psychological therapies. We understand that these interventions can reduce the risks of relapse in people with psychosis or with depression. Our aim is to ensure patients have real choices about all available treatment options and to see these interventions accessible across Wales.” Chair of the We Need to Talk (Wales) Coalition, Alun Thomas said: “We represent patients, carers and professionals across Wales who know from experience that talking therapies can be hugely beneficial in the recovery process. There is also widespread evidence that psychological therapies result in significant saving to the public sector in healthcare, tax gains and welfare with benefits felt throughout the NHS. Currently, 50% of people have to wait more than three months after assessment to receive their first therapy session."" ""As charities, professional organisations and service providers, we have come together in order to promote both parity of access for patients, regardless of whether they are in primary or secondary care.” The We Need to Talk (Wales) Coalition has been established to campaign for improved access to psychological therapies for people with mental health problems in Wales.  It comprises of the following organisations: British Association for Counselling & Psychotherapy Mind Infoline is closed right now, for support visit our  © 2021 Mind We're a registered charity in England (no. 219830) and a registered company (no. 424348) in England and Wales.",53,what is psychotherapy?,-8.734399795532227,27

The survey (2) of over 1,600 people who have tried to access talking therapies such as counselling and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy on the NHS in England over the last two years also shows how some people are paying for private therapy to get the help they desperately need. One in ten (11%) said that they had faced costs for private treatment because the therapy they needed was not available on the NHS. The choice of treatment on offer was also found to be limited even though CBT, the most commonly prescribed talking treatment, doesn’t work for everyone. The coalition found that three in five people (58%) weren’t offered a choice in the type of therapy they received. Since 2007, the Government’s increased investment in the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme has helped millions of people to access psychological therapies on the NHS who otherwise wouldn’t have had this support. However, delays in accessing support and a lack of choice is having a devastating effect on people’s lives and recovery. The We Need To Talk coalition is calling for the NHS in England to offer a full range of evidence-based psychological therapies to all who need them within 28 days of requesting a referral. The coalition is raising these concerns as the IAPT team has now moved to NHS England, and is operating on reduced capacity and budget. This also means that the issues of many marginalized groups may not be addressed. People from Black and minority ethnic (BME) communities, those with long-term mental health problems such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, older people and children and young people face specific challenges of their own. The coalition held focus groups with people from BME ethnic heritage and over half of those people said that language barriers was a specific issue that they faced. We need to talk wants the Government and NHS England to invest more in psychological therapies to meet demand and urgently introduce maximum waiting time standards to ensure timely access to treatment. Locally, clinical commissioning groups must ensure they commission a range of psychological therapies to meet the needs of diverse local communities. “Since our last We need to talk report, we’ve seen money poured into the IAPT programme with some encouraging improvements in waiting times. However, it is far from acceptable that in some parts of the country people are still waiting over a year to access treatment. This must urgently be addressed if the Government’s commitment to parity between physical and mental health care is to be realised. “The Government is committed to improving access to talking treatments but our report shows there is still a long way to go. That’s why we’re urging the Government and NHS England to take heed of this new report and make sure that people with mental health problems are getting the right treatment when they need it.” ""More people than ever before are getting access to talking therapies thanks to our £450 million investment in the improving access to psychological therapies programme. “Due to its initial success, demand has increased and this has led to increased waiting times in some parts of the country. “We want people to get access to treatment quickly. We have asked NHS England - the body which oversees the NHS – to introduce for the first time new waiting time and access standards for mental health services from 2015.” Dr David Murphy, Chair of the Professional Practice Board at the British Psychological Society said: ""This new report welcomes the positive steps that have been taken by the coalition Government in increasing access to psychological therapies. This has undoubtedly benefitted thousands of people who might otherwise have not received help. However, considerable progress is still required as access to psychological therapies is still very limited, especially for particular groups such as those from ethnic minorities, older people, those with physical disabilities, and also people with severe mental health problems. “Those people who do access services are also waiting too long before they receive psychological therapies. Moreover, even after waiting many weeks or months, our own research has shown that often therapy is cut well short of the amount recommended in NICE guidelines because of arbitrary local limits. This is of great concern and illustrates how far we still need to go before treatment of mental health problems and physical health problems have equal priority. It would be front page news if a healthcare organization started limiting prescriptions of antibiotics to half the recommended dose in order to manage costs but this is equivalent to what seems to be happening in many psychological therapies services."" The cost of mental health problems is high. Depression alone costs £7.5 billion, of which only £1.7 billion is to NHS services, with the rest going on the cost of lost employment. Previous research has shown that extending NICE-recommended treatments such as talking therapies to all those with depression could deliver £1 billion in economic benefits each year. Lisa, 51, has been affected by depression since she was a teenager and also has been diagnosed with anxiety, bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Born in Africa, Lisa has experienced physical and emotional abuse from people who have not accepted her transgender status, both in her home country and the UK, and she has tried to take her own life many times. Lisa has had to wait over four years to access the psychotherapy that has had such a positive impact on her life. “I have had to wait so long to receive psychotherapy because the service wasn’t available where I live and I can’t help but think what my life might have been like if I’d received therapy earlier. I’ve now am getting the right treatment for me and it’s made such a difference to my life; psychotherapy truly has turned my life around.” © 2021 Mind We're a registered charity in England (no. 219830) and a registered company (no. 424348) in England and Wales.",53,what is psychotherapy?,-11.31998062133789,77
0bb52e15-e758-4b37-9656-036bdcdb35ee,"> > Psychoanalysis is both a theory and method for understanding human psychology, and, in particular, the development and function of emotions. Psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic therapy are ‘talking therapies’ designed to help people to manage emotional conflicts that manifest in the form of mental symptoms, relationships with other people, and interpersonal and occupational functioning. Psychoanalysis is based upon Freud’s idea that we are not aware of our feelings and the conflicts in them, and the ways that we defend against them. Unconscious mental representations are thought to be developed throughout our lives, and include conflicted emotions that involve simultaneous wishes and fears. Psychoanalysis helps to explore these representations and bring them to consciousness in the context of the therapeutic relationship, allowing for change to take place (Marcus, 2002).

Harm reduction psychotherapy book: Practicing Harm Reduction Psychotherapy (BOOK REVIEW) Harm reduction psychotherapy book: Practicing Harm Reduction Psychotherapy (BOOK REVIEW) Looking for a book on how to integrate harm reduction into a psychotherapeutic environment? A review of harm reduction and why you should check out “Practicing Harm Reduction Psychotherapy” here. Author of ""The Definitive Guide to Addiction Interventions"" is a book that sets out strategies intended to reduce harm and improve health and well-being of individuals who have problems with substance use. Read more about how and why this book can help you first understand and then stop doing harm. Then, ask your questions about harm reduction therapy at the end. is an approach to working with drug users that aims to reduce drug-related harm to individuals, their families, and communities without necessarily reducing the consumption of drugs and alcohol. The damage done by drug and alcohol use and drug prohibition, not the drug use itself, is the primary focus of attention. Abstinence from mind-altering drugs is only one of many worthy goals and outcomes of harm reduction work. Harm reduction practitioners make use of a full spectrum of strategies, from safer drug use (such as use of clean needles) to moderation management (e.g., controlled drinking) to abstinence (perhaps from one but not all mind-altering substances). Working with drug users from a harm reduction perspective involves accepting that some people simply are not going to give up using drugs no matter what we think or what we try to do about it. Traditional models are attached to one outcome of treatment: abstinence. This singular focus positions therapists against the client’s relationship with drugs. However, the best outcomes in treatment occur when the goals of treatment are chosen by the client. Why consider harm reduction in your practice?   Firstly, the harm that someone incurs from using drugs may be preferable to one’s experience without them. There are many clinical examples of clients who have chosen to get high rather that commit suicide or remain unbearably depressed, for example. Second, harm reduction is based on the reality that all personal, behavioral change (leaving a relationship, changes to sexual habits, changing diet, taking medication, or reducing or quitting drug or alcohol use) requires a process of decision making and successful implementation. While ambivalence and resistance are normal and expected parts of the change process, what can you focus on in the meantime? Rather than wait for this change process to take place, harm reduction focuses on the more urgent priority of saving. Finally, much harm can come to drinkers and other drug users who are not “addicted”. Harm reduction aims to educate people about their choices, and to help minimize potential injury. If you are practitioner who treats patients that use drugs, this book will provide you with a thorough theoretical background of harm reduction psychotherapy and a description of how to practice it. is an excellent guide for therapists looking to begin or enhance their current mental health practice with harm reduction strategies. It presents a combined psychotherapeutic approach for individuals with drug and alcohol use problems. What’s more, this book gives us a detailed picture of the treatment method and many worthwhile harm reduction resources (applying harm reduction principles in group work or instructions on combining psychotherapy with medication for patients with comorbidity). It shows how treatment providers can treat clients at the precise point where they are capable of making changes and sets up a new way of understanding addictions. Wondering where you can find ?

COVID-19 is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation. Get the latest public health information from CDC: Get the latest research information from NIH: Get the latest shareable resources on coping with COVID-19 from NIMH: > > Psychotherapy (sometimes called “talk therapy”) is a term for a variety of treatment techniques that aim to help a person identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behavior. Most psychotherapy takes place with a licensed and trained mental health care professional and a patient meeting one on one or with other patients in a group setting. Someone might seek out psychotherapy for different reasons: You might be dealing with severe or long-term stress from a job or family situation, the loss of a loved one, or relationship or other family issues. Or you may have symptoms with no physical explanation: changes in sleep or appetite, low energy, a lack of interest or pleasure in activities that you once enjoyed, persistent irritability, or a sense of discouragement or hopelessness that won’t go away. A health professional may suspect or have diagnosed a condition such as depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress or other disorder and recommended psychotherapy as a first treatment or to go along with medication. You may be seeking treatment for a family member or child who has been diagnosed with a condition affecting mental health and for whom a health professional has recommended treatment. An exam by your primary care practitioner can ensure there is nothing in your overall health that would explain your or a loved one’s symptoms. Therapists have different professional backgrounds and specialties. There are resources at the end of this material that can help you find out about the different credentials of therapists and resources for locating therapists. Different therapies are often variations on an established approach, such as cognitive behavioral therapy. There is no formal approval process for psychotherapies as there is for the use of medications in medicine. For many therapies, however, research involving large numbers of patients has provided evidence that treatment is effective for specific disorders. These “evidence-based therapies” have been shown in research to reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other disorders.   The particular approach a therapist uses depends on the condition being treated and the training and experience of the therapist. Also, therapists may combine and adapt elements of different approaches. The for specific disorders on the NIMH website list some of the evidence based therapies for those disorders. One goal of establishing an evidence base for psychotherapies is to prevent situations in which a person receives therapy for months or years with no benefit. If you have been in therapy and feel you are not getting better, talk to your therapist, or look into other practitioners or approaches. The object of therapy is to gain relief from symptoms and improve quality of life. Once you have identified one or more possible therapists, a preliminary conversation with a therapist can help you get an idea of how treatment will proceed and whether you feel comfortable with the therapist. Rapport and trust are important. Discussions in therapy are deeply personal and it’s important that you feel comfortable and trusting with the therapist and have confidence in his or her expertise. Consider asking the following questions: What are the credentials and experience of the therapist? Does he or she have a specialty?  What approach will the therapist take to help you? Does he or she practice a particular type of therapy? What can the therapist tell you about the rationale for the therapy and the evidence base? Does the therapist have experience in diagnosing and treating the age group (for example, a child) and the specific condition for which treatment is being sought? If a child is the patient, how will parents be involved in treatment? What are the goals of therapy? Does the therapist recommend a specific time frame or number of sessions? How will progress be assessed and what happens if you (or the therapist) feel you aren’t starting to feel better? Are medications an option? How will medications be prescribed if the therapist is not an M.D.? Are our meetings confidential? How can this be assured? If you are interested in reading more about evidence based therapies, see the links at the end of this material. Psychotherapy can be an alternative to medication or can be used along with other treatment options, such as . Choosing the right treatment plan should be based on a person's individual needs and medical situation and under a mental health professional’s care. Even when medications relieve symptoms, psychotherapy and other interventions can help a person address specific issues. These might include self-defeating ways of thinking, fears, problems with interactions with other people, or dealing with situations at home and at school or with employment. A variety of different kinds of psychotherapies and interventions have been shown to be effective . Psychotherapists may use one primary approach, or incorporate different elements depending on their training, the condition being treated, and the needs of the person receiving treatment. Here are examples of the elements that psychotherapies can include: Helping a person become aware of ways of thinking that may be automatic but are inaccurate and harmful. (An example might be someone who has a low opinion of his or her own abilities.) The therapist helps the person find ways to question these thoughts, understand how they affect emotions and behavior, and try ways to change self-defeating patterns. This approach is central to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Examining in depth a person’s interactions with others and offering guidance with social and communication skills, if needed. Exposure therapy for people with anxiety disorders. In exposure therapy, a person spends brief periods, in a supportive environment, learning to tolerate the distress certain items, ideas, or imagined scenes cause. Over time the fear associated with these things dissipates. Tracking emotions and activities and the impact of each on the other. Safety planning can include helping a person recognize warning signs, and thinking about coping strategies, such as contacting friends, family, or emergency personnel. Supportive counseling to help a person explore troubling issues and provide emotional support. The telephone, Internet, and mobile devices have opened up new possibilities for providing interventions that can reach people in areas where mental health professionals may be not be easily available, and can be at hand 24/7. Some of these approaches involve a therapist providing help at a distance, but others—such as web-based programs and cell phone apps— are designed to provide information and feedback in the absence of a therapist. For an overview, see our fact sheet on Technology and the Future of Mental Health Treatment. Some approaches that use electronic media to provide help for mental health-related conditions have been shown by research to be helpful in some situations, others not as yet. The has information to consider before choosing online therapy. It is important to note that, as with all care for conditions affecting mental health, the treatment needs to be appropriate for the condition and the individual. eHealth approaches may be helpful in some situations, including as a support with other in-person treatment, but may not be appropriate or effective as a substitute for in-person care.

If you are working with a therapist, consult with him or her for help in evaluating the app. The symptoms of mental disorders can have a profound effect on someone’s quality of life and ability to function. Treatment can address symptoms as well as assist someone experiencing severe or ongoing stress. Some of the reasons that you might consider seeking out psychotherapy include: Overwhelming sadness or helplessness that doesn’t go away Difficulty focusing on work, or carrying out other everyday activities Drinking to excess or any behavior that harms self or others Dealing with a difficult transition, such as a divorce, children leaving home, job difficulties, or the death of someone close Children’s behavior problems that interfere with school, family, or peers Seeking help is not an admission of weakness, but a step towards understanding and obtaining relief from distressing symptoms.

The earlier pioneers in integration were following a trend that was introduced by Freud into psychoanalysis. It is said that common factors approach to integration came about because of the assumption that all effective methods of psychotherapy share somewhat critical and curative factors. Psychotherapy Integration is to integrate therapies that will derive a goal to maximize a patients exposure to the unique combination of therapeutic factors that will best help him or her with their problems. Psychotherapy Integration Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy In studying the different theories, I felt that Reality Therapy, Cognitive Therapy, and Behavioral Therapy had a great impact on me. In Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, the therapists tries its best to work with the patient to identify the underlying thoughts that might be causing their distress. The therapist then tries and come up with techniques they feel will alter the resulting behavior. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy uses the cognitive restructuring approach to try and modify the behavior. In using this therapy we learn that patients have certain beliefs, known as schemas, these schemas are what have a negative impact on the patients behavior and functioning. For example, a patient suffering from schizophrenia may develop a social phobia because he is convinced he is not likable, uninteresting, or convinced unwanted. The therapist would put this schema to a test by asking the patient to name family and friends that care for them and seem to enjoy their company. By allowing the patient to see that others value them, the therapist brings to a head the irrationalness of the patients thought process. The... References: Arkowitz, H. (1991).

BASIC CONCEPTS Existential therapy is a philosophical approach to explore with a client the fundamental questions every conscious human being faces inevitably at some point of life: Who am I? Why am I here? What is the meaning of my life? The approach is highly individualistic and allows the client search for truth in the phenomenological framework rather than the pre-established and dogmatic way. (Van Deurzen, 2007). Thus, existential therapy is not a prescribed structured methodology but rather “an attitude toward human suffering.” (Yalom and Josselson, 2011, p. 310). According to Rollo May existential therapy is “an encounter with one’s own existence in an immediate and quintessential form.” (May, 1967, p. 134). Since the underlying philosophy of existentialism encompasses all aspects of human life, existential techniques are used by practitioners of all major school of therapy and counselling.

According to Gilbert, ""One of its key concerns is to use compassionate mind training to help people develop and work with experiences of inner warmth, safeness and soothing, via and self-compassion."" The central therapeutic technique of CFT is compassionate mind training, which teaches the skills and attributes of . Compassionate mind training helps transform problematic patterns of cognition and emotion related to , , and . Biological evolution forms the theoretical backbone of CFT. Humans have evolved with at least three primal types of emotion regulation system: the threat (protection) system, the drive (resource-seeking) system, and the soothing system. CFT emphasizes the links between cognitive patterns and these three emotion regulation systems. Through the use of techniques such as compassionate mind training and (CBT), counselling clients can learn to manage each system more effectively and respond more appropriately to situations. Compassion focused therapy is especially appropriate for people who have high levels of shame and self-criticism and who have difficulty in feeling warmth toward, and being kind to, themselves or others. CFT can help such people learn to feel more safeness and warmth in their interactions with others and themselves. Numerous methods are used in CFT to develop a person's compassion. For example, people undergoing CFT are taught to understand compassion from the third person, before transferring these thought processes to themselves. CFT is largely built on the idea that the evolution of caring behavior has major regulatory and developmental functions. The central focus of CFT is to concentrate on helping clients relate to their difficulties in compassionate ways, as well as provide them with effective tools to work with challenging circumstances and emotions they encounter. CFT helps those learn tools to engage with their battles in accepting and encouraging ways, thereby aiding themselves to feel confident to accomplish difficult tasks and deal with challenging situations. Developing a positive therapeutic relationship that facilitates the process of engaging with one's challenges and development of skills to deal with them. Developing non-blaming compassionate understandings into the nature of suffering. Developing the ability to experience and cultivate compassionate attributes. Developing the feeling of compassion for others, being open to compassion from others, and developing self-compassion. According to evolutionary analysis, there are three types of functional emotion regulation systems: drive, safety and threat. CFT is based on the relationship and interactions between these systems. One is born with each system but our surroundings implicate whether one utilizes and sustains the non-survival-based systems (drive and caregiving). Threat and self-protection focused system: evolved to alert and direct attention to detect and respond to threats. This system contains threat-based emotions (anger, anxiety, disgust), and threat-based behaviors (fight/flight, freezing). Drive, seeking and acquisition focused system: pay attention and notice advantageous resources, experience drive and pleasure in securing them (positive system is activating). Contentment, soothing and affiliative system: enables state of peacefulness when individuals are no longer focused on threats or seeking out resources (allows body to rest and digest and have open attention). Using CFT enriches the compassion-based soothing system, while withdrawing from the threat-focused emotional regulation system. In turn, this will augment the ability to activate (drive) and work towards valued goals. Compassion focused therapy has been investigated as a novel treatment for several different psychological disorders. A 2012 randomized controlled trial showed CFT to be a safe and clinically effective treatment option for psychosis patients. CFT was shown to be more effective than ""treatment as usual"", with particular efficacy in reducing depression symptoms. A further 2015 literature review of 14 different studies showed promising psychotherapeutic benefits of CFT, especially when treating mood disorders. However, further large-scale trials are necessary in order for CFT to become an accepted, ""evidence-based"" treatment for these disorders. CFT has also been explored as a treatment for individuals with eating disorders. This slightly modified version of CFT, CFT-E, has had promising results in treating adult outpatients with restrictive eating disorders as well as with binging and purging disorders. A 2014 literature review found CFT-E to be a particularly effective treatment for eating disorders due to the fact that it confronts the ""high levels of shame and self‐criticism"" that patients often experience. More recent primary studies have further proved CFT-E to be a safe and effective intervention for eating disorders. CFT is also being studied as a rehabilitation method for patients with acquired brain injuries (ABI). Preliminary, small-scale studies have shown CFT to be safe and beneficial in treating anxiety and depressive symptoms of ABI patients, although further large-scale studies are needed. Beaumont and Hollins Martin (2015) examined narrative reviews of 12 research findings that has shown use of CFT to treat and experiment with psychological outcomes in clinical populations. The researchers found that overall, there are improvements of mental health issues with CFT intervention, especially when combined with approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Beaumont and Hollins Martin (2015) found a major limitation in the empirical studies are the small number of participants involved in each case. For instance, Gilbert and Proctor (2006) showed small reductions in depression, anxiety, self-criticism and shame, however their participant group involved only 6 members. The small number of participants can cause bias or facilitate a problem of generalization for the broader population. For instance, out of the twelve studies only two individually supported effectiveness of CFT. A study conducted by Lucre and Corten (2012) found CFT to be effective for treating patients with only personality disorders, and another study by Heriot-Maitland et al. (2014) found that treating clients in acute inpatient settings was effective. The findings of Beaumont and Hollins Martin (2015) recommended that the effectiveness of CFT needs further extensive research in order to fully examine reductions in mental illnesses and overall improvements in quality of life. This study recommends for consideration of larger samples of participants in order to ensure that CFT can be independently effective without other psychotherapy interventions involved such as CBT.

Some definitions of overlap with psychotherapy (particularly in non-directive client-centered approaches), or counseling may refer to guidance for everyday problems in specific areas, typically for shorter durations with a less medical or 'professional' focus. refers to the use of physical changes as injuries and illnesses, and to the use of a person's social environment to effect therapeutic change. Psychotherapy may address as a significant part of someone's mental / psychological life, and some forms are derived from spiritual philosophies, but practices based on treating the spiritual as a separate dimension are not necessarily considered as traditional or 'legitimate' forms of psychotherapy. Historically, psychotherapy has sometimes meant ""interpretative"" (i.e. ) methods, namely , in contrast with other methods to treat psychiatric disorders such as behavior modification. Psychotherapy is often dubbed as a ""talking therapy"", particularly for a general audience, though not all forms of psychotherapy rely on .

The Australian Victoria state Government's Health Agency has awarded no mental health app with scores greater than 3 stars out of 5 for effectiveness. One reason for this is that online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy programs have poor ""adherence"" compared to face-to-face programs. That means that many users do not ""stick to"" the program as prescribed. They may uninstall the app or skip days, for instance. See also: , Counseling psychology § Counseling ethics and regulation, , , , and Mental health professional § Professional distinctions Psychotherapists traditionally may be: like psychologists and psychiatrists; professionals from other backgrounds (family therapists, social workers, nurses, etc.) who have trained in a specific psychotherapy; or (in some cases) academic or scientifically-trained professionals. are trained first as physicians, and—as such—they may prescribe ; and specialist psychiatric training begins after medical school in psychiatric residencies: however, their specialty is in mental disorders or forms of mental illness. have specialist doctoral degrees in psychology with some clinical and research components. Other clinical practitioners, , mental health counselors, pastoral counselors, and nurses with a specialization in mental health, also often conduct psychotherapy. Many of the wide variety of psychotherapy training programs and institutional settings are multi-professional. In most countries, psychotherapy training are all at a post-graduate level, often at a master's degree (or doctoral) level, over 4 years, with significant supervised practice and clinical placements. Such professionals doing specialized psychotherapeutic work also require a program of continuing professional education after basic professional training. There is a 2013 listing of the extensive professional competencies of a European psychotherapist, developed by the European Association of Psychotherapy (EAP). As sensitive and deeply personal topics are often discussed during psychotherapy, therapists are expected, and usually legally bound, to respect client or patient confidentiality. The critical importance of —and the limited circumstances in which it may need to be broken for the protection of clients or others—is enshrined in the regulatory psychotherapeutic organizations' codes of ethical practice. Examples of when it is typically accepted to break confidentiality include when the therapist has knowledge that a child or elder is being physically abused; when there is a direct, clear and imminent threat of serious physical harm to self or to a specific individual. As of 2015, there are still a lot of variations between different European countries about the regulation and delivery of psychotherapy. Several countries have no regulation of the practice or no protection of the title. Some have a system of voluntary registration, with independent professional organizations, while other countries attempt to restrict the practice of psychotherapy to 'mental health professionals' (psychologists and psychiatrists) with state-certified training. The titles that are protected also vary. The (EAP) established the 1990 Strasbourg Declaration on Psychotherapy, which is dedicated to establishing an independent profession of psychotherapy in Europe, with pan-European standards. The EAP has already made significant contacts with the European Union & European Commission towards this end. Given that the has a primary policy about the free movement of labor within Europe, European legislation can overrule national regulations that are, in essence, forms of restrictive practices. In Germany, the practice of psychotherapy for adults is restricted to qualified psychologists and physicians (including psychiatrists) who have completed several years of specialist practical training and certification in psychotherapy. As psychoanalysis, psychodynamic therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy meet the requirements of German health insurance companies, mental health professionals regularly opt for one of these three specializations in their postgraduate training. For psychologists, this includes three years of full-time practical training (4.200 hours), encompassing a year-long internship at an accredited psychiatric institution, six months of clinical work at an outpatient facility, 600 hours of supervised psychotherapy in an outpatient setting, and at least 600 hours of theoretical seminars. may complete the specialist training for child and teenage clients. Similarly in Italy, the practice of psychotherapy is restricted to graduates in psychology or medicine who have completed four years of recognised specialist training. Sweden has a similar restriction on the title ""psychotherapist"", which may only be used by professionals who have gone through a post-graduate training in psychotherapy and then applied for a licence, issued by the . Legislation in France restricts the use of the title ""psychotherapist"" to professionals on the National Register of Psychotherapists, which requires a training in clinical psychopathology and a period of internship which is only open to physicians or titulars of a master's degree in psychology or psychoanalysis. Austria and Switzerland (2011) have laws that recognize multi-disciplinary functional approaches. In the United Kingdom, the government and considered mandatory legal registration but decided that it was best left to professional bodies to regulate themselves, so the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (PSA) launched an Accredited Voluntary Registers scheme. Counseling and psychotherapy are not protected titles in the United Kingdom. Counsellors and psychotherapists who have trained and qualify to a certain standard (usually a level 4 Diploma) can apply to be members of the professional bodies who are listed on the PSA Accredited Registers. In some states, counselors or therapists must be licensed to use certain words and titles on self-identification or advertising. In some other states, the restrictions on practice are more closely associated with the charging of fees. Licensing and regulation are performed by various states. Presentation of practice as licensed, but without such a license, is generally illegal. Without a license, for example, a practitioner cannot bill insurance companies. Information about state licensure is provided by the . In addition to state laws, the American Psychological Association requires its members to adhere to its published Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct. The examines and certifies ""psychologists who demonstrate competence in approved specialty areas in professional psychology"". Regulation of psychotherapy is in the jurisdiction of, and varies among, the provinces and territories. In , psychotherapy is a regulated activity which is restricted to psychologists, medical doctors, and holders of a psychotherapy permit issued by the , the Quebec order of psychologists. Members of certain specified professions, including , couple and family therapists, , , , , , and registered nurses may obtain a psychotherapy permit by completing certain educational and practice requirements; their professional oversight is provided by their own professional orders. Some other professionals who were practising psychotherapy before the current system came into force continue to hold psychotherapy permits alone. See also: and Psychotherapy can be said to have been practiced through the ages, as medics, philosophers, spiritual practitioners and people in general used psychological methods to heal others. In the , by the 19th century, a movement (then meaning morale or mental) developed based on non-invasive non-restraint therapeutic methods. Another influential movement was started by (1734–1815) and his student Armand-Marie-Jacques de Chastenet, Marquis of Puységur (1751–1825). Called Mesmerism or animal magnetism, it would have a strong influence on the rise of and psychiatry as well as theories about . In 1853 introduced the term ""psycho-therapeia"" regarding how physicians might influence the mental states of sufferers and thus their bodily ailments, for example by creating opposing emotions to promote mental balance. cited the term and wrote about ""psycho-therapeutics"" in 1872, in which he also proposed making a science of . and colleagues in the "" School"" developed the concept of ""psychotherapy"" in the sense of using the mind to heal the body through , yet further. Charles Lloyd Tuckey's 1889 work, Psycho-therapeutics, or Treatment by Hypnotism and Suggestion popularized the work of the Nancy School in English. Also in 1889 a clinic used the word in its title for the first time, when and Albert Willem in renamed theirs ""Clinique de Psycho-thérapeutique Suggestive"" after visiting Nancy. During this time, travelling became popular, and such activities added to the scientific controversies around the use of hypnosis in medicine. Also in 1892, at the second congress of experimental psychology, van Eeden attempted to take the credit for the term psychotherapy and to distance the term from hypnosis. In 1896, the German journal Zeitschrift für Hypnotismus, Suggestionstherapie, Suggestionslehre und verwandte psychologische Forschungen changed its name to Zeitschrift für Hypnotismus, Psychotherapie sowie andere psychophysiologische und psychopathologische Forschungen, which is probably the first journal to use the term. Thus psychotherapy initially meant ""the treatment of disease by psychic or hypnotic influence, or by suggestion"".

His popular reputation as the father of psychotherapy was established by his use of the distinct term """", tied to an overarching system of theories and methods, and by the effective work of his followers in rewriting history.

Shipiro and in Britain, and and in the United States. approaches relied on principles of , and to bring about therapeutic change in observable symptoms. The approach became commonly used for , as well as other disorders. Some therapeutic approaches developed out of the European school of . Concerned mainly with the individual's ability to develop and preserve a sense of meaning and purpose throughout life, major contributors to the field (e.g., , ) and Europe (, , , , ) attempted to create therapies sensitive to common ""life crises"" springing from the essential bleakness of human self-awareness, previously accessible only through the complex writings of existential philosophers (e.g., , , , , ). The uniqueness of the thus also forms a vehicle for therapeutic inquiry. A related body of thought in psychotherapy started in the 1950s with . Based also on the works of and his , Rogers brought into mainstream focus. The primary requirement was that the client receive three core ""conditions"" from his counselor or therapist: unconditional positive regard, sometimes described as ""prizing"" the client's humanity; congruence [authenticity/genuineness/transparency]; and . This type of interaction was thought to enable clients to fully experience and express themselves, and thus develop according to their innate potential. Others developed the approach, like and in the creation of , as well as Marshall Rosenberg, founder of , and , founder of . Later these fields of psychotherapy would become what is known as today. Self-help groups and books became widespread. During the 1950s, originated (REBT). Independently a few years later, psychiatrist developed a form of psychotherapy known as . Both of these included relatively short, structured and present-focused techniques aimed at identifying and changing a person's beliefs, appraisals and reaction-patterns, by contrast with the more long-lasting insight-based approach of psychodynamic or humanistic therapies. Beck's approach used primarily the , and links have been drawn between ancient philosophy and these cognitive therapies. Cognitive and behavioral therapy approaches were increasingly combined and grouped under the umbrella term (CBT) in the 1970s. Many approaches within CBT are oriented towards active/directive yet collaborative (a form of reality-testing), and assessing and modifying core beliefs and dysfunctional schemas. These approaches gained widespread acceptance as a primary treatment for numerous disorders. A ""third wave"" of cognitive and behavioral therapies developed, including and , which expanded the concepts to other disorders and/or added novel components and exercises. However the ""third wave"" concept has been criticized as not essentially different from other therapies and having roots in earlier ones as well. Counseling methods developed include and . psychotherapies such as and do not impose definitions of mental health and illness, but rather see the goal of therapy as something constructed by the client and therapist in a social context. also developed, which focuses on family and group dynamics—and , which focuses on the spiritual facet of human experience. Other orientations developed in the last three decades include , , , , applied and the approach. A survey of over 2,500 US therapists in 2006 revealed the most utilized models of therapy and the ten most influential therapists of the previous quarter-century. There are hundreds of psychotherapy approaches or schools of thought. By 1980 there were more than 250; by 1996 more than 450; and at the start of the 21st century there were over a thousand different named psychotherapies—some being minor variations while others are based on very different conceptions of psychology, ethics (how to live) or technique. In practice therapy is often not of one pure type but draws from a number of perspectives and schools—known as an or approach. The importance of the , also known as therapeutic alliance, between client and therapist is often regarded as crucial to psychotherapy. addresses this and other core aspects thought to be responsible for effective psychotherapy. Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), a Viennese neurologist who studied with in 1885, is often considered the father of modern psychotherapy. His methods included analyzing his patient's dreams in search of important hidden insights into their unconscious minds. Other major elements of his methods, which changed throughout the years, included identification of childhood sexuality, the role of anxiety as a manifestation of inner conflict, the differentiation of parts of the psyche (id, ego, superego), transference and countertransference (the patient's projections onto the therapist, and the therapist's emotional responses to that). Some of his concepts were too broad to be amenable to empirical testing and invalidation, and he was critiqued for this by Jaspers. Numerous major figures elaborated and refined Freud's therapeutic techniques including Melanie Klein, Donald Winnicott, and others. Since the 1960s, however, the use of Freudian-based analysis for the treatment of mental disorders has declined substantially. Different types of psychotherapy have been created along with the advent of clinical trials to test them scientifically. These incorporate subjective treatments (after Beck), behavioral treatments (after Skinner and Wolpe) and additional time-constrained and centered structures, for example, interpersonal psychotherapy. In youth issue and in schizophrenia, the systems of family treatment hold esteem. A portion of the thoughts emerging from therapy are presently pervasive and some are a piece of the tool set of ordinary clinical practice. They are not just medications, they additionally help to understand complex conduct. Therapy may address specific forms of diagnosable , or everyday problems in managing or maintaining or meeting personal goals. A course of therapy may happen before, during or after (e.g. taking ). Psychotherapies are categorized in several different ways. A distinction can be made between those based on a and those based on a . In the medical model, the client is seen as unwell and the therapist employs their skill to help the client back to health. The extensive use of the , the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders in the United States is an example of a medically exclusive model. The humanistic or non-medical model in contrast strives to depathologise the human condition. The therapist attempts to create a relational environment conducive to experiential learning and help build the client's confidence in their own natural process resulting in a deeper understanding of themselves. The therapist may see themselves as a facilitator/helper. Another distinction is between individual one-to-one therapy sessions, and , including and . Therapies are sometimes classified according to their duration; a small number of sessions over a few weeks or months may be classified as (or short-term therapy), others, where regular sessions take place for years, may be classified as long-term. Some practitioners distinguish between more ""uncovering"" (or """") approaches and more ""supportive"" psychotherapy. Uncovering psychotherapy emphasizes facilitating the client's insight into the roots of their difficulties. The best-known example is classical psychoanalysis. by contrast stresses strengthening the client's coping mechanisms and often providing encouragement and advice, as well as reality-testing and limit-setting where necessary. Depending on the client's issues and situation, a more supportive or more uncovering approach may be optimal. Most forms of psychotherapy use spoken . Some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, , , story or music. Psychotherapy with children and their parents often involves , dramatization (i.e. role-play), and drawing, with a co-constructed narrative from these non-verbal and displaced modes of interacting. There are also different formats for delivering some therapies, as well as the usual face to face: for example or . There have also been developments in computer-assisted therapy, such as for behavioral exposure, multimedia programs to each cognitive techniques, and handheld devices for improved monitoring or putting ideas into practice. These psychotherapies, also known as """", are based on and emerged in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis, being dubbed the ""third force"". They are primarily concerned with the human development and needs of the individual, with an emphasis on meaning, a rejection of , and a concern for positive growth rather than . Some posit an inherent human capacity to maximize potential, ""the tendency""; the task of therapy is to create a relational environment where this tendency might flourish. Humanistic psychology can, in turn, be rooted in —the belief that human beings can only find meaning by creating it. This is the goal of . Existential therapy is in turn philosophically associated with . , also known as client-centered, focuses on the therapist showing openness, empathy and ""unconditional positive regard"", to help clients express and develop their own . Humanistic (HPD) is based on the human image of humanistic psychology. So all rules and methods follow the axioms of humanistic psychology. The HPD sees itself as development-oriented psychotherapy and has completely moved away from the psychoanalytic catharsis theory. Self-awareness and self-realization are essential aspects in the therapeutic process. Subjective experiences, feelings and thoughts and one's own experiences are the starting point for a change or reorientation in experience and behavior in the direction of more self-acceptance and satisfaction. Dealing with the biography of the individual is closely related to the sociometry of the group. , originally called ""concentration therapy"", is an existential/experiential form that facilitates awareness in the various contexts of life, by moving from talking about relatively remote situations to action and direct current experience. Derived from various influences, including an overhaul of psychoanalysis, it stands on top of essentially four load-bearing theoretical walls: , dialogical relationship, field-theoretical strategies, and experimental freedom. A briefer form of humanistic therapy is the approach, introduced in 1998–99. It is a solution-focused intervention based on identifying emotional needs—such as for security, autonomy and social connection—and using various educational and psychological methods to help people meet those needs more fully or appropriately. focus on revealing or interpreting processes. Most commonly referring to , of which is the oldest and most intensive form, these applications of encourage the verbalization of all the patient's thoughts, including , fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst formulates the nature of the past and present unconscious conflicts which are causing the patient's symptoms and character problems. There are six main schools of psychoanalysis, which all influenced psychodynamic theory: Freudian, , , , , and . Techniques for analytic have also developed. use techniques, including (also known as ), to change maladaptive patterns of behavior to improve emotional responses, cognitions, and interactions with others. is one form of this approach. By nature, behavioral therapies are empirical (data-driven), contextual (focused on the environment and context), functional (interested in the effect or consequence a behavior ultimately has), probabilistic (viewing behavior as statistically predictable), (rejecting mind-body dualism and treating the person as a unit), and relational (analyzing bidirectional interactions). focuses directly on changing the thoughts, in order to improve the emotions and behaviors. attempts to combine the above two approaches, focused on the construction and reconstruction of people's , and . Generally in CBT, the therapist, through a wide array of modalities, helps clients assess, recognize and deal with problematic and dysfunctional ways of thinking, emoting and behaving. The concept of ""third wave"" psychotherapies reflects an influence of , incorporating principles such as into interventions such as , , and for . (IPT) is a relatively brief form of psychotherapy (deriving from both CBT and approaches) that has been increasingly studied and endorsed by guidelines for some conditions. It focuses on the links between and social circumstances, helping to build social skills and social support. It aims to foster adaptation to current interpersonal roles and situations. (ERP) is primarily deployed by therapists in the treatment of . The (APA) state that CBT drawing primarily on behavioral techniques (such as ERP) has the ""strongest evidence base"" among psychosocial interventions. By confronting feared scenarios (i.e., exposure) and refraining from performing rituals (i.e., responsive prevention), patients may gradually feel less distress in confronting feared stimuli, while also feeling less inclination to use rituals to relieve that distress. Typically, ERP is delivered in ""hierarchical fashion"", meaning patients confront increasingly anxiety-provoking stimuli as they progress through a course of treatment. Other types include /, , and therapies for specific disorders including therapies such as and ; therapies such as and ; and therapies such as Seeking Safety. seeks to address people not just individually, as is often the focus of other forms of therapy, but in relationship, dealing with the interactions of groups, their patterns and dynamics (includes and ). is a type of systemic psychology. The term was first used around 1920 by , whose main contribution was the development of , in which groups were used as both cast and audience for the exploration of individual problems by reenactment under the direction of the leader. The more analytic and exploratory use of groups in both hospital and out-patient settings was pioneered by a few European psychoanalysts who emigrated to the US, such as , who treated severely neurotic and mildly psychotic out-patients in small groups at Bellevue Hospital, New York. The power of groups was most influentially demonstrated in Britain during the Second World War, when several psychoanalysts and psychiatrists proved the value of group methods for officer selection in the War Office Selection Boards. A chance to run an Army psychiatric unit on group lines was then given to several of these pioneers, notably and Rickman, followed by , Main, and Bridger. The in Birmingham gave its name to what came to be called the two ""Northfield Experiments"", which provided the impetus for the development since the war of both social therapy, that is, the movement, and the use of small groups for the treatment of neurotic and personality disorders. Today group therapy is used in clinical settings and in private practice settings. Expressive psychotherapy is a form of therapy that utilizes artistic expression (via improvisational, compositional, re-creative, and receptive experiences) as its core means of treating clients. Expressive psychotherapists use the different disciplines of the creative arts as therapeutic interventions. This includes the modalities , , , , , among others. This may include techniques such as . Expressive psychotherapists believe that often the most effective way of treating a client is through the expression of imagination in creative work and integrating and processing what issues are raised in the act. Also known as or . gives attention to each person's ""dominant story"" through therapeutic conversations, which also may involve exploring unhelpful ideas and how they came to prominence. Possible social and cultural influences may be explored if the client deems it helpful. posits multiple levels of mental constructs that create symptoms as a way to strive for self-protection or self-realization. does not accept that there is one single or correct way of looking at reality and therefore is considered a postmodernist approach. addresses the client in the context of a spiritual understanding of consciousness. (PPT) (since 1968) is a method in the field of humanistic and psychodynamic psychotherapy and is based on a positive image of humans, with a health-promoting, resource-oriented and conflict-centered approach. Hypnotherapy is undertaken while a subject is in a state of . Hypnotherapy is often applied in order to modify a subject's behavior, emotional content, and attitudes, as well as a wide range of conditions including: dysfunctional habits, anxiety, stress-related illness, pain management, and personal development. are therapeutic practices involving , such as , , , and . In psychedelic therapy, in contrast to conventional taken by the patient regularly or as-needed, patients generally remain in an extended psychotherapy session during the acute psychedelic activity with additional sessions both before and after in order to help integrate experiences with the psychedelics. Psychedelic therapy has been compared with the healing rituals of indigenous people. Researchers identified two main differences: the first is the shamanic belief that multiple realities exist and can be explored through altered states of consciousness, and second the belief that spirits encountered in dreams and visions are real. , part of the field of , focuses on the link between the mind and the body and tries to access deeper levels of the psyche through greater awareness of the and . There are various approaches, such as Reichian () character-analytic and orgonomy; neo-Reichian ; ; ; Ron Kurtz's psychotherapy; ; Biosynthesis psychotherapy; and Biodynamic psychotherapy. These approaches are not to be confused with or body-therapies that seek to improve primarily physical health through direct work (touch and manipulation) on the body, rather than through directly psychological methods. Some non-Western therapies have been developed. In African countries this includes harmony restoration therapy, meseron therapy and systemic therapies based on the . is an attempt to combine ideas and strategies from more than one theoretical approach. These approaches include mixing core beliefs and combining proven techniques. Forms of integrative psychotherapy include , the , cyclical psychodynamics, systematic treatment selection, , , and conceptual interaction. In practice, most experienced psychotherapists develop their own integrative approach over time. Psychotherapy needs to be adapted to meet the developmental needs of children. Depending on age, it is generally held to be one part of an effective strategy to help the needs of a child within the family setting. Child psychotherapy training programs necessarily include courses in . Since children often do not have the ability to articulate thoughts and feelings, psychotherapists will use a variety of media such as musical instruments, sand and toys, crayons, paint, clay, puppets, bibliocounseling (books), or board games. The use of is often rooted in , but other approaches also exist. In addition to therapy for the child, sometimes instead of it, children may benefit if their parents work with a therapist, take parenting classes, attend , or take other action to resolve stressful situations that affect the child. is a highly effective form of psychotherapy that teaches parenting skills to reduce their child's behavior problems. In many cases a different psychotherapist will work with the care taker of the child, while a colleague works with the child. Therefore, contemporary thinking on working with the younger age group has leaned towards working with parent and child simultaneously, as well as individually as needed. Research on computer-supported and computer-based interventions has increased significantly over the course of the last two decades. The following applications frequently have been investigated: Tele-therapy / tele-mental health: In teletherapy classical psychotherapy is provided via modern communication devices, such as via videoconferencing. Virtual reality: is a computer-generated scenario that simulates experience. The immersive environment, used for simulated , can be similar to the real world or it can be fantastical, creating a new experience. Computer-based interventions (or or ): These interventions can be described as interactive self-help. They usually entail a combination of text, audio or video elements. Computer-supported therapy (or ): Classical psychotherapy is supported by means of online or elements. The feasibility of such interventions has been investigated for individual and group therapy. There is considerable controversy about whether, or when, psychotherapy efficacy is best evaluated by or more individualized methods. One issue with trials is what to use as a treatment group or non-treatment . Often, this group includes patients on a waiting list, or those receiving some kind of regular non-specific contact or support. Researchers must consider how best to match the use of inert tablets or sham treatments in in pharmaceutical trials. Several interpretations and differing assumptions and language remain. Another issue is the attempt to standardize and manualize therapies and link them to specific symptoms of diagnostic categories, making them more amenable to research. Some report that this may reduce efficacy or gloss over individual needs. Fonagy and Roth's opinion is that the benefits of the evidence-based approach outweighs the difficulties. There are several formal frameworks for evaluating whether a psychotherapist is a good fit for a patient. One example is the Scarsdale Psychotherapy Self-Evaluation (SPSE). However, some scales, such as the SPS, elicit information specific to certain schools of psychotherapy alone (e.g. the superego). Many psychotherapists believe that the nuances of psychotherapy cannot be captured by questionnaire-style observation, and prefer to rely on their own clinical experiences and conceptual arguments to support the type of treatment they practice. Psychodynamic therapists in particular believe that evidence-based approaches are not appropriate to their methods or assumptions, though some have increasingly accepted the challenge to implement evidence-based approaches in their methods. Outcomes in relation with selected kinds of treatment Large-scale international reviews of scientific studies have concluded that psychotherapy is effective for numerous conditions. One line of research consistently finds that supposedly different forms of psychotherapy show similar effectiveness. According to The Handbook of Counseling Psychology: ""Meta-analyses of psychotherapy studies have consistently demonstrated that there are no substantial differences in outcomes among treatments"". The handbook states that there is ""little evidence to suggest that any one psychological therapy consistently outperforms any other for any specific psychological disorders. This is sometimes called the after a scene/section in Alice in Wonderland where every competitor in a race was called a winner and is given prizes"". Further analyses seek to identify the factors that the psychotherapies have in common that seem to account for this, known as ; for example the quality of the therapeutic relationship, interpretation of problem, and the confrontation of painful emotions. Outcome studies have been critiqued for being too removed from real-world practice in that they use carefully selected therapists who have been extensively trained and monitored, and patients who may be non-representative of typical patients by virtue of strict inclusionary/exclusionary criteria. Such concerns impact the of research results and the ability to generalize from them to practicing therapists. However, specific therapies have been tested for use with specific disorders, and regulatory organizations in both the UK and US make recommendations for different conditions. The Helsinki Psychotherapy Study was one of several large long-term clinical trials of psychotherapies that have taken place. Anxious and depressed patients in two short-term therapies (solution-focused and brief psychodynamic) improved faster, but five years long-term psychotherapy and psychoanalysis gave greater benefits. Several patient and therapist factors appear to predict suitability for different psychotherapies. Meta-analyses have established that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic psychotherapy are equally effective in treating depression. A 2014 meta analysis over 11,000 patients reveals that Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) is of comparable effectiveness to CBT for depression but is inferior to the latter for eating disorders. For children and adolescents, interpersonal psychotherapy and CBT are the best methods according to a 2014 meta analysis of almost 4000 patients. It is not yet understood how psychotherapies can succeed in treating mental illnesses. Different therapeutic approaches may be associated with particular theories about what needs to change in a person for a successful therapeutic outcome. In general, processes of and have long been held to play an important role. One theory combining these aspects proposes that permanent change occurs to the extent that the neuropsychological mechanism of is triggered and is able to incorporate new emotional experiences. Patient to a course of psychotherapy—continuing to attend sessions or complete tasks—is a major issue. The dropout level—early termination—ranges from around 30% to 60%, depending partly on how it is defined. The range is lower for research settings for various reasons, such as the selection of clients and how they are inducted. Early termination is associated on average with various demographic and clinical characteristics of clients, therapists and treatment interactions. The high level of dropout has raised some criticism about the relevance and efficacy of psychotherapy. Most psychologists use between-session tasks in their general therapy work, and cognitive behavioral therapies in particular use and see them as an ""active ingredient"". It is not clear how often clients do not complete them, but it is thought to be a pervasive phenomenon. From the other side, the adherence of therapists to therapy protocols and techniques—known as ""treatment integrity"" or ""fidelity""—has also been studied, with complex mixed results. In general, however, it is a hallmark of evidence-based psychotherapy to use fidelity monitoring as part of therapy outcome trials and ongoing quality assurance in clinical implementation. Research on of psychotherapy has been limited for various reasons, yet they may be expected to occur in 5% to 20% of patients. Problems include deterioration of symptoms or developing new symptoms, strains in other relationships, and therapy dependence. Some techniques or therapists may carry more risks than others, and some client characteristics may make them more vulnerable. Side-effects from properly conducted therapy should be distinguished from harms caused by malpractice. Some critics are skeptical of the healing power of psychotherapeutic relationships. Some dismiss psychotherapy altogether in the sense of a scientific discipline requiring professional practitioners, instead favoring either nonprofessional help or biomedical treatments. Others have pointed out ways in which the values and techniques of therapists can be harmful as well as helpful to clients (or indirectly to other people in a client's life). Many resources available to a person experiencing emotional distress—the friendly support of friends, peers, family members, clergy contacts, personal reading, healthy exercise, research, and independent coping—all present considerable value. Critics note that humans have been dealing with crises, navigating severe social problems and finding solutions to life problems long before the advent of psychotherapy. On the other hand, some argue psychotherapy is under-utilized and under-researched by contemporary psychiatry despite offering more promise than stagnant medication development. In 2015, the US allocated only 5.4% of its budget to new clinical trials of psychotherapies (medication trials are largely funded by ), despite plentiful evidence they can work and that patients are more likely to prefer them. Some Christians, such as theologian , have argued that successful therapeutic relationships, based on true acceptance of the client as a human being without contingency, require a theological assumption, an ontological acceptance of God. Further critiques have emerged from , and sources. Key to these is the issue of . In this regard there is a concern that clients are persuaded—both inside and outside the consulting room—to understand themselves and their difficulties in ways that are consistent with therapeutic ideas. This means that alternative ideas (e.g., feminist, economic, spiritual) are sometimes implicitly undermined. Critics suggest that we idealize the situation when we think of therapy only as a helping relationship—arguing instead that it is fundamentally a political practice, in that some cultural ideas and practices are supported while others are undermined or disqualified, and that while it is seldom intended, the therapist–client relationship always participates in society's power relations and political dynamics.

However, there is no single 'Foucauldian' approach to power, or indeed to therapy, and his ideas are used, as he intended, more in the manner of a 'tool kit' of ideas than as a coherent theoretical account.

977f7020-1111-42fb-b653-8975324803d4,"is a technique in to treat . Exposure therapy involves exposing the target patient to the anxiety source or its context without the intention to cause any danger. Doing so is thought to help them overcome their or . Procedurally, it is similar to the fear paradigm developed studying laboratory rodents. Numerous studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in the treatment of disorders such as , , , , and . There is empirical evidence that exposure therapy can be an effective treatment for people with , citing specifically in vivo exposure therapy, which has greater effectiveness than imaginal exposure in regards to generalized anxiety disorder. The aim of in vivo exposure treatment is to promote emotional regulation using systematic and controlled therapeutic exposure to traumatic stimuli. Exposure therapy is the most successful known treatment for phobias. Several published meta-analyses included studies of one-to-three hour single-session treatments of phobias, using imaginal exposure. At a post-treatment follow-up four years later 90% of people retained a considerable reduction in fear, avoidance, and overall level of impairment, while 65% no longer experienced any symptoms of a specific phobia. and are examples of phobias that have been successfully treated by exposure therapy. is a modern but effective treatment of (PTSD). This method was tested on several active duty Army soldiers, using an immersive computer simulation of military settings over six sessions. Self-reported PTSD symptoms of these soldiers were greatly diminished following the treatment. Exposure therapy has shown promise in the treatment of PTSD and . Exposure and response prevention (also known as exposure and ritual prevention; ERP or EX/RP) is a variant of exposure therapy that is recommended by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), the American Psychiatric Association (APA), and the Mayo Clinic as first-line treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) citing that it has the richest empirical support for both youth and adolescent outcomes. ERP is predicated on the idea that a effect is achieved as subjects confront their fears, but refrain from engaging in the escape response or ritual that delays or eliminates distress. In the case of individuals with OCD or an anxiety disorder, there is a thought or situation that causes distress. Individuals usually combat this distress through specific behaviors that include avoidance or rituals. However, ERP involves purposefully evoking fear, anxiety, and or distress in the individual by exposing him/her to the feared stimulus. The response prevention then involves having the individual refrain from the ritualistic or otherwise compulsive behavior that functions to decrease distress. The patient is then taught to tolerate distress until it fades away on its own, thereby learning that rituals are not always necessary to decrease distress or anxiety. Over repeated practice of ERP, patients with OCD expect to find that they can have obsessive thoughts and images but not have the need to engage in compulsive rituals to decrease distress. The AACAP's practise parameters for OCD recommends cognitive behavioral therapy, and more specifically ERP, as first line treatment for youth with mild to moderate severity OCD and combination psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for severe OCD. The Cochrane Review's examinations of different randomized control trials echoes repeated findings of the superiority of ERP over waitlist control or pill-placebos, the superiority of combination ERP and pharmacotherapy, but similar effect sizes of efficacy between ERP or pharmacotherapy alone. Exposure therapy is based on the principle of often termed Pavlovian extinction. The exposure therapist identifies the cognitions, emotions and physiological arousal that accompany a fear-inducing stimulus and then tries to break the pattern of escape that maintains the fear. This is done by exposing the patient to progressively stronger fear-inducing stimuli. Fear is minimized at each of a series of steadily escalating steps or challenges (a ), which can be explicit (""static"") or implicit (""dynamic"" — see ) until the fear is finally gone. The patient is able to terminate the procedure at any time. There are three types of exposure procedures. The first is in vivo or ""real life."" This type exposes the patient to actual fear-inducing situations. For example, if someone fears public speaking, the person may be asked to give a speech to a small group of people. The second type of exposure is imaginal, where patients are asked to imagine a situation that they are afraid of. This procedure is helpful for people who need to confront feared thoughts and memories. The third type of exposure is interoceptive, which may be used for more specific disorders such as panic or post-traumatic stress disorder. Patients confront feared bodily symptoms such as increased heart rate and shortness of breath. All types of exposure may be used together or separately. While evidence clearly supports the effectiveness of exposure therapy, some clinicians are uncomfortable using imaginal exposure therapy, especially in cases of PTSD. They may not understand it, are not confident in their own ability to use it, or more commonly, they see significant contraindications for their client. also exposes the patient to feared stimuli, but it is quite distinct in that flooding starts at the most feared item in a fear , while exposure starts at the least fear-inducing. In the exposure and response prevention (ERP or EX/RP) variation of exposure therapy, the resolution to refrain from the is to be maintained at all times and not just during specific practice sessions. Thus, not only does the subject experience to the feared stimulus, but they also practice a fear-incompatible behavioral response to the stimulus. The distinctive feature is that individuals confront their fears and discontinue their escape response. The American Psychiatric Association recommends ERP for the treatment of OCD, citing that ERP has the richest empirical support. While this type of therapy typically causes some short-term anxiety, this facilitates long-term reduction in obsessive and compulsive symptoms. Generally, ERP incorporates a relapse prevention plan toward the end of the course of therapy. The use of exposure as a mode of therapy began in the 1950s, at a time when psychodynamic views dominated Western clinical practice and behavioral therapy was first emerging. South African psychologists and psychiatrists first used exposure as a way to reduce pathological fears, such as phobias and anxiety-related problems, and they brought their methods to England in the training program. (1915–1997) was one of the first psychiatrists to spark interest in treating psychiatric problems as behavioral issues. He sought consultation with other behavioral psychologists, among them James G. Taylor (1897–1973), who worked in the psychology department of the in South Africa. Although most of his work went unpublished, Taylor was the first psychologist known to use exposure therapy treatment for , including methods of situational exposure with response prevention—a common exposure therapy technique still being used. Since the 1950s several sorts of exposure therapy have been developed, including , , implosive therapy, , in vivo exposure therapy, and imaginal exposure therapy. A 2015 review pointed out parallels between exposure therapy and , stating that mindful meditation ""resembles an exposure situation because [mindfulness] practitioners 'turn towards their emotional experience', bring acceptance to bodily and affective responses, and refrain from engaging in internal reactivity towards it."" Imaging studies have shown that the , , and the are all affected by exposure therapy; imaging studies have shown similar activity in these regions with mindfulness training. Exposure therapy can be investigated in the laboratory using Pavlovian paradigms. Using rodents such as rats or mice to study extinction allows for the investigation of underlying neurobiological mechanisms involved, as well as testing of pharmacological adjuncts to improve extinction learning.

He also played in the 2013 documentary, From Neurons to Nirvana: The Great Medicines. In 2007, he appeared in an episode of the Colbert Report, after he was banned from the US for several years as the result of a border guard googling his work. Feldmár worked for several international organizations as a specialist in mental health. In 1993 he took part in the UNESCO Chernobyl Program in Minsk, Belarus. He participated in training specialists for the Community Mental Health Centers for the victims of the Chernobyl catastrophe. For two weeks in 1996 he was a consultant for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in Bosnia and Croatia. To popularize Feldmár's work, his theoretical and practical approach to mental health Andrew Feldmár and a group of professionals in 2006 founded an institute in Budapest, Hungary, called (in English: Feldmár Institute). The nonprofit organization is organizing and hosting popular events and an annual summer school. The Institute sponsors a reintegration program for inmates which has proven to be significantly successful. (Only 5 out of the 65 convicted participants are registered as re-offenders, while the national rate is 50%.) The Institute is also involved in the sponsorship and professional work of the Soteria Shelter program in Budapest, a non-coercive alternative to psychiatric hospitalization. In 2019, Feldmár Institut Stuttgart was officially founded. Feldmár has been writing poems since his childhood. In the mid 60's he was the Poet of the Month on Toronto's CHQM radio, and his poetry was read at the Vancouver Art Gallery. In 2007 a selection of his haikus was published in a bilingual (English-Hungarian) poetry book. His poems were translated by the famous Hungarian contemporary poet . He translated Géza Gárdonyi's novel, which was first published in English in 1969.

He held MA and PhD degrees in from , and was certified by the (ABPP). He also founded, and was the President of, the New York City-based Albert Ellis Institute. He is generally considered to be one of the originators of the paradigm shift in and an early proponent and developer of . Based on a 1982 professional survey of US and Canadian psychologists, he was considered the second most influential psychotherapist in history ( ranked first in the survey; was ranked third). noted that, ""No individual—not even Freud himself—has had a greater impact on modern psychotherapy."" Ellis was born in , and raised in borough of from a young age. His paternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from the , while his maternal grandfather originated from in . He was the eldest of three children. Ellis' father, Harry, was a broker, often away from home on business trips, who reportedly showed only a modicum of affection to his children. By his teenage years, his parents , and he lived solely with his mother. In his autobiography, Ellis characterized his mother, Hattie, as a self-absorbed woman with a . At times, according to Ellis, she was a ""bustling chatterbox who never listened."" She would expound on her strong opinions on most subjects, but rarely provided a factual basis for these views. Like his father, Ellis' mother was emotionally distant from her children. Ellis recounted that she was often sleeping when he left for school and usually not home when he returned. Instead of reporting feeling bitter, he took on the responsibility of caring for his siblings. He purchased an alarm clock with his own money and woke and dressed his younger brother and sister. When the struck, all three children sought work to assist the family. Ellis was sickly as a child and suffered numerous health problems throughout his youth. At the age of five he was hospitalized with a . He was also hospitalized with , which led to a severe requiring emergency surgery. He reported that he had eight hospitalizations between the ages of five and seven, one of which lasted nearly a year. His parents provided little emotional support for him during these years, rarely visiting or consoling him. Ellis stated that he learned to confront his adversities as he had ""developed a growing indifference to that dereliction"". Illness was to follow Ellis throughout his life; at age 40 he developed . Ellis had exaggerated fears of speaking in public and during his adolescence, he was extremely shy around women. At age 19, already showing signs of thinking like a cognitive-behavioral therapist, he forced himself to talk to 100 women in the over a period of a month. Even though he did not get a date, he reported that he desensitized himself to his fear of rejection by women. Ellis entered the field of after first earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in business from what was then known as the in 1934. He began a brief career in business, followed by one as a writer. These endeavors took place during the that began in 1929, and Ellis found that business was poor and had no success in publishing his fiction. Finding that he could write non-fiction well, Ellis researched and wrote on . His lay counseling in this subject convinced him to seek a new career in . In 1942, Ellis began his studies for a PhD in clinical psychology at , which trained psychologists mostly in . He completed his Master of Arts in clinical psychology from Teachers College in June 1943, and started a part-time private practice while still working on his PhD degree—possibly because there was no licensing of psychologists in New York at that time. Ellis began publishing articles even before receiving his PhD; in 1946 he wrote a critique of many widely used pencil-and-paper . He concluded that only the met the standards of a research-based instrument. In 1947, he was awarded a PhD in Clinical Psychology at Columbia, and at that time Ellis had come to believe that psychoanalysis was the deepest and most effective form of therapy. Like most psychologists of that time, he was interested in the theories of . He sought additional training in psychoanalysis and then began to practice classical psychoanalysis. Shortly after receiving his PhD in 1947, Ellis began a Jungian analysis and program of supervision with , a leading analyst at the Karen Horney Institute (whose own analyst had been , the developer of the ). At that time he taught at , , and and held a couple of leading staff positions. At this time, Ellis' faith in psychoanalysis was gradually crumbling. The writings of , , and would be some of the influences in Ellis's thinking and played a role in shaping his psychological models. Ellis credits , his book, , and for starting him on the philosophical path for founding rational therapy. In addition, modern and ancient philosophy (particularly ), and his own experiences heavily influenced his new theoretical developments to psychotherapy. Ellis acknowledged that his therapy was ""by no means entirely new"", as in particular 's ""rational persuasion"" had prefigured some of its main principles; Ellis stated he had read him some years after inventing his therapy, but had studied since a young age. From the late 1940s onwards, Ellis worked on (REBT), and by January 1953 his break with psychoanalysis was complete, and he began calling himself a rational therapist. Ellis was now advocating a new more active and directive type of psychotherapy. In 1955, he presented rational therapy (RT). In RT, the therapist sought to help the client understand—and act on the understanding—that his personal philosophy contained beliefs that contributed to his own emotional pain. This new approach stressed actively working to change a client's self-defeating beliefs and behaviours by demonstrating their irrationality, self-defeatism and rigidity. Ellis believed that through and reconstruction, people could understand their self-defeatingness in light of their core irrational beliefs and then develop more rational constructs. In 1954, Ellis began teaching his new techniques to other therapists, and by 1957, he formally set forth the first by proposing that therapists help people adjust their thinking and behavior as the treatment for emotional and behavioral problems. Two years later, Ellis published , which elaborated on his new method. In 1960, Ellis presented a paper on his new approach at the (APA) convention in Chicago. There was mild interest, but few recognized that the paradigm set forth would become the within a generation. At that time, the prevailing interest in experimental psychology was , while in it was the psychoanalytic schools of notables such as Freud, , Adler, and . Despite the fact that Ellis' approach emphasized cognitive, emotive, and behavioral methods, his strong cognitive emphasis provoked the psychotherapeutic establishment with the possible exception of the followers of Adler. Consequently, he was often received with significant hostility at professional conferences and in print. He regularly held seminars where he would bring a participant up on stage and treat them. His own therapeutical style was famed for often being delivered in a rough, confrontational style; however, it should not be confused with his rational-emotive and cognitive-behavioral therapy school that is practiced by his students and followers in a large variety of therapeutic styles (e.g., often depending on client's personality, client's clinical problem, and evidence-based information regarding the appropriate intervention, but also including therapist's own preference). Despite the relative slow adoption of his approach in the beginning, Ellis founded his own institute. The Institute for Rational Living was founded as a non-profit organization in 1959. By 1968, it was chartered by the New York State as a training institute and psychological clinic. By the 1960s, Ellis had come to be seen as one of the founders of the . Especially in his earlier career, he was well known for his work as a sexologist and for his liberal , and in some camps controversial opinions on human sexuality. He also worked with noted and sex researcher and explored in a number of books and articles the topic of human sexuality and love. Sex and love relations were his professional interests even from the beginning of his career. , in his preface to Ellis' 1952 book , applauded the work of the Society for the Prevention of Venereal Disease while he ridiculed its rival, the National Council for Combating Venereal Disease, who argued that preventive measures such as would encourage vice: Haire called them ""the Society for the Prevention of the Prevention of Venereal Disease"". In 1958, Ellis published his classic work which came to be known for its advocacy of a liberal attitude towards sex. He contributed to 's magazine ; among its articles, in 1964 he wrote if this be heresy... Is pornography harmful to children? In 1965, Ellis published a book entitled , which partly saw as a pathology and therefore a condition to be cured. In 1973, the reversed its position on homosexuality by declaring that it was not a mental disorder and thus not properly subject to cure, and in 1976, Ellis clarified his earlier views in , expounding that some homosexual disturbed behaviors may be subject to treatment but, in most cases, that should not be attempted as homosexuality is not inherently good or evil, except from a religious viewpoint (See ""Ellis and religion"", below). Near the end of his life, he finally updated and re-wrote in 2001 and released as . In this book, he expounded and enhanced his humanistic view on sexual ethics and morality and dedicated a chapter on homosexuality to giving homosexuals advice and suggestion on how to more greatly enjoy and enhance their sexual love lives. While preserving some of the ideas about human sexuality from the original, the revision described his later humanistic opinions and ethical ideals as they had evolved in his academic work and practice. Ellis published his first major book on in 1962. REBT is an active-directive, and based , the aim of which is to resolve and problems and disturbances and to help people to lead happier and more fulfilling lives. REBT is seen as the first form of (CBT). Ellis advocated the importance of accepting yourself just because you are alive, human and unique - and not giving yourself a global rating, or being influenced by what others think of you. In 1979 and during the next two decades Ellis focuses part of his research on behavioral integrity through applied experimental psychology, focusing on , and as psychosocial behavior. as a cognitive norm, evaluating concretely through images developed in his Institute. In his book developed with and establish the opinions of evaluation of integrity understanding the reason of each personality can have a change in their attitude, reliability is the common factor of their samples taken and of the which great advances were obtained to look for a tool to work with the human mind. In his original version of his book , Ellis expressed the opinion that religious restrictions on sexual expression are often needless and harmful to emotional health. He also famously debated religious psychologists, including and , over the proposition that religion often contributed to psychological distress. Because of his forthright espousal of a nontheistic humanism, he was recognized in 1971 as Humanist of the Year by the . By 2003, he was one of the signers of the . Ellis most recently described himself as a , meaning that while he acknowledged that he could not be completely certain there is no god, he believed the probability a god exists was so small that it was not worth his or anyone else's attention. While Ellis' personal atheism and humanism remained consistent, his views about the role of religion in mental health changed over time. In early comments delivered at conventions and at his institute in New York City, Ellis overtly and often with characteristically acerbic delivery stated that devout religious beliefs and practices were harmful to mental health. In ""The Case Against Religiosity"", a 1980 pamphlet published by his New York institute, he offered an idiosyncratic definition of religiosity as any devout, dogmatic and demanding belief. He noted that religious codes and religious individuals often manifest religiosity, but added that devout, demanding religiosity is also obvious among many orthodox psychotherapists and psychoanalysts, devout political believers and aggressive atheists. Ellis was careful to state that REBT was independent of his atheism, noting that many skilled REBT practitioners are religious, including some who are ordained ministers. In his later days, he significantly toned down his opposition to religion. While Ellis maintained his firm atheistic stance, proposing that thoughtful, probabilistic atheism was likely the most emotionally healthy approach to life, he acknowledged and agreed with survey evidence suggesting that belief in a loving God can also be psychologically healthy. Based on this later approach to religion, he reformulated his professional and personal view in one of his last books , and he also co-authored a book, Counseling and Psychotherapy with Religious Persons: A Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Approach, with two religious psychologists, Stevan Lars Nielsen and W. Brad Johnson, describing principles for integrating religious material and beliefs with REBT during treatment of religious clients. Ellis was a lifelong advocate for peace and an opponent of militarism. He also praised libertarian economist 's book, . While many of his ideas were criticized during the 1950s and '60s by the psychotherapeutic establishment, his reputation grew immensely in the subsequent decades. From the 1960s on, his prominence was steadily growing as the (CBT) were gaining further theoretical and scientific ground. From then, CBT gradually became one of the most popular systems of psychotherapy in many countries, mainly due to the large body of rigorously conducted research that underpinned the work of the school (a key part of the CBT family) founded by . In the late 1960s, his institute launched a professional journal, and in the early 70s established ""The Living School"" for children between 6 and 13. The school provided a curriculum that incorporated the principles of RE(B)T. Despite its relative short life, interest groups generally expressed satisfaction with its programmer. Many schools of psychological thought became influenced by Albert Ellis, including created by a student of his, Ellis had such an impact that in a 1982 , American and Canadian clinical psychologists and counsellors ranked him ahead of Freud when asked to name the figure who had exerted the average influence on their field. Also in 1982, in an analysis of psychology journals published in the US it was found that Ellis was the most cited author after 1957. In 1985, the APA presented Dr. Ellis with its award for ""distinguished professional contributions"". He held many important positions in many professional societies including the Division of Consulting Psychology of the APA, Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality, American Association of Marital and Family Therapy, the American Academy of Psychotherapists and the American Association of Sex Educators, Counsellors, and Therapists. In addition Ellis also served as consulting or associate editor of many . Many professional societies gave Ellis their highest professional and clinical awards. In the mid-1990s, he renamed his psychotherapy and behavior change system rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT). (It was originally known as rational therapy and then rational-emotive therapy.) This he did to stress the interrelated importance of cognition, emotion and behaviour in his therapeutic approach. In 1994, he also updated and revised his original, 1962 classic book, . During the remainder of his life, he continued developing the theory that cognition, emotion and behaviour are intertwined, and that a system for psychotherapy and behaviour change must involve all three. Ellis's work extended into areas other than psychology, including education, politics, business and philosophy. He eventually became a prominent and confrontational social commenter and public speaker on a wide array of issues. During his career he publicly debated a vast number of people who represented opposing views to his; this included for example debates with psychologist on and psychiatrist on the topic of . On numerous occasions he critiqued opposing psychotherapeutic approaches, and questioned some of the doctrines in certain dogmatic religious systems, i.e.: and . From 1965 until the end of his life he led his famous Friday Night Workshops, in which he conducted therapy sessions with volunteers from the audience. The 1970s found him introducing his popular ""rational humorous songs"" which combined humorous lyrics with a rational self-help message set to a popular tune. Ellis also held workshops and seminars on mental health and psychotherapy all over the world until his 90s. Until he fell ill at the age of 92 in 2006, Ellis typically worked at least 16 hours a day, writing books in longhand on legal tablets, visiting with clients, and teaching. On his 90th birthday in 2003, he received congratulatory messages from well-known public figures such as then-President , New York senators and , former President , New York City Mayor , and the , who sent a silk scarf blessed for the occasion. In 2004, Ellis was taken ill with serious intestinal problems, which led to hospitalization and the removal of his . He returned to work after a few months of supportive care. In 2005, he was removed from all professional duties and from the board of his own institute after a dispute over the management policies of the institute. Ellis was reinstated to the board in January 2006 after winning civil proceedings against the board members who removed him. On June 6, 2007, lawyers acting for Albert Ellis filed a suit against the Albert Ellis Institute in New York state court. The suit alleges a breach of a long-term contract with the AEI and sought recovery of the 45 East 65th Street property through the imposition of a constructive trust. Despite his series of health issues and profound hearing loss, Ellis never stopped working with the assistance of his wife, Australian psychologist Debbie Joffe Ellis. In April 2006, Ellis was hospitalized with , and spent more than a year shuttling between hospital and a rehabilitation facility. He eventually returned to his residence on the top floor of the Albert Ellis Institute where he died on July 24, 2007 in his wife's arms. Ellis had authored and co-authored more than 80 books and 1200 articles (including eight hundred scientific papers) during his lifetime. He died aged 93. During his final years he worked on his only college textbook with longtime collaborator with whom he co-authored 3 books along with several research articles and chapters, including the textbook . Ellis' penultimate book was an autobiography entitled """" published by in June 2010. The book was dedicated to and included contributions by his wife, Dr Debbie Joffe Ellis, to whom he entrusted the legacy of REBT. In early 2011, the book by Albert and Debbie Joffe Ellis was released by the American Psychological Association. The book explains the essentials of the theory of REBT for students and practitioners of psychology as well as for the general public. In eulogy of Albert Ellis, APA past president states: Psychology has had only a handful of legendary figures who not only command attention across much of the discipline but also receive high recognition from the public for their work. Albert Ellis was such a figure, known inside and outside of psychology for his astounding originality, his provocative ideas, and his provocative personality. He bestrode the practice of psychotherapy like a colossus… In the opening ceremony of the 2013 American Psychological Association Convention, Ellis was posthumously awarded the APA Award For Outstanding Lifetime Contributions to Psychology. It highlights the profound and historic role played in the life and evolution of the fields of psychology and psychotherapy. (Prometheus Books, 2004) explains the philosophies underlying REBT - particularly an attitude of tolerance - and relates it to many religious, philosophical and social movements. ""I think I can honestly say that I am one of the relatively few people in the United States, and perhaps in the entire world, who has not had a seriously miserable day since I created REBT in 1955. I find it almost impossible to feel intensely depressed, hostile, or upset for more than literally a few minutes at a time. ... Whereas I was desperately unhappy for a good part of my childhood and teens, this feeling is virtually unknown to me today. Instead, these days I almost automatically go after self-disturbances and quickly eliminate them. Not squelch, suppress, or repress them – I mean really eliminate. ... I derive considerable pleasure, enjoyment, and sometimes sheer bliss out of life. What more can one ask?"" Albert Ellis, ""The Road To Tolerance."" p. 77 In the 'Final wisdom' chapter of his 2001 book, ""Feeling better..."", Ellis proposed that people try different tools to see what works best for them. ""What works best for you may be radically different than what works for other people."" Most of the books Ellis wrote after inventing REBT had a strong autobiographical element. He used anecdotes from his personal life to explain how the insights of REBT occurred to him and how they helped him cope with personal problems such as shyness, anger and chronic illness. He also used anecdotes from client sessions to illustrate how his therapy worked. Two of Ellis last books were explicitly autobiographical. Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy: It Works for Me -- It Can Work for You (Prometheus Books, 2004) recounts his early life and crises in an unusually candid way. It illustrates the way he handled his problems, at first through philosophy, and later through the application of his emerging therapeutic skills and insights. (Prometheus Books, 2009) —published after his death—is a more traditional narrative of his life and work (though it also meant to be an inspirational story of the use of rational thinking in self-help). Fellow psychologists often criticized Ellis for what they described as a tone that could come off as blaming people for their depression, and for not offering any evidence to back his views on psychotherapy. In his obituary in the British newspaper , it was noted that others, such as , had conducted more rigorous testing than what Ellis was willing to undertake and were able to better advance . His approach to treatment of severe depression was also criticized as suggesting simplistic things like ""pull your socks up.""

Two distinct historic pathways can be identified for present-day provision in and in the : one through the Movement, the other stemming from Adult or Psychological Medicine, which evolved a separate specialism. Terms describing child-focused treatments may vary from one part of the world to another, with particular differences in the use of such terms, as ""therapy"", ""child "" or """". List of therapies for children reviewed in empirical studies Psychoanalytic psychotherapy with infants, children and adolescents is mainly delivered by people qualified specifically in psychoanalytic child psychotherapy, or by trainees under supervision from a specialist in child-focused treatment. Recent evidence, covering 34 research papers (nine of which were ) showed psychoanalytic psychotherapy to be particularly effective for children with the following conditions: Furthermore, follow-up research shows that in psychoanalytic psychotherapy, therapeutic improvements continue well beyond the termination of the therapy itself. This has been termed a, ""sleeper effect."" In the UK, psychoanalytic psychotherapy is recommended by as an evidence-based treatment for trauma from sexual abuse and severe depression in adolescents following the IMPACT study There are various therapeutic assessments to address mental health concerns among children and adolescents. Some approaches are backed by strong scientific evidence, while some are not. Some research suggests that it is the quality of the relationship with the therapist, rather than the particular form of therapeutic intervention, that is the strongest factor in helping change develop. If the normal course of between parent and infant is disrupted, parent–infant psychotherapy is a catch-all term to describe psychotherapies that either aim to restore this bond or to work with vulnerable parents to overcome disruption and prevent further occurrence. Examples of this kind of therapy include, ""Watch, Wait, Wonder,"" and . Many of these techniques require a three-way relationship between the parent, child, and therapist. During therapy sessions, the parent may express his or her thoughts and feelings which are based on a combination of factors including: The parent's expectations and hopes for the child's future The relationships the parent has with other people The therapist's role is as an observer and an interpreter of the interaction between the infant and the parent. He might share some of his thoughts about the behavior of the child with the parent and by doing so offering the parent an alternative way of experiencing the child. This technique helps the parent to resolve issues with his or her own infancy-experiences in order to restore secure attachment with the infant. And it helps lower the risk for psychopathological developments of the child in the future.

They bring together approximately 1500 practitioners of psychoanalytic and psychodynamic (including psychoanalysts, and child psychotherapists) who as individuals become of the BPC. The BPC (then the ) was formed on 8 March 1992, emerging from the United Kingdom Standing Conference for Psychotherapy (now the ) as a specifically psychoanalytically-oriented organisation. It has an annual register of those practitioners who meet its continuing professional and fitness-to-practise standards. Promoting professional standards and acting as a voluntary regulator of the profession is a key role of the BPC. The BPC accredits the trainings of its member institutions, ensuring that they meet published training standards. Some of these are member organisations of the . An individual who qualifies from one of these trainings is then eligible for entry into the BPC's register. BPC registration then continues to be governed by a range of fitness to practise requirements: The therapist must be a member of good standing of their own professional institution (which is a member institution of the BPC) They subscribe to and are governed by the BPC's published They are regulated by the BPC's Complaints Procedure They must maintain an annual programme of (CPD), monitored and approved by the BPC, which includes consultation on their clinical work, attending lectures and courses and a broad range of professional activity. The preparation and training for becoming a psychoanalytic psychotherapist involves undergoing analysis. The individual organisations that train psychotherapists have always been self-regulating. Over the last twenty years, however, there has been an increase in the number of institutions and range of psychotherapies on offer to the public. The British Psychoanalytic Council is one of a number of bodies which exist to protect the interests of the public by promoting standards in the selection, training, professional association and conduct of psychotherapists. It is the primary body for psychoanalytic psychotherapy in the UK. The BPC, together with each of its member institutions, aims to protect the public by setting out the appropriate standards of professional conduct, and a Code of Ethics, which describes the responsibilities of psychoanalytic psychotherapists. There are also comprehensive complaints and disciplinary procedures, which include the sanction of striking a practitioner off both their organisation's membership list and the BPC's Register. The detailed fitness to practise policies are all published on its website or are available from the BPC office.

It offers a hypothesis about the cause and nature of the presenting problems and is considered an adjunct or alternative approach to the more categorical approach of psychiatric . In clinical practice, formulations are used to communicate a and provide framework for developing the most suitable treatment approach. It is most commonly used by and and is deemed to be a core component of these professions. Mental health nurses and social workers may also use formulations. Different psychological schools or models utilize clinical formulations, including (CBT) and related therapies: , , and . The structure and content of a clinical formulation is determined by the psychological model. Most systems of formulation contain the following broad categories of information: symptoms and problems; precipitating stressors or events; predisposing life events or stressors; and an explanatory mechanism that links the preceding categories together and offers a description of the precipitants and maintaining influences of the person's problems. Behavioral case formulations used in and are built on a rank list of problem behaviors, from which a is conducted, sometimes based on . Such functional analysis is also used in third-generation behavior therapy or such as and . Functional analysis looks at setting events (ecological variables, history effects, and motivating operations), antecedents, behavior chains, the problem behavior, and the consequences, short- and long-term, for the behavior. A model of formulation that is more specific to CBT is described by Jacqueline Persons. This has seven components: problem list, core beliefs, precipitants and activating situations, origins, working hypothesis, treatment plan, and predicted obstacles to treatment. A psychodynamic formulation would consist of a summarizing statement, a description of nondynamic factors, description of core psychodynamics using a specific model (such as , or ), and a prognostic assessment which identifies the potential areas of in therapy. One school of psychotherapy which relies heavily on the formulation is (CAT). CAT is a fixed-term therapy, typically of around 16 sessions. At around session four, a formal written reformulation letter is offered to the patient which forms the basis for the rest of the treatment. This is usually followed by a diagrammatic reformulation to amplify and reinforce the letter. Many psychologists use an approach to formulation. This is to take advantage of the benefits of resources from each model the psychologist is trained in, according to the patient's needs. The quality of specific clinical formulations, and the quality of the general used in those formulations, can be evaluated with criteria such as: : Is the model understandable and , and are key concepts discrete, specific, and non-redundant? : Does the model produce testable hypotheses, with and concepts? : Are the posited within the model ? : Is the model enough to apply across a range of clinical phenomena? : Does it facilitate shared between clinician and client, and are interventions based on the model shown to be ? Formulations can vary in temporal scope from case-based to episode-based or moment-based, and formulations may evolve during the course of treatment. Therefore, ongoing monitoring, testing, and assessment during treatment are necessary: monitoring can take the form of session-by-session progress reviews using quantitative measures, and formulations can be modified if an intervention is not as effective as hoped. Psychologist , who developed in the 1950s, noted his complaint against traditional diagnosis in his book (1955): ""Much of the reform proposed by the psychology of personal constructs is directed towards the tendency for psychologists to impose preemptive constructions upon human behaviour. Diagnosis is all too frequently an attempt to cram a whole live struggling client into a nosological category."" In place of nosological categories, Kelly used the word ""formulation"" and mentioned two types of formulation: a first stage of , in which the clinician tentatively organizes clinical case information ""in terms of dimensions rather than in terms of disease entities"" while focusing on ""the more important ways in which the client can change, and not merely ways in which the psychologist can distinguish him from other persons"", and a second stage of , in which the clinician seeks a kind of negotiated integration of the clinician's organization of the case information with the client's personal meanings. Psychologists , , , and Ira Turkat were also among the early developers of systematic individualized alternatives to diagnosis. Meyer has been credited with providing perhaps the first training course of based on a case formulation model, at the in London in 1970.

Otto Kernberg designed an intensive form of known as , which is intended to be suitable for Borderline Personality Organization (BPO) patients. BPO patients are described as experiencing so-called 'splits' in their and thinking, and the intended aim of the treatment is focused on the integration of split off parts of self and object representations. TFP entails two to three 45 or 50-minute sessions per week. It views the individual as holding unreconciled and contradictory internalized representations of self and significant others that are affectively charged. The defense against these contradictory internalized object relations is called identity diffusion, and leads to disturbed relationships with others and with self. The distorted perceptions of self, others, and associated affects are the focus of treatment as they emerge in the relationship with the therapist (transference). The consistent interpretation of these distorted perceptions is considered the mechanism of change. Kernberg designed TFP especially for patients with BPO. According to him, these patients suffer from identity diffusion, primitive defense operations and unstable reality testing. Identity diffusion results from pathological object relations and involves contradictory character traits, discontinuity of self and either very idealized or devalued . often applied by BPO patients are splitting, denial, projective identification, primitive devaluation / idealization and omnipotence. Reality testing is negatively influenced by the primitive defense mechanisms as they change a person's perception of self and others. The major goals of TFP are better behavioral control, increased affect regulation, more intimate and gratifying relationships and the ability to pursue life goals. This is believed to be accomplished through the development of integrated representations of self and others, the modification of primitive and the resolution of identity diffusion that perpetuate the fragmentation of the patient's world. To do this, the client's affectively charged internal representations of previous relationships are consistently interpreted as the therapist becomes aware of them in the , that is, the . Techniques of clarification, confrontation, and interpretation are used within the evolving transference relationship between the patient and the therapist. The treatment begins with the development of the treatment contract, which consists of general guidelines that apply for all clients and of specific items developed from problem areas of the individual client that could interfere with the therapy progress. The contract also contains therapist responsibilities. The client and the therapist must agree to the content of the treatment contract before the therapy can proceed. (a) the diagnostic description of a particular internalized object relation in the transference (b) the diagnostic elaboration of the corresponding self and object representation in the transference, and of their enactment in the transference /countertransference and (c) the integration of the split-off self representations, leading to an integrated sense of self and others which resolves identity diffusion. During the first year of treatment, TFP focuses on a hierarchy of issues: the containment of and the identification and recapitulation of dominant object relational patterns (from unintegrated and undifferentiated affects and representations of self and others to a more coherent whole). In TFP, hypothesized mechanisms of change derive from Kernberg's developmentally based theory of Borderline Personality Organisation, conceptualized in terms of unintegrated and undifferentiated affects and of and other. Partial representations of self and other are paired and linked by an affect in mental units called dyads. These are elements of psychological structure. In borderline pathology, the lack of integration of the internal object relations dyads corresponds to a 'split' psychological structure in which totally negative representations are split off/segregated from idealized positive representations of self and other (seeing people as all good or all bad). The putative global mechanism of change in patients treated with TFP is the integration of these polarized affect states and representations of self and other into a more coherent whole. Theory on narcissism and the controversy with H. Kohut Otto Kernberg states that there are three types of narcissism: normal adult narcissism, normal infantile narcissism, and pathological narcissism. Pathological narcissism, defined as the in a pathological structure of the self, is further divided into three types (regression to the regulation of the infantile , narcissistic choice of object, narcissistic personality disorder) with narcissistic personality disorder being the most severe of all. Still, narcissism has been a great source of disagreement between Otto Kernberg and . Although both focused on narcissistic, borderline, and psychotic patients, the focus and content of their theory and treatment has been considerably differentiated. Their major diversities emerged in response to their conceptualizations regarding the relationship between Narcissistic and Borderline personalities, normal vs. pathological narcissism, their ideas about narcissistic idealization and the self, as well as the psychoanalytic technique and the narcissistic transference. According to Kernberg, the self is an intrapsychic structure consisting of multiple self representations. It is a realistic self which integrates both good and bad self-images. That is, the self constitutes a structure that combines libidinally and aggressively invested components. Kernberg defines normal narcissism as the libidinal investment of the self. However, it needs to be emphasized that this libidinal investment of the self is not merely derived from an instinctual source of libidinal energy. On the contrary, it stems from the several relationships between the self and other intrapsychic structures, such as the ego the superego and the id. This is a normal self-esteem based on normal structures of the self. The individual has introjected whole representations of objects, has stable objects relationships and a solid moral system. The superego is fully developed and individualized. Regulation of self-esteem occurs through gratifications related to the age, which include or imply a normal infantile system of values, demands or prohibitions. Regression to the regulation of infantile self-esteem. The ideal ego is dominated by infantile pursuits, values and prohibitions. The regulation of self-esteem is overly dependent on expressions or defences against infantile pleasures, which are discarded in adult life. This is the mildest type of narcissistic pathology. Narcissistic choice of object. This type is more severe than the first one but more rare. The representation of the infantile self is projected on an object and then identified through that same object. Thus, a libidinal association is generated, where the functions of the self and the object have been exchanged. Narcissistic personality disorder. This type is different from both normal adult narcissism and from regression to normal infantile narcissism. It is the most severe type and is suitable for psychoanalysis. In Kernberg's view, narcissistic personalities are differentiated from both normal adult narcissism and from fixation at or regression to normal infantile narcissism. Fixation at a primitive stage of development or lack of development of specific intrapsychic structures is not adequate to explain the characteristics of narcissistic personalities. Those characteristics (through a process of pathological differentiation and integration of ego and superego structures) are the consequence of pathological object relationships. Pathological narcissism is not merely the libidinal investment in the self but in a pathological, underdeveloped structure of the self. This pathological structure presents defences against early self and object images, which are either libidinally or aggressively invested. The psychoanalytic process brings to the surface primitive object relations, conflicts and defences, which are typical of the developmental stages that precede the stability of the object. Otto Kernberg and Heinz Kohut can be considered to be two theorists that have markedly influenced past and current psychoanalytic thinking. Both focused on the observation and treatment of patients who were otherwise thought to be unsuitable for analytic therapy. Their main work has been mostly related to individuals with narcissistic, borderline, and psychotic psychopathology. Still, their perspectives concerning the causes, psychic organization, and treatment of these disorders have been considerably different. Taken as a whole, Kohut is regarded as a self theorist who radically departed from Sigmund Freud's conjectural conceptualizations, focusing mostly on people's need for self-organization and self-expression. Kernberg in contrast, remained faithful to the Freudian metapsychology, concentrating more on people's struggle between and . Their main differences are summarized below. Relationship between narcissistic personality and borderline personality One of the main disagreements between the two theorists revolves around their conceptualization among narcissistic and borderline disorders. According to Kernberg, the defensive structure of the individual is quite similar to that of the borderline person since the former has a fairly underlying borderline personality organization which becomes obvious when one looks at the defenses of splitting and projective identification. He identifies constitutional along with factors as the source of disturbance for these individuals by stressing the important role of the who treats the child on the surface (callously) with little regard for his/her feelings and needs. Kohut on the other hand, sees borderline personality as totally distinct from the narcissistic one and less able to benefit from the analytic . Equally, a narcissistic personality is more apt for analysis since it is characterized by a more resilient self. According to Kohut, the environment alone is the major cause of troubles for these persons. Moreover, although both focus on the concept of the in their narcissistic personality theorizing, they provide different explanations for it. For Kohut, reflects the while for Kernberg it is a pathological development, different from normal narcissism. For Kohut treatment should be primarily centered on encouraging the patient's narcissistic desires, wishes, and to open up during the process of transference. For Kernberg, the goal of treatment should be to use confrontation strategies so as to help the patient integrate his/her internal fragmented world. One of the main arguments between Kohut and Kernberg is about normal and pathological narcissism. As mentioned earlier, Kohut assumes that a narcissistic personality suffers from developmental arrest. Specifically, he assumes that this type of personality mirrors adaptive narcissistic wishes, needs, and that, nevertheless, have not been satisfied during by the parental environment. Here, the grandiose self is nothing more than an archaic form that prospectively ought to become the normal self. When this does not occur then pathological narcissism emerges. In his explanation of pathological narcissism, he pays attention on the forces or charges in order to provide an of how this disorder develops. For him the aggression is of secondary importance in respect to the libidinal drive and that is why one should differentiate between ordinary aggression and narcissistic . The first, according to him, is adaptive for eradicating obstructions when heading toward a realistic goal whereas the second is the forceful response to narcissistic injury. Kernberg however, sees Kohut's ideas as de-emphasizing the power of aggression. He allies more to the Freudian conceptualization, by proposing that narcissistic behavior results from pathological development in which aggressive drives play a central role. He argues that narcissism on the whole involves a strong aggressive drive that cannot possibly be analyzed separately from the libidinal one. As he says, ""one cannot study the vicissitudes of normal and pathological narcissism without relating the development of the respective internalized object relations to both libidinal and aggressive drive alternatives."" Relationship between narcissistic idealization and grandiose self Kohut departed from the classical Freudian view, which suggested that some patients could not be analyzed given that they lacked the ability to develop transferences. He postulated that narcissistic patients are capable of presenting transferences but these are somewhat different from those of other patients, such as the neurotics. He distinguished three types, namely the idealizing, the mirror, or the twinship transference. His debate with Kernberg concerns mostly the idealizing transference, which, according to Kohut, relates to a fixation at an archaic level of normal development. Still Kernberg believed that the idealizing transference is nothing more than a pathological type of idealization that is produced as a response to the substantial instigation of the grandiose self in the transference. Psychoanalytic technique and narcissistic transference Otto F. Kernberg and regard the analytic process as well as the role of the analyst in quite different terms. The analytical situation concerning pathological narcissism according to Otto F. Kernberg Kernberg requests a methodological and persistent interpretation of the defensive function of grandiosity and idealization as they emerge in transference. The role of the analyst should be neutral rather than supportive, especially during the confrontation process, in order to modify the narcissist's pathological structure. ""The analyst must be continuously focusing on the particular quality of the transference in these cases and consistently counteract the patient's efforts toward omnipotent control and devaluation"". This traditional emphasis on aggressive interpretation of narcissistic phenomena derives from and is wholly consistent with Freud's early view of narcissistic neuroses as unanalysable and narcissistic defenses as generating the most recalcitrant resistances to the analytic process. The analytical situation concerning pathological narcissism according to Heinz Kohut In contrast to seeing primitive grandiosity or idealization as a representation of a defensive retreat from reality, regards narcissistic illusions within the analytic situation as representations of the patient's attempt to establish crucial developmental opportunities. These narcissistic illusions thus give an opportunity for revitalization of the self. Therefore, Heinz Kohut advocates that the analyst's position within treatment should be one where a full narcissistic transference should be encouraged instead of being challenged. To establish this, the analyst should be able to show empathic comprehension, which entails a receptivity to the narcissistic illusions and an avoidance at all costs of anything which would challenge them or suggest they are unrealistic. used the concepts of narcissistic transference and self-object needs. He also stressed the significance of infantilism and what appear to be excessive demands on the analyst and everyone else. Rather than instinctual wishes to be renounced, they are missed developmental needs to be warmly received and understood. The patient is groping toward self-cure, by trying to extract from others what was missing early in his development. Heinz Kohut feels the patient knows what he needs, regardless of what the analyst may think he knows. He stresses the importance of hopes in maturity and throughout development. There is an enduring need for ideals and idealization that vitalizes self experience. In his work with narcissistic patients, the defining feature of Heinz Kohut's psychoanalytic methodology became therefore empathic immersion (or vicarious inspection), whereby he tried to put himself in his patient's shoes. This view is certainly in contrast with Freud's early view of the analyzability of narcissistic defenses as discussed above. Approaches as regarded by Heinz Kohut and Otto F. Kernberg Both Kohut and Kernberg regarded each other's approaches as counterproductive. From Kohut's point of view, the methodical interpretive approach recommended by Kernberg is interpreted by the narcissistically vulnerable patient as an assault and generates intense narcissistic rage. As Kernberg instead recommends this methodology for treating these patients, self-psychology regards Kernberg as creating narcissism instead of treating it. On the other hand, Kernberg (from the more traditional point of view) sees the approach of Kohut as leading to nothing. An unquestioning acceptance of the patient's illusions with the assumption that they will eventually diminish of their own accord represents a collusion with the patient's defenses. The analytic process is thereby subverted and the analyst never emerges as a figure who can meaningfully help the patient. However, Stephen A. Mitchell offers an integrative relational approach in which the perspectives of both Kernberg and Kohut are connected. In his opinion, ""the more traditional approach to narcissism highlights the important ways in which the narcissistic illusions are used defensively, but misses their role in health and creativity and in consolidating certain kinds of developmentally crucial relationships with others. The developmental-arrest approach (Kohut) had generated a perspective on narcissism which stresses the growth-enhancing function of narcissistic illusions, but overlooks the extent to which they often constrict and interfere in real engagements between the analysand and other people, including the analyst"". Mitchell recommends a ""subtle dialectic between articulating and embracing the analysand's illusions on the one hand, and the provision of larger context in which they can be experienced, on the other"". One of Kernberg's major contributions is his developmental model. This model is built on the developmental tasks one has to complete in order to develop healthy relationships. When one fails to accomplish a certain developmental task, this responds to the increased risk to develop certain psychopathologies. Whereby failing the first developmental task, which is psychic clarification of self and other, an increased risk of development of varieties of psychosis results. Not accomplishing the second task (overcoming splitting) results in an increased risk of developing a borderline personality disorder. Furthermore, his developmental model includes Kernberg's view about drives, in which he differs from Freud. Kernberg was obviously inspired by Melanie Klein, whose model draws mainly on the paranoid-schizoid position and on the depressive position. More elaborate information on Kernberg's ideas can be found in a recent publication by Cohen M. (2000). Kernberg saw the in the first months of his life as struggling to sort out his experience on the basis of the affective valence of this experience. The infant moves back and forth between two different affective states. One state is characterized as pleasurable and gratified; the other state is unpleasurable, painful and frustrating. Regardless of what one is in, no distinction is made between self and other. First developmental task: psychic clarification of self and other The first developmental task embodies being able to make a distinction between what is self and what is other. When this task would not be accomplished, one cannot develop a dependable sense of the self as separate and distinct because one cannot make a distinction between one's own experience and the experience of others. This failure is hypothesized to be the major precursor for all psychotic states. In schizophrenic symptoms (, , psychic fragmentation) we can see a lack of being able to separate between internal and external world, own experience and experience of others, own mind and the mind of another. The second developmental task is to overcome splitting. When the first developmental task is accomplished, one is able to differentiate between self-images and object images; however, these images remain segregated affectively. Loving self images and images of good objects are held together by positive , or libidinal affects. Hateful images of the self and bad, frustrating object images are held together by negative or aggressive affects. The good is separated from the bad. The developmental task is accomplished when the child is able to see objects as ""whole"", meaning that the can see objects as being both good and bad. Next to seeing ""whole"" objects, the child is required to see the self as being loving and hating, as being good and bad at the same time. When one fails to accomplish this second developmental task, this will result in a borderline pathology, meaning that objects or the self cannot be seen as both good and bad; something is good, or it is bad, but both affects cannot be in the same object together. Kernberg's model of self and object development rests on five stages that delineate the growth of the internalized object relations units, some of which already start taking place during the precipitating stage. The stages are not static, but fluent. This stage is marked by undifferentiated self-object representations. This stage is equated with , Pine and Bergman's conception of autism. Stage 2 (2 months to 6–8 months): Normal In the beginning of this stage the child is unable to integrate opposing affective valences. Libidinally invested and aggressively invested representations are strictly separated into a 'good' self-object representation and a 'bad' self-object representation. Stage 3 (6–8 months to 18–36 months): Differentiation of self from object relations In this stage the 'good' self-object representation differentiates into a 'good' self and a 'good' object and shortly thereafter the 'bad' self-object representation differentiates into a 'bad' self and a 'bad' object. A failure of the child to differentiate between self and other results in a psychotic personality organization; one has failed to accomplish the first developmental task and is stuck in stage II. Although in this stage differentiation between self and object has taken place the good and bad self and object representations are strictly separated through the mechanism of splitting in order to protect the ideal, good relationship with the mother from contamination by bad self representations and bad representations of her. Stage 4 (36+ months through the oedipal period): The integration of self representations and object representations During this stage the 'good' (libidinally invested) and 'bad' (aggressively invested) self and object representations are integrated into a definite self-system and a total object representation. One is able to comprehend the possibility of the self or other containing both positive and negative characteristics. A failure of this results in a borderline personality organization; one has failed to accomplish the second developmental task and is stuck in stage III. Consequently, the good self and object must still be protected from the aggression by the splitting of good and bad. Stage 5: Consolidation of superego and ego integration In this stage are consolidated in definite intrapsychic structures. By successfully completing all the developmental tasks, the child has developed a neurotic personality organization, which is the strongest personality structure. In contrast with Freud's perspective, drives are not inborn according to Kernberg. The libidinal and aggressive drives are shaped, developed over time by experiences of with others. The child's good and bad affects become consolidated and shaped into libidinal and aggressive drives. Good, pleasurable interactions with others consolidate, over time, into a pleasure-seeking (libidinal) drive. In the same way bad, unsatisfying and frustrating interactions with others, become consolidated into a destructive (aggressive) drive over time.

During psychoanalytic sessions, typically lasting 50 minutes, ideally 4–5 times a week, the patient (or ) may lie on a couch, with the analyst often sitting just behind and out of sight. The patient expresses his or her thoughts, including , , and dreams, from which the analyst infers the unconscious conflicts causing the patient's symptoms and character problems. Through the analysis of these conflicts, which includes interpreting the transference and (the analyst's feelings for the patient), the analyst confronts the patient's pathological to help the patient gain . first used the term 'psychoanalysis' (: ) in 1896, ultimately retaining the term for his own school of thought. In November 1899, he wrote the (: ), which Freud thought of as his ""most significant work."" Psychoanalysis was later developed in different directions, mostly by students of Freud such as and , and by such as , and . The idea of psychoanalysis (: ) first began to receive serious attention under , who formulated his own theory of psychoanalysis in in the 1890s. Freud was a trying to find an effective treatment for patients with or symptoms. Freud realised that there were mental processes that were not conscious, whilst he was employed as a neurological consultant at the Children's Hospital, where he noticed that many children had no apparent organic cause for their symptoms. He then wrote a about this subject. In 1885, Freud obtained a grant to study with , a famed neurologist, at the in Paris, where Freud followed the clinical presentations of Charcot, particularly in the areas of hysteria, paralyses and the anaesthesias. Charcot had introduced hypnotism as an experimental research tool and developed the photographic representation of clinical symptoms. Freud's first theory to explain hysterical symptoms was presented in (1895; ), co-authored with his mentor the distinguished physician , which was generally seen as the birth of psychoanalysis. The work was based on Breuer's treatment of , referred to in case studies by the """", treatment which Pappenheim herself had dubbed the """". Breuer wrote that many factors could result in such symptoms, including various types of emotional trauma, and he also credited work by others such as ; while Freud contended that at the root of hysterical symptoms were repressed memories of distressing occurrences, almost always having direct or indirect sexual associations. Around the same time, Freud attempted to develop a neuro-physiological theory of unconscious mental mechanisms, which he soon gave up. It remained unpublished in his lifetime. The term 'psychoanalysis' () was first introduced by Freud in his essay titled ""Heredity and etiology of neuroses"" (""""), written and published in French in 1896. In 1896, Freud also published his , claiming to have uncovered repressed memories of incidents of sexual abuse for all his current patients, from which he proposed that the preconditions for symptoms are in infancy. However, by 1898 he had privately acknowledged to his friend and colleague that he no longer believed in his theory, though he did not state this publicly until 1906. Though in 1896 he had reported that his patients ""had no feeling of remembering the [infantile sexual] scenes"", and assured him ""emphatically of their unbelief,"" in later accounts he claimed that they had told him that they had been sexually abused in infancy. This became the received historical account until challenged by several Freud scholars in the latter part of the 20th century who argued that he had imposed his preconceived notions on his patients. However, building on his claims that the patients reported infantile sexual abuse experiences, Freud subsequently contended that his clinical findings in the mid-1890s provided evidence of the occurrence of unconscious fantasies, supposedly to cover up memories of . Only much later did he claim the same findings as evidence for desires. By 1899, Freud had theorised that dreams had symbolic significance, and generally were specific to the dreamer. Freud formulated his second psychological theory— which hypotheses that the unconscious has or is a ""primary process"" consisting of symbolic and condensed thoughts, and a ""secondary process"" of logical, conscious thoughts. This theory was published in his 1899 book, . Chapter VII is a re-working of the earlier ""Project"" and Freud outlined his . In this theory, which was mostly later supplanted by the Structural Theory, unacceptable sexual wishes were repressed into the ""System Unconscious,"" unconscious due to society's condemnation of premarital sexual activity, and this repression created anxiety. This "" theory"" is still popular in much of Europe, although it has fallen out of favour in much of North America. In 1905, Freud published in which he laid out his discovery of the : His early formulation included the idea that because of societal restrictions, sexual wishes were repressed into an unconscious state, and that the energy of these unconscious wishes could be turned into anxiety or physical symptoms. Therefore, the early treatment techniques, including hypnotism and abreaction, were designed to make the unconscious conscious in order to relieve the pressure and the apparently resulting symptoms. This method would later on be left aside by Freud, giving free association a bigger role. In (1915), Freud turned his attention to the titular subject of . Still using an energic system, Freud characterized the difference between energy directed at the self versus energy directed at others, called . By 1917, in "","" he suggested that certain depressions were caused by turning guilt-ridden anger on the self. In 1919, through ""A Child is Being Beaten,"" he began to address the problems of (moral masochism) and frank sexual masochism. Based on his experience with depressed and self-destructive patients, and pondering the carnage of , Freud became dissatisfied with considering only oral and sexual motivations for behavior. By 1920, Freud addressed the power of identification (with the leader and with other members) in groups as a motivation for behavior (in """"). In that same year, Freud suggested his ' of sexuality and aggression in "","" to try to begin to explain human destructiveness. Also, it was the first appearance of his ""structural theory"" consisting of three new concepts . Three years later, in 1923, he summarised the ideas of id, ego, and superego in ""."" In the book, he revised the whole theory of mental functioning, now considering that repression was only one of many defense mechanisms, and that it occurred to reduce anxiety. Hence, Freud characterised repression as both a cause and a result of anxiety. In 1926, in ""Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety,"" Freud characterised how intrapsychic conflict among drive and superego (wishes and guilt) caused , and how that anxiety could lead to an inhibition of mental functions, such as intellect and speech. ""Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety"" was written in response to , who, in 1924, published (), analysing how art, myth, religion, philosophy and therapy were illuminated by separation anxiety in the ""phase before the development of the Oedipus complex."" Freud's theories, however, characterized no such phase. According to Freud, the Oedipus complex, was at the centre of neurosis, and was the foundational source of all art, myth, religion, philosophy, therapy—indeed of all human culture and civilization. It was the first time that anyone in the had characterised something other than the Oedipus complex as contributing to intrapsychic development, a notion that was rejected by Freud and his followers at the time. By 1936 the ""Principle of Multiple Function"" was clarified by . He widened the formulation that psychological symptoms were caused by and relieved conflict simultaneously. Moreover, symptoms (such as and ) each represented elements of some drive wish (sexual and/or aggressive), superego, anxiety, reality, and defenses. Also in 1936, , Sigmund's daughter, published her seminal book, , outlining numerous ways the mind could shut upsetting things out of consciousness. When 's power grew, the Freud family and many of their colleagues fled to London. Within a year, Sigmund Freud died. In the United States, also following the death of Freud, a new group of psychoanalysts began to explore the function of the ego. Led by , the group built upon understandings of the function of the ego as a mediator in psychic functioning, distinguishing such from ego functions (e.g. memory and intellect, which could be secondarily affected by conflict). These ""Ego Psychologists"" of the 1950s paved a way to focus analytic work by attending to the defenses (mediated by the ego) before exploring the deeper roots to the unconscious conflicts. In addition, there was burgeoning interest in . Although criticized since its inception, psychoanalysis has been used as a research tool into childhood development, and is still used to treat certain mental disturbances. In the 1960s, Freud's early thoughts on the childhood development of were challenged; this challenge led to the development of a variety of understandings of female sexual development, many of which modified the timing and normality of several of Freud's theories (which had been gleaned from the treatment of women with mental disturbances). Several researchers followed 's studies of societal pressures that influence the development of women. In the first decade of the 21st century, there were approximately 35 training institutes for psychoanalysis in the United States accredited by the (APsaA), which is a component organization of the (IPA), and there are over 3000 graduated psychoanalysts practicing in the United States. The IPA accredits psychoanalytic training centers through such ""component organisations"" throughout the rest of the world, including countries such as Serbia, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, and many others, as well as about six institutes directly in the United States. In the 1950s, psychoanalysis was the main modality of . Behavioural models of pschotherapy started to assume a more central role in psychotherapy in the 1960s. a psychiatrist trained in a psychoanalytic tradition set out to test the psychoanalytic models of depression and found that conscious ruminations of loss and personal failing were correlated with depression. He suggested that distorted and biased beliefs were a causal factor of depression, publishing an influential paper in 1967 after a decade of research using the construct of to explain the process. Beck developed this into a talking therapy in the early 1970s called . The predominant psychoanalytic theories can be organised into several theoretical schools. Although these perspectives differ, most of them emphasize the influence of unconscious elements on the conscious. There has also been considerable work done on consolidating elements of conflicting theories. As in the field of , there are some persistent conflicts regarding specific causes of certain syndromes, and disputes regarding the ideal treatment techniques. In the 21st century, psychoanalytic ideas are embedded in , especially in fields such as , , , , , and particularly . Though there is a of evolved analytic , there are groups who follow the of one or more of the later theoreticians. Psychoanalytic ideas also play roles in some types of literary analysis such as . was named and first described by in (1899). The theory hypothesizes that the mental apparatus can be divided into the systems , , and . These systems are not structures of the brain but, rather, mental processes. Although Freud retained this theory throughout his life he largely replaced it with the . The Topographic theory remains as one of the meta-psychological points of view for describing how the mind functions in classical psychoanalytic theory. Structural theory divides the psyche into the , the , and the . The id is present at birth as the repository of basic instincts, which Freud called """" (""drives""): unorganized and unconscious, it operates merely on the 'pleasure principle', without realism or foresight. The ego develops slowly and gradually, being concerned with mediating between the urging of the id and the realities of the external world; it thus operates on the 'reality principle'. The super-ego is held to be the part of the ego in which self-observation, self-criticism and other reflective and judgmental faculties develop. The ego and the super-ego are both partly conscious and partly unconscious. During the twentieth century, many different clinical and theoretical models of psychoanalysis emerged. was initially suggested by Freud in ""Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety"" (1926), while major steps forward would be made through 's work on , first published in her book (1936). The theory was refined by , Loewenstein, and Kris in a series of papers and books from 1939 through the late 1960s. Leo Bellak was a later contributor. This series of constructs, paralleling some of the later developments of cognitive theory, includes the notions of autonomous ego functions: mental functions not dependent, at least in origin, on intrapsychic conflict. Such functions include: sensory perception, motor control, symbolic thought, logical thought, speech, abstraction, integration (synthesis), orientation, concentration, judgment about danger, reality testing, adaptive ability, executive decision-making, hygiene, and self-preservation. Freud noted that inhibition is one method that the mind may utilize to interfere with any of these functions in order to avoid painful emotions. Hartmann (1950s) pointed out that there may be delays or deficits in such functions. Frosch (1964) described differences in those people who demonstrated damage to their relationship to reality, but who seemed able to test it. According to ego psychology, ego strengths, later described by (1975), include the capacities to control oral, sexual, and destructive impulses; to tolerate painful affects without falling apart; and to prevent the eruption into consciousness of bizarre symbolic fantasy. Synthetic functions, in contrast to autonomous functions, arise from the development of the ego and serve the purpose of managing conflict processes. Defenses are synthetic functions that protect the conscious mind from awareness of forbidden impulses and thoughts. One purpose of ego psychology has been to emphasize that some mental functions can be considered to be basic, rather than derivatives of wishes, affects, or defenses. However, autonomous ego functions can be secondarily affected because of unconscious conflict. For example, a patient may have an hysterical amnesia (memory being an autonomous function) because of intrapsychic conflict (wishing not to remember because it is too painful). Taken together, the above theories present a group of assumptions. Therefore, the inclusive group of the different classical theories provides a cross-sectional view of human mentation. There are six ""points of view"", five described by Freud and a sixth added by Hartmann. Unconscious processes can therefore be evaluated from each of these six points of view: Genetic (i.e. propositions concerning origin and development of psychological functions) Adaptational (i.e. psychological phenomena as it relates to the external world) , a variation of , is a revised version of , most notably different by altering concepts related to where repressed thoughts were stored. Modern conflict theory addresses emotional symptoms and character traits as complex solutions to mental conflict. It dispenses with the concepts of a fixed , and instead posits conscious and unconscious conflict among wishes (dependent, controlling, sexual, and aggressive), guilt and shame, emotions (especially anxiety and depressive affect), and defensive operations that shut off from consciousness some aspect of the others. Moreover, healthy functioning (adaptive) is also determined, to a great extent, by resolutions of conflict. A major objective of modern conflict-theory psychoanalysis is to change the balance of conflict in a patient by making aspects of the less adaptive solutions (also called ""compromise formations"") conscious so that they can be rethought, and more adaptive solutions found. Current theoreticians who follow the work of , especially (1982), include Sandor Abend, , and Jerome Blackman. attempts to explain the ups and downs of human relationships through a study of how internal representations of the self and others are organized. The clinical symptoms that suggest object relations problems (typically developmental delays throughout life) include disturbances in an individual's capacity to feel: warmth, empathy, trust, sense of security, identity stability, consistent emotional closeness, and stability in relationships with significant others Concepts regarding internal representation (aka 'introspect,' 'self and object representation,' or 'internalization of self and other'), although often attributed to , were actually first mentioned by Sigmund Freud in his early concepts of drive theory (, 1905). Freud's 1917 paper "","" for example, hypothesized that unresolved grief was caused by the survivor's internalized image of the deceased becoming fused with that of the survivor, and then the survivor shifting unacceptable anger toward the deceased onto the now complex . , in ""Linking Objects and Linking Phenomena,"" expanded on Freud's thoughts on this, describing the syndromes of ""established pathological mourning"" vs. ""reactive depression"" based on similar dynamics. Melanie Klein's hypotheses regarding internalization during the first year of life, leading to paranoid and depressive positions, were later challenged by (e.g., , 1965), who divided the first year of life into a coenesthetic phase of the first six months, and then a diacritic phase for the second six months. , Fine, and Bergman (1975) describe distinct phases and subphases of child development leading to ""separation-individuation"" during the first three years of life, stressing the importance of constancy of parental figures in the face of the child's destructive aggression, internalizations, stability of affect management, and ability to develop healthy . John Frosch, , , and have developed the theory of self and object constancy as it affects adult psychiatric problems such as psychosis and borderline states. (1960) described how similar separation-individuation struggles occur during adolescence, of course with a different outcome from the first three years of life: the teen usually, eventually, leaves the parents' house (varying with culture). During adolescence, (1950–1960s) described the 'identity crisis,' that involves identity-diffusion anxiety. In order for an adult to be able to experience ""Warm-ETHICS: (warmth, Empathy, Trust, , Identity, Closeness, and Stability) in relationships, the teenager must resolve the problems with identity and redevelop self and object constancy. emphasizes the development of a stable and integrated through empathic contacts with other humans, primary significant others conceived of as '.' meet the developing self's needs for mirroring, idealization, and twinship, and thereby strengthen the developing self. The process of treatment proceeds through ""transmuting internalizations"" in which the patient gradually internalizes the selfobject functions provided by the therapist. Self psychology was proposed originally by , and has been further developed by , Frank Lachmann, and , Marian Tolpin, and others. , which integrates psychoanalysis with and philosophy, is especially popular in France and parts of Latin America. Lacanian psychoanalysis is a departure from the traditional British and American psychoanalysis. frequently used the phrase ""retourner à Freud"" (""return to Freud"") in his seminars and writings, as he claimed that his theories were an extension of Freud's own, contrary to those of Anna Freud, the Ego Psychology, and ""self"" theories and also claims the necessity of reading Freud's complete works, not only a part of them. Lacan's concepts concern the """", , , and , and the claim that ""the unconscious is structured as a language."" Though a major influence on psychoanalysis in France and parts of Latin America, Lacan and his ideas have taken longer to be translated into English and he has thus had a lesser impact on psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in the English-speaking world. In the United Kingdom and the United States, his ideas are most widely used to analyze texts in . Due to his increasingly critical stance towards the deviation from Freud's thought, often singling out particular texts and readings from his colleagues, Lacan was excluded from acting as a training analyst in the IPA, thus leading him to create his own school in order to maintain an for the many candidates who desired to continue their analysis with him. The of psychotherapy develops out of the work of . The interprets psychic conflict primarily in terms of conscious and unconscious adaptation to reality. Langs’ recent work in some measure returns to the earlier Freud, in that Langs prefers a modified version of the of the mind (conscious, preconscious, and unconscious) over the (id, ego, and super-ego), including the former's emphasis on trauma (though Langs looks to death-related traumas rather than sexual traumas). At the same time, Langs’ model of the mind differs from Freud's in that it understands the mind in terms of evolutionary biological principles. combines interpersonal psychoanalysis with object-relations theory and with inter-subjective theory as critical for mental health. It was introduced by . Relational psychoanalysis stresses how the individual's personality is shaped by both real and imagined relationships with others, and how these relationship patterns are re-enacted in the interactions between analyst and patient. In New York, key proponents of relational psychoanalysis include , , and Adrienne Harris. and Target, in London, have propounded their view of the necessity of helping certain detached, isolated patients, develop the capacity for ""mentalization"" associated with thinking about relationships and themselves. Arietta Slade, , and in New York have additionally contributed to the application of relational psychoanalysis to treatment of the adult patient-as-parent, the clinical study of mentalization in parent-infant relationships, and the intergenerational transmission of attachment and trauma. The term is often used as a professional identification. Psychoanalysts under this broader umbrella debate about what precisely are the differences between the two schools, without any current clear consensus. This section . Please help by .

In depressions with psychotic features, the self-preservation function may also be damaged (sometimes by overwhelming depressive affect). Because of the integrative deficits (often causing what general psychiatrists call ""loose associations,"" ""blocking,"" "","" ""verbigeration,"" and ""thought withdrawal""), the development of self and object representations is also impaired. Clinically, therefore, psychotic individuals manifest limitations in warmth, empathy, trust, identity, closeness and/or stability in relationships (due to problems with self-object fusion anxiety) as well. In patients whose autonomous ego functions are more intact, but who still show problems with object relations, the diagnosis often falls into the category known as ""borderline"". Borderline patients also show deficits, often in controlling impulses, affects, or fantasies – but their ability to test reality remains more or less intact. Adults who do not experience guilt and shame, and who indulge in criminal behavior, are usually diagnosed as psychopaths, or, using , . —including panic, phobias, conversions, obsessions, compulsions and depressions—are not usually caused by deficits in functions. Instead, they are caused by intrapsychic conflicts. The conflicts are generally among sexual and hostile-aggressive wishes, guilt and shame, and reality factors. The conflicts may be conscious or unconscious, but create anxiety, depressive affect, and anger. Finally, the various elements are managed by defensive operations—essentially shut-off brain mechanisms that make people unaware of that element of conflict. is the term given to the mechanism that shuts thoughts out of consciousness. is the term used for the mechanism that shuts sensations out of consciousness. Neurotic symptoms may occur with or without deficits in ego functions, object relations, and ego strengths. Therefore, it is not uncommon to encounter obsessive-compulsive schizophrenics, panic patients who also suffer with , etc. This section above is partial to ego psychoanalytic theory . Freudian theories hold that problems can be traced to unresolved conflicts from certain phases of childhood and , caused by fantasy, stemming from their own drives. Freud, based on the data gathered from his patients early in his career, suspected that neurotic disturbances occurred when children were sexually abused in childhood (i.e. ). Later, Freud came to believe that, although child abuse occurs, neurotic symptoms were not associated with this. He believed that neurotic people often had unconscious conflicts that involved incestuous fantasies deriving from different stages of development. He found the stage from about three to six years of age (preschool years, today called the ""first genital stage"") to be filled with fantasies of having romantic relationships with both parents. Arguments were quickly generated in early 20th-century Vienna about whether adult seduction of children, i.e. , was the basis of neurotic illness. There still is no complete agreement, although nowadays professionals recognize the negative effects of child sexual abuse on mental health. Many psychoanalysts who work with children have studied the actual effects of child abuse, which include ego and object relations deficits and severe neurotic conflicts. Much research has been done on these types of trauma in childhood, and the adult sequelae of those. In studying the childhood factors that start neurotic symptom development, Freud found a constellation of factors that, for literary reasons, he termed the , based on the play by , , in which the protagonist unwittingly kills his father and marries his mother. The validity of the is now widely disputed and rejected. The shorthand term, —later explicated by in ""On the Concept Superego"" (1960) and modified by in (1982)—refers to the powerful attachments that children make to their parents in the preschool years. These attachments involve fantasies of sexual relationships with either (or both) parent, and, therefore, competitive fantasies toward either (or both) parents. Humberto Nagera (1975) has been particularly helpful in clarifying many of the complexities of the child through these years. ""Positive"" and ""negative"" oedipal conflicts have been attached to the heterosexual and homosexual aspects, respectively. Both seem to occur in development of most children. Eventually, the developing child's concessions to reality (that they will neither marry one parent nor eliminate the other) lead to identifications with parental values. These identifications generally create a new set of mental operations regarding values and guilt, subsumed under the term . Besides superego development, children ""resolve"" their preschool oedipal conflicts through channeling wishes into something their parents approve of (""sublimation"") and the development, during the school-age years (""latency"") of age-appropriate defensive maneuvers (rules, repetitive games).

To be treated with psychoanalysis, whatever the presenting problem, the person requesting help must demonstrate a desire to start an analysis. The person wishing to start an analysis must have some capacity for speech and communication. As well, they need to be able to have or develop trust and insight within the psychoanalytic session. Potential patients must undergo a preliminary stage of treatment to assess their amenability to psychoanalysis at that time, and also to enable the analyst to form a working psychological model, which the analyst will use to direct the treatment. Psychoanalysts mainly work with neurosis and hysteria in particular; however, adapted forms of psychoanalysis are used in working with schizophrenia and other forms of psychosis or mental disorder. Finally, if a prospective patient is severely suicidal a longer preliminary stage may be employed, sometimes with sessions which have a twenty-minute break in the middle. There are numerous modifications in technique under the heading of psychoanalysis due to the individualistic nature of personality in both analyst and patient. The most common problems treatable with psychoanalysis include: , , , , , , , a wide variety of relationship problems (such as dating and marital strife), and a wide variety of character problems (for example, painful shyness, meanness, obnoxiousness, workaholism, hyperseductiveness, hyperemotionality, hyperfastidiousness). The fact that many of such patients also demonstrate deficits above makes diagnosis and treatment selection difficult. Analytical organizations such as the IPA, APsaA and the European Federation for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy have established procedures and models for the indication and practice of psychoanalytical therapy for trainees in analysis. The match between the analyst and the patient can be viewed as another contributing factor for the indication and contraindication for psychoanalytic treatment. The analyst decides whether the patient is suitable for psychoanalysis. This decision made by the analyst, besides made on the usual indications and pathology, is also based to a certain degree by the ""fit"" between analyst and patient. A person's suitability for analysis at any particular time is based on their desire to know something about where their illness has come from. Someone who is not suitable for analysis expresses no desire to know more about the root causes of their illness. An evaluation may include one or more other analysts' independent opinions and will include discussion of the patient's financial situation and insurances. The basic method of psychoanalysis is interpretation of the patient's unconscious conflicts that are interfering with current-day functioning – conflicts that are causing painful symptoms such as phobias, anxiety, depression, and compulsions. (1936) stressed that figuring out ways the patient distorted perceptions about the analyst led to understanding what may have been forgotten. In particular, unconscious hostile feelings toward the analyst could be found in symbolic, negative reactions to what later called the ""frame"" of the therapy—the setup that included times of the sessions, payment of fees, and necessity of talking. In patients who made mistakes, forgot, or showed other peculiarities regarding time, fees, and talking, the analyst can usually find various unconscious ""resistances"" to the flow of thoughts (aka ). When the patient reclines on a couch with the analyst out of view, the patient tends to remember more experiences, more resistance and transference, and is able to reorganize thoughts after the development of insight – through the interpretive work of the analyst. Although fantasy life can be understood through the examination of , masturbation fantasies are also important. The analyst is interested in how the patient reacts to and avoids such fantasies. Various memories of early life are generally distorted—what Freud called —and in any case, very early experiences (before age two)—cannot be remembered. There is what is known among psychoanalysts as , although Freud throughout his writings deviated from this considerably, depending on the problems of any given patient. was summarized by Allan Compton as comprising: instructions: telling the patient to try to say what's on their mind, including interferences; clarification: rephrasing and summarizing what the patient has been describing. As well, the analyst can also use confrontation to bringing an aspect of functioning, usually a defense, to the patient's attention. The analyst then uses a variety of interpretation methods, such as: Dynamic interpretation: explaining how being too nice guards against guilt (e.g. defense vs. affect); Genetic interpretation: explaining how a past event is influencing the present; Resistance interpretation: showing the patient how they are avoiding their problems; interpretation: showing the patient ways old conflicts arise in current relationships, including that with the analyst; or Dream interpretation: obtaining the patient's thoughts about their dreams and connecting this with their current problems. Analysts can also use reconstruction to estimate what may have happened in the past that created some current issue. These techniques are primarily based on (see above). As evolved, supplemented by the work of and , techniques with patients who had more severe problems with basic trust (, 1950) and a history of (see the works of Augusta Alpert) led to new techniques with adults. These have sometimes been called interpersonal, intersubjective (cf. ), relational, or corrective object relations techniques. These techniques include expressing an empathic attunement to the patient or warmth; exposing a bit of the analyst's personal life or attitudes to the patient; allowing the patient autonomy in the form of disagreement with the analyst (cf. I. H. Paul, ); and explaining the motivations of others which the patient misperceives. Ego psychological concepts of deficit in functioning led to refinements in supportive therapy. These techniques are particularly applicable to psychotic and near-psychotic (cf., Eric Marcus, ""Psychosis and Near-psychosis"") patients. These supportive therapy techniques include discussions of reality; encouragement to stay alive (including hospitalization); psychotropic medicines to relieve overwhelming depressive affect or overwhelming fantasies (hallucinations and delusions); and advice about the meanings of things (to counter abstraction failures). The notion of the ""silent analyst"" has been criticized. Actually, the analyst listens using Arlow's approach as set out in ""The Genesis of Interpretation"", using active intervention to interpret resistances, defenses creating pathology, and fantasies. Silence is not a technique of psychoanalysis (see also the studies and opinion papers of Owen Renik). """" is a concept that does not mean the analyst is silent. It refers to the analyst's position of not taking sides in the internal struggles of the patient. For example, if a patient feels guilty, the analyst might explore what the patient has been doing or thinking that causes the guilt, but not reassure the patient not to feel guilty. The analyst might also explore the identifications with parents and others that led to the guilt. Interpersonal–relational psychoanalysts emphasize the notion that it is impossible to be neutral. introduced the term to indicate the analyst inevitably interacts with the analysand, and suggested the detailed inquiry as an alternative to interpretation. The detailed inquiry involves noting where the analysand is leaving out important elements of an account and noting when the story is obfuscated, and asking careful questions to open up the dialogue. Although single-client sessions remain the norm, psychoanalytic theory has been used to develop other types of psychological treatment. Psychoanalytic group therapy was pioneered by , Joseph Pratt, , , , and Wolfe. Child-centered counseling for parents was instituted early in analytic history by Freud, and was later further developed by , Edith Schulhofer, and Gilbert Kliman. Psychoanalytically based couples therapy has been promulgated and explicated by Fred Sander. Techniques and tools developed in the first decade of the 21st century have made psychoanalysis available to patients who were not treatable by earlier techniques. This meant that the analytic situation was modified so that it would be more suitable and more likely to be helpful for these patients. Eagle (2007) believes that psychoanalysis cannot be a self-contained discipline but instead must be open to influence from and integration with findings and theory from other disciplines. Psychoanalytic constructs have been adapted for use with children with treatments such as , , and . Throughout her career, from the 1920s through the 1970s, adapted psychoanalysis for children through play. This is still used today for children, especially those who are preadolescent. Using toys and games, children are able to symbolically demonstrate their fears, fantasies, and defenses; although not identical, this technique, in children, is analogous to the aim of free association in adults. Psychoanalytic play therapy allows the child and analyst to understand children's conflicts, particularly defenses such as disobedience and withdrawal, that have been guarding against various unpleasant feelings and hostile wishes. In art therapy, the counselor may have a child draw a portrait and then tell a story about the portrait. The counselor watches for recurring themes—regardless of whether it is with art or toys. Psychoanalysis can be adapted to different , as long as the therapist or counselor understands the client's culture. For example, Tori and Blimes found that defense mechanisms were valid in a normative sample of 2,624 . The use of certain defense mechanisms was related to cultural values. For example, Thais value calmness and collectiveness (because of beliefs), so they were low on . Psychoanalysis also applies because Freud used techniques that allowed him to get the subjective perceptions of his patients. He takes an objective approach by not facing his clients during his talk therapy sessions. He met with his patients wherever they were, such as when he used free association—where clients would say whatever came to mind without self-censorship. His treatments had little to no structure for most cultures, especially Asian cultures. Therefore, it is more likely that Freudian constructs will be used in structured therapy. In addition, Corey postulates that it will be necessary for a therapist to help clients develop a as well as an ego identity. This section . Relevant discussion may be found on the .

Low-fee analysis is often available in a psychoanalytic training clinic and graduate schools. Otherwise, the fee set by each analyst varies with the analyst's training and experience. Since, in most locations in the United States, unlike in Ontario and Germany, classical analysis (which usually requires sessions three to five times per week) is not covered by health insurance, many analysts may negotiate their fees with patients whom they feel they can help, but who have financial difficulties. The modifications of analysis, which include psychodynamic therapy, brief therapies, and certain types of group therapy, are carried out on a less frequent basis – usually once, twice, or three times a week – and usually the patient sits facing the therapist. As a result of the and the lack of access to the unfathomable elements of the unconscious, psychoanalysis can be an expansive process that involves 2 to 5 sessions per week for several years. This type of therapy relies on the belief that reducing the symptoms will not actually help with the root causes or irrational drives. The analyst typically is a 'blank screen', disclosing very little about themselves in order that the client can use the space in the relationship to work on their unconscious without interference from outside. The psychoanalyst uses various methods to help the patient to become more self-aware and to develop insights into their behavior and into the meanings of symptoms. First and foremost, the psychoanalyst attempts to develop a confidential atmosphere in which the patient can feel safe reporting his feelings, thoughts and fantasies. Analysands (as people in analysis are called) are asked to report whatever comes to mind without fear of reprisal. Freud called this the ""fundamental rule"". Analysands are asked to talk about their lives, including their early life, current life and hopes and aspirations for the future. They are encouraged to report their fantasies, ""flash thoughts"" and dreams. In fact, Freud believed that dreams were, ""the royal road to the unconscious""; he devoted an entire volume to the interpretation of dreams. Freud had his patients lay on a couch in a dimly lit room and would sit out of sight, usually directly behind them, as to not influence the patients thoughts by his gestures or expressions. The psychoanalyst's task, in collaboration with the analysand, is to help deepen the analysand's understanding of those factors, outside of his awareness, that drive his behaviors. In the safe environment of the psychoanalytic setting, the analysand becomes attached to the analyst and pretty soon he begins to experience the same conflicts with his analyst that he experiences with key figures in his life such as his parents, his boss, his significant other, etc. It is the psychoanalyst's role to point out these conflicts and to interpret them. The transferring of these internal conflicts onto the analyst is called ""transference"". Many studies have also been done on briefer ""dynamic"" treatments; these are more expedient to measure, and shed light on the therapeutic process to some extent. Brief Relational Therapy (BRT), Brief Psychodynamic Therapy (BPT), and Time-Limited Dynamic Therapy (TLDP) limit treatment to 20–30 sessions. On average, classical analysis may last 5.7 years, but for phobias and depressions uncomplicated by ego deficits or object relations deficits, analysis may run for a shorter period of time. Longer analyses are indicated for those with more serious disturbances in object relations, more symptoms, and more ingrained character pathology. Psychoanalysis continues to be practiced by psychiatrists, social workers, and other mental health professionals; however, its practice has declined. In 2015, psychoanalyst Bradley Peterson, who is also a child psychiatrist and director of the Institute for the Developing Mind at , said: ""I think most people would agree that psychoanalysis as a form of treatment is on its last legs."" However psychoanalytic approaches continue to be listed by the UK as possibly helpful for depression. This section . Please help by . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.

Typically, this psychoanalysis must be conducted by a Supervising and Training Analyst. Most institutes (but not all) within the American Psychoanalytic Association, require that Supervising and Training Analysts become certified by the American Board of Psychoanalysts. Certification entails a blind review in which the psychoanalyst's work is vetted by psychoanalysts outside of their local community. After earning certification, these psychoanalysts undergo another hurdle in which they are specially vetted by senior members of their own institute. Supervising and Training analysts are held to the highest clinical and ethical standards. Moreover, they are required to have extensive experience conducting psychoanalyses. Similarly, class instruction for psychoanalytic candidates is rigorous. Typically classes meet several hours a week, or for a full day or two every other weekend during the academic year; this varies with the institute. Candidates generally have an hour of supervision each week, with a Supervising and Training Analyst, on each psychoanalytic case. The minimum number of cases varies between institutes, often two to four cases. Male and female cases are required. Supervision must go on for at least a few years on one or more cases. Supervision is done in the supervisor's office, where the trainee presents material from the psychoanalytic work that week. In supervision, the patient's unconscious conflicts are explored, also, transference-countertransference constellations are examined. Also, clinical technique is taught. Many psychoanalytic training centers in the United States have been accredited by special committees of the APsaA or the IPA. Because of theoretical differences, there are independent institutes, usually founded by psychologists, who until 1987 were not permitted access to psychoanalytic training institutes of the APsaA. Currently there are between 75 and 100 independent institutes in the United States. As well, other institutes are affiliated to other organizations such as the American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry, and the National Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis. At most psychoanalytic institutes in the United States, qualifications for entry include a terminal degree in a mental health field, such as Ph.D., Psy.D., M.S.W., or M.D. A few institutes restrict applicants to those already holding an M.D. or Ph.D., and most institutes in Southern California confer a Ph.D. or in psychoanalysis upon graduation, which involves completion of the necessary requirements for the state boards that confer that doctoral degree. The first training institute in America to educate non-medical psychoanalysts was The National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis (1978) in New York City. It was founded by the analyst Theodor Reik. The Contemporary Freudian (originally the New York Freudian Society) an offshoot of the National Psychological Association has a branch in Washington, DC. It is a component society/institute or the IPA. Some psychoanalytic training has been set up as a post-doctoral fellowship in university settings, such as at Duke University, Yale University, New York University, Adelphi University and Columbia University. Other psychoanalytic institutes may not be directly associated with universities, but the faculty at those institutes usually hold contemporaneous faculty positions with psychology Ph.D. programs and/or with medical school psychiatry residency programs. The IPA is the world's primary accrediting and regulatory body for psychoanalysis. Their mission is to assure the continued vigor and development of psychoanalysis for the benefit of psychoanalytic patients. It works in partnership with its 70 constituent organizations in 33 countries to support 11,500 members. In the US, there are 77 psychoanalytical organizations, institutes associations in the United States, which are spread across the states of America. APSaA has 38 affiliated societies which have 10 or more active members who practice in a given geographical area. The aims of APSaA and other psychoanalytical organizations are: provide ongoing educational opportunities for its members, stimulate the development and research of psychoanalysis, provide training and organize conferences. There are eight affiliated study groups in the United States. A study group is the first level of integration of a psychoanalytical body within the IPA, followed by a provisional society and finally a member society. The Division of Psychoanalysis (39) of the (APA) was established in the early 1980s by several psychologists. Until the establishment of the Division of Psychoanalysis, psychologists who had trained in independent institutes had no national organization. The Division of Psychoanalysis now has approximately 4,000 members and approximately 30 local chapters in the United States. The Division of Psychoanalysis holds two annual meetings or conferences and offers continuing education in theory, research and clinical technique, as do their affiliated local chapters. The European Psychoanalytical Federation (EPF) is the organization which consolidates all European psychoanalytic societies. This organization is affiliated with the IPA. In 2002 there were approximately 3,900 individual members in 22 countries, speaking 18 different languages. There are also 25 psychoanalytic societies. The American Association of Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work (AAPCSW) was established by Crayton Rowe in 1980 as a division of the Federation of Clinical Societies of Social Work and became an independent entity in 1990. Until 2007 it was known as the National Membership Committee on Psychoanalysis. The organization was founded because although social workers represented the larger number of people who were training to be psychoanalysts, they were underrepresented as supervisors and teachers at the institutes they attended. AAPCSW now has over 1000 members and has over 20 chapters. It holds a bi-annual national conference and numerous annual local conferences.

Psychoanalysis modified by object relations techniques has been shown to be effective in many cases of ingrained problems of intimacy and relationship (cf. the many books of Otto Kernberg). Psychoanalytic treatment, in other situations, may run from about a year to many years, depending on the severity and complexity of the pathology. Psychoanalytic theory has, from its inception, been the subject of criticism and controversy. Freud remarked on this early in his career, when other physicians in Vienna ostracized him for his findings that hysterical conversion symptoms were not limited to women. Challenges to analytic theory began with and (turn of the 20th century), continued with behaviorists (e.g. ) into the 1940s and '50s, and have persisted (e.g. ). Criticisms come from those who object to the notion that there are mechanisms, thoughts or feelings in the mind that could be unconscious. Criticisms also have been leveled against the idea of ""infantile sexuality"" (the recognition that children between ages two and six imagine things about procreation). Criticisms of theory have led to variations in analytic theories, such as the work of , , and . In the past 30 years or so, the criticisms have centered on the issue of empirical verification. Psychoanalysis has been used as a research tool into childhood development (cf. the journal ), and has developed into a flexible, effective treatment for certain mental disturbances. In the 1960s, Freud's early (1905) thoughts on the childhood development of were challenged; this challenge led to major research in the 1970s and 80s, and then to a reformulation of female sexual development that corrected some of Freud's concepts. Also see the various works of Eleanor Galenson, , , , , , and others. Most recently, psychoanalytic researchers who have integrated attachment theory into their work, including Alicia Lieberman, , and have explored the role of parental traumatization in the development of young children's mental representations of self and others. The psychoanalytic profession has been resistant to researching efficacy. Evaluations of effectiveness based on the interpretation of the therapist alone cannot be proven. in 2012 and 2013 found support or evidence for the efficacy of psychoanalytic therapy, thus further research is needed. Other meta-analyses published in the recent years showed psychoanalysis and to be effective, with outcomes comparable or greater than other kinds of or , but these arguments have also been subjected to various criticisms. In particular, the inclusion of pre/post studies rather than randomized controlled trials, and the absence of adequate comparisons with control treatments is a serious limitation in interpreting the results. In 2011, the made 103 comparisons between psychodynamic treatment and a non-dynamic competitor and found that 6 were superior, 5 were inferior, 28 had no difference and 63 were adequate. The study found that this could be used as a basis ""to make psychodynamic psychotherapy an 'empirically validated' treatment."" Meta-analyses of Short Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (STPP) have found () ranging from .34 to .71 compared to no treatment and was found to be slightly better than other therapies in follow up. Other reviews have found an effect size of .78 to .91 for compared to no treatment and .69 for treating depression. A 2012 meta-analysis of Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP) found effect sizes ranging from .84 for interpersonal problems to 1.51 for depression. Overall ISTDP had an effect size of 1.18 compared to no treatment. A meta-analysis of Long Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy in 2012 found an overall effect size of .33, which is modest. This study concluded the recovery rate following LTPP was equal to control treatments, including treatment as usual, and found the evidence for the effectiveness of LTPP to be limited and at best conflicting. Others have found effect sizes of .44–.68. According to a 2004 French review conducted by , psychoanalysis was presumed or proven effective at treating , , and , but did not find evidence of its effectiveness in treating , , , , and . A 2001 systematic review of the medical literature by the concluded that no data exist demonstrating that psychodynamic psychotherapy is effective in treating schizophrenia and severe mental illness, and cautioned that medication should always be used alongside any type of in schizophrenia cases. A French review from 2004 found the same. The Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team advises against the use of in cases of schizophrenia, arguing that more trials are necessary to verify its effectiveness. The strongest reason for considering Freud a pseudo-scientist is that he claimed to have tested – and thus to have provided the most cogent grounds for accepting – theories which are either untestable or even if testable had not been tested. It is spurious claims to have tested an untestable or untested theory which are the most pertinent grounds for deeming Freud and his followers pseudoscientists... Both Freud and psychoanalysis have been criticized in extreme terms. Exchanges between critics and defenders of psychoanalysis have often been so heated that they have come to be characterized as the . Early critics of psychoanalysis believed that its theories were based too little on quantitative and , and too much on the clinical case study method. Some have accused Freud of fabrication, most famously in the case of . Philosopher cites false claims of a sound scientific verification of the theory and its elements as the strongest basis for classifying the work of Freud and his school as pseudoscience. Others have speculated that patients suffered from now easily identifiable conditions unrelated to psychoanalysis; for instance, Anna O. is thought to have suffered from an organic impairment such as or and not hysteria (see ). argued that psychoanalysis is a because its claims are not testable and cannot be refuted; that is, they are not : ....those ""clinical observations"" which analysts naively believe confirm their theory cannot do this any more than the daily confirmations which astrologers find in their practice. And as for Freud's epic of the Ego, the Super-ego, and the Id, no substantially stronger claim to scientific status can be made for it than for Homer's collected stories from the Olympus. In addition, wrote that ""Freudians have been nonplussed by Popper's basic challenge concerning scientific honesty. Indeed, they have refused to specify experimental conditions under which they would give up their basic assumptions."" In (1986), philosopher rejects Popper's arguments pointing to the theory of repression as an example of a Freudian theory that does have testable consequences. Scruton nevertheless concluded that psychoanalysis is not genuinely scientific, on the grounds that it involves an unacceptable dependence on metaphor. The philosopher and physicist argued that psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience because it violates the and inherent to science. According to Bunge, most psychoanalytic theories are either untestable or unsupported by evidence. , in particular, have also weighed in. , a prominent academic in wrote that: Thirty years ago, the cognitive revolution in psychology overthrew both Freud and the behaviorists, at least in academia.… [T]hinking…is not just a [result] of emotion or behavior.… [E]motion is always generated by cognition, not the other way around. Linguist has criticized psychoanalysis for lacking a scientific basis. considers Freudian theory unscientific for understanding the mind. Evolutionary biologist considered psychoanalysis influenced by pseudoscientific theories such as . Psychologists (1985) and (2012/2000) have also criticized the field as pseudoscience. argues in Validation in the Clinical Theory of Psychoanalysis (1993) that psychoanalytic based theories are falsifiable, but that the causal claims of psychoanalysis are unsupported by the available clinical evidence. wrote off psychoanalysts as mere ""witch doctors:"" If you look at all of the complicated ideas that they have developed in an infinitesimal amount of time, if you compare to any other of the sciences how long it takes to get one idea after the other, if you consider all the structures and inventions and complicated things, the ids and the egos, the tensions and the forces, and the pushes and the pulls, I tell you they can't all be there. It's too much for one brain or a few brains to have cooked up in such a short time. Likewise, psychiatrist , in (1986), agreed that psychoanalytic theories have no more scientific basis than the theories of traditional native healers, ""witchdoctors"" or modern ""cult"" alternatives such as . Psychologist charged psychoanalysis with being similar to the , which she described in her book . She scrutinized and rejected the validity of Freud's , including the Oedipus complex, which, according to her and , blames the child for the abusive sexual behavior of adults. Psychologist Joel Kupfersmid investigated the validity of the Oedipus complex, examining its nature and origins. He concluded that there is little evidence to support the existence of the Oedipus complex. and claimed that the institution of psychoanalysis has become a center of power and that its techniques resemble the . criticized the emphasis of some American and British psychoanalytical traditions on what he has viewed as the suggestion of imaginary ""causes"" for symptoms, and recommended the return to Freud. Together with Deleuze, criticised the Oedipal structure. criticised psychoanalysis, employing 's concept of to describe the exclusion of the woman from Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalytical theories. Deleuze and Guattari (1972), in , take the cases of , and , prominent members of the most respected associations (), to suggest that, traditionally, psychoanalysis enthusiastically embraces a . The theoretical foundations of psychoanalysis lie in the same philosophical currents that lead to interpretive rather than in those that lead to , making the theory largely incompatible with positivist approaches to the study of the mind. Although numerous studies have shown that the efficacy of therapy is primarily related to the quality of the therapist, rather than the school or technique or training, a French 2004 report from concluded that psychoanalytic therapy is less effective than other psychotherapies (including ) for certain diseases. This report used a of numerous other studies to find whether the treatment was ""proven"" or ""presumed"" to be effective on different diseases. Many aspects of Freudian theory are indeed out of date, and they should be: Freud died in 1939, and he has been slow to undertake further revisions. His critics, however, are equally behind the times, attacking Freudian views of the 1920s as if they continue to have some currency in their original form. Psychodynamic theory and therapy have evolved considerably since 1939 when Freud's bearded countenance was last sighted in earnest. Contemporary psychoanalysts and psychodynamic therapists no longer write much about ids and egos, nor do they conceive of treatment for psychological disorders as an archaeological expedition in search of lost memories. A survey of scientific research suggested that while personality traits corresponding to Freud's oral, anal, Oedipal, and genital phases can be observed, they do not necessarily manifest as stages in the development of children. These studies also have not confirmed that such traits in adults result from childhood experiences. However, these stages should not be viewed as crucial to modern psychoanalysis. What is crucial to modern psychoanalytic theory and practice is the power of the unconscious and the transference phenomenon. The idea of ""unconscious"" is contested because human behavior can be observed while human mental activity has to be inferred. However, the unconscious is now a popular topic of study in the fields of experimental and social psychology (e.g., implicit attitude measures, , and , and other indirect tests). The idea of unconscious, and the transference phenomenon, have been widely researched and, it is claimed, validated in the fields of and social psychology, though a Freudian interpretation of unconscious mental activity is not held by the majority of cognitive psychologists. Recent developments in neuroscience have resulted in one side arguing that it has provided a biological basis for unconscious emotional processing in line with psychoanalytic theory i.e., , while the other side argues that such findings make psychoanalytic theory obsolete and irrelevant. explains that the that flourished in the 19th century severely harmed religion and rejected whatever called spiritual. The institution of the priest in particular was badly damaged. The empty void that this institution left behind was swiftly occupied by the newborn psychoanalysis. In his writings, Kalo claims that psychoanalysis basic approach is erroneous. It represents the mainline wrong assumptions that happiness is unreachable and that the natural desire of a human being is to exploit his fellow men for his own pleasure and benefit. incorporated aspects of psychoanalytic theory into his theory of in order to question what he called the ''. Derrida also turns some of these ideas against Freud, to reveal tensions and contradictions in his work. For example, although Freud defines religion and metaphysics as displacements of the identification with the father in the resolution of the Oedipal complex, Derrida () insists that the prominence of the father in Freud's own analysis is itself indebted to the prominence given to the father in Western metaphysics and theology since . ""What is psychoanalysis? Of course, one is supposed to answer that it is many things — a theory, a research method, a therapy, a body of knowledge. In what might be considered an unfortunately abbreviated description, Freud said that anyone who recognizes transference and resistance is a psychoanalyst, even if he comes to conclusions other than his own.… I prefer to think of the analytic situation more broadly, as one in which someone seeking help tries to speak as freely as he can to someone who listens as carefully as he can with the aim of articulating what is going on between them and why.

() is a form of developed by starting in 1988 in which the person being treated is asked to recall distressing images; the therapist then directs the patient in one type of bilateral stimulation, such as side-to-side eye movements or hand tapping. According to the 2013 World Health Organization practice guideline: ""This therapy [EMDR] is based on the idea that negative thoughts, feelings and behaviours are the result of unprocessed memories. The treatment involves standardized procedures that include focusing simultaneously on (a) spontaneous associations of traumatic images, thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations and (b) bilateral stimulation that is most commonly in the form of repeated eye movements."" EMDR is included in several evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of (PTSD) - with varying levels of recommendation and evidence (very low to moderate per WHO stress guidelines). As of 2020, the lists EMDR as an evidence-based treatment for but stresses that ""the available evidence can be interpreted in several ways"" and notes there is debate about the precise mechanism by which EMDR appears to relieve PTSD symptoms with some evidence EMDR may simply be a variety of . Questions about eye movement and bilateral stimulation EMDR therapy was first developed by Francine Shapiro upon noticing that certain eye movements reduced the intensity of a disturbing thought. She then conducted a scientific study with trauma victims in 1988 and the research was published in the in 1989. Her hypothesis was that when a traumatic or distressing experience occurs, it may overwhelm normal , with the memory and associated stimuli being inadequately processed and stored in an isolated memory network. Shapiro noted that, when she was experiencing a disturbing thought, her eyes were involuntarily moving rapidly. She further noted that her anxiety was reduced when she brought her eye movements under voluntary control while thinking a traumatic thought. Shapiro developed EMDR therapy for (PTSD). She speculated that traumatic events ""upset the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain, causing a pathological change in the neural elements"". Shapiro over time developed an eight-stage process for EMDR, with various additions being made to the core EMDR practice itself. EMDR is typically undertaken in a series of sessions with a trained therapist. The number of sessions can vary depending on the progress made. A typical EMDR therapy session lasts from 60-90 minutes. However self-administration also occurs. The person being treated is asked to recall distressing images while generating one of several types of bilateral stimulation|bilateral sensory input, such as side-to-side movements or hand tapping. The 2013 World Health Organization practice guideline says that ""Like (CBT) with a trauma focus, EMDR aims to reduce subjective distress and strengthen adaptive beliefs related to the traumatic event. Unlike CBT with a trauma focus, EMDR does not involve (a) detailed descriptions of the event, (b) direct challenging of beliefs, (c) extended exposure, or (d) homework."" While multiple meta-analyses have found EMDR to be as effective as for the treatment of PTSD, these findings have been regarded as tentative given the low numbers in the studies, high risk rates of , and high dropout rates. A 1998 meta-analysis found that EMDR was as effective as and . A 2002 meta-analysis concluded that EMDR is not as effective, or as long lasting, as traditional . A 2005 and a 2006 meta-analysis each suggested that traditional exposure therapy and EMDR have equivalent effects immediately after treatment and at follow-up. Two meta-analyses in 2006 found EMDR to be at least equivalent in effect size to specific exposure therapies. A 2009 review of rape treatment outcomes concluded that EMDR had some efficacy. Another 2009 review concluded EMDR to be of similar efficacy to other exposure therapies and more effective than SSRIs, problem-centered therapy, or ""treatment as usual"". A 2010 meta-analysis concluded that all """" treatments were equally effective, but there was some debate regarding the study's selection of which treatments were """". A Cochrane systematic review comparing EMDR with other psychotherapies in the treatment of Chronic PTSD, found EMDR to be just as effective as Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TFCBT) and more effective than the other non-TFCBT psychotherapies. Caution was urged interpreting the results due to low numbers in included studies, risk of , high drop out rates, and overall ""very low"" quality of evidence for the comparisons with other psychotherapies. A 2013 systematic review examined 15 clinical trials of EMDR with and without the eye movements, finding that the effect size was larger when eye movements were used. Again, interpretation of this meta-analysis was tentative. Lee and Cuijpers (2013) stated that ""the quality of included studies was not optimal. This may have distorted the outcomes of the studies and our meta-analysis. Apart from ensuring adequate checks on treatment quality, there were other serious methodological problems with the studies in the therapy context."" A meta-analysis in 2020, could not confirm the results of this 2013 study, due to ""differences in inclusion criteria."" A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis was the ""first systematic review of randomized trials examining the effects of EMDR for any mental health problem."" The authors raised concerns about bias in previous studies, concluding: Despite these limitations, the results of this meta-analysis aid us in concluding that EMDR may be effective in the treatment of PTSD in the short term and possibly have comparable effects as other treatments. However, the quality of studies is too low to draw definite conclusions. Further, it is evident that the long-term effects of EMDR are unclear and that there is certainly not enough evidence to advise its use in patients with mental health problems other than PTSD. The 2009 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies practice guidelines categorized EMDR as an evidence-based level A treatment for PTSD in adults. Other guidelines recommending EMDR therapy – as well as CBT and exposure therapy – for treating trauma have included starting in 2005, Australian Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health in 2007, the Dutch National Steering Committee Guidelines Mental Health and Care in 2003, the in 2004, the in 2010, in 2011, the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies in 2009, and the in 2013 (only for PTSD, not for acute stress treatment). The American Psychological Association ""conditionally recommends"" EMDR for the treatment of PTSD. EMDR is included in a 2009 practice guideline for helping children who have experienced trauma. EMDR is often cited as a component in the treatment of . A 2017 meta-analysis of in children and adolescents with PTSD found that EMDR was at least as efficacious as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and superior to or placebo. Several small studies have indicated EMDR efficacy for other mental health conditions, but more research is needed. Studies have indicated EMDR effectiveness in depression. A 2019 review found that ""Although the selected studies are few and with different methodological critical issues, the findings reported by the different authors suggest in a preliminary way that EMDR can be a useful treatment for depression."" Small studies have found EMDR to be effective with , , other anxiety disorders, and distress due to body image issues. EMDR may have application for when co-morbid with trauma, Other studies have investigated EMDR therapy’s efficacy with , and somatic disorders such as . EMDR has also been found to improve stress management symptoms. EMDR has been found to reduce suicide ideation, and help low self-esteem. Other studies focus on effectiveness in substance craving and pain management. EMDR may help people with who suffer from exposure to distressing events. A 2013 overall literature review covered research up to that time. A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis was the ""first systematic review of randomized trials examining the effects of EMDR for any mental health problem."" The authors concluded: ""it is evident that the long-term effects of EMDR are unclear, and... there is certainly not enough evidence to advise its use in patients with mental health problems other than PTSD."" The proposed mechanisms that underlie eye movements in EMDR therapy are still under investigation and there is as yet no definitive finding. Many proposals share an assumption that, as Shapiro posited, when a traumatic or very negative event occurs, information processing of the experience in memory may be incomplete. The trauma causes a disruption of normal adaptive information processing, which results in unprocessed information being dysfunctionally held in memory networks. According to the 2013 World Health Organization practice guideline: ""This therapy [EMDR] is based on the idea that negative thoughts, feelings and behaviours are the result of unprocessed memories."" Proposed mechanisms posit that EMDR can assist to successfully alleviate clinical complaints by processing the components of the contributing distressing memories. Doing EMDR allows the client to access and reprocess negative memories (leading to decreased psychological arousal associated with the memory). This is sometimes known as the Adaptive Information Processing (AIP) model. The mechanism by which EMDR achieves this effect is unknown. One proposal is that EDMR achieves this effect through impacting working memory. The proposal is that the degradation in working memory causes a distancing effect, enabling the client to 'stand back' from the trauma. This enables the client to re-evaluate the trauma and their understanding of it, because they can re-experience it whilst not feeling overwhelmed by it. This effect may be achieved by . By having the patient perform a bilateral stimulation task while retrieving memories of trauma, the amount of information they can retrieve about the trauma is limited, and thus the resulting negative emotions are less intense. Bilateral stimulation (BLS) may have other effects (see below). Another proposal is that EMDR enables ‘dual attention’ (recalling the trauma whilst keeping ‘one foot in the present’ assisted by BLS), allowing the brain to access the dysfunctionally stored experience and stimulate the innate processing system, allowing it to transform the information to an adaptive resolution. Other commentators compare EMDR to the effects of sleep, and posit that traumatic experiences are processed during sleep. A slowing of brain waves has been seen during bilateral stimulation (eye movement), somewhat similar to what occurs during sleep. A possibly related finding is that brain waves during EMDR treatment shows changes in brain activity, specifically the limbic system showed its highest level of activity prior to commencing EMDR treatment. An earlier suggestion was that horizontal eye movement triggers an evolutionary 'orienting approach' in the brain, used in scanning the environment for threats and opportunities. Another approach is that trauma can be overcome or mastered, and that EMDR facilitates a form of mindfulness or other form of mastery over the trauma. A 2013 meta-analysis focused on two mechanisms: (1) taxing and (2) /. It may be that several mechanisms are at work in EMDR. Questions about eye movement and bilateral stimulation Bilateral stimulation is a generalization of the left and right repetitive eye movement technique first used by Shapiro. These alternative stimuli include auditory stimuli that alternate between left and right speakers or headphones, and physical stimuli such as tapping of the therapist's hands. Research has attempted to correlate other types of rhythmic side-to-side stimuli, such as sound and touch, with mood, memory and cerebral hemispheric interaction. A small 1996 study found that the eye movements employed in EMDR did not add to its effectiveness. A 2000 review found that the eye movements did not play a central role, and that the mechanisms of eye movements were speculative. A 2001 meta-analysis suggested that EMDR with the eye movements was no more efficacious than EMDR without the eye movements (Davidson & Parker, 2001). Salkovskis in 2002 reported that the eye movement is irrelevant, and that the effectiveness of EMDR was solely due to its having properties similar to CBT, such as desensitization and exposure. However a 2012 review found that the evidence provided support for the contention that eye movements are essential to this therapy and that a theoretical rationale exists for their use. A 2013 meta-study found the effect size of eye movement was large and significant, with the strongest effect size difference being for vividness measures. As of 2020, the most recent and robust experiments call into question the consistency and generalizability of the technique. As early as 1999, EMDR was controversial within the psychological community, and it has continued to be so. Concerns have included questions about its effectiveness and the importance of the eye movement component of EMDR. In 2012, Hal Arkowitz, and summed up the state of the research at the time, saying that while EMDR is better than no treatment and probably better than merely talking to a supportive listener, Yet not a shred of good evidence exists that EMDR is superior to exposure-based treatments that behavior and cognitive-behavior therapists have been administering routinely for decades. Paraphrasing British writer and critic Samuel Johnson, Harvard University psychologist nicely summed up the case for EMDR: “What is effective in EMDR is not new, and what is new is not effective.” Skeptics of the therapy argue that EMDR is a , because the underlying theory is unfalsifiable. Also, the results of the therapy are non-specific, especially if the eye movement component is irrelevant to the results. What remains is a broadly therapeutic interaction and deceptive marketing. According to Yale neurologist : [T]he false specificity of these treatments is a massive clinical distraction. Time and effort are wasted clinically in studying, perfecting, and using these methods, rather than focusing on the components of the interaction that actually work. Shapiro has been criticized for repeatedly increasing the length and expense of training and certification, allegedly in response to the results of controlled trials that cast doubt on EMDR's efficacy. This included requiring the completion of an EMDR training program in order to be qualified to administer EMDR properly, after researchers using the initial written instructions found no difference between no-eye-movement control groups and EMDR-as-written experimental groups. Further changes in training requirements and/or the definition of EMDR included requiring level II training when researchers with level I training still found no difference between eye-movement experimental groups and no-eye-movement controls and deeming ""alternate forms of bilateral stimulation"" (such as finger-tapping) as variants of EMDR by the time a study found no difference between EMDR and a finger-tapping control group. Such changes in definition and training for EMDR have been described as ""ad hoc moves [made] when confronted by embarrassing data"". Feske, Ulrike (June 1998).

So, now to the bottom line: EMDR ameliorates symptoms of traumatic anxiety better than doing nothing and probably better than talking to a supportive listener. Yet not a shred of good evidence exists that EMDR is superior to exposure-based treatments that behavior and cognitive-behavior therapists have been administering routinely for decades. Paraphrasing British writer and critic Samuel Johnson, Harvard University psychologist nicely summed up the case for EMDR: “What is effective in EMDR is not new, and what is new is not effective.” (March 30, 2011).

28cfb261-43c5-43f0-8c4a-e7b5fed9f27f,"() is a form of short-term psychotherapy developed through empirical, video-recorded research by . The therapy's primary goal is to help the patient overcome internal resistance to experiencing true feelings about the present and past which have been warded off because they are either too frightening or too painful. The technique is in that it aims to help the patient experience these warded-off feelings to the maximum degree possible; it is in that it tries to achieve this experience as quickly as possible; it is because it involves working with forces and feelings. Patients come to therapy because of either symptoms or interpersonal difficulties. Symptoms include traditional psychological problems like and , but they also include physical symptoms without medically identifiable cause, such as headache, shortness of breath, diarrhea, or sudden weakness. The ISTDP model attributes these to the occurrence of distressing situations where painful or forbidden emotions are triggered outside of awareness. Within psychiatry, these phenomena are classified as """" in . The therapy itself was developed during the 1960s to 1990s by Habib Davanloo, a and from . He video recorded patient sessions and watched the recordings in minute detail to determine as precisely as possible what sorts of interventions were most effective in overcoming , which he believed was acting to keep painful or frightening feelings out of awareness and prevent interpersonal closeness. ISTDP is taught by Habib Davanloo at , as well as in other University and post-graduate settings around the world. The ISTDP Institute offers on-line ISTDP training materials, including introductory videos and skill-building exercises. Davanloo's discovery of the unconscious consequences of attachment trauma I. Pressure: Therapeutic encouragement and reaching through to the patient II. Challenge: Pointing out and interrupting defenses in concert with the patient III. Head-on collision: Pointing out the reality of the defenses and encouragement to overcome them In 1895, and published their , which looked at a series of case studies where patients presented with dramatic neurological symptoms, such as ""Anna O"" who suffered headaches, partial paralysis, loss of sensation, and visual disturbances. These symptoms did not conform to known patterns of neurological disease, and neurologists were thus unable to account for symptoms in purely anatomical or physiological terms. Breuer's breakthrough was the discovery that symptomatic relief could be brought about by encouraging patients to speak freely about emotionally difficult aspects of their lives. Experiencing these emotions which had been previously outside of awareness seemed to be the curative factor. This cure became known as , and the experiencing of the previously forbidden or painful emotion was . Freud tried various techniques to deal with the fact that patients generally seemed resistant to experiencing painful feelings. He moved from to , interpretation of resistance, and . With each step, therapy became longer. Freud himself was quite open about the possibility that there were many patients for whom analysis could bring little or no relief, and he discusses the factors in his 1937 paper ""Analysis Terminable and Interminable."" From the 1930s through the 1950s, a number of analysts were researching methods of shortening the course of therapy without sacrificing therapeutic effectiveness. These included , , Peter Sifneos, , and Habib Davanloo. One of the first discoveries was that the patients who appeared to benefit most from therapy were those who could rapidly engage, could describe a specific therapeutic focus, and could quickly move to experience their previously warded-off feelings. These also happened to represent those patients who were the healthiest to begin with and therefore had the least need for the therapy being offered. Clinical research revealed that these ""rapid responders"" were able to recover quickly with therapy because they were the least traumatised and therefore had the smallest burden of repressed emotion, and so were least resistant to experiencing the emotions related to trauma. However, these patients represented only a small minority of those arriving at psychiatric clinics; the vast majority remained unreachable with the newly developing techniques. A number of psychiatrists began directing their psychotherapeutic research into methods of overcoming resistance. Dr. David Malan popularized a model of resistance, known as the , which had first been proposed by . At the bottom of the triangle are the patient's true, impulse-laden feelings, outside of conscious awareness. When those emotions rise to a certain degree and threaten to break into conscious awareness, they trigger anxiety. The patient manages this anxiety by deploying defences, which lessen anxiety by pushing emotions back into the unconscious. The emotions at the bottom of Malan's Triangle of Conflict originate in the patient's past, and , the , originally proposed by Menninger, explains that old emotions generated from the past are triggered in current relationships and also get triggered in the relationship with the therapist. The question of how maladaptive patterns of interpersonal behaviour could arise from early childhood experiences in the family of origin was postulated within psychoanalytic theory. Independent empirical support came from Bowlby's newly arising field of . , a British psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, was very interested in the impact on a child of adverse experiences in relation to its primary figures (usually the mother, but often the father and others) in early life. He concluded, in opposition to received psychoanalytic dogma of the day, that childhood experience was far more important than unconscious fantasy. He also elucidated the nature of attachment, a system of behaviours exhibited by human and other mammalian infants which are innate and have the goal of physical proximity to the mother. For instance, a child taken out of its mother's arms cries loudly in protest, and it is only quieted by being restored to its mother's arms. Bowlby observed that the innate attachment system would be activated by loss of proximity to the mother, and that long-lasting trauma to the child could result from attachment interruption. Long term consequences included increased propensity to psychiatric disorders, poor relationship function, and decreased life satisfaction. Bowlby conducted numerous studies and noted strong correlations between adverse early-life circumstances—primarily the lack of a consistent and nurturing relationship with the mother—as the source of numerous difficulties, including persistent depression, anxiety, or delinquency in adulthood. Childhood traumatisation to the attachment bond, usually through separation from or loss of the primary mother or mother-substitute, led to adult difficulties. Since Bowlby, the effects of trauma over development have consistently been shown to have a significant detrimental impact on adult psychological functioning. Davanloo's discovery of the unconscious consequences of attachment trauma In the 1960s, while Bowlby was observing children directly, Davanloo was beginning his work with symptomatic and character-disturbed adults. As he began his video-recording work and became progressively successful against higher levels of resistance, he noted that particular themes reappeared with striking consistency in patient after patient. First, the therapist's efforts to get to know the patient's true feelings often aroused a simultaneous mixed feeling in the patient, composed of deep appreciation for the therapist's relentless efforts to get to know the patient deeply, combined with equally deep irritation at the therapist for challenging the patient to abandon long-held resistances which could thwart the therapeutic effort. Davanloo noted, in concert with Malan's Triangle of Conflict, that patients would unconsciously resist the therapist's efforts to get to the root of their difficulties. He also observed, from his videotaped sessions, that patients would simultaneously send off signals of their anxiety. Davanloo carefully monitored these signals of anxiety and saw that they represented the rise of complex mixed feelings with the therapist. The mix represented that part of the patient seeking relief from painful symptoms but also an active desire to avoid painful, repressed feelings. As Davanloo became more skilled at unlocking the patient's true unconscious feelings, he noted an often very predictable sequence of feelings. The sequence was by no means invariable, but it occurred frequently enough to allow the therapist to hypothesise its existence in a majority of cases. First, after a high rise of mixed feeling with the therapist, manifested as signals of intense anxiety (tension in skeletal muscle, often manifested as wringing of the hands, accompanied with deep, sighing respirations), there would often be a breakthrough of rage, accompanied by an immediate drop in anxiety. This rage, Davanloo discovered, is intensely felt. It often has a violent impulse associated with it, sometimes even a murderous impulse. Once patients feel this rage, they are able to describe vividly detailed fantasies of what the rage would do if it were to take on a life of its own. The rage is a product of thwarted efforts to attach from the past. Those thwarted efforts to love and be loved yield pain, in the form of what Bowlby described as protest. The pain yields a reactive rage at the loved person who thwarted attachment efforts. Complete experiencing of the rageful impulse is typically accompanied by a tremendous relief at finally getting something out which has yearned for release. However, the relief is typically short lived. Next, Davanloo almost invariably noted that patients then experience a tremendous wave of . The guilt is a product of the fact that the old rageful feelings were with a person who was also loved. It is this guilt, Davanloo discovered, which is the key ingredient in symptom formation and character difficulties. Symptoms and interpersonal difficulties (usually unconscious efforts to ward off intimacy and closeness) are the product of guilt, which turns the rage back on the self. For instance, the rage of a two-year-old toward a mother who dies may be experienced in the present as suicidal feelings (self-directed murderous rage). Beneath the guilty feelings from the past, Davanloo almost invariably noted painful feelings about thwarted efforts at emotional closeness to parents and others in childhood. Finally, at the deepest layer of feelings are the still powerful yearnings for closeness, attachment, and love. The goal of the ISTDP therapist is, as rapidly as possible, to help the patient overcome resistance, and then experience all the waves of mixed, genuine feeling, previously unconscious, triggered by the intense therapeutic process. Those feelings are traced back to their origins in the past, and then both therapist and patient come to understand how the patient came to be the ""consciously confused, unconsciously driven"" person in the present. Old pockets of emotion are drained, the patient has a clearer self-narrative, and self-destructive symptoms and defences are renounced. The understanding gained is not just cognitive, but goes to the fundamental, emotional core. The influence of Freud's early trauma theory is evident. Davanloo discovered the layers of the dynamic unconscious through a process of developing specific interventions which allow the therapist to reach those layers. Those interventions, applied in a specific fashion at specific times in the therapeutic process, are all calculated to overcome the patient's resistance as quickly and completely as possible, to allow the earliest and fullest experience of true feelings about the present and past as quickly as possible. Those interventions are known as , , and . I. Pressure: Therapeutic encouragement and reaching through to the patient Pressure is the principal ingredient of ISTDP, and it takes many forms. Initially, pressure takes the form of encouraging the patient to describe symptoms and interpersonal difficulties as specifically as possible, so both patient and therapist get the clearest picture possible of the precise difficulties. It starts from the moment the patient walks into the room, in the form of the question, ""Are there some difficulties you are experiencing which you would like us to have a look at?"" The primary form of pressure is pressure toward . Again, this is exerted mainly in the form of questions, such as, ""How did you feel toward your boss for humiliating you in front of your staff? We see that you got anxious and depressed, but how did you feel?"" Pressure can be toward the patient's : ""Can we look to your feelings? Do you want us to look to your feelings?"" Pressure is also exerted toward the therapeutic : ""Our goal here, if you want, is to get to the root, the engine, driving your difficulties. So, can we look at a specific time when you experienced anxiety? This will give us a clear picture of the problem which we can use to get to the engine."" In its essence, pressure is encouragement from the therapist to the patient. It is encouragement to renounce defences, tolerate anxiety, and walk, with the therapist, into those places which have previously been off-limits. It is a way of saying, ""There's nothing in there we cannot face together, and we do so in your service, to relieve you of painful difficulties."" Patients with low resistance are often quite responsive to pressure alone. However, as explained above, those are the patients who are healthiest to begin with. For patients with higher levels of resistance, usually the product of a more traumatised early phase of life, pressure quickly leads to the patient erecting barriers with the therapist. Those barriers are the patient's habitual defences against avoided feelings. The combination of intentional (conscious) and unintentional (unconscious) defences is called the resistance. The therapist is constantly monitoring for both the rise in anxiety and the appearance of resistance. When resistance does make its appearance, new interventions, in addition to pressure, are called for. II. Challenge: Pointing out and interrupting defenses in concert with the patient Challenge is a two-stage process. The first stage is , which is the therapist's effort to confirm that resistance is operating, and also to acquaint the patient with the specific defense being deployed. Patients are often quite unaware of their own defenses. Clarification takes the form of a question, meant to clarify the defense to both patient and therapist: ""Do you notice that when you speak of being angry with your boss that you smile and giggle? Is a smile something you sometimes do to cover up a deeper feeling?"" When a defense is properly clarified, both patient and therapist can work together against it, because it represents an obstacle to the therapeutic task of getting to the patient's true feelings. A defense which has not been clarified is still invisible to the patient. It is also important to note that in childhood, defenses can be a useful tool in emotionally overwhelming or traumatic situations. According to Los Angeles-based psychiatrist Katherine Watkins, M.D. “ can shield us from intense feelings that we are developmentally unprepared to experience and process. However as we grow up, this shielding cuts us off from our full range of feelings, even when we are now emotionally able to handle the feelings.” Challenge to the defenses represents an exhortation to the patient to abandon the defense: ""Again you smile when I ask you about feelings in relation to being humiliated by your husband. If you don't smile, how were you truly feeling?"" This particular intervention is a very powerful one in the therapist's arsenal. As with all powerful interventions, if it is misapplied, the consequences can be severe: rapid misalliance with the therapist, worsening of symptoms, and treatment dropout. This is because the patient perceives a premature challenge, applied when a defense has not been clarified, as a criticism or a personal attack. A common misunderstanding of ISTDP is that the therapist's role is to badger the patient through the use of Challenge. However, the proper use of challenge is as an aid or enhancement to the therapeutic alliance by removing an obstacle to the rise in feelings with the therapist. If challenge originates as a product of frustration in the therapist or as a misunderstanding of the unconscious, then stalemate is virtually assured. The main purpose of challenge is to remove any obstacles in the way of the mutually agreed upon task of getting to the engine of the patient's present difficulties: warded-off, complex feelings in relation to traumatizing experiences with important attachment figures in the past. The majority of patients are able to experience their true mixed feelings with a combination of Pressure and properly clarified Challenge. However, a sizable minority of patients erect a massive wall of resistance with the therapist. This wall is erected automatically and is an over-learned, habitual response, used to avoid emotional intimacy, both with the therapist and with other important figures in the patient's personal orbit. When the therapist observes that the patient's resistance has fully crystallized, it is time to deploy the ultimate intervention. III. Head-on collision: Pointing out the reality of the defenses and encouragement to overcome them The Head-on Collision is an intervention aimed not at any single defense but rather aimed at the entire defensive structure being deployed by the patient. It is an urgent appeal to the patient to exert maximal effort to overcome the resistance, and it takes the form of a summary statement to the patient which explains the consequences of continuing to resist: Let's take a look at what's happening here. You have come on your own free will, because you are experiencing a problem which causes you pain. We have set out to get to the root of your difficulties, but every time we attempt to move toward it, you put up this massive wall. The wall keeps me out, and it keeps you from knowing your own true feelings. If you keep me out, you keep me useless. Is that what you want? Because, as you see, you are certainly capable of keeping me useless to you. My first question is, why would you want me to be useless? You see, the consequences of this would be that I would be unable to help you. I'd like to, but the nature of this work is that I can't help everyone. Sometimes I fail. However, can you afford to fail? How much longer do you want to carry this burden? This complex intervention is simultaneously aimed at the patient's will, is a reminder of the task, and is a wake-up call to the therapeutic alliance to exert maximal effort against the resistance. It is a reminder, in stark terms, that the therapeutic task is in jeopardy and may well fail. Finally, it is a reminder to the patient of the consequences of failure, as well as an implied reminder that success is also possible. The interventions of Pressure, Challenge, and Head-on Collision, all aimed at helping the patient experience true feelings in relation to the present and past, allowed Davanloo to expand the scope of patients who can be helped by short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy. A model which initially worked only with highly motivated patients able to describe a clearly problematic area can now be applied to patients whose difficulties are diffuse and whose motivation is also initially quite diffuse. The results are deep, lasting changes in areas of both symptomatic and interpersonal disturbances. It is also worth stressing that ISTDP, unlike traditional psychodynamic therapies, assiduously avoids interpretation until such time as the unconscious is open. The use of trial interpretations is explicitly avoided. The phase of interpretation only commences once it is clear to both therapist and patient that there has been a passage of previously unconscious emotion. Quite often, it is then the patient who takes the lead in interpreting: ""The incredible rage I felt toward you when you refused to let me off the hook regarding my feelings is exactly the same rage that I felt toward my father when I was five years old and found out he had been killed in the war and wasn't coming home. I buried the rage that day because I felt so guilty about it. That's the day I became depressed."" Davanloo's initial research was published in the form of a qualitative case series of approximately 200 patients. He maintains a large video library of treated cases which he uses for teaching conferences, though this has not yet been made available for other psychotherapy researchers to independently verify and quantify Davanloo's claims. He claims efficacy with psychological symptoms, medically unexplained symptoms (so-called functional or ), and characterological disturbances (referred to as in ). Empirical research into the efficacy of ISTDP, and other brief psychodynamic psychotherapies is active. There are now over 60 published outcome studies in ISTDP including 40 randomized controlled trials for depression, anxiety, personality, somatic symptom and substance use disorders. There are also over 20 studies showing the cost effectiveness of the method through reducing doctor visits, medication costs, hospital costs and disability costs. Depression and Treatment Resistant Depression Somatic Symptom Disorders: at least 20 studies as of October 2019 Cost effectiveness studies: at least 22 studies as of October 2019: As an Adjunct to Care in Severe Mental Disorders A examined the efficacy of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapies for common mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and personality disorders. Without distinguishing between different forms of STDP from Davanloo's ISTDP, modest to large short-term gains were reported for a broad range of people experiencing common mental disorders. Further research is required to determine the effectiveness and long term benefits of psychodynamic psychotherapies for common mental disorders. Neuroscientist and Nobel Prize winner, refers to Davanloo's technique and its effectiveness in providing relief from emotional disturbances. (CT), developed by Aaron T. Beck, focuses on illogical thoughts as the main driver of emotional difficulties. These beliefs, such as, ""Everything I attempt inevitably fails,"" are postulated to cause emotional states like depression or hopelessness. The therapist collaborates with the patient to determine which faulty cognitions are currently accepted by the patient as true. Together, the patient and therapist discover these cognitions and collaboratively explore the evidence for and against them. Relief of symptoms comes from replacing unfounded cognitions with more reality-based thoughts. CBT has been shown effective in numerous trials, particularly for depression and anxiety disorders. While ISTDP accepts the presence of faulty cognitions, the causality is thought to be reversed. The ISTDP therapist would posit that unconscious emotions lead to unconscious anxiety, which is managed by unconscious defences. These defences can certainly include hopeless, helpless, or self-deprecating cognitions. Rather than examining evidence for and against a thought like, ""I am unable to know my own true feelings,"" an ISTDP therapist might say, ""If you adopt that position, which is essentially a position of helplessness, we will not get to the engine driving your difficulties. If you renounce this helpless position, how are you truly feeling right now?"" Both the CT and ISTDP therapist call the thought into question, with the goal of ultimately liberating the patient. The difference is that the ISTDP therapist sees the faulty cognition as to the true, buried feelings, while the CT therapist sees the faulty cognition as the of the painful emotions leading to the painful psychological state. It may well be the case that causality flows in both directions, dependent on the individual, the emotions, and the cognitions involved. As of this writing, though both CT and ISTDP show good evidence of clinical efficacy, the theoretical question of whether or remains unresolved; it could well be the case that thought and feeling are inextricably bound, and that we have not yet developed adequate psychological or neuroscientific concepts and tools to frame these sorts of questions properly.

The triangle in the middle represents CBT's tenet that all humans' core beliefs can be summed up in three categories: self, others, future. () is a that aims to improve . CBT focuses on challenging and changing unhelpful (e.g. thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes) and behaviors, improving , and the development of personal that target solving current problems. Originally, it was designed to treat , but its uses have been expanded to include treatment of a number of mental health conditions, including . CBT includes a number of cognitive or behavior psychotherapies that treat defined psychopathologies using evidence-based techniques and strategies. CBT is based on the combination of the basic principles from and . It is different from historical approaches to , such as the approach where the therapist looks for the unconscious meaning behind the behaviors and then formulates a diagnosis. Instead, CBT is a ""problem-focused"" and ""action-oriented"" form of therapy, meaning it is used to treat specific problems related to a diagnosed mental disorder. The therapist's role is to assist the client in finding and practicing effective strategies to address the identified goals and decrease symptoms of the disorder. CBT is based on the belief that and behaviors play a role in the development and maintenance of , and that symptoms and associated distress can be reduced by teaching new information-processing skills and coping mechanisms. When compared to , review studies have found CBT alone to be as effective for treating less severe forms of depression, , (PTSD), , , and . Some research suggests that CBT is most effective when combined with medication for treating mental disorders such as . In addition, CBT is recommended as the first line of treatment for the majority of psychological disorders in children and adolescents, including aggression and . Researchers have found that other therapeutic interventions were equally effective for treating certain conditions in adults. Along with (IPT), CBT is recommended in treatment guidelines as a psychosocial treatment of choice,. Psychiatry residents in the United States are mandated to receive training in psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, and supportive psychotherapy. Behavior and cognitive therapies merge – ""third wave"" CBT Mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral hypnotherapy Precursors of certain fundamental aspects of CBT have been identified in various ancient philosophical traditions, particularly . Stoic philosophers, particularly , believed logic could be used to identify and discard false beliefs that lead to destructive emotions, which has influenced the way modern cognitive-behavioral therapists identify cognitive distortions that contribute to depression and anxiety. For example, 's original treatment manual for depression states, ""The philosophical origins of cognitive therapy can be traced back to the Stoic philosophers"". Another example of Stoic influence on cognitive theorists is Epictetus on . A key philosophical figure who also influenced the development of CBT was . The modern roots of CBT can be traced to the development of in the early 20th century, the development of cognitive therapy in the 1960s, and the subsequent merging of the two. Groundbreaking work of behaviorism began with and 's studies of in 1920. Behaviorally-centered therapeutic approaches appeared as early as 1924 with ' work dedicated to the unlearning of fears in children. These were the antecedents of the development of 's behavioral therapy in the 1950s. It was the work of Wolpe and Watson, which was based on 's work on learning and conditioning, that influenced and to develop new behavioral therapy techniques based on . During the 1950s and 1960s, behavioral therapy became widely utilized by researchers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa, who were inspired by the learning theory of , , and . In Britain, , who applied the findings of animal experiments to his method of , applied behavioral research to the treatment of neurotic disorders. Wolpe's therapeutic efforts were precursors to today's fear reduction techniques. British psychologist presented behavior therapy as a constructive alternative. At the same time as Eysenck's work, and his associates were beginning to have an impact with their work on . Skinner's work was referred to as and avoided anything related to cognition. However, , in 1954, and , in 1969, contributed behavior therapy with their respective work on , by demonstrating the effects of cognition on learning and behavior modification. The work of the Australian dealing with anxiety disorders in the 1960s was also seen as a prototype of behavior therapy. The emphasis on behavioral factors constituted the ""first wave"" of CBT. One of the first therapists to address cognition in psychotherapy was with his notion of and how they contributed to creation of unhealthy or useless behavioral and life goals. Adler's work influenced the work of , who developed the earliest cognitive-based psychotherapy, known today as , or REBT. Ellis also credits as a founder of cognitive behavioral therapy. Around the same time that rational emotive therapy, as it was known then, was being developed, was conducting sessions in his practice. During these sessions, Beck noticed that thoughts were not as unconscious as had previously theorized, and that certain types of thinking may be the culprits of emotional distress. It was from this hypothesis that Beck developed , and called these thoughts ""automatic thoughts"". Beck has been referred to as ""the father of cognitive behavioral therapy."" It was these two therapies, rational emotive therapy and cognitive therapy, that started the ""second wave"" of CBT, which was the emphasis on cognitive factors. Behavior and cognitive therapies merge – ""third wave"" CBT Although the early behavioral approaches were successful in many of the neurotic disorders, they had little success in treating . Behaviorism was also losing in popularity due to the so-called """". The therapeutic approaches of and gained popularity among behavior therapists, despite the earlier behaviorist rejection of """" concepts like thoughts and cognitions. Both of these systems included behavioral elements and interventions and primarily concentrated on problems in the present. In initial studies, cognitive therapy was often contrasted with behavioral treatments to see which was most effective. During the 1980s and 1990s, cognitive and behavioral techniques were merged into cognitive behavioral therapy. Pivotal to this merging was the successful development of treatments for by in the UK and in the US. Over time, cognitive behavior therapy came to be known not only as a therapy, but as an umbrella term for all cognitive-based psychotherapies. These therapies include, but are not limited to, , cognitive therapy, , , /, , , and . All of these therapies are a blending of cognitive- and behavior-based elements. This blending of theoretical and technical foundations from both and cognitive therapies constituted the ""third wave"" of CBT. The most prominent therapies of this third wave are dialectical behavior therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy. Despite increasing popularity of ""third-wave"" treatment approaches, reviews of studies reveal there may be no difference in the effectiveness compared with ""non-third wave"" CBT for the treatment of depression. Mainstream cognitive behavioral therapy assumes that changing thinking leads to change in and , but recent variants emphasize changes in one's relationship to maladaptive thinking rather than changes in thinking itself. The goal of cognitive behavioral therapy is not to diagnose a person with a particular disease, but to look at the person as a whole and decide what can be altered. Therapists or computer-based programs use CBT techniques to help people challenge their patterns and beliefs and replace errors in thinking, known as , such as ""overgeneralizing, magnifying negatives, minimizing positives and catastrophizing"" with ""more realistic and effective thoughts, thus decreasing emotional distress and self-defeating behavior"". Cognitive distortions can be either a pseudo-discrimination belief or an over-generalization of something. CBT techniques may also be used to help individuals take a more open, mindful, and aware posture toward cognitive distortions so as to diminish their impact. Mainstream CBT helps individuals replace ""maladaptive... coping skills, cognitions, emotions and behaviors with more adaptive ones"", by challenging an individual's way of thinking and the way that they react to certain habits or behaviors, but there is still controversy about the degree to which these traditional cognitive elements account for the effects seen with CBT over and above the earlier behavioral elements such as exposure and skills training. These steps are based on a system created by Kanfer and Saslow. After identifying the behaviors that need changing, whether they be in excess or deficit, and treatment has occurred, the psychologist must identify whether or not the intervention succeeded. For example, ""If the goal was to decrease the behavior, then there should be a decrease relative to the baseline. If the critical behavior remains at or above the baseline, then the intervention has failed."" Step 2: Determine whether critical behaviors are excesses or deficits Step 3: Evaluate critical behaviors for frequency, duration, or intensity (obtain a baseline) Step 4: If excess, attempt to decrease frequency, duration, or intensity of behaviors; if deficits, attempt to increase behaviors. The re-conceptualization phase makes up much of the ""cognitive"" portion of CBT. A summary of modern CBT approaches is given by Hofmann. There are different protocols for delivering cognitive behavioral therapy, with important similarities among them. Use of the term may refer to different interventions, including ""self-instructions (e.g. distraction, imagery, motivational self-talk), relaxation and/or , development of adaptive coping strategies (e.g. minimizing negative or self-defeating thoughts), changing maladaptive beliefs about pain, and "". Treatment is sometimes manualized, with brief, direct, and time-limited treatments for individual psychological disorders that are specific technique-driven. CBT is used in both individual and group settings, and the techniques are often adapted for applications. Some clinicians and researchers are cognitively oriented (e.g. ), while others are more behaviorally oriented (e.g. ). Interventions such as imaginal exposure therapy combine both approaches. CBT may be delivered in conjunction with a variety of diverse but related techniques such as , , , , , , and . Some practitioners promote a form of mindful cognitive therapy which includes a greater emphasis on self-awareness as part of the therapeutic process. This section .

In adults, CBT has been shown to have effectiveness and a role in the treatment plans for , , , , chronic , , , , , in the adjustment, depression, and anxiety associated with , and with post-. In children or adolescents, CBT is an effective part of treatment plans for anxiety disorders, body dysmorphic disorder, depression and , eating disorders and , (OCD), and , as well as , , and other repetitive behavior disorders. CBT-SP, an adaptation of CBT for suicide prevention (SP), was specifically designed for treating youths who are severely depressed and who have recently attempted suicide within the past 90 days, and was found to be effective, feasible, and acceptable. CBT has also been shown to be effective for posttraumatic stress disorder in very young children (3 to 6 years of age). Reviews found ""low quality"" evidence that CBT may be more effective than other psychotherapies in reducing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents. CBT has also been applied to a variety of childhood disorders, including depressive disorders and various anxiety disorders. CBT combined with hypnosis and distraction reduces self-reported pain in children. have found no evidence that CBT is effective for , although there appears to be an effect on management of associated depression and quality of life in this condition. Other recent Cochrane Reviews found no convincing evidence that CBT training helps providers manage difficult behaviors in the youths under their care, nor was it helpful in treating people who their intimate partners. According to a 2004 review by of three methods, cognitive behavioral therapy was either ""proven"" or ""presumed"" to be an effective therapy on several specific . According to the study, CBT was effective at treating schizophrenia, , , , , anxiety disorders, , , personality disorders and . Some meta-analyses find CBT more effective than psychodynamic therapy and equal to other therapies in treating anxiety and depression. Computerized CBT (CCBT) has been proven to be effective by randomized controlled and other trials in treating depression and anxiety disorders, including children, as well as insomnia. Some research has found similar effectiveness to an intervention of informational websites and weekly telephone calls. CCBT was found to be equally effective as face-to-face CBT in adolescent anxiety and . Criticism of CBT sometimes focuses on implementations (such as the UK ) which may result initially in low quality therapy being offered by poorly trained practitioners. However, evidence supports the effectiveness of CBT for anxiety and depression. (ACT) is a specialist branch of CBT (sometimes referred to as contextual CBT). ACT uses mindfulness and acceptance interventions and has been found to have a greater longevity in therapeutic outcomes. In a study with anxiety, CBT and ACT improved similarly across all outcomes from pre-to post-treatment. However, during a 12-month follow-up, ACT proved to be more effective, showing that it is a highly viable lasting treatment model for anxiety disorders. Evidence suggests that the addition of as an adjunct to CBT improves treatment efficacy for a variety of clinical issues. CBT has been applied in both clinical and non-clinical environments to treat disorders such as personality conditions and behavioral problems. A of CBT in depression and anxiety disorders concluded that ""CBT delivered in primary care, especially including computer- or Internet-based self-help programs, is potentially more effective than usual care and could be delivered effectively by primary care therapists."" Emerging evidence suggests a possible role for CBT in the treatment of (ADHD); ; coping with the impact of ; sleep disturbances related to aging; ; and bipolar disorder, but more study is needed and results should be interpreted with caution. CBT can have a therapeutic effects on easing symptoms of anxiety and depression in people with . CBT has been studied as an aid in the treatment of anxiety associated with . Initial studies have shown CBT to be effective in reducing social anxiety in adults who stutter, but not in reducing stuttering frequency. In the case of people with , data is limited but CBT and other psychosocial interventions might help with psychological outcomes and pain management. There is some evidence that CBT is superior in the long-term to and the in the treatment and management of . CBT has been shown to be moderately effective for treating . In the United Kingdom, the (NICE) recommends CBT in the treatment plans for a number of difficulties, including , (OCD), , and . Further information: , and Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown as an effective treatment for clinical depression. The Practice Guidelines (April 2000) indicated that, among psychotherapeutic approaches, cognitive behavioral therapy and had the best-documented efficacy for treatment of . One theory of depression is 's cognitive theory of depression. His theory states that depressed people think the way they do because their thinking is biased towards negative interpretations. According to this theory, depressed people acquire a negative of the world in childhood and adolescence as an effect of stressful life events, and the negative schema is activated later in life when the person encounters similar situations. Beck also described a negative . The cognitive triad is made up of the depressed individual's negative evaluations of themselves, the world, and the future. Beck suggested that these negative evaluations derive from the negative schemata and cognitive biases of the person. According to this theory, depressed people have views such as ""I never do a good job"", ""It is impossible to have a good day"", and ""things will never get better"". A negative schema helps give rise to the cognitive bias, and the cognitive bias helps fuel the negative schema. Beck further proposed that depressed people often have the following cognitive biases: , , over-generalization, magnification, and . These cognitive biases are quick to make negative, generalized, and personal inferences of the self, thus fueling the negative schema. A 2001 meta-analysis comparing CBT and suggested the approaches were equally effective in the short term. In contrast, a 2013 meta-analyses suggested that CBT, , and outperformed psychodynamic psychotherapy and in the treatment of depression. CBT has been shown to be effective in the treatment of adults with anxiety disorders. A basic concept in some CBT treatments used in anxiety disorders is . CBT-exposure therapy refers to the direct confrontation of feared objects, activities, or situations by a patient. Results from a 2018 systematic review found a high strength of evidence that CBT-exposure therapy can reduce PTSD symptoms and lead to the loss of a PTSD diagnosis. For example, a woman with PTSD who fears the location where she was assaulted may be assisted by her therapist in going to that location and directly confronting those fears. Likewise, a person with social anxiety disorder who fears public speaking may be instructed to directly confront those fears by giving a speech. This ""two-factor"" model is often credited to . Through exposure to the stimulus, this harmful conditioning can be ""unlearned"" (referred to as and ). Studies have provided evidence that when examining animals and humans that may possibly lead to a more successful extinction learning during exposure therapy. For instance, glucocorticoids can prevent aversive learning episodes from being retrieved and heighten reinforcement of memory traces creating a non-fearful reaction in feared situations. A combination of glucocorticoids and exposure therapy may be a better improved treatment for treating patients with anxiety disorders. A 2015 Cochrane review also found that CBT for symptomatic management of non-specific chest pain is probably effective in the short term. However, the findings were limited by small trials and the evidence was considered of questionable quality. Many studies show CBT, combined with pharmacotherapy, is effective on improving depressive symptoms, mania severity and psychosocial functioning with mild to moderate effects, and that it is better than medication alone. In long-term , CBT is used to complement medication and is adapted to meet individual needs. Interventions particularly related to these conditions include exploring reality testing, changing delusions and hallucinations, examining factors which precipitate relapse, and managing relapses. A Cochrane review reported CBT had ""no effect on long‐term risk of relapse"" and no additional effect above standard care. A 2015 investigated the effects of CBT compared with other psychosocial therapies for people with schizophrenia and determined that there is no clear advantage over other, often less expensive, interventions but acknowledged that better quality evidence is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. CBT is used to help people of all ages, but the therapy should be adjusted based on the age of the patient with whom the therapist is dealing. Older individuals in particular have certain characteristics that need to be acknowledged and the therapy altered to account for these differences thanks to age. Of the small number of studies examining CBT for the management of depression in older people, there is currently no strong support. For anxiety disorders, use of CBT with people at risk has significantly reduced the number of episodes of generalized anxiety disorder and other anxiety symptoms, and also given significant improvements in explanatory style, hopelessness, and dysfunctional attitudes. In another study, 3% of the group receiving the CBT intervention developed generalized anxiety disorder by 12 months postintervention compared with 14% in the control group. Subthreshold panic disorder sufferers were found to significantly benefit from use of CBT. Use of CBT was found to significantly reduce social anxiety prevalence. For depressive disorders, a stepped-care intervention (watchful waiting, CBT and medication if appropriate) achieved a 50% lower incidence rate in a patient group aged 75 or older. Another depression study found a neutral effect compared to personal, social, and health education, and usual school provision, and included a comment on potential for increased depression scores from people who have received CBT due to greater self recognition and acknowledgement of existing symptoms of depression and negative thinking styles. A further study also saw a neutral result. A meta-study of the Coping with Depression course, a cognitive behavioral intervention delivered by a psychoeducational method, saw a 38% reduction in risk of major depression. For people at risk of , in 2014 the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended preventive CBT. CBT is also used for . The percentage of people who problem gamble is 1–3% around the world. Cognitive behavioral therapy develops skills for relapse prevention and someone can learn to control their mind and manage high-risk cases. There is evidence of efficacy of CBT for treating pathological and problem gambling at immediate follow up, however the longer term efficacy of CBT for it is currently unknown. CBT looks at the habit of smoking cigarettes as a learned behavior, which later evolves into a coping strategy to handle daily stressors. Because smoking is often easily accessible, and quickly allows the user to feel good, it can take precedence over other coping strategies, and eventually work its way into everyday life during non-stressful events as well. CBT aims to target the function of the behavior, as it can vary between individuals, and works to inject other coping mechanisms in place of smoking. CBT also aims to support individuals suffering from strong cravings, which are a major reported reason for relapse during treatment. In a 2008 controlled study out of Stanford University School of Medicine, suggested CBT may be an effective tool to help maintain abstinence. The results of 304 random adult participants were tracked over the course of one year. During this program, some participants were provided medication, CBT, 24 hour phone support, or some combination of the three methods. At 20 weeks, the participants who received CBT had a 45% abstinence rate, versus non-CBT participants, who had a 29% abstinence rate. Overall, the study concluded that emphasizing cognitive and behavioral strategies to support smoking cessation can help individuals build tools for long term smoking abstinence. Mental health history can affect the outcomes of treatment. Individuals with a history of depressive disorders had a lower rate of success when using CBT alone to combat smoking addiction. A Cochrane review was unable to find evidence of any difference between CBT and hypnosis for smoking cessation. While this may be evidence of no effect, further research may uncover an effect of CBT for smoking cessation. Studies have shown CBT to be an effective treatment for substance abuse. For individuals with substance abuse disorders, CBT aims to reframe maladaptive thoughts, such as denial, minimizing and catastrophizing thought patterns, with healthier narratives. Specific techniques include identifying potential triggers and developing coping mechanisms to manage high-risk situations. Research has shown CBT to be particularly effective when combined with other therapy-based treatments or medication. Main article: Cognitive behavioral treatment of eating disorders Though many forms of can support individuals with eating disorders, CBT is proven to be a more effective treatment than medications and interpersonal psychotherapy alone. CBT aims to combat major causes of distress such as negative cognitions surrounding body weight, shape and size. CBT therapists also work with individuals to regulate strong emotions and thoughts that lead to dangerous compensatory behaviors. CBT is the first line of treatment for , and Eating Disorder Non-Specific. While there is evidence to support the efficacy of CBT for bulimia nervosa and binging, the evidence is somewhat variable and limited by small study sizes. Research has identified as a new clinical disorder that causes relational, occupational, and social problems. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been suggested as the treatment of choice for Internet addiction, and addiction recovery in general has used CBT as part of treatment planning. A Cochrane review of interventions aimed at preventing psychological stress in healthcare workers found that CBT was more effective than no intervention but no more effective than alternative stress-reduction interventions. Emerging evidence for cognitive behavioral interventions aimed at reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder in autistic adults without intellectual disability has been identified through a systematic review. While the research was focused on adults, cognitive behavioral interventions have also been beneficial to autistic children. A typical CBT programme would consist of face-to-face sessions between patient and therapist, made up of 6–18 sessions of around an hour each with a gap of 1–3 weeks between sessions. This initial programme might be followed by some booster sessions, for instance after one month and three months. CBT has also been found to be effective if patient and therapist type in real time to each other over computer links. Cognitive behavioral therapy is most closely allied with the in which clinical practice and research is informed by a scientific perspective, clear of the problem, and an emphasis on , including measuring changes in cognition and behavior and in the attainment of . These are often met through """" assignments in which the patient and the therapist work together to craft an assignment to complete before the next session. The completion of these assignments – which can be as simple as a person suffering from depression attending some kind of social event – indicates a dedication to treatment compliance and a desire to change. The therapists can then logically gauge the next step of treatment based on how thoroughly the patient completes the assignment. Effective cognitive behavioral therapy is dependent on a between the healthcare practitioner and the person seeking assistance. Unlike many other forms of psychotherapy, the patient is very involved in CBT. For example, an anxious patient may be asked to talk to a stranger as a homework assignment, but if that is too difficult, he or she can work out an easier assignment first. The therapist needs to be flexible and willing to listen to the patient rather than acting as an authority figure. Although Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT) has been a topic of sustained controversy, it has been described by as a ""generic term for delivering CBT via an interactive computer interface delivered by a personal computer, internet, or interactive voice response system"", instead of face-to-face with a human therapist. It is also known as internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy or ICBT. CCBT has potential to improve access to evidence-based therapies, and to overcome the prohibitive costs and lack of availability sometimes associated with retaining a human therapist. In this context, it is important not to confuse CBT with 'computer-based training', which nowadays is more commonly referred to as . CCBT has been found in meta-studies to be cost-effective and often cheaper than usual care, including for anxiety. Studies have shown that individuals with social anxiety and depression experienced improvement with online CBT-based methods. A review of current CCBT research in the treatment of OCD in children found this interface to hold great potential for future treatment of OCD in youths and adolescent populations. Additionally, most internet interventions for posttraumatic stress disorder use CCBT. CCBT is also predisposed to treating mood disorders amongst non-heterosexual populations, who may avoid face-to-face therapy from fear of stigma. However presently CCBT programs seldom cater to these populations. A key issue in CCBT use is low uptake and completion rates, even when it has been clearly made available and explained. CCBT completion rates and treatment efficacy have been found in some studies to be higher when use of CCBT is supported personally, with supporters not limited only to therapists, than when use is in a self-help form alone. Another approach to improving uptake and completion rate, as well as treatment outcome, is to design software that supports the formation of a strong therapeutic alliance between the user and the technology. In February 2006 NICE recommended that CCBT be made available for use within the across England and Wales for patients presenting with mild-to-moderate depression, rather than immediately opting for antidepressant medication, and CCBT is made available by some health systems. The 2009 NICE guideline recognized that there are likely to be a number of computerized CBT products that are useful to patients, but removed endorsement of any specific product. A relatively new avenue of research is the combination of artificial intelligence and CCBT. It has been proposed to use modern technology to create CCBT that simulates face-to-face therapy. This might be achieved in cognitive behavior therapy for a specific disorder using the comprehensive domain knowledge of CBT. One area where this has been attempted is the specific domain area of social anxiety in those who stutter. Another new method of access is the use of or smartphone applications to deliver self-help or guided CBT. Technology companies are developing mobile-based artificial intelligence applications in delivering CBT as an early intervention to support , to build and to promote . (AI) text-based conversational application delivered securely and privately over smartphone devices have the ability to scale globally and offer contextual and always-available support. Active research is underway including real world data studies that measure effectiveness and engagement of text-based smartphone chatbot apps for delivery of CBT using a text-based conversational interface. Enabling patients to read self-help CBT guides has been shown to be effective by some studies. However one study found a negative effect in patients who tended to ruminate, and another meta-analysis found that the benefit was only significant when the self-help was guided (e.g. by a medical professional). Patient participation in group courses has been shown to be effective. In a meta-analysis reviewing evidence-based treatment of OCD in children, individual CBT was found to be more efficacious than group CBT. Brief cognitive behavioral therapy (BCBT) is a form of CBT which has been developed for situations in which there are time constraints on the therapy sessions. BCBT takes place over a couple of sessions that can last up to 12 accumulated hours by design. This technique was first implemented and developed on soldiers overseas in active duty by David M. Rudd to prevent suicide. Orientation Skill focus prevention Main article: Cognitive emotional behavioral therapy (CEBT) is a form of CBT developed initially for individuals with eating disorders but now used with a range of problems including , , (OCD), (PTSD) and anger problems. It combines aspects of CBT and and aims to improve understanding and tolerance of emotions in order to facilitate the therapeutic process. It is frequently used as a ""pretreatment"" to prepare and better equip individuals for longer-term therapy. Main article: Structured cognitive behavioral training (SCBT) is a cognitive-based process with core philosophies that draw heavily from CBT. Like CBT, SCBT asserts that behavior is inextricably related to beliefs, thoughts and emotions. SCBT also builds on core CBT philosophy by incorporating other well-known modalities in the fields of and : most notably, 's . SCBT differs from CBT in two distinct ways. First, SCBT is delivered in a highly regimented format. Second, SCBT is a predetermined and finite training process that becomes personalized by the input of the participant. SCBT is designed with the intention to bring a participant to a specific result in a specific period of time. SCBT has been used to challenge addictive behavior, particularly with substances such as tobacco, alcohol and food, and to manage and subdue stress and anxiety. SCBT has also been used in the field of in the effort to reduce recidivism. Moral reconation therapy, a type of CBT used to help felons overcome (ASPD), slightly decreases the risk of further offending. It is generally implemented in a group format because of the risk of offenders with ASPD being given one-on-one therapy reinforces narcissistic behavioral characteristics, and can be used in correctional or outpatient settings. Groups usually meet weekly for two to six months. This type of therapy uses a blend of cognitive, behavioral and some humanistic training techniques to target the stressors of the client. This usually is used to help clients better cope with their stress or anxiety after stressful events. This is a three-phase process that trains the client to use skills that they already have to better adapt to their current stressors. The first phase is an interview phase that includes psychological testing, client self-monitoring, and a variety of reading materials. This allows the therapist to individually tailor the training process to the client. Clients learn how to categorize problems into emotion-focused or problem-focused, so that they can better treat their negative situations. This phase ultimately prepares the client to eventually confront and reflect upon their current reactions to stressors, before looking at ways to change their reactions and emotions in relation to their stressors. The focus is conceptualization. The second phase emphasizes the aspect of skills acquisition and rehearsal that continues from the earlier phase of conceptualization. The client is taught skills that help them cope with their stressors. These skills are then practised in the space of therapy. These skills involve self-regulation, problem-solving, interpersonal communication skills, etc. The third and final phase is the application and following through of the skills learned in the training process. This gives the client opportunities to apply their learned skills to a wide range of stressors. Activities include role-playing, imagery, modeling, etc. In the end, the client will have been trained on a preventive basis to inoculate personal, chronic, and future stressors by breaking down their stressors into problems they will address in long-term, short-term, and intermediate coping goals. A newly developed group therapy model based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) integrates knitting into the therapeutical process and has been proven to yield reliable and promising results. The foundation for this novel approach to CBT is the frequently emphasized notion that therapy success depends on the embeddedness of the therapy method in the patients' natural routine. Similar to standard group-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, patients meet once a week in a group of 10 to 15 patients and knit together under the instruction of a trained psychologist or mental health professional. Central for the therapy is the patient's imaginative ability to assign each part of the wool to a certain thought. During the therapy, the wool is carefully knitted, creating a knitted piece of any form. This therapeutical process teaches the patient to meaningfully align thought, by (physically) creating a coherent knitted piece. Moreover, since CBT emphasizes the behavior as a result of cognition, the knitting illustrates how thoughts (which are tried to be imaginary tight to the wool) materialize into the reality surrounding us. Mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral hypnotherapy Mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral hypnotherapy (MCBH) is a form of CBT focusing on awareness in reflective approach with addressing of subconscious tendencies. It is more the process that contains basically three phases that are used for achieving wanted goals. The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) is a form of CBT, developed by and researchers at , that can be applied to a range of depression and anxiety disorders. The rationale is that anxiety and depression disorders often occur together due to common underlying causes and can efficiently be treated together. The UP has been shown to produce equivalent results to single-diagnosis protocols for specific disorders, such as and . Several studies have shown that the UP is easier to disseminate as compared to single-diagnosis protocols. See also: , and The research conducted for CBT has been a topic of sustained controversy. While some researchers write that CBT is more effective than other treatments, many other researchers and practitioners have questioned the validity of such claims. For example, one study determined CBT to be superior to other treatments in treating anxiety and depression. However, researchers responding directly to that study conducted a re-analysis and found no evidence of CBT being superior to other bona fide treatments, and conducted an analysis of thirteen other CBT clinical trials and determined that they failed to provide evidence of CBT superiority. In cases where CBT has been reported to be statistically better than other psychological interventions in terms of primary outcome measures, effect sizes were small and suggested that those differences were clinically meaningless and insignificant. Moreover, on secondary outcomes (i.e., measures of general functioning) no significant differences have been typically found between CBT and other treatments. A major criticism has been that clinical studies of CBT efficacy (or any psychotherapy) are not double-blind (i.e., either the subjects or the therapists in psychotherapy studies are not blind to the type of treatment). They may be single-blinded, i.e. the rater may not know the treatment the patient received, but neither the patients nor the therapists are blinded to the type of therapy given (two out of three of the persons involved in the trial, i.e., all of the persons involved in the treatment, are unblinded). The patient is an active participant in correcting negative distorted thoughts, thus quite aware of the treatment group they are in. The importance of double-blinding was shown in a meta-analysis that examined the effectiveness of CBT when placebo control and blindedness were factored in. Pooled data from published trials of CBT in , , and that used controls for non-specific effects of intervention were analyzed. This study concluded that CBT is no better than non-specific control interventions in the treatment of schizophrenia and does not reduce relapse rates; treatment effects are small in treatment studies of MDD, and it is not an effective treatment strategy for prevention of relapse in bipolar disorder. For MDD, the authors note that the pooled effect size was very low. Nevertheless, the methodological processes used to select the studies in the previously mentioned meta-analysis and the worth of its findings have been called into question. Additionally, a 2015 meta-analysis revealed that the positive effects of CBT on depression have been declining since 1977. The overall results showed two different declines in : 1) an overall decline between 1977 and 2014, and 2) a steeper decline between 1995 and 2014. Additional sub-analysis revealed that CBT studies where therapists in the test group were instructed to adhere to the Beck CBT manual had a steeper decline in effect sizes since 1977 than studies where therapists in the test group were instructed to use CBT without a manual. The authors reported that they were unsure why the effects were declining but did list inadequate therapist training, failure to adhere to a manual, lack of therapist experience, and patients' hope and faith in its efficacy waning as potential reasons. The authors did mention that the current study was limited to depressive disorders only. Furthermore, other researchers write that CBT studies have high drop-out rates compared to other treatments. CBT drop out rates were found to be 17% higher than other therapies in one meta-analysis. This high drop-out rate is also evident in the treatment of several disorders, particularly the , which is commonly treated with CBT. Those treated with CBT have a high chance of dropping out of therapy before completion and reverting to their anorexia behaviors. Other researchers conducting an analysis of treatments for youths who self-injure found similar drop-out rates in CBT and groups. In this study, the researchers analyzed several clinical trials that measured the efficacy of CBT administered to youths who self-injure. The researchers concluded that none of them were found to be efficacious. The methods employed in CBT research have not been the only criticisms; some individuals have called its theory and therapy into question. Slife and Williams write that one of the hidden assumptions in CBT is that of , or the absence of . They argue that CBT holds that external stimuli from the environment enter the mind, causing different thoughts that cause emotional states: nowhere in CBT theory is agency, or free will, accounted for. Another criticism of CBT theory, especially as applied to major depressive disorder (MDD), is that it confounds the symptoms of the disorder with its causes. CBT is generally regarded as having very few if any side effects. Calls have been made by some for more appraisal of possible side effects of CBT. Many randomized trials of psychological interventions like CBT do not monitor potential harms to the patient. In contrast, randomized trials of pharmacological interventions are much more likely to take adverse effects into consideration. However, a 2017 meta-analysis revealed that adverse events are not common in children receiving CBT and, furthermore, that CBT is associated with fewer dropouts than either placebo or medications. Nevertheless, CBT therapists do sometimes report 'unwanted events' and side effects in their outpatients with ""negative wellbeing/distress"" being the most frequent. The writer and group analyst Farhad Dalal questions the socio-political assumptions behind the introduction of CBT. According to one reviewer, Dalal connects the rise of CBT with ""the parallel rise of , with its focus on marketization, efficiency, quantification and "", and he questions the scientific basis of CBT, suggesting that ""the 'science' of psychological treatment is often less a scientific than a political contest"". In his book, Dalal also questions the ethical basis of CBT. The UK's announced in 2008 that more therapists would be trained to provide CBT at government expense as part of an initiative called (IAPT). The said that CBT would become the mainstay of treatment for non-severe depression, with medication used only in cases where CBT had failed. Therapists complained that the data does not fully support the attention and funding CBT receives. Psychotherapist and professor stated that this constitutes ""a coup, a power play by a community that has suddenly found itself on the brink of corralling an enormous amount of money ... Everyone has been seduced by CBT's apparent cheapness."" The issued a press release in 2012 saying that the IAPT's policies were undermining traditional psychotherapy and criticized proposals that would limit some approved therapies to CBT, claiming that they restricted patients to ""a watered down version of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), often delivered by very lightly trained staff"". The also recommends offering CBT to people suffering from schizophrenia, as well as those at risk of suffering from a psychotic episode. Hollon SD, Beck AT. Lambert MJ (ed.). .

Psychotherapy is a general term for treating mental health problems by talking with a psychiatrist, psychologist or other mental health provider. During psychotherapy, you learn about your condition and your moods, feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Psychotherapy helps you learn how to take control of your life and respond to challenging situations with healthy coping skills. There are many types of psychotherapy, each with its own approach. The type of psychotherapy that's right for you depends on your individual situation. Psychotherapy is also known as talk therapy, counseling, psychosocial therapy or, simply, therapy. Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Psychotherapy can be helpful in treating most mental health problems, including: such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), phobias, panic disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) such as depression or bipolar disorder such as alcoholism, drug dependence or compulsive gambling such as borderline personality disorder or dependent personality disorder or other disorders that cause detachment from reality (psychotic disorders) Not everyone who benefits from psychotherapy is diagnosed with a mental illness. Psychotherapy can help with a number of life's stresses and conflicts that can affect anyone. For example, it may help you: with your partner or someone else in your life due to work or other situations such as divorce, the death of a loved one or the loss of a job such as road rage or passive-aggressive behavior Come to terms with an ongoing or serious physical health problem, such as diabetes, cancer or long-term (chronic) pain or witnessing violence whether they're due to a physical or psychological cause if you have trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep (insomnia) In some cases, psychotherapy can be as effective as medications, such as antidepressants. However, depending on your specific situation, psychotherapy alone may not be enough to ease the symptoms of a mental health condition. You may also need medications or other treatments. Generally, there's little risk in having psychotherapy. But because it can explore painful feelings and experiences, you may feel emotionally uncomfortable at times. However, any risks are minimized by working with a skilled therapist who can match the type and intensity of therapy with your needs. The coping skills that you learn can help you manage and conquer negative feelings and fears. Get a referral from a doctor, health insurance plan, friend or other trusted source. Many employers offer counseling services or referrals through employee assistance programs (EAPs). Or you can find a therapist on your own, for instance, by looking for a professional association on the Internet. If you have health insurance, find out what coverage it offers for psychotherapy. Some health plans cover only a certain number of psychotherapy sessions a year. Also, talk to your therapist about fees and payment options. Before your first appointment, think about what issues you'd like to work on. While you also can sort this out with your therapist, having some sense in advance may provide a good starting point. Before seeing a psychotherapist, check his or her background, education, certification, and licensing. Psychotherapist is a general term rather than a job title or indication of education, training or licensure. Trained psychotherapists can have a number of different job titles, depending on their education and role. Most have a master's or doctoral degree with specific training in psychological counseling. Medical doctors who specialize in mental health (psychiatrists) can prescribe medications as well as provide psychotherapy. Examples of psychotherapists include psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed professional counselors, licensed social workers, licensed marriage and family therapists, psychiatric nurses, or other licensed professionals with mental health training. Make sure that the therapist you choose meets state certification and licensing requirements for his or her particular discipline. The key is to find a skilled therapist who can match the type and intensity of therapy with your needs. At the first psychotherapy session, the therapist typically gathers information about you and your needs. You may be asked to fill out forms about your current and past physical and emotional health. It might take a few sessions for your therapist to fully understand your situation and concerns and to determine the best approach or course of action. The first session is also an opportunity for you to interview your therapist to see if his or her approach and personality are going to work for you. Make sure you understand: Don't hesitate to ask questions anytime during your appointment. If you don't feel comfortable with the first psychotherapist you see, try someone else. Having a good fit with your therapist is critical for psychotherapy to be effective. You'll likely meet in your therapist's office or a clinic once a week or every other week for a session that lasts about 45 to 60 minutes. Psychotherapy, usually in a group session with a focus on safety and stabilization, also can take place in a hospital if you've been admitted for treatment. There are a number of effective types of psychotherapy. Some work better than others in treating certain disorders and conditions. In many cases, therapists use a combination of techniques. Your therapist will consider your particular situation and preferences to determine which approach may be best for you. Although many types of therapies exist, some psychotherapy techniques proven to be effective include: which helps you identify unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and replace them with healthy, positive ones a type of CBT that teaches behavioral skills to help you handle stress, manage your emotions and improve your relationships with others which helps you become aware of and accept your thoughts and feelings and commit to making changes, increasing your ability to cope with and adjust to situations which focus on increasing your awareness of unconscious thoughts and behaviors, developing new insights into your motivations, and resolving conflicts which focuses on addressing problems with your current relationships with other people to improve your interpersonal skills — how you relate to others, such as family, friends and colleagues which reinforces your ability to cope with stress and difficult situations Psychotherapy is offered in different formats, including individual, couple, family or group therapy sessions, and it can be effective for all age groups. For most types of psychotherapy, your therapist encourages you to talk about your thoughts and feelings and what's troubling you. Don't worry if you find it hard to open up about your feelings. Your therapist can help you gain more confidence and comfort as time goes on. Because psychotherapy sometimes involves intense emotional discussions, you may find yourself crying, upset or even having an angry outburst during a session. Some people may feel physically exhausted after a session. Your therapist is there to help you cope with such feelings and emotions. Your therapist may ask you to do ""homework"" — activities or practices that build on what you learn during your regular therapy sessions. Over time, discussing your concerns can help improve your mood, change the way you think and feel about yourself, and improve your ability to cope with problems. Except in rare and specific circumstances, conversations with your therapist are confidential. However, a therapist may break confidentiality if there is an immediate threat to safety (yours or someone else's) or when required by state or federal law to report concerns to authorities. Your therapist can answer questions about confidentiality. The number of psychotherapy sessions you need — as well as how frequently you need to see your therapist — depends on such factors as: How long you've had symptoms or have been dealing with your situation How much your mental health concerns interfere with day-to-day life How much support you receive from family members and others It may take only weeks to help you cope with a short-term situation. Or, treatment may last a year or longer if you have a long-term mental illness or other long-term concerns. Psychotherapy may not cure your condition or make an unpleasant situation go away. But it can give you the power to cope in a healthy way and to feel better about yourself and your life. Take steps to get the most out of your therapy and help make it a success. Make sure you feel comfortable with your therapist. If you don't, look for another therapist with whom you feel more at ease. Therapy is most effective when you're an active participant and share in decision-making. Make sure you and your therapist agree about the major issues and how to tackle them. Together, you can set goals and measure progress over time. Success depends on willingness to share your thoughts, feelings and experiences, and to consider new insights, ideas and ways of doing things. If you're reluctant to talk about certain issues because of painful emotions, embarrassment or fears about your therapist's reaction, let your therapist know. If you feel down or lack motivation, it may be tempting to skip psychotherapy sessions. Doing so can disrupt your progress. Try to attend all sessions and to give some thought to what you want to discuss. Working on emotional issues can be painful and may require hard work. You may need several sessions before you begin to see improvement. If your therapist asks you to document your thoughts in a journal or do other activities outside of your therapy sessions, follow through. These homework assignments can help you apply what you've learned in the therapy sessions to your life. If psychotherapy isn't helping, talk to your therapist. If you don't feel that you're benefiting from therapy after several sessions, talk to your therapist about it. You and your therapist may decide to make some changes or try a different approach that may be more effective. testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease.

View details for View details for Longitudinal changes in brain function associated with symptom improvement in youth with PTSD. Garrett, A., Cohen, J. A., Zack, S., Carrion, V., Jo, B., Blader, J., Rodriguez, A., Vanasse, T. J., Reiss, A. L., Agras, W. S. BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicate that youth with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have abnormal activation in brain regions important for emotion processing. It is unknown whether symptom improvement is accompanied by normative changes in these regions. This study identified neural changes associated with symptom improvement with the long-term goal of identifying malleable targets for interventions.METHODS: A total of 80 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were collected, including 20 adolescents with PTSD (ages 9-17) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects, each scanned before and after a 5-month period. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy was provided to the PTSD group to ensure improvement in symptoms. Whole brain voxel-wise activation and region of interest analyses of facial expression task data were conducted to identify abnormalities in the PTSD group versus HC at baseline (BL), and neural changes correlated with symptom improvement from BL to EOS of study (EOS).RESULTS: At BL, the PTSD group had abnormally elevated activation in the cingulate cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and medial frontal cortex compared to HC. From BL to EOS, PTSD symptoms improved an average of 39%. Longitudinal improvement in symptoms of PTSD was associated with decreasing activation in posterior cingulate, mid-cingulate, and hippocampus, while improvement in dissociative symptoms was correlated with decreasing activation in the amygdala.CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in emotion-processing brain networks in youth with PTSD normalize when symptoms improve, demonstrating neural plasticity of these regions in young patients and the importance of early intervention.

A mechanistic understanding of the pathology of psychiatric disorders has been hampered by extensive heterogeneity in biology, symptoms, and behavior within diagnostic categories that are defined subjectively. We investigated whether leveraging individual differences in information-processing impairments in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could reveal phenotypes within the disorder. We found that a subgroup of patients with PTSD from two independent cohorts displayed both aberrant functional connectivity within the ventral attention network (VAN) as revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neuroimaging and impaired verbal memory on a word list learning task. This combined phenotype was not associated with differences in symptoms or comorbidities, but nonetheless could be used to predict a poor response to psychotherapy, the best-validated treatment for PTSD. Using concurrent focal noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography, we then identified alterations in neural signal flow in the VAN that were evoked by direct stimulation of that network.

Exposure therapy is an effective treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but many patients do not respond. Brain functions governing treatment outcome are not well characterized. The authors examined brain systems relevant to emotional reactivity and regulation, constructs that are thought to be central to PTSD and exposure therapy effects, to identify the functional traits of individuals most likely to benefit from treatment.Individuals with PTSD underwent functional MRI (fMRI) while completing three tasks assessing emotional reactivity and regulation. Participants were then randomly assigned to immediate prolonged exposure treatment (N=36) or a waiting list condition (N=30). A random subset of the prolonged exposure group (N=17) underwent single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) concurrent with fMRI to examine whether predictive activation patterns reflect causal influence within circuits. Linear mixed-effects modeling in line with the intent-to-treat principle was used to examine how baseline brain function moderated the effect of treatment on PTSD symptoms.At baseline, individuals with larger treatment-related symptom reductions (compared with the waiting list condition) demonstrated 1) greater dorsal prefrontal activation and 2) less left amygdala activation, both during emotion reactivity; 3) better inhibition of the left amygdala induced by single TMS pulses to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; and 4) greater ventromedial prefrontal/ventral striatal activation during emotional conflict regulation. Reappraisal-related activation was not a significant moderator of the treatment effect.Capacity to benefit from prolonged exposure in PTSD is gated by the degree to which prefrontal resources are spontaneously engaged when superficially processing threat and adaptively mitigating emotional interference, but not when deliberately reducing negative emotionality. Selective Effects of Psychotherapy on Frontopolar Cortical Function in PTSD. Fonzo, G. A., Goodkind, M. S., Oathes, D. J., Zaiko, Y. V., Harvey, M., Peng, K. K., Weiss, M. E., Thompson, A.

Exposure therapy is an effective treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but a comprehensive, emotion-focused perspective on how psychotherapy affects brain function is lacking. The authors assessed changes in brain function after prolonged exposure therapy across three emotional reactivity and regulation paradigms.Individuals with PTSD underwent functional MRI (fMRI) at rest and while completing three tasks assessing emotional reactivity and regulation. Individuals were then randomly assigned to immediate prolonged exposure treatment (N=36) or a waiting list condition (N=30) and underwent a second scan approximately 4 weeks after the last treatment session or a comparable waiting period, respectively.Treatment-specific changes were observed only during cognitive reappraisal of negative images. Psychotherapy increased lateral frontopolar cortex activity and connectivity with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/ventral striatum. Greater increases in frontopolar activation were associated with improvement in hyperarousal symptoms and psychological well-being. The frontopolar cortex also displayed a greater variety of temporal resting-state signal pattern changes after treatment. Concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and fMRI in healthy participants demonstrated that the lateral frontopolar cortex exerts downstream influence on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/ventral striatum.Changes in frontopolar function during deliberate regulation of negative affect is one key mechanism of adaptive psychotherapeutic change in PTSD. Given that frontopolar connectivity with ventromedial regions during emotion regulation is enhanced by psychotherapy and that the frontopolar cortex exerts downstream influence on ventromedial regions in healthy individuals, these findings inform a novel conceptualization of how psychotherapy works, and they identify a promising target for stimulation-based therapeutics. Brain Mechanisms and Predictors of Response to Prolonged Exposure Therapy in PTSD Fonzo, G., Goodkind, M., Oathes, D., Zaiko, Y., Harvey, M., Peng, K., Weiss, E., Mills-Finnerty, C., Thompson, A., Zack, S., Lindley, S., Arnow, B., Jo, B., Gross, J., Rothbaum, B., Etkin, A.

R., Pate, G. A. The role of the alliance in predicting treatment outcome is robust and long established. However, much less attention has been paid to mechanisms of change, including moderators, particularly for youth. This study examined the moderating role of pretreatment adolescent-caregiver attachment and its impact on the working alliance-treatment outcome relationship. One hundred adolescents and young adults with primary substance dependence disorders were treated at a residential facility, with a cognitive-behavioral emphasis. The working alliance and clinical symptoms were measured at regular intervals throughout treatment. A moderator hypothesis was tested using a path analytic approach. Findings suggested that attachment to the primary caregiver moderated the impact of the working alliance on treatment outcome, such that for youth with the poorest attachment history, working alliance had a stronger relationship with outcome. Conversely, for those with the strongest attachment histories, alliance was not a significant predictor of symptom reduction. This finding may help elucidate alliance-related mechanisms of change, lending support for theories of corrective emotional experience as one function of the working alliance in youth psychotherapy.

This paper presents the findings of a psychotherapy process study conducted within the Pennsylvania Psychological Association Practice Research Network (PPA-PRN). The investigation was the product of a long-term collaborative effort, both in terms of the study design and implementation, between experienced clinicians of various theoretical orientations and full-time psychotherapy researchers. Based on a relatively large sample of clients seen in independent practice settings, close to 1,500 therapeutic events (described by clients and therapists as being particularly helpful or hindering) were collected. These events were coded by three independent observers using a therapy content analysis system. Among the findings, both clients and therapists perceived the fostering of self-awareness as being particularly helpful. The results also point to the importance of paying careful attention to the therapeutic alliance and other significant interpersonal relationships. The merits and difficulties of conducting scientifically rigorous and clinically relevant studies in naturalistic contexts are also discussed.

A., Zack, S., Carrion, V., Jo, B., Blader, J., Rodriguez, A., Vanasse, T. J., Reiss, A. L., Agras, W. S. BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicate that youth with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have abnormal activation in brain regions important for emotion processing. It is unknown whether symptom improvement is accompanied by normative changes in these regions. This study identified neural changes associated with symptom improvement with the long-term goal of identifying malleable targets for interventions.METHODS: A total of 80 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were collected, including 20 adolescents with PTSD (ages 9-17) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects, each scanned before and after a 5-month period. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy was provided to the PTSD group to ensure improvement in symptoms. Whole brain voxel-wise activation and region of interest analyses of facial expression task data were conducted to identify abnormalities in the PTSD group versus HC at baseline (BL), and neural changes correlated with symptom improvement from BL to EOS of study (EOS).RESULTS: At BL, the PTSD group had abnormally elevated activation in the cingulate cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and medial frontal cortex compared to HC. From BL to EOS, PTSD symptoms improved an average of 39%. Longitudinal improvement in symptoms of PTSD was associated with decreasing activation in posterior cingulate, mid-cingulate, and hippocampus, while improvement in dissociative symptoms was correlated with decreasing activation in the amygdala.CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in emotion-processing brain networks in youth with PTSD normalize when symptoms improve, demonstrating neural plasticity of these regions in young patients and the importance of early intervention. Using fMRI connectivity to define a treatment-resistant form of post-traumatic stress disorder. Etkin, A., Maron-Katz, A., Wu, W., Fonzo, G. A., Huemer, J., Vertes, P.

A mechanistic understanding of the pathology of psychiatric disorders has been hampered by extensive heterogeneity in biology, symptoms, and behavior within diagnostic categories that are defined subjectively. We investigated whether leveraging individual differences in information-processing impairments in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could reveal phenotypes within the disorder. We found that a subgroup of patients with PTSD from two independent cohorts displayed both aberrant functional connectivity within the ventral attention network (VAN) as revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neuroimaging and impaired verbal memory on a word list learning task. This combined phenotype was not associated with differences in symptoms or comorbidities, but nonetheless could be used to predict a poor response to psychotherapy, the best-validated treatment for PTSD. Using concurrent focal noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography, we then identified alterations in neural signal flow in the VAN that were evoked by direct stimulation of that network. These alterations were associated with individual differences in functional fMRI connectivity within the VAN. Our findings define specific neurobiological mechanisms in a subgroup of patients with PTSD that could contribute to the poor response to psychotherapy.

View All Centers & Departments The mission of the Group Psychotherapy Center at Massachusetts General Hospital is to promote the development of psychotherapy groups to meet the needs of the hospital community. ,   Group psychotherapy is a form of therapy in which a small number of people meet under the leadership of a trained therapist, generally once a week. The members of the group work to help themselves and one another. In group therapy people learn about themselves and improve their interpersonal relationships. All of our therapy groups are led by mental health professionals. Members share feelings of isolation, depression, low self-esteem or anxiety. They also share their progress and solutions to problems. Group therapy helps people make significant changes, so they feel better about the quality of their lives. Special interest groups (bulimia nervosa, medical illness, OCD) In addition to providing clinical care, the Group Psychotherapy Center trains residents and psychology interns in the theory and practice of group psychotherapy. Trainees learn from distinguished faculty who teach nationally and internationally. If you are interested in a group, please call the Psychiatry Access Line at 617-724-7792 and express your interest in the group program. You will be scheduled for an intake with one of our psychologists who will help assign you to an appropriate group. You must have a primary care provider or psychiatrist at Mass General in order to participate in the group program. General Psychodynamic/Interpersonal Process Groups Psychodynamic/Interpersonal groups are unstructured and process-oriented. They are useful for individuals looking to talk about difficult life experiences and feelings in a safe and confidential environment and to get support from others. These groups also act as a microcosm of the larger world and are a place where members can try out new, more functional ways of interacting with others and get feedback about how other people view them interpersonally. Groups generally consist of a maximum of eight people who have made a commitment to the group for at least six months. New members can join at any time if space allows. There are currently five psychodynamic groups offered at Mass General. Mondays 10–11 am and 4–5 pm, Tuesdays 5–6 pm, Fridays 1–2 pm This 12-week skills-based outpatient therapy group is ideal for women and men aged 18 and older who are seeking to learn new skills to cope with anxiety and have a PCP at Mass General. The group will be appropriate for individuals who are diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder or a specific phobia. The group is not designed to address symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder or personality disorders. The group is also not designed to offer adequate support for patients with a co-morbid major depressive disorder or recent hospitalization unless your mood is stable and you are actively involved in individual psychotherapy for these other issues. This group may not be appropriate to provide adequate support for patients with co-morbid ADHD and learning disabilities or active substance use disorder issues. The group consists of two six-week modules. The first module is designed to provide psychoeducation and cognitive techniques to manage anxiety. The second module is designed to focus on behavioral change strategies that will include opportunities to practice relaxation techniques and exposure to feared situations. Patients can enter the group at the beginning of either module and are expected to continue until they have completed both modules. All potential patients will need to undergo an evaluation with the group leader to assess the fit between the patient’s needs and the goals of the group. Tuesdays, 5:30–6:45 pm Not running currently, contact us to learn more Structured skills-based therapy designed specifically for patients with borderline personality disorder. Group requirements include weekly individual psychotherapy and a clear ongoing commitment to consistent attendance. Mondays, 12:00–1:45 pm and 2:30–4:14 pm; Wednesday 11:00 am–12:45 pm Structured skills-based therapy designed specifically for patients with borderline personality disorder who have completed previous skills training. This group is designed to assist members in their utilization and generalization of DBT skills and principles. Group requirements include individual psychotherapy and a clear ongoing commitment to practicing skills. This is an 18-week skills-based group derived from DBT for adults who are interested in learning state-of-the-art coping strategies when confronted with difficult emotions. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Bingeing and Purging This 12-week skills-based group is appropriate for adults 18 and older looking for therapist and peer support in reducing bingeing and purging behaviors. Key components include marshaling motivation for change, identifying binge triggers, enhancing body image and preventing relapse. This is a time-limited group as a 12-week session. Please contact the at 617-726-8470 to inquire about availability and schedule an intake appointment for this group. This group is an open-ended, mixed adult group for individuals struggling with persistent medical and pain problems. Participants in this group have made a commitment to therapeutically address such issues as acceptance, communication and coping related to their medical condition and symptoms. The group offers a balance of interpersonal learning and support along with an opportunity for acquiring personally meaningful coping strategies. Aging confronts us with challenges to our bodies, our minds, our hearts and our spirits. Members of this group will work with the co-leaders to face these issues and seek the opportunities for therapeutic change and growth present, not in spite of these challenges, but because of them. OCD Spectrum Disorders Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Maintenance Group This ongoing, rolling-admission group is appropriate for people who have already had successful individual cognitive behavioral therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder, trichotillomania or compulsive skin picking (meaning symptoms may still exist but are mild). Group members are encouraged to use their skills to maintain their progress as they transition out of individual therapy. You will receive support from other members to achieve this goal and aid each other in completing exposures during group sessions. Skills covered will include: behavioral activation and scheduling, decreasing procrastination, increasing attention to sleep, nutrition, exercise, medication compliance, mindfulness, cognitive restructuring, increasing social supports and decreasing social isolation. A time-limited one-year group that is run in two phases. The first ten weeks will consist of the Stress Management and Resiliency Training Program (SMART) a multi-modal mind body medicine group developed at the at Massachusetts General Hospital. During the second phase, members will be expected to begin a daily mindfulness practice and the group will run as a general process group. A semi-structured group for women in their late 20s to late 60s to improve self-esteem, effective self-assertion and self-compassion. Group includes teaching (introduction of information and concepts), experiential exercises and open discussion. Minimum commitment for this group is 16 weeks. Content will not repeat, so longer-term participation is encouraged. Those who might never have thought of joining a group are especially welcome. An individual therapist is not required. This may be a useful next step for those completing individual therapy, but is also appropriate for those who have never been in psychotherapy. Examples of issues confronted in this group include: care-taking or other role strain, stress-exacerbated physical or mental illness, mild to moderate depression, mild to moderate anxiety, self-criticism, indecision, loneliness, difficult or unfulfilling relationships, life or role changes. This group is not currently running. Please check back for updates.

This study examined the association between the therapeutic alliance and behavioral/emotional outcomes in 350 youth receiving outpatient therapy at a community mental health clinic. Constructs of interest were measured at intake, 3 week, 2 month, 4 month and 6 month intervals. Results indicated that early therapeutic alliance ratings were not related to premature termination. Problem type was related to the formation of the alliance only at the three week time point. A relationship between age of the client and the formation of a therapeutic alliance was true only at the 6 month time point. Finally, therapist’s ratings of the alliance were not correlated with psychotherapy outcome. These findings indicate that further work is needed to understand associations between therapeutic alliance and youth treatment outcomes. Therapeutic alliance; Youth ; Community mental health services The therapeutic alliance in psychotherapy has been an area of interest for clinicians and researchers for decades [-]. Most studies of the alliance between child and adolescent clients and their therapists indicate the same trend in relation to outcomes as that which has been found in the adult realm [-]. Although the overall importance of the therapeutic alliance is supported by clinical and empirical evidence, more work is needed to understand the circumstances under which therapeutic alliance is most important, the populations in which it is most influential, and the mechanisms through which it impacts therapy outcomes. For example, it is unclear at what point during the course of therapy alliance is most predictive of outcomes [,]. Similarly, many studies of therapeutic alliance are limited by the use of measures and methods assessing alliance or outcome that lack sensitivity to change or do not facilitate analysis of the alliance over time []. Although there are preliminary indications to support the notion, research has not yet been able to establish whether a poor therapeutic alliance is related to early termination or “dropout” from therapy [,,,]. Furthermore, there is a limited understanding of what factors contribute to the development, or lack of development, of a positive therapeutic bond [-,]. Moreover, the great majority of studies of therapeutic alliance have been conducted with populations, calling into question the applicability of findings to child and adolescent populations []. Finally, with regard to child therapy, there is little understanding as to whether child, parent and therapist ratings of the alliance have equal predictive value [,]. One of the most frequently studied common factors in psychotherapy is the therapeutic alliance. While there are varying definitions for the therapeutic alliance, the affective quality shared between the therapist and the client is a central component []. The most pressing reason the therapeutic alliance has received so much attention is that is has consistently demonstrated to be an influential factor in the outcome of adult treatment, and the growing body of evidence for child and adolescent treatment provides similar evidence [,,]. The construct of the therapeutic alliance as it relates to child therapy carries all of the considerations of concern with adults, and adds a few more which are specific to children. Child therapy is complicated by the fact that children and adolescents are often brought to treatment against their will which changes the dynamic of the therapeutic process from the beginning of treatment [,]. Another distinctive challenge of child therapists is the task of building an alliance with both the parent and the child [,]. Therapeutic alliance and outcomes in child and adolescent psychotherapy A 2006 meta-analysis indicated that there have only been 23 studies examining the therapeutic alliance in psychotherapy with children, as opposed to over 2000 adult studies as of 2000 []. In examining the studies that examined the therapeutic alliance, a correlation of .24 was found between the quality of the child-therapist alliance and therapy outcome [,]. Similar results (.22 alliance–outcome association) were observed in a more recent meta-analysis []. Although these results suggest that the variance in treatment outcomes accounted for by the therapeutic alliance is comparable for adult and child/ adolescent , it is unclear to what extent adult research on the therapeutic alliance is generalizable to child and adolescent psychotherapy []. Based on 9 of the 23 studies in a 2003 review, the alliance was a stronger predictor of outcome for children who had externalizing problems compared to those who had internalizing problems []. This could be because the externalizing behavior treatments are more effective, or that there is a systematic difference in children with externalizing behaviors and how they relate to the therapist []. Further support for this was provided by Kaufman et al. [] who found that higher alliance ratings of depressed adolescents did not indicate better outcomes. In contrast, Bickman et al. [] found that children in their study with more aggressive behavior patterns reported lower alliance ratings and poorer outcomes. A study examining alliance formation in children who had been previously abused indicated that severity of interpersonal problems was the best predictor of poorer outcomes in the children they examined []. Because of the importance of the development of the alliance and outcomes it has been recommended that this area of research be continued [,,]. In child research only preliminary data are currently available regarding the consistency of therapeutic alliance ratings. At this time, there is support for the notion that the child alliance ratings remain stable once established and do not fluctuate during the course of treatment. In a literature review of the few studies on the alliance with children, it was suggested that overall the quality of the alliance from the child’s perspective does not change significantly over time []. Other researchers have also supported the notion that there is consistency in the child’s ratings of the alliance over time [,]. Some attention in the literature has been directed at the question of the influence of age in developing an alliance with children and adolescents. Several authors have noted the inherent difficulty in working with adolescent clients due to developmental needs for autonomy [,,]. Many therapists report feeling intimidated by teenage clients, which can also hinder the development of a positive therapeutic alliance []. It has been reported that many adolescents begin therapy in the pre-contemplative stage, making it all the more important for the therapist to quickly develop a positive relationship in order to maintain engagement []. In spite of these findings, metaanalytic reviews suggest that thus far there is no consistent relationship between the age of the child and the alliance-outcome relationship [,]. Given the lack of uniformity with regard to the alliance and outcome measures in the studies included in the analyses, it may be that underlying relationships have been obscured by divergent evaluations of the constructs of interest. Some studies have examined whether alliance and child outcome can be better predicted by including multiple rater’s view of the relationship. One study has given preliminary support for the association of a better parent-therapist relationship leading to improvements in child therapeutic outcome []. Further, it assumed that the therapeutic alliance may influence the extent to which parenting practices improve []. While much more investigation is needed to clarify this point, Kazdin et al. [] emphasized the importance of evaluating more than one perspective when assessing alliance ratings and outcome in child therapy. Because multiple parties are influential in the child therapeutic process, some have focused on whose ratings of the alliance are the most predictive. Parents, children and therapists have all been identified as believing that the alliance is important to outcome, yet it is still unknown if child ratings, therapist ratings or parent ratings are more predictive of outcome for child and adolescent therapy []. Based on the few studies that have compared different raters, it seems that different informants of child functioning show only modest agreement [,]. With regard to therapist ratings of the alliance, so far there is minimal support for their predictive value of outcome [,]. With regard to parent ratings of the alliance there is preliminary support for the importance of positive parent ratings of the therapist in therapy retention (i.e. family participation, dropouts, cancellations) whereas youth alliance ratings were not associated with retention []. This finding is intuitive given that the parent plays the primary role in the child receiving mental health services, and this may play a factor in the relatively high attrition rates observed in child therapy []. While parents generally maintain the primary responsibility for continuation in therapy, the youth has an important role in engaging in the therapeutic process in a meaningful manner and the alliance can be a major factor in promoting treatment compliance from a child []. A few studies have indicated that those children who rated the alliance as stronger exhibited greater therapeutic change [,]. In summary, the limited available research on the therapeutic alliance in child and adolescent psychotherapy suggest that youth– therapist and parent–therapist alliances may be associated with therapy maintenance and symptom improvement. Although many other areas of research still need attention, the alliance should not be disregarded as an important contributor to the of child therapy processes. First, it was hypothesized that those adolescent participants who reported low alliance ratings at the 3 week data collection point would be more likely to prematurely terminate from therapy and/or exhibit no reliable change. Second, it was hypothesized that participants with externalizing problems would have lower alliance ratings as compared to those participants with internalizing problems. Third, it was hypothesized that therapists would report lower ratings of the therapeutic alliance for adolescents as opposed to children. Fourth, it was hypothesized that the adolescent participant’s ratings of the alliance would have the highest correlation to outcome as compared to the therapist’s ratings of the alliance. Participants were recruited as part of a broader study on youth psychotherapy outcomes. Three hundred fifty participants were recruited in order to meet requirements for data analysis. Eleven participants were excluded because their was medication management only. The remaining participating youth in the study were 143 females (44%) and 196 males (56%). Their ages ranged from 4 to17 years old with a mean age of 11.38 years old. Participating youth’s parents reported the following ethnicity characteristics: 255 (75.2%) participants identified themselves as White, 55 (16.2%) as Hispanic, 19 (5.6%) as Black, 2 (.59%) as Asian, 1 (.03%) as Native American, 1 (.03%) as Pacific Islander and the 6 (1.8%) remaining participants identified themselves as “Other”. All participants who completed measures were able to speak, read and write in English. The average income for participants who disclosed this information (N=209) was $948 per month. Participants received a variety of clinician-assigned primary diagnoses with the most frequent being Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (n=97, 28.6%), Oppositional Defiant Disorder (n=27, 7.9%), Depressive Disorder NOS (n=19, 5.6%), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (n=15, 4.4%) and Adjustment Disorder (n=15, 4.4%). Two-hundred twenty nine (67.6%) participants had a co-morbid diagnosis. The therapists reported representing disciplines including social work, social services workers, licensed professional counselors and . Twelve therapists indicated they were masters level clinicians (60%), 3 indicated they did not hold masters degrees (15%), and 5 (25%) therapists indicated they held no bachelors/associate degrees. The Youth Outcome Questionnaire 2.01 (Y-OQ-2.1) and Youth Outcome Questionnaire Self –Report (Y-OQ-SR) were used over the course of treatment as measures of psychosocial distress for participating children and adolescents, aged 4-17 years old, receiving mental health services []. The Y-OQ-2.1 is an outcome measure intended to track changes during the course of psychotherapy and was constructed to be sensitive to change over short periods of time, be brief, and maintain validity and reliability at a high level []. Based on clinical and non-treatment community norms, a cutoff score of 46 on the Y-OQ distinguishes individuals in treatment from non-treated individuals in the normal population. A Reliable Change Index (RCI) score of 13 points has been calculated for the Y-OQ, which is used to judge whether changes exhibited by individuals during treatment are reliable []. The Therapeutic Alliance Scale for Children-revised (TASC-r) was used as a measure of therapeutic alliance across treatment. The TASC is a 12-item, 4-point Likert-type scale completed by the adolescent participant aged 12-18, and there is a parallel version for the therapist to complete. Each item is rated on a 4 point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The total score equals the ratings of the 12 items on the scale. The TASC is unique among alliance measures in that it was designed specifically for use with youth and assesses both positive and negative qualities of the relationship. The TASC has demonstrated adequate internal consistency reliability (a=.72 to .74) in previous investigations []. A brief description of the study was given to the parent or guardian of the child, by the clinic case worker, during their initial phone call for scheduling of the intake session. The parent or guardians were approached by trained research assistants during the standard clinic intake session. During the description of the study the potential participants were informed that they would be financially compensated for their participation in this study: for the first set of questionnaires completed they received $10 in gift certificates and the opportunity to choose a gift from a “grab bag” consisting of small prizes, gift certificates, or coupons. In addition, a light lunch was provided to the participants during data collection. The potential participants were notified that if they chose to participate, they would be approached again at 3 weeks, 2 months, 4 months and 6 months after intake, to complete the same packet of questionnaires. They were also notified that if they chose to participate in the subsequent data collections they will be compensated with $5 and a choice from the “grab bag” for each packet of questionnaires. The response rate for participation among families recruited at intake was above 60%. Only participating children aged 12 years old and older completed the self-report version of the Y-OQ and TASC and therapists for all clients completed their version of the TASC. Given that one goal of this study was to examine the therapeutic alliance ratings and premature termination, the logistic examined whether early alliance ratings, from the 3-week data collection point, were a significant predictor of premature termination from therapy. Two sets of analyses were conducted using different operationalizations of premature termination. For the first set of analyses, premature termination was operationalized as the client having discontinued treatment before reliable symptom change was observed. In the second set of analyses, premature termination was based on a subjective clinician judgment as to whether the client had dropped out of treatment prematurely. For the first set of analyses, reliable symptom change was assessed using the Reliable Change Index (RCI) criteria developed by Jacobson and Truax []. Evaluation of change was based on the clients’ Y-OQ scores, and the developers of the scale have calculated the RCI value of the Y-OQ as 13 points []. A cutoff score was used to determine whether the client’s distress level was representative of an individual in the clinical population versus the community normal range. The cutoff score assigned participants to one of four categories: Recovered (reliable change, and below cut off score), Improved (reliable change only), Unchanged (criteria for reliable change not met) or Deteriorated (reliably worse) []. Premature terminators from therapy were defined as individuals who discontinued treatment and met criteria for the Unchanged or Deteriorated groups. The client’s scores were examined at their final Y-OQ provided, meaning either the last one taken before premature termination or at the final data collection point. For the second set of analyses on premature termination, therapist judgment of premature termination was obtained from archival discharge data. As part of routine clinic procedures when a case is closed, the primary clinician is asked to provide a judgment as to whether the client discontinued treatment prematurely. This dichotomous judgment was used as the dependent variable in a logistic regression. The definitions of premature termination are varied in the literature. Many previous investigators have chosen criteria for premature termination that are not founded in the progression of the client throughout the therapeutic process. Rather, these studies base “completion” of therapy on more arbitrary definitions such as therapist opinion of whether termination was “timely” or “advised” [,]. Another means by which premature termination has been often defined is a preset number of sessions required, without consideration of the particular client’s needs or progression throughout the therapeutic process []. Given that it is possible that clients achieve adequate symptom relief after a varied number of sessions, it seems reasonable to seek a more empirical definition of premature termination from therapy. In the current study premature termination was defined by criteria rooted in both pragmatic and empirical methods. Defining premature termination in the manner utilized in this study, based on both clinician judgment and self-reported symptom reduction, is advantageous as it allows for a more individualized and specific appraisal of where each client was when they discontinued treatment. The second question addressed in this study was whether children with externalizing problems had lower alliance ratings as compared to those with internalizing problems. Behavior type was classified by examining the six domains of the Y-OQ to determine the level of internalizing or externalizing for participants who had contributed at the respective time points. Each participant’s responses to the Y-OQ provided internalizing and externalizing subscale scores. Both of these scores for each participant were utilized in the analysis to avoid an arbitrary split into two separate groups given that there was a high level of comorbidity in diagnoses in this sample. The between problem type and alliance formation was examined, at each data collection time point, using a multiple regression statistical technique to determine if either internalizing or externalizing had an influence on ratings of the alliance. The third question addressed in this study was whether therapists reported lower alliance ratings for teenage participants (12 years old and older) as opposed to child participants (under 12 years old.) Dividing the participants in this manner allowed for comparisons between two different age groups within the youth sample as therapists may have differing approaches to alliance formation with them. The therapist’s ratings of the alliance were examined at each of the data collection points for differences between groups. This comparison was also conducted by using a multiple regression statistical technique. Finally, this study examined the hypothesis that the adolescent participants’ ratings had the highest correlation to psychotherapy outcome as compared to the therapists’ ratings. A correlation of the child and therapists’ ratings of the alliance and outcome change scores was examined to assess for differences between the two raters. includes means and standard deviations of intake Y-OQ scores from the youth and parents, and alliance ratings from youth and therapists. Intake Y-OQ and Y-OQ-SR scores are comparable to those found at intake in previous investigations [,]. Based on the YOQ RCI value of 13, 16% of cases showed significant worsening of symptoms (deteriorated) and 31% of cases showed no reliable change in symptoms (unchanged); these were classified in the premature termination category for the first set of premature termination analyses. Of the 194 cases for which discharge data were available, 89 cases (46%) were judged by the primary therapist to have discontinued treatment prematurely. Means, Standard Deviations, and Sample Sizes for Outcome and Alliance Measures. provides the prediction of premature termination from therapy given the client and therapist’s ratings of the therapeutic alliance from the 3 week data collection point. Premature termination from therapy, as defined by symptom reduction (client discontinued treatment before reliable change was observed), was not predicted by client alliance ratings from the 3 week data collection point (p=.363), nor by therapist ratings (p=.640). Premature termination from therapy, as defined by therapist judgment, was not predicted by client alliance ratings from the 3 week data collection point (p=.641) nor did the therapist ratings (p=.176), these findings do not support the hypothesis that client or therapist early alliance ratings would be predictive of premature termination from therapy. Logistic regression predictors for premature termination. The influence of client’s primary behavior problem type (internalizing versus externalizing) on the therapeutic alliance, as reported by the participant, was examined by means of a multiple regression statistical technique. Analyses were conducted separately for each data collection time point and internalizing and externalizing scores for the participants who had contributed data at the respective time points were entered together. Using the Enter method, a significant model emerged for client behavior predicting ratings of the therapeutic alliance at the 3 week data collection point (F=5.538, p=.008. Adjusted R square=.206) indicating that externalizing behavior was significantly negatively associated with alliance (ß=-.647, p=.005). Client’s behavior type did not have a significant influence on their ratings of the alliance at the 2 month (F=1.031, p=.371), 4 month (F=.560, p=.581), or 6 month data collection points (F=.675, p=.524). The third hypothesis was that therapists would report lower ratings of the therapeutic alliance for adolescents than for children. The association of client’s age category, teenage or child, with the therapeutic alliance was examined by means of a multiple regression statistical technique for the participants who had contributed measures at each respective time point. Using the Enter method, a significant model emerged for client age and therapist’s ratings of the therapeutic alliance at the 6 month data collection point (F= 4.232, p=.048; Adjusted R square=.089) indicating that the therapists rated their relationships with youth under 13 years old more favorably than youth over 13 years old (ß=-.342, p=.048). Client age was not associated with therapist’s ratings of the alliance at the 3 week (F=.135, p=.714), 2 month (F=.156, p=.694) or 4 month data collection points (F=.250, p=.619). The fourth hypothesis was that participant ratings of the alliance would be more significantly correlated with the overall change in symptoms, as measured by a Y-OQ total change score, than the therapist’s ratings. The Y-OQ total change score was the difference between Y-OQ at intake and the final Y-OQ available for each participant. There was no significant correlation of therapist alliance ratings at 3 weeks and children’s (age < 13) Y-OQ total change score (201)=-.08, =.453. There was also no significant correlation of the therapist alliance ratings at 3 weeks and the youth (age ≥ 13) Y-OQ change score (43)=-.116, =.453. Finally, there was no significant correlation of the youth alliance ratings at 3 weeks and their Y-OQ change score (49)=-.203, =.156. In examining the range of therapeutic alliance scores obtained in this study it became apparent that there was not extensive variability in the ratings on the TASC. Low variability in the scores measuring the alliance is problematic when trying to discern a potential relationship between the alliance and psychotherapy outcomes as correlations become more difficult to find. It is possible that if there was not a restricted range in scores of the alliance that the associations examined in this study would be more pronounced. Consequently, interpretation of results should be made in the context of the limited variability observed in therapeutic alliance scores. Contrary to the first hypothesis in this study, early therapeutic alliance ratings did not predict premature termination from therapy. Although there is support in the literature for the notion that there is a predictive relationship between early alliance ratings and completion of treatment in the adult realm [,] preliminary findings with youth are inconsistent [,,,]. Some child and adolescent therapy studies have cited difficulty in establishing early alliance as a predictor of premature termination [,]. One potential reason for the lack of a significant relationship between early alliance and premature termination in youth could be that children and adolescents may differ in the manner in which they develop the therapeutic alliance compared to adults. Youth may take longer to form a bond with their therapist and therefore early alliance may not be the most telling predictor of participation in therapy []. Other unique aspects of youth treatment may also explain why early alliance between the youth and therapist was not related to premature termination in this study and in some previous research. For example, given that youth rarely refer themselves for treatment, a strong alliance between the parent and the child’s therapist may prolong treatment even if the child–therapist alliance is poor. Similarly, if the parent feels dissatisfied with the therapist, the parent may discontinue treatment even if the child–therapist alliance was strong [,]. In addition, parental commitment to therapy, finances and family dynamics are some of the many added contributors to the therapeutic process with youth [,,,]. Factors such as these may have had a greater influence on participation in therapy in this study than early alliance did. Clients may have left early from therapy for a variety of reasons, or may have continued participation in spite of a poor alliance. With regard to the finding that externalizing clients rated the alliance lower than internalizing clients at the 3 week time point, there is some support for this finding in previous research [,,]. At such an early point in the therapeutic process the externalizing clients may have had difficulty establishing a trusting bond with their therapist but eventually came to develop a relationship similar to the internalizing clients at the later time points. One reason for this finding may be the difficulty that therapists express in establishing relationships with youth who have externalizing problems [,,,]. For example, Eltz et al. [] found that children and adolescents with interpersonal issues had more difficulty forming positive relationships with their treatment providers than youth without interpersonal issues. Although age was hypothesized to predict alliance ratings, in this study the association was only observed at one time point. The lack of association is not surprising given the tentative nature of the relationship between age and alliance development in the literature [,]. In an important meta-analysis Shirk and Karver [] identified only 23 published studies and dissertations addressing the therapeutic alliance with youth. Although meta-analyses have found a similar effect size for alliance in youth psychotherapy as compared to the adult literature [,], client age has not been a reliable moderator in alliance– outcome associations. Given that many of the studies included in the meta-analyses were complicated by shortfalls in methodology, measures used, and lack real world representation, the role of age in alliance ratings and outcome requires further study. Contrary to hypothesis, neither therapist alliance ratings nor youth alliance ratings significantly predicted change in parent-report or self-report of youth symptoms. The lack of an observed relationship between alliance and symptom change was unexpected given that several prior studies have found alliance to be influential on treatment outcomes in varying degrees [,,,-]. The therapeutic alliance has been consistently established as an influential factor in the adult therapy realm and some research supports the alliance as the factor most predictive of outcome [,,,]; however, this relationship has not been consistently demonstrated in child and adolescent studies [,-]. The variability in the findings may be due to the additional factors which influence child and adolescent psychotherapy specifically. For example, children are often compelled to attend treatment by their caregivers, therapy with youth often involves the client as well as the parents or the entire family, and children may form relationships in a different manner than adults [,]. It is therefore unclear to what degree we can expect to find parallel results across adult and youth research on the therapeutic alliance [,]. Another possible explanation for the findings in this study was that the sample was comprised of patients from an outpatient community mental health center. Historically, research on child and adolescent therapy has been conducted in university-based research clinics through controlled trials [-]. Many researchers and practicing clinicians have raised concerns about the lack of external validity of clinical trial studies due to important differences in how therapy is conducted in research settings compared to treatment provided in usual-care settings [,,,]. Consequently, it is unknown how well results of therapeutic alliance studies conducted in usual-care settings may compare to results obtained under more highly controlled conditions. Future research in this realm should expand upon the work which has been conducted in community mental health centers as this is a more generalizable population than controlled studies. The present study had several strengths that warrant emphasis. One useful strength was the collection of alliance ratings from multiple perspectives including the youth participants and the therapists. Another strength of this study was that data regarding the alliance and symptom change was collected at multiple points for the duration of therapy which allowed for a more dynamic understanding of these aspects through the course of treatment. Finally, this study sampled from youth, parents, and therapists in a real-world community-based mental health system. Although this study had several strengths, it was not without some limitations. One important limitation of the current study is the lack of variability in alliance scores rated by the adolescents as well as the therapists. The finding that the relationship was rated highly across all raters at all time points maybe due to a difference in the manner which this construct manifests in psychotherapy with youth, or may simply indicate that alliance ratings tend to be uniform and relatively high for the large majority of cases. Additionally, high variability in the types of procedures utilized during therapy, which is typical of practice in real-world settings, and therapist-related aspects of the treatment process such as training level and theoretic orientation were not taken into account and this may be just as influential on the therapeutic relationship and outcomes as the variables examined [,,,]. Lastly, in this study concurrent treatments were not accounted for in these analyses. It is possible that the alliance would form differently given certain extraneous factors such as participation in family therapy or usage of medications [,]. Due to the lack of knowledge in the field of the influences on therapy with youth more research is needed, especially on those variables outside of the therapeutic relationship. In light of the historical importance of the therapeutic alliance and client treatment it would also be desirable to expand our understanding of the various influences which are unique to child and adolescent therapy. In order to have an understanding of if and how the therapeutic alliance has an effect future researchers could include this common factor in their investigations of therapy with children and adolescents. To facilitate the understanding of the alliance influence on psychotherapy with youth future research will need to include investigations of the potential influence of age, behavior type, various raters of the relationship and the development of the relationship over time [,,,,,,]. Although these areas of interest have been suggested in previous research to be potential influences on the development of the alliance, a compelling base of literature is not yet available to make these claims with certainty []. There has been some empirical substantiation that early ratings of the alliance are an indicator of completion of treatment in child and adolescent psychotherapy [,,]. The early relationship and how the relationship changes over the course of treatment may be a determining factor of whether clients obtain the amount of treatment needed before terminating therapy. Furthermore, there has been recent corroboration for the relationship of alliance and therapeutic outcomes in youth psychotherapy [,]. Given that it may be possible to keep clients from prematurely terminating treatment the fundamentals of this association should be identified by future researchers in order to maximize retention in therapy. Although some advancement in the field of child and adolescent psychotherapy research have been made in the direction of assessing therapy outside of controlled trials, more movement towards understanding the therapeutic process in real life clinics is needed [,,]. To date the majority of research has been executed in settings that differ greatly from everyday clinical practice [,,]. Additionally, practicing clinicians have asserted that empirical findings are of little relevance to the work they conduct with their clients []. If professionals in the field are not able to utilize the considerable amount of research being published then a disparity exists which needs to be addressed and by continuing research in real world settings the gap can be minimized [,,].

96a5d0b4-6150-45f0-b624-14df4f40c78c,"Battles of the Comfort Zone: Modelling Therapeutic Strategy, Alliance, and Epistemic Trust—A Qualitative Study of Mentalization-Based Therapy for Borderline Personality Disorder   , , –() We propose a model for how therapeutic strategy, alliance, and epistemic trust interact to foster or hinder therapeutic processes. Four individual mentalization-based treatment (MBT) sessions were subjected to an in-depth qualitative comparison and interpretative phenomenological analysis. Two sessions had high adherence and quality ratings, and two exemplified low evaluations. The sessions were from an MBT program for patients with borderline personality disorder. The high-rated therapists were more prone to strategically identify and investigate maladaptive patterns, were more challenging, and brought the patients out of their comfort zone. This therapeutic endeavour seemed to facilitate therapeutic alliance and a productive therapeutic process. Low-rated therapists seemed to be brought out of their own comfort zone (e.g. transferences/counter-transferences), and attempted to amend the relational atmosphere by being supportive. In these sessions, the therapeutic alliance seemed weak, and therapeutic progress was not observed. When therapists strategically and competently challenged problematic patterns, despite disclosing discomfort, alliance was strengthened. It seemed that a clear therapeutic strategy, and skilfull battling of the patients’ comfort zone, fostered the therapeutic process. We hypothesize that epistemic trust may develop as a product of a fruitful and persistent focus on tasks and goals in therapy. This is a preview of subscription content, .

9c17ae18-0735-431d-905c-a960d6fc214a,"Unwanted Events and Side Effects in Cognitive Behavior Therapy   & , –() Side effects (SEs) are negative reactions to an appropriately delivered treatment, which must be discriminated from unwanted events (UEs) or consequences of inadequate treatment. One hundred CBT therapists were interviewed for UEs and SEs in one of their current outpatients. Therapists reported 372 UEs in 98 patients and SEs in 43 patients. Most frequent were ""negative wellbeing/distress"" (27% of patients), ""worsening of symptoms"" (9%), ""strains in family relations"" (6%); 21% of patients suffered from severe or very severe and 5% from persistent SEs. SEs are unavoidable and frequent also in well-delivered CBT. They include both symptoms and the impairment of social life. Knowledge about the side effect profile can improve early recognition of SEs, safeguard patients, and enhance therapy outcome. This is a preview of subscription content, .

To manage the condition well, medications are prescribed by a psychiatrist to keep the symptoms in check. Also Read - Bipolar disorder: Strike these yoga poses for managing the condition better Bipolar disorder is a condition wherein a person goes from a depressed state to mania. It is classified as a class of mood disorders where a person feels depressed for a minimum of two weeks followed by a manic episode where his energy levels are elevated and he remains in that state for at least seven days at a stretch. However, either of these moods can last for around six to eight months at a stretch too. Here are some facts about bipolar disorder that you need to know.  One thing about bipolar disorder is that unlike other mental disorders the thoughts that plague one’s mind during those mood swings isn’t destructive in nature. They could either be too ambitious (when one is in mania) or riddled with self-doubts (when one is in depression). Here is . Also Read - Eating junk food can raise risk of bipolar disorder, depression, say researchers Incidentally, there is no cure for bipolar disorder. The condition can be managed well with medication and therapy. Medication is the mainstay of treatment but at times psychotherapy can also help in managing the condition better. We spoke to to know how psychotherapy can help people suffering from bipolar disorder; here is what she has to say: ‘Psychotherapy isn’t the primary form of treatment for bipolar disorder. The ideal way to get treated would be to take medications prescribed by a psychiatrist. Remember bipolar disorder happens due to biochemical changes in the brain and so one needs proper medication to treat the condition. However, psychotherapy can be offered or suggested in adjunct to the ongoing treatment to cope better,’ says Bhagwagar. ‘In bipolar disorder, depression is very common. Psychotherapy helps to deal with depression and the negative emotions. As the medications bring a semblance in the biochemical balance of the brain, physiotherapy helps to deal with the emotional surges to cope with the condition. Since a person suffering from bipolar disorder keeps oscillating from depression to mania which are extreme emotions, psychotherapy helps to deal with these emotions in a positive way and bring in a balance in the thought process,’ she says. ‘It is essential to do the right assessment before offering any kind of psychotherapy to the patient. The history of the depressive and manic episodes, the triggers, the shifts in the moods and many other things are taken into consideration before the therapy starts. Often the therapy helps to resolve issues like personality disorders, underlying trauma, depression, phobias and other issues that could act as triggers,’ says Bhagwagar. However, a psychotherapist will always work in conjunction with a psychiatrist. In no condition should medications be abandoned or stopped, unless told by the psychiatrist chances of which are less. In bipolar disorder, medications are usually never discontinued the doses might be titrated according to the patient’s condition and current diagnosis. With medication and therapy, it is possible to manage the condition well and lead a normal life.

(Dotdash) — All rights reserved Kendra Cherry, MS, is an author, educational consultant, and speaker focused on helping students learn about psychology. Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Psychotherapy is a general term that is used to describe the process of treating and mental distress through the use of verbal and psychological techniques. During this process, a trained psychotherapist helps the client tackle specific or general problems such as a particular mental illness or a source of life stress. Depending on the approach used by the therapist, a wide range of techniques and strategies can be used. Almost all types of psychotherapy involve developing a , communicating and creating a dialogue, and working to overcome problematic thoughts or behaviors. Psychotherapy is increasingly viewed as a distinct profession in its own right, but many different types of professionals offer it, including , psychiatrists, counselors, , , mental health counselors, and psychiatric nurses. When many people hear the word ""psychotherapy,"" they immediately imagine a patient lying on a couch talking while a therapist sits in a nearby chair jotting down thoughts on a yellow notepad. The reality is that there are a variety of techniques and practices used in psychotherapy. The exact method used in each situation can vary based upon a variety of factors, including the training and background of the therapist, the preferences of the client, and the exact nature of the client's current problem. Here is a brief overview of the main types of therapy. While psychotherapy was practiced in various forms as far back as the time of the ancient Greeks, it received its formal start when began using talk therapy to work with patients. Techniques commonly used by Freud included the analysis of transference, dream interpretation, and free association. This involves delving into a patient's thoughts and past experiences to seek out unconscious thoughts, feelings, and memories that may influence behavior. When behaviorism became a more prominent school of thought during the early part of the twentieth-century, techniques such as different types of conditioning began to play an important role in psychotherapy. While behaviorism may not be as dominant as it once was, many of its methods are still very popular today. often uses , , and to help clients alter problematic behaviors. Starting in the 1950s, the school of thought known as began to have an influence on psychotherapy. The humanist psychologist developed an approach known as , which focused on the therapist showing to the client. Today, aspects of this approach remain widely used. The humanistic approach to psychotherapy focuses on helping people maximize their potential and stresses the importance of self-exploration, free will, and . The cognitive revolution of the 1960s also had a major impact on the practice of psychotherapy, as psychologists began to increasingly focus on how human thought processes influence behavior and functioning. Cognitive therapy is centered on the idea that our thoughts have a powerful influence on our mental well-being. For example, if you tend to see the negative aspects of every situation, you will probably have a more pessimistic outlook and a gloomier overall mood. The goal of cognitive therapy is to identify the cognitive distortions that lead to this type of thinking and replace such thoughts with more realistic and positive ones. By doing so, people are able to improve their moods and overall well-being. The approach known as (CBT) is a psychotherapeutic treatment that helps patients understand the thoughts and feelings that influence behaviors. CBT is used to treat a range of conditions including , addiction, depression, and anxiety. CBT involves cognitive and behavioral techniques to change negative thoughts and maladaptive behaviors. The approach helps people to change underlying thoughts that contribute to distress and modify problematic behaviors that result from these thoughts. Psychotherapy can take different formats depending on the style of the therapist and the needs of the patient. A few formats that you might encounter include: , which involves working one-on-one with a psychotherapist. , which involves a therapist working with a couple to help improve how the two function in their relationship , which centers on improving the dynamic within families and can include multiple individuals within a family unit , which involves a small group of individuals who share a common goal (This approach allows members of the group to offer and receive support from others, as well as practice new behaviors within a supportive and receptive group.) We've tried, tested and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, Betterhelp, and Regain. There are a number of issues or concerns for both therapists and clients. When , consider whether you feel comfortable divulging personal information to the therapist. You should also assess the therapist's qualifications, including the type of degree they hold and years of experience. People who provide psychotherapy can hold a number of different titles or degrees. Titles such as ""psychologist"" or ""psychiatrist"" are protected and carry specific educational and . Some of the individuals who are qualified to offer psychotherapy include psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, licensed social workers, and advanced psychiatric nurses. When providing services to clients, psychotherapists need to consider issues such as , patient confidentiality, and duty to warn. Informed consent involves notifying a client of all of the potential risks and benefits associated with treatment. This includes explaining the exact nature of the treatment, any possible risks, costs, and the available alternatives. Because clients frequently discuss issues that are highly personal and sensitive in nature, psychotherapists also have a legal obligation to protect a patient's right to confidentiality. However, one instance where psychotherapists have a right to breach patient confidentiality is if clients pose an imminent threat to either themselves or others. gives counselors and therapists the right to breach confidentiality if a client poses a risk to another person. One of the major criticisms leveled against psychotherapy calls into question its effectiveness. In one early and frequently cited study, a psychologist named found that two-thirds of participants either improved or recovered on their own within two years, regardless of whether they had received psychotherapy. However, in numerous subsequent studies, researchers found that psychotherapy can enhance the well-being of clients.﻿ In his book ""The Great Psychotherapy Debate,"" statistician and psychologist Bruce Wampold reported that factors such as the therapist’s personality as well as their belief in the effectiveness of the treatment played a role in the outcome of psychotherapy. Surprisingly, Wampold suggested that the type of therapy and the theoretical basis of the treatment do not have an effect on the outcome. The disagreement has motivated researchers to continue to examine and study the effectiveness of psychotherapy.﻿ You might realize that psychotherapy can help with life's problems, but it can still be difficult to seek help or to even recognize when it is time to talk to a professional. Some key signs that it might be time to see a psychotherapist include: The issue is causing significant distress or disruption in your life. If you feel that the problem you are facing interrupts a number of important areas of your life including school, work, and relationships, it may be time to see if psychotherapy can help. You are relying on unhealthy or dangerous coping mechanisms. If you find yourself dealing with your problem by smoking, drinking, overeating, or taking out your frustrations on others, seeking assistance can help you find healthier and more beneficial coping strategies. Friends and family are concerned about your well-being. If it has reached a point where other people are worried about your emotional health, it may be time to see if psychotherapy can improve your psychological state. You've read self-help books, explored some techniques you read about online, or even tried just ignoring the problem, yet things just seem to be staying the same or even getting worse. You don't have to wait until your life becomes so overwhelming that you can't cope to ask for help. The sooner you reach out, the sooner you can get the help you need to live a healthier, happier life. If you feel that you might benefit from psychotherapy, your first step is to discuss your concerns with your primary care physician. Your doctor might begin by that could cause or contribute to your symptoms. If no specific physical cause is found, your doctor can refer you to a mental health professional who is qualified to diagnose and treat mental illness. Your symptoms often play a role in the treatment and therapist you choose. For example, if the best treatment for you would require and psychotherapy, seeing a may be beneficial.﻿ A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who can prescribe medications and has specific training in the treatment of psychological and psychiatric conditions. If you would most benefit from some form of talk therapy without the addition of prescription drugs, you might be referred to a clinical psychologist or counselor. Referrals from friends and family members can sometimes be a good route to connecting with a therapist who can help you. Psychotherapy is both an art and a science. If your sessions don't feel helpful or you just don't seem to ""click"" with your current therapist, it's OK to try therapy with someone else. Keep looking until you find a professional that you feel comfortable with. As you evaluate a potential psychotherapist, consider the following questions: Does the therapist seem professional and qualified? Do you feel comfortable sharing your feelings and experiences? Are you satisfied with the extent of your interaction with the therapist? Psychotherapy comes in many forms, but all are designed to help people overcome challenges, develop coping strategies, and lead happier and healthier lives. If you are experiencing symptoms of a psychological or psychiatric disorder, you might benefit from an evaluation by a trained and experienced psychotherapist who is qualified to assess, diagnose, and treat mental health conditions. You can reap the possible benefits of psychotherapy even if you just feel that there is something ""off"" in your life that might be improved by consulting with a mental health professional.

Talk therapy is one of the most common , although the specifics will vary according to the client’s needs and the therapist’s school of thought. Talk therapy, also known as psychotherapy, is based on the core idea that talking about the things that are bothering you can help with emotional distress. Some talk therapists follow a specific school of thought, such as or behaviorism. Others use a more , drawing techniques and principles from several different theories. For specific phobias, a mental health professional (like a psychologist or psychiatrist) may use a combination of cognitive and behavioral strategies that includes exposure to the feared object or situation in their treatment plan.  Effectiveness of Talk Therapy vs. Medication Therapy There is an age-old debate in the mental health community regarding the usefulness of talk therapy as opposed to . According to the , mental disorders are the result of physiological causes and should be treated by medication and other biological interventions. Proponents of talk therapy believe that mental disorders are largely based on reactions to one’s environment. Therefore, they can be treated through discussion, resolution of conflict, behavioral changes, and changes in thinking. Today, most members of the mental health community feel that the combination of biological, psychological, and social factors contribute to development of mental health conditions. Many therapists consider both medical and talk therapy solutions when devising a treatment plan. The ultimate is to help the client feel better and deal more successfully with a disorder or a situation. The specific treatment goals depend on the individual client, the therapist’s theories, and the situation at hand. The goal may be specific, such as quitting smoking, or more abstract, such as improved self-esteem. When talk therapy is used for phobia treatment, there are generally two goals. One is to help the client reduce their fear and anxiety, and the second goal is to help the client learn to change their response to the feared situation or object. Some forms of talk therapy have a third goal. In psychoanalysis and related therapies, the goal is to discover and resolve the underlying conflicts and dynamics that caused the phobia or other disorder. In interpersonal therapies, the goal is to resolve problems in interpersonal relationships that have resulted from or contributed to the phobia or other disorder. We've tried, tested and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, Betterhelp, and Regain. Talk therapy begins with an initial appointment, often referred to as an . During this appointment, you'll describe what brings you to therapy. This is known as the . The therapist will then ask questions to help clarify the nature of the problem, and its duration and severity. They will also try to determine your goals for therapy. By the end of the first session, the therapist will have the beginnings of a formulation of the problem and a potential . This may be written as a formal document, or may just be shared with you as a guide to your treatment. Despite the presence of a treatment plan, you should always work collaboratively with your therapist and remain in control of the choices in your therapy. The issue may require more or fewer sessions than originally planned. Family members or friends may be invited to join in certain sessions. Auxiliary , such as support groups, may be recommended. Although talk therapy is most commonly performed one on one, group talk therapy can also be effective. In traditional group therapy, the existence of the group plays a key role. A is an environment that is created within a group that provides structure, support, and a feeling of safety. Within a safe and trusting environment, group members often can express feelings, confront their own negative personality traits, and experiment with behavioral changes. Of course, it takes time and effort to build a sense of community. The popularity of brief therapy has led to a different style of group therapy—the seminar. Time-limited to a single evening or perhaps a weekend, seminars could be seen as a type of group therapy. These short group sessions use methods that are presented to several people at once.

Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Psychotherapy is a general term that is used to describe the process of treating and mental distress through the use of verbal and psychological techniques. During this process, a trained psychotherapist helps the client tackle specific or general problems such as a particular mental illness or a source of life stress. Depending on the approach used by the therapist, a wide range of techniques and strategies can be used. Almost all types of psychotherapy involve developing a , communicating and creating a dialogue, and working to overcome problematic thoughts or behaviors. Psychotherapy is increasingly viewed as a distinct profession in its own right, but many different types of professionals offer it, including , psychiatrists, counselors, , , mental health counselors, and psychiatric nurses. When many people hear the word ""psychotherapy,"" they immediately imagine a patient lying on a couch talking while a therapist sits in a nearby chair jotting down thoughts on a yellow notepad. The reality is that there are a variety of techniques and practices used in psychotherapy. The exact method used in each situation can vary based upon a variety of factors, including the training and background of the therapist, the preferences of the client, and the exact nature of the client's current problem. Here is a brief overview of the main types of therapy. While psychotherapy was practiced in various forms as far back as the time of the ancient Greeks, it received its formal start when began using talk therapy to work with patients. Techniques commonly used by Freud included the analysis of transference, dream interpretation, and free association. This involves delving into a patient's thoughts and past experiences to seek out unconscious thoughts, feelings, and memories that may influence behavior. When behaviorism became a more prominent school of thought during the early part of the twentieth-century, techniques such as different types of conditioning began to play an important role in psychotherapy. While behaviorism may not be as dominant as it once was, many of its methods are still very popular today. often uses , , and to help clients alter problematic behaviors. Starting in the 1950s, the school of thought known as began to have an influence on psychotherapy. The humanist psychologist developed an approach known as , which focused on the therapist showing to the client. Today, aspects of this approach remain widely used. The humanistic approach to psychotherapy focuses on helping people maximize their potential and stresses the importance of self-exploration, free will, and . The cognitive revolution of the 1960s also had a major impact on the practice of psychotherapy, as psychologists began to increasingly focus on how human thought processes influence behavior and functioning. Cognitive therapy is centered on the idea that our thoughts have a powerful influence on our mental well-being. For example, if you tend to see the negative aspects of every situation, you will probably have a more pessimistic outlook and a gloomier overall mood. The goal of cognitive therapy is to identify the cognitive distortions that lead to this type of thinking and replace such thoughts with more realistic and positive ones. By doing so, people are able to improve their moods and overall well-being. The approach known as (CBT) is a psychotherapeutic treatment that helps patients understand the thoughts and feelings that influence behaviors. CBT is used to treat a range of conditions including , addiction, depression, and anxiety. CBT involves cognitive and behavioral techniques to change negative thoughts and maladaptive behaviors. The approach helps people to change underlying thoughts that contribute to distress and modify problematic behaviors that result from these thoughts. Psychotherapy can take different formats depending on the style of the therapist and the needs of the patient. A few formats that you might encounter include: , which involves working one-on-one with a psychotherapist. , which involves a therapist working with a couple to help improve how the two function in their relationship , which centers on improving the dynamic within families and can include multiple individuals within a family unit , which involves a small group of individuals who share a common goal (This approach allows members of the group to offer and receive support from others, as well as practice new behaviors within a supportive and receptive group.) We've tried, tested and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, Betterhelp, and Regain. There are a number of issues or concerns for both therapists and clients. When , consider whether you feel comfortable divulging personal information to the therapist. You should also assess the therapist's qualifications, including the type of degree they hold and years of experience. People who provide psychotherapy can hold a number of different titles or degrees. Titles such as ""psychologist"" or ""psychiatrist"" are protected and carry specific educational and . Some of the individuals who are qualified to offer psychotherapy include psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, licensed social workers, and advanced psychiatric nurses. When providing services to clients, psychotherapists need to consider issues such as , patient confidentiality, and duty to warn. Informed consent involves notifying a client of all of the potential risks and benefits associated with treatment. This includes explaining the exact nature of the treatment, any possible risks, costs, and the available alternatives. Because clients frequently discuss issues that are highly personal and sensitive in nature, psychotherapists also have a legal obligation to protect a patient's right to confidentiality. However, one instance where psychotherapists have a right to breach patient confidentiality is if clients pose an imminent threat to either themselves or others. gives counselors and therapists the right to breach confidentiality if a client poses a risk to another person. One of the major criticisms leveled against psychotherapy calls into question its effectiveness. In one early and frequently cited study, a psychologist named found that two-thirds of participants either improved or recovered on their own within two years, regardless of whether they had received psychotherapy. However, in numerous subsequent studies, researchers found that psychotherapy can enhance the well-being of clients.﻿ In his book ""The Great Psychotherapy Debate,"" statistician and psychologist Bruce Wampold reported that factors such as the therapist’s personality as well as their belief in the effectiveness of the treatment played a role in the outcome of psychotherapy.

She's also a psychotherapist, the author of the bestselling book ""13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do,"" and the host of the Mentally Strong People podcast. The terms ""counselor"" and ""psychotherapist"" are often used interchangeably and have many similarities, but there are some important differences as well. In general, counseling is recommended for specific issues and situations, such as addiction or grief, and takes place over weeks to several months. Psychotherapy, in contrast, tends to explore past issues that might be contributing to present day problems. It often takes place continually or intermittently over a period of years. In actual practice, however, there is a great deal of overlap between the two types of therapies. Understanding some more of the differences between counseling and psychotherapy may be helpful in choosing the type of therapy that will be most effective for you as an individual. While the same therapist may provide both counseling and psychotherapy, psychotherapy generally requires more skill than simple counseling.﻿ It is conducted by professionals trained to practice psychotherapy such as a , a trained counselor, or a . While a psychotherapist is qualified to provide counseling, a counselor may or may not possess the necessary training and skills to provide psychotherapy. That said, a therapist may provide counseling with specific situations and a counselor may function in a psychotherapeutic manner. Technically speaking, """" means ""advisor."" It involves two people working together to solve a problem. It is a term that is used in conjunction with many types of advice giving. For example, financial planning and spiritual guidance are both types of counseling. Just about anyone may claim to be a counselor if they are in the role of giving advice. The term counseling may also properly be used to refer to what occurs in a relationship with a psychotherapist. In the context of mental health, ""counseling"" is generally used to denote a relatively brief treatment that is focused primarily on behavior. It often targets a particular symptom or problematic situation and offers suggestions and advice for dealing with it. In this setting, the counselor offers guidance and support as the figures out ways to better manage life and adjust to change or adversity. There are many types of counselors, such as marriage and family therapists, grief counselors, addiction and substance abuse counselors, and more. """" on the other hand is generally a longer-term treatment that focuses more on gaining insight into chronic physical and emotional problems. Its focus is on the person's thought processes, and how these may be influenced by past events such that they cause problems in the present. In other words, psychotherapy addresses the root cause and core issues of current problems so that lasting change and personal growth may occur. There are several different types of therapy that fall under the general heading of psychotherapy, including approaches such as , , , and much more. There are many similarities between counseling and psychotherapy, and even with the distinction, counseling often includes some psychotherapy and psychotherapy often includes some counseling. Similarities include: Development of a healing, safe, and therapeutic relationship between a therapist and an individual Effectiveness for a wide range of people, both adults and children Understanding a person's feelings and behaviors, and addressing issues with the goal of improving a person's life While mental health professionals with more advanced degrees (eg. psychology PhD or PsyD) are more likely to provide psychotherapy, the same provider may do both types of therapy. There are some key differences between the providers, however. Short term therapy (for a period of weeks and up to 6 months) Guidance, support, and education to help people identify and find their own solutions to current problems Long term therapy, either continuous or intermittent over many years May include testing (such as personality, intelligence), talk therapy, other therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy In-depth focus on internal thoughts/feelings (core issues) leading to personal growth How to Choose Between a Counselor and Psychotherapist When choosing a therapist, it's helpful to learn about the differences noted above, as well as the background of specific providers and the approaches they use. Sometimes the choice will come down to personal preferences, access, or insurance coverage. The most important step, however, is to find a therapist you can trust. In fact, the level of trust a person has in their mental health care practitioner plays the greatest role in whether the therapy will be successful or not. You may actually need to talk with a provider or visit for a few appointments before you know which type of therapy is best for you. For example, with some situations it can be difficult to know if it is a short term, a limited problem you are facing (and thus, may fall under conditions best treated with counseling), or if instead there are events or situations in your past that are leading to the current problem. Counseling may be a better option than psychotherapy if: You have specific issues or short term problems you wish to address You wish to learn coping skills to help better manage stress and improve relationships You are coping with life transitions and adjustments, such as divorce or grief You are looking for someone who is essentially a ""coach"" who can guide and support you as you learn to recognize problems and formulate healthy solutions yourself You have problems that are significantly impacting your life and relationships You are coping with past trauma, or if you believe situations in the past may be playing a role in your current issues Your present issues are chronic or recurring concerns You have a chronic medical condition (such as autoimmune disease, cancer, etc.) that is affecting your emotional well-being You have a diagnosed mental health condition such bipolar disorder or a major anxiety disorder You have seen a counselor and your issues aren't improving even though you've been actively working on solutions Both counseling and psychotherapy are used in the , and the choice can depend on the severity of the depression, whether it is a new issue for you or rather an ongoing or recurrent problem and more. As far as the effectiveness of the two approaches, a 2016 study found that counseling was just as effective for the treatment of mild to moderate depression diagnosed in primary care.﻿ Another 2016 study, however, found that interpersonal psychotherapy was somewhat more beneficial than counseling in adolescents with depression, with respect to both symptoms, and overall functioning over the .﻿ That said, a looking at the same group found that , the effects of counseling were more beneficial.﻿ People with chronic, severe depression might benefit most from psychotherapy, whereas people with mild to moderate depression may benefit most from developing a good relationship with a therapist based on mutual trust, and then talking with them about which approach would be most helpful. Preparing for a Visit With Counselor or Psychotherapist Whether you choose to see a counselor or a psychotherapist, your initial appointment will likely be more rewarding if you do a little homework ahead of time. Doing so will not only help you clarify why you are seeking professional help but will help the provider you see know whether she believes she will be able to help you or not.

Psychoanalysis for is based on psychodynamic theory, which was originally attributed to . From a psychodynamic perspective, social anxiety disorder is believed to be part of a larger problem that develops during childhood. Scientists with this perspective view anxiety as a disorder of childhood origin. Therefore, they see your social anxiety as resulting from your early experiences and attachments to your caregivers and other important people in your life. While these terms are often used interchangeably, psychoanalysis refers to intense long-term psychotherapy, whereas psychodynamic therapy is brief in format. While psychoanalysis might involve meeting several times a week over a period of years, psychodynamic therapy can take place in as little as 15 weeks with once-a-week meetings.﻿ In this way, psychodynamic therapy is more similar to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in terms of its format. Whereas a certified psychoanalyst will conduct psychoanalysis, psychodynamic therapy can be administered by any psychologist trained in this orientation.﻿ Although there is no comprehensive psychoanalytic theory of SAD, there are several beliefs about the origins of social anxiety from this perspective. Each of these conflicts is believed to result in shame, social withdrawal, insecurity, and low self-esteem. An expectation of shame and humiliation elicited by critical or harsh parents A conflict between your need to achieve and succeed, and your fear of success A conflict between your need for independence and fear of rejection or abandonment by your parents Narcissistic fear of being unable to make a perfect impression Psychodynamic Therapy for Social Anxiety Disorder The goal of psychodynamic therapy for SAD is to uncover underlying conflicts believed to cause the disorder and work through these issues.﻿ Your mental health professional will work with you to determine the unique conflicts and childhood issues that may be linked to your social anxiety. In addition, your therapist will discuss potential issues that may affect therapy and are unique to social anxiety disorder. For example, you may find yourself expecting that your therapist will judge you negatively. Or, you may have trouble trusting your therapist. In a 2013 study, 495 patients with social anxiety disorder received either cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, or were put on a wait-list (control condition).﻿ The patients were given assessments (e.g., the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale) at the start of the study and then again at the end of treatment. Patients receiving CBT showed response to treatment in 60% of cases, while those who received psychodynamic therapy responded in 52% of cases.﻿ Those who were put on the waitlist only showed improvement in 15% of cases. In terms of remission over time, 36% of those who received CBT remained in remission, compared to 26% who received psychodynamic therapy and 9% who were put on the wait-list.﻿ These findings show that receiving CBT or psychodynamic therapy is better than being on a waitlist both in the short and long term. However,  appears to be more helpful than psychodynamic therapy when it comes to treatment effects lasting over the long term for social anxiety disorder. In a 2014 study of CBT versus psychodynamic for SAD, both treatments were found to be equally effective. In another 2014 study of the long-term outcomes of CBT and psychodynamic therapy for social anxiety disorder, participants were followed for 24 months. Response rates were about 70% for both treatments at 2-year follow-up and remission rates were nearly 40% for both.﻿ This suggests that both CBT and psychodynamic therapy may be helpful for SAD. Finally, in a 2016 multi-center trial of patient characteristics that predict outcomes of psychodynamic psychotherapy for social anxiety disorder, it was found that the most important predictor of treatment outcomes was the level of severity of social anxiety prior to treatment.﻿ This means that your doctor should consider how severe your symptoms are when choosing the best type of therapy for your situation. Based on current research evidence, psychodynamic therapy is likely as good as CBT in terms of immediate improvement. However, over the long-term, cognitive-behavioral therapy may be more effective.

(Dotdash) — All rights reserved What you can and cannot expect from psychotherapy Deborah Glasofer, PhD is a professor of clinical psychology and practitioner of cognitive behavioral therapy. David Susman, PhD is a licensed clinical psychologist with experience providing treatment to individuals with mental illness and substance use concerns. In my experience consulting with patients who are considering whether or not to pursue psychotherapy to improve their mental health, the path to this decision is as varied as the people who travel down it. Sometimes, it is the concern of a that is the tipping point for an individual to seek help. In other cases, a teacher, school, colleague, or employer is insisting that mental health needs be prioritized above all else so that a person can return to school (or work) on better psychological footing. Often, adults themselves are aware of ways in which they would like their relationships to be better, their mood or anxiety to feel more manageable, or of specific behaviors that they would like help to change; in these cases, people choose to seek therapy in the interest of personal growth, symptom reduction, and overall improved quality of life. Regardless of how you might arrive at the decision to try psychotherapy (or the you choose), you will arrive at your first session with a set of expectations which might include some misconceptions about the psychotherapy process. Why Are There Misconceptions About Psychotherapy? If you don't work in the mental health field, you may benefit from improving your (i.e., knowledge about mental disorders). This certainly makes sense and is not unique to the field of mental health. After all, non-lawyers don’t typically know much about litigation. But it might make it hard for you to know if you or someone you are concerned about have reached the point when you need to seek therapy. (See this related post to distinguish ‘normal’ anxiety from generalized anxiety disorder). And it can add hurdles to successfully initiating psychotherapy or being willing to stick with it. The most readily accessible information on psychotherapy comes from . Research has shown that people do form conceptualizations and expectations of psychotherapy based on the . And whereas you might be able to balance out fictionalized, sometimes-damaging depictions of other professionals like physicians or teachers with your real-life experience receiving medical care or education, it may be more challenging to , or the overall process of psychotherapy. Understanding what to expect from the experience can help you approach treatment as, as I like to think of it, an . Here are some important things to understand about psychotherapy which address several of the common but misguided expectations you should try to leave at the door before you enter your session: There are a very limited number of problems for which one session of psychotherapy will be all the treatment that is required (Exceptions to this might include single-session exposure therapy for some specific phobias in , .). Psychotherapy can be a short- or long-term commitment. The first several appointments are typically used for you and your therapist to determine if (and what kind of) therapy can be helpful. You will be asked to talk about the specific concerns that led you to seek care, as well as elements of your broader medical, social, and family history that will help the therapist get to know you better. For some people, it is quite uncomfortable to talk openly about their symptoms and history. For others, this is in and of itself a powerfully relieving experience. Regardless, it is highly unlikely that meaningful, lasting change or resolution for longstanding patterns of thinking, relating, or behaving can be adequately achieved in a handful of appointments. That said, it is reasonable to expect structured, present-focused approaches like , interpersonal psychotherapy, or to be time-limited. Psychodynamic psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, on the other hand, which focus on the exploration of unconscious desires and processes are likely to require a greater time investment. Psychotherapy is work. It will require you to take a hard look at yourself. You will not be alone in this; your therapist will be working hard too. You will work together to (1) develop more awareness about exactly what is causing you a problem (for example, particular ways of thinking, ways you are avoiding facing your concerns, expressing or coping with various emotions, or communication style), (2) understand how your current patterns are serving you well and not so well, and (3) experiment with , doing, relating, and coping. Along the way, there are likely to be moments when you feel worse before you feel better. Talking about traumatic experiences, for example, might disrupt sleep. Confronting ways in which others have treated you poorly, or you have mistreated others, can lead to sadness and anger. —be it a rollercoaster, raising your hand in class, or deciding to get a divorce—can create more anxiety in the short-term. In your ‘feeling worse moments’, remember that the old patterns felt bad too. Perhaps it’s worth giving it some time to see if this tough moment will give way to something better in the long run? Talking With Your Therapist Is Not the Same as Talking to a Friend The therapeutic relationship differs from other relationships. It is not reciprocal, not a ""two-way street."" You will likely share intimate details of yourself with your clinician, and he or she will not be responding in kind. This is not intended to be harsh or withholding, nor is it any kind of indicator of your trustworthiness or likability to the clinician. Rather, your therapist sets limits around if they will share personal information in order to keep the focus where it needs to be—on you and your goals—and in some types of therapy, to help you makes sense of your assumptions (or projections) about him or her as another way to learn more about yourself. The boundaries set by a therapist in some instances can also model for you ways of limit-setting with others. Your Therapist Will Not Usually Tell You Exactly What to Do Because your therapist will not be directly living out the consequences of your choices, he or she will typically refrain from overt instruction. There are certainly exceptions to this—namely, if there is a concern for your safety or anyone else’s—that might lead your therapist to be more candid and directive with you than usual. Rather than telling you what to do, your therapist will ask you questions to help you determine what want to do—and why. He or she will reflect back what you’ve said to help you hear it with ‘fresh ears’ and facilitate a thorough examination. Your therapist may guide you to consider other options you had not imagined or to think through the positive, negative, and ‘somewhere in between’ consequences of taking a particular path. If you work with the same therapist over an extended time frame, your therapist may be able to remind you about prior decisions (and their consequences) or flag repeated patterns. This may inform how you proceed with decision currently in front of you, or how you cope with its outcome. Don’t Expect to ‘Click’ With the First Therapist You See As unique as the therapeutic relationship is, it shares in common with other relationships that it involves two people coming together. You are clearly the expert on you, and you arrive at your therapist’s office with particular temperament and personal style, a perception of the active problems, and an idea of your goals for therapy. Your therapist is the mental health expert, and he or she is greeting you with their own particular therapeutic style, areas of clinical experience (including the type of therapy practiced, age or diagnostic group(s) typically served, etc.), and temperament. You may not ""click"" with the first therapist you see or it might take more than one appointment to decide if they're a good fit. You may need to see more than one clinician for multiple sessions before you find the right therapist. The best fit is different for different people, but consider the following questions as a helpful start in for yourself: Has the therapist answered your questions to your satisfaction about your diagnosis, their clinical experience, and what treatment could involve? Does the therapist convey professionalism (in conversation, in the office environment, in their description of practice policies regarding cancellation, emergencies, etc.)? Given any challenges for you in beginning psychotherapy, how comfortable do you feel talking openly with the therapist? Do you like their style, including their extent of interaction with you, use of humor, ability to perceive and address your emotional state during a session?

Supportive-expressive therapy is an evidence-based, psychodynamic psychotherapy, that is effective in treating more severe . Find out if this form of therapy is right for you with this review of the treatment, including its origins and techniques. Supportive-expressive therapy draws from the psychodynamic orientation, which originated with , which claimed that psychological problems originated in early childhood. These psychological problems can occur alongside problems associated with substance use and can be treated by becoming more aware of, working through and overcoming unhelpful patterns in relationships. Supportive-expressive therapy is a manualized and time-limited intervention for individuals with more severe substance use disorders. It focuses on substance use within the context of the person and her relationships with other people. Supportive-expressive therapy is a combination of two main components: supportive techniques to help clients feel comfortable in discussing their personal experiences and expressive techniques to help clients identify and work through interpersonal relationship issues. This is done through working on three areas of focus: the person's emotional experience, for example, through the person identifying and labeling the emotions they have been experiencing; the communication between the therapist and the person receiving treatment; and interpretation of what comes up in therapy sessions. The goal of supportive-expressive therapy is to help clients achieve mastery over their difficulties, gain self-understanding and practice self-control over substance use problems. It is based on the theory that the development of problematic substance use, as with the development of personality, is influenced by formative life experiences. The therapist and client explore and gain insight into conflicts that developed within the client through early experiences, for example, with parents and caregivers, and how these are represented in current situations and relationships during supportive-expressive therapy. Supportive-expressive therapy is non-directive, which means that the client, not the therapist, decides what is important to focus on, and a typical course of therapy consists of 16 to 30 sessions, which last about an hour each. Supportive-expressive therapy is particularly well suited to clients with severe substance use disorders, including , which can develop in response to using a drug such as  and . Why Supportive-Expressive Therapy Helps Severe Substance Use  Supportive-expressive therapy has been shown by research studies to be more effective in treating severe substance use disorders than drug counseling, and improvements have been found to continue to be present 12 months after completing treatment. In methadone maintenance treatment, the benefits from supportive-expressive therapy included reductions in drug use, need for less methadone and maintenance of treatment gains. Improvements in employment, measured by the number of days worked and wages earned have also been described. In addition, people who receive supportive-expressive therapy show fewer and less severe problems than those receiving drug counseling. It is as effective as . The best outcomes have been found by combining drug counseling and supportive-expressive therapy, especially people with severe co-occurring psychiatric problems. Supportive-expressive therapy has been recognized by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) as an evidence-based approach to treating substance use disorders.

Psychoanalysis is defined as a set of psychological theories and therapeutic techniques that have their origin in the work and theories of Sigmund Freud.﻿ The core of psychoanalysis is the belief that all people possess unconscious thoughts, feelings, desires, and memories. Psychoanalysis suggests that people can experience  and gain insight into their current state of mind by bringing the content of the unconscious into conscious awareness. Through this process, a person can find relief from psychological distress. Psychoanalysis also suggests that: A person's behavior is influenced by their unconscious drives. Emotional and psychological problems such as depression and anxiety are often rooted in conflicts between the conscious and unconscious mind. development is heavily influenced by the events of early childhood (Freud suggested that personality was largely set in stone by the age of five). People use defense mechanisms to protect themselves from information contained in the unconscious. Skilled analysts can help a person bring certain aspects of their unconscious mind into their conscious awareness by using psychoanalytic strategies such as dream analysis and free association. Sigmund Freud was the founder of psychoanalysis and the psychodynamic approach to psychology. Freud believed that the human mind was composed of three elements:  Freud's theories of , the unconscious, and dream symbolism are still popular among both psychologists and laypeople, but others view his work with skepticism. Many of were based on clinical cases and case studies. This made his findings difficult to generalize to the larger population. Still, Freud's theories changed how we think about the human mind and behavior and left a lasting mark on psychology and culture. Erik Erikson is another theorist associated with psychoanalysis. Erikson expanded on Freud's theories and stressed the importance of growth throughout the lifespan. Erikson's psychosocial stage theory of personality remains influential today in our understanding of human development. According to the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA), psychoanalysis can help people understand themselves by exploring their unrecognized impulses that are hidden in the unconscious.﻿ Applied psychoanalysis (which applies psychoanalytic principles to the study of art, literature, and real-world settings and situations) Neuro-psychoanalysis (which applies neuroscience to psychoanalytic topics such as dreams and repression) Many of the criticisms of psychodynamic approaches are based on the earlier Freudian approaches to treatment. More recently, however, research has demonstrated that this approach can have a number of benefits.﻿  While traditional Freudian approaches have fallen out of favor, modern approaches to psychoanalytic therapy emphasize a non-judgmental and empathetic approach. In psychotherapy, people are able to feel safe as they explore feelings, desires, memories, and stressors that can lead to psychological difficulties. Research has demonstrated that the self-examination utilized in the psychoanalytic process can contribute to long-term emotional growth.﻿ 1882 – Josef Breuer described the case of Anna O to Freud 1900 – Sigmund Freud published his book  1896 – Sigmund Freud first coined the term psychoanalysis 1908 – The Vienna Psychoanalytic Society was formed and the first international meeting of psychoanalysts was held 1909 – Freud made his first and only trip to the United States 1910 – The International Psychoanalytic Association was formed 1938 – The Vienna Psychoanalytic Society was dissolved 1939 – Sigmund Freud died in London following a long battle with oral cancer  was the founder of psychoanalysis, but other thinkers—including his own daughter —also left a significant mark on the field. Among the most prominent names in psychoanalysis were , , and . Karl Abraham, Otto Rank, John Bowlby, Melanie Klein, Karen Horney, and  were also key contributors to the evolution of psychoanalytic theory. Psychoanalysis also involves a number of different terms and ideas related to the mind, personality, and treatment. A  is defined as an in-depth study of one person, group, or event. Some of Freud's most famous case studies include Dora, Little Hans, and . These cases had a powerful influence on the development of his psychoanalytic theory. In a case study, the researcher attempts to intensely examine every aspect of an individual's life. By closely studying a person, a researcher can gain insight into how an individual's history contributes to their current behavior. Although the hope is that the insights gained from a single case study could apply to others, it is difficult to generalize the results, because case studies tend to be highly subjective. In some instances, the factors involved in a particular case are so individualized that they may not apply to others. The  includes all of the things that are outside of our conscious awareness, such as early childhood memories, secret desires, and hidden drives. According to Freud, the unconscious contains things that we might consider to be unpleasant or even socially unacceptable. We bury these things in our unconscious because they might bring us pain or conflict. While these thoughts, memories, and urges are outside of our awareness, they still influence how we think and behave. In some cases, the things that are outside of our awareness can influence behavior in negative ways and lead to psychological distress.  The conscious mind, on the other hand, includes everything that is inside of our awareness. The contents of the conscious mind are the things we are aware of or can easily bring into awareness. Thoughts, urges, or feelings that are unpleasant, difficult, or even socially unacceptable. Buried because they can bring about pain or conflict. Can sometimes be brought into awareness using certain techniques. Thoughts, feelings, and urges that we are aware of or can easily bring into awareness. May be influenced by unconscious thoughts, feelings, or memories. Freud believed that an individual's personality had three components: the id, the ego, and the superego. The first of the key elements of personality to emerge is known as . The id contains all of the unconscious, basic, and primal urges. The second aspect of personality to emerge is known as . This is the part of the personality that must deal with the demands of reality. It helps control the urges of the id and makes us behave in ways that are both realistic and acceptable. Rather than engaging in behaviors that are designed to satisfy our desires and needs, the ego forces us to fulfill our needs in ways that are socially acceptable and realistic. In addition to controlling the demands of the id, the ego also helps strike a balance between our basic urges, our ideals, and reality. The is the final aspect of personality to emerge, and it contains our ideals and values. The values and beliefs that our parents and society instill in us are the guiding force of the superego and it strives to make us behave according to these morals. Defense mechanisms are strategies that the ego uses to . These defensive tools act as a safeguard to keep unpleasant or distressing aspects of the unconscious from entering our awareness. When something is experienced as overwhelming or even inappropriate, defense mechanisms keep the information from entering our consciousness, which minimizes our distress. Common Defense Mechanisms People Use to Cope with Anxiety Over the course of the early twentieth century, the influence of psychoanalysis grew. It was not, however, without its critics. Despite its flaws, psychoanalysis continued to play a key role in the development of psychology. It influenced our approach to treating mental health conditions and continues to exert an influence on psychology today.  Even though most psychodynamic theories did not rely on experimental research, the methods and theories of psychoanalytic thinking contributed to the development of experimental psychology. Many of the theories of personality developed by psychodynamic thinkers, such as Erikson's theory of psychosocial stages and Freud's psychosexual stage theory, continue to influence the field today. Psychoanalysis opened up a new view on mental illness, particularly that talking through problems with a psychoanalytic professional could help alleviate a person's psychological distress.  Freud's theories overemphasized the unconscious mind, sex, aggression, and childhood experiences. Many of the concepts proposed by psychoanalytic theorists are difficult to measure and quantify. Most of Freud's ideas were based on case studies and clinical observations rather than empirical, scientific research. Many people are skeptical of psychoanalysis because the evidence supporting its effectiveness has often been viewed as weak. One of the main arguments by those who are critical of psychoanalysis is that it's not as effective as other treatments. However, some of the research on the effectiveness of psychoanalysis has yielded support. One systematic review of previous studies concluded that psychoanalytic therapy was an effective treatment that resulted in the reduction of symptoms and long-term changes that persisted for years after treatment ended.﻿ A 2015 review found that psychodynamic therapy could be effective in the treatment of a number of conditions include: Another critique is that psychoanalysis often requires an investment of time, money, and effort. Psychoanalysis is also generally a long-term proposition. In the world we live in today, people are usually seeking fast results and approaches that yield an effect in days, weeks, or months. Psychoanalytic therapy typically involves a client and therapist exploring issues over a period of years. Using the criteria established for evidence-based treatment, traditional psychoanalysis alone does not, in fact, pass muster as a method of therapy for the large majority of . However, to dismiss Freud’s contributions as irrelevant to psychology... Many of Freud's ideas have fallen out of favor in psychology, but that certainly does not mean that his work is without merit. Research also supports at least some of Freud's original ideas. His approach to therapy (specifically, the suggestion that mental illness was treatable and that talking about problems could bring relief) was a revolutionary concept that changed how we approach the treatment of mental illness. ""Reviews of neuroscientific work confirm that many of Freud's original observations, not least the pervasive influence of non-conscious processes and the organizing function of emotions for thinking, have found confirmation in laboratory studies,"" explained Peter Fonagy in an article published in .﻿ Sigmund Freud was also very much a product of his time. While he was known for his audacious theories (which were considered especially shocking in the Victorian period), his view of the world was colored by the time in which he lived. If Freud were alive today, his ideas might be regarded very differently—and his own work would likely take a different direction. Some have suggested that if Freud were alive today, he would likely be interested in topics related to brain functioning. Prior to the development of psychoanalysis, Freud's interests had centered on developing a neural model of behavior. Researchers today also suggest that the neurobiological underpinnings of psychoanalysis are worth further exploration.﻿ Psychologists today talk about the , not the . As such, this perspective refers to the dynamic forces within our personalities whose shifting movements underlie much of the basis for our observable behavior. Psychoanalysis is a much narrower term referring to the Freudian-based notion that to understand, and treat, abnormal behavior, our unconscious conflicts must be worked through. Psychoanalysis as Freud conceived it might be on the decline, but that does not mean that the psychodynamic perspective has disappeared or that it will be going anywhere soon. If you ask someone what comes to mind when they think of psychology, Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis are likely to be common responses. There is no question that psychoanalysis—both as a therapeutic approach and theoretical outlook—has left its mark on psychology. Most psychologists today employ a more eclectic approach to the field of psychology, though there are some professionals who still take a purely psychoanalytical point of view on human behavior. Many contemporary psychologists view psychoanalysis with skepticism.﻿ Some even feel derision toward Freud's school of thought. In a world of psychology where cognitive processes, neuroscience, and dominate, is there still room for psychoanalysis? In general, there is a perceived decline in traditional psychoanalysis. A report published by the APsaA in 2008 found that psychology departments typically treat psychoanalysis as a purely historical artifact, while subjects such as art, literature, history, and other humanities were more likely to teach psychoanalysis as an ongoing and relevant topic.﻿ Some suggest that psychoanalysis has fallen by the wayside as an academic topic within psychology partly because of its failure to test the validity of its therapeutic approach and earlier failures to ground the discipline in evidence-based practices. There are a few things that psychoanalysis as a field can do to ensure its continued relevance in the world of psychology. Some things that can help improve the legitimacy and relevance of psychoanalytic methods include: Place a greater emphasis on scientific research and empirical evidence. Explore evidence-based treatments in greater depth. Give greater consideration of other possible explanations for behavior. Collaborate actively with other mental health professionals. Some current efforts to revitalize psychoanalysis focus on psychoanalytic concepts that are more evidence-based (such as attachment theory) or on connecting Freud's idea of the unconscious to modern neuroscience.﻿ Freud's mark on psychology is still felt today.  is most often associated with psychoanalysis, but therapists also use the technique in other approaches to treatment, including  and . Psychoanalysis might not be the force it was back in 1910, but Freud's theories have had a lasting influence on both popular culture and psychology.

Talk therapy is one of the most common , although the specifics will vary according to the client’s needs and the therapist’s school of thought. Talk therapy, also known as psychotherapy, is based on the core idea that talking about the things that are bothering you can help with emotional distress. Some talk therapists follow a specific school of thought, such as or behaviorism. Others use a more , drawing techniques and principles from several different theories. For specific phobias, a mental health professional (like a psychologist or psychiatrist) may use a combination of cognitive and behavioral strategies that includes exposure to the feared object or situation in their treatment plan.  Effectiveness of Talk Therapy vs. Medication Therapy There is an age-old debate in the mental health community regarding the usefulness of talk therapy as opposed to . According to the , mental disorders are the result of physiological causes and should be treated by medication and other biological interventions. Proponents of talk therapy believe that mental disorders are largely based on reactions to one’s environment. Therefore, they can be treated through discussion, resolution of conflict, behavioral changes, and changes in thinking. Today, most members of the mental health community feel that the combination of biological, psychological, and social factors contribute to development of mental health conditions. Many therapists consider both medical and talk therapy solutions when devising a treatment plan. The ultimate is to help the client feel better and deal more successfully with a disorder or a situation. The specific treatment goals depend on the individual client, the therapist’s theories, and the situation at hand. The goal may be specific, such as quitting smoking, or more abstract, such as improved self-esteem. When talk therapy is used for phobia treatment, there are generally two goals. One is to help the client reduce their fear and anxiety, and the second goal is to help the client learn to change their response to the feared situation or object. Some forms of talk therapy have a third goal. In psychoanalysis and related therapies, the goal is to discover and resolve the underlying conflicts and dynamics that caused the phobia or other disorder. In interpersonal therapies, the goal is to resolve problems in interpersonal relationships that have resulted from or contributed to the phobia or other disorder. We've tried, tested and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, Betterhelp, and Regain. Talk therapy begins with an initial appointment, often referred to as an . During this appointment, you'll describe what brings you to therapy. This is known as the . The therapist will then ask questions to help clarify the nature of the problem, and its duration and severity. They will also try to determine your goals for therapy. By the end of the first session, the therapist will have the beginnings of a formulation of the problem and a potential . This may be written as a formal document, or may just be shared with you as a guide to your treatment. Despite the presence of a treatment plan, you should always work collaboratively with your therapist and remain in control of the choices in your therapy. The issue may require more or fewer sessions than originally planned. Family members or friends may be invited to join in certain sessions. Auxiliary , such as support groups, may be recommended. Although talk therapy is most commonly performed one on one, group talk therapy can also be effective. In traditional group therapy, the existence of the group plays a key role. A is an environment that is created within a group that provides structure, support, and a feeling of safety. Within a safe and trusting environment, group members often can express feelings, confront their own negative personality traits, and experiment with behavioral changes. Of course, it takes time and effort to build a sense of community. The popularity of brief therapy has led to a different style of group therapy—the seminar. Time-limited to a single evening or perhaps a weekend, seminars could be seen as a type of group therapy. These short group sessions use methods that are presented to several people at once. The group setting may increase the confidence that can develop from seeing others successfully battle their own issues. Ever wonder what your personality type means?

Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Psychotherapy is a general term that is used to describe the process of treating and mental distress through the use of verbal and psychological techniques. During this process, a trained psychotherapist helps the client tackle specific or general problems such as a particular mental illness or a source of life stress. Depending on the approach used by the therapist, a wide range of techniques and strategies can be used. Almost all types of psychotherapy involve developing a , communicating and creating a dialogue, and working to overcome problematic thoughts or behaviors. Psychotherapy is increasingly viewed as a distinct profession in its own right, but many different types of professionals offer it, including , psychiatrists, counselors, , , mental health counselors, and psychiatric nurses. When many people hear the word ""psychotherapy,"" they immediately imagine a patient lying on a couch talking while a therapist sits in a nearby chair jotting down thoughts on a yellow notepad. The reality is that there are a variety of techniques and practices used in psychotherapy. The exact method used in each situation can vary based upon a variety of factors, including the training and background of the therapist, the preferences of the client, and the exact nature of the client's current problem. Here is a brief overview of the main types of therapy. While psychotherapy was practiced in various forms as far back as the time of the ancient Greeks, it received its formal start when began using talk therapy to work with patients. Techniques commonly used by Freud included the analysis of transference, dream interpretation, and free association. This involves delving into a patient's thoughts and past experiences to seek out unconscious thoughts, feelings, and memories that may influence behavior. When behaviorism became a more prominent school of thought during the early part of the twentieth-century, techniques such as different types of conditioning began to play an important role in psychotherapy. While behaviorism may not be as dominant as it once was, many of its methods are still very popular today. often uses , , and to help clients alter problematic behaviors. Starting in the 1950s, the school of thought known as began to have an influence on psychotherapy. The humanist psychologist developed an approach known as , which focused on the therapist showing to the client. Today, aspects of this approach remain widely used. The humanistic approach to psychotherapy focuses on helping people maximize their potential and stresses the importance of self-exploration, free will, and . The cognitive revolution of the 1960s also had a major impact on the practice of psychotherapy, as psychologists began to increasingly focus on how human thought processes influence behavior and functioning. Cognitive therapy is centered on the idea that our thoughts have a powerful influence on our mental well-being. For example, if you tend to see the negative aspects of every situation, you will probably have a more pessimistic outlook and a gloomier overall mood. The goal of cognitive therapy is to identify the cognitive distortions that lead to this type of thinking and replace such thoughts with more realistic and positive ones. By doing so, people are able to improve their moods and overall well-being. The approach known as (CBT) is a psychotherapeutic treatment that helps patients understand the thoughts and feelings that influence behaviors. CBT is used to treat a range of conditions including , addiction, depression, and anxiety. CBT involves cognitive and behavioral techniques to change negative thoughts and maladaptive behaviors. The approach helps people to change underlying thoughts that contribute to distress and modify problematic behaviors that result from these thoughts. Psychotherapy can take different formats depending on the style of the therapist and the needs of the patient. A few formats that you might encounter include: , which involves working one-on-one with a psychotherapist. , which involves a therapist working with a couple to help improve how the two function in their relationship , which centers on improving the dynamic within families and can include multiple individuals within a family unit , which involves a small group of individuals who share a common goal (This approach allows members of the group to offer and receive support from others, as well as practice new behaviors within a supportive and receptive group.) We've tried, tested and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, Betterhelp, and Regain. There are a number of issues or concerns for both therapists and clients. When , consider whether you feel comfortable divulging personal information to the therapist. You should also assess the therapist's qualifications, including the type of degree they hold and years of experience. People who provide psychotherapy can hold a number of different titles or degrees. Titles such as ""psychologist"" or ""psychiatrist"" are protected and carry specific educational and . Some of the individuals who are qualified to offer psychotherapy include psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, licensed social workers, and advanced psychiatric nurses. When providing services to clients, psychotherapists need to consider issues such as , patient confidentiality, and duty to warn. Informed consent involves notifying a client of all of the potential risks and benefits associated with treatment. This includes explaining the exact nature of the treatment, any possible risks, costs, and the available alternatives. Because clients frequently discuss issues that are highly personal and sensitive in nature, psychotherapists also have a legal obligation to protect a patient's right to confidentiality. However, one instance where psychotherapists have a right to breach patient confidentiality is if clients pose an imminent threat to either themselves or others. gives counselors and therapists the right to breach confidentiality if a client poses a risk to another person. One of the major criticisms leveled against psychotherapy calls into question its effectiveness. In one early and frequently cited study, a psychologist named found that two-thirds of participants either improved or recovered on their own within two years, regardless of whether they had received psychotherapy. However, in numerous subsequent studies, researchers found that psychotherapy can enhance the well-being of clients.﻿ In his book ""The Great Psychotherapy Debate,"" statistician and psychologist Bruce Wampold reported that factors such as the therapist’s personality as well as their belief in the effectiveness of the treatment played a role in the outcome of psychotherapy. Surprisingly, Wampold suggested that the type of therapy and the theoretical basis of the treatment do not have an effect on the outcome. The disagreement has motivated researchers to continue to examine and study the effectiveness of psychotherapy.﻿ You might realize that psychotherapy can help with life's problems, but it can still be difficult to seek help or to even recognize when it is time to talk to a professional. Some key signs that it might be time to see a psychotherapist include: The issue is causing significant distress or disruption in your life. If you feel that the problem you are facing interrupts a number of important areas of your life including school, work, and relationships, it may be time to see if psychotherapy can help. You are relying on unhealthy or dangerous coping mechanisms. If you find yourself dealing with your problem by smoking, drinking, overeating, or taking out your frustrations on others, seeking assistance can help you find healthier and more beneficial coping strategies. Friends and family are concerned about your well-being. If it has reached a point where other people are worried about your emotional health, it may be time to see if psychotherapy can improve your psychological state. You've read self-help books, explored some techniques you read about online, or even tried just ignoring the problem, yet things just seem to be staying the same or even getting worse. You don't have to wait until your life becomes so overwhelming that you can't cope to ask for help. The sooner you reach out, the sooner you can get the help you need to live a healthier, happier life. If you feel that you might benefit from psychotherapy, your first step is to discuss your concerns with your primary care physician. Your doctor might begin by that could cause or contribute to your symptoms. If no specific physical cause is found, your doctor can refer you to a mental health professional who is qualified to diagnose and treat mental illness. Your symptoms often play a role in the treatment and therapist you choose. For example, if the best treatment for you would require and psychotherapy, seeing a may be beneficial.﻿ A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who can prescribe medications and has specific training in the treatment of psychological and psychiatric conditions. If you would most benefit from some form of talk therapy without the addition of prescription drugs, you might be referred to a clinical psychologist or counselor. Referrals from friends and family members can sometimes be a good route to connecting with a therapist who can help you. Psychotherapy is both an art and a science. If your sessions don't feel helpful or you just don't seem to ""click"" with your current therapist, it's OK to try therapy with someone else. Keep looking until you find a professional that you feel comfortable with. As you evaluate a potential psychotherapist, consider the following questions: Does the therapist seem professional and qualified? Do you feel comfortable sharing your feelings and experiences? Are you satisfied with the extent of your interaction with the therapist? Psychotherapy comes in many forms, but all are designed to help people overcome challenges, develop coping strategies, and lead happier and healthier lives. If you are experiencing symptoms of a psychological or psychiatric disorder, you might benefit from an evaluation by a trained and experienced psychotherapist who is qualified to assess, diagnose, and treat mental health conditions. You can reap the possible benefits of psychotherapy even if you just feel that there is something ""off"" in your life that might be improved by consulting with a mental health professional.

Amy Morin, LCSW, is the Editor-in-Chief of Verywell Mind. She's also a psychotherapist, the author of the bestselling book ""13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do,"" and the host of the Mentally Strong People podcast. Psychoanalytic therapy is one of the most well-known treatment modalities, but it is also frequently misunderstood by mental health consumers. The goal of this therapy is to help patients better understand the unconscious forces that can play a role in their current behaviors, thoughts, and emotions. This type of therapy is based upon the theories of , who founded the school of thought known as . Freud described the unconscious as the reservoir of desires, thoughts, and memories that are below the surface of conscious awareness. He believed that these unconscious influences could often lead to psychological distress and disturbances. Psychoanalytic therapy looks at how the  influences thoughts and behaviors. Psychoanalysis frequently involves looking at early childhood experiences in order to discover how these events might have shaped the individual and how they contribute to current actions. Freud began developing his therapeutic techniques in the late 1800s. In 1885, he began to study and work with Jean-Martin Charcot at the Salpêtrière in Paris. Charcot used  to treat women suffering from what was then known as . Symptoms of the illness included partial paralysis, hallucinations, and nervousness. Freud continued to research hypnotism in treatment, but his work and friendship with colleague Josef Breuer led to the development of his most famous therapeutic technique. Breuer described his treatment of a young woman, known in the case history as , whose symptoms of hysteria were relieved by talking about her traumatic experiences. Freud and Breuer collaborated on a book called  and Freud continued to develop his use of this ""."" This approach proposed that simply talking about problems could help relieve psychological distress. Psychoanalytic therapists generally spend time listening to patients talk about their lives, which is why this method is often referred to as ""the talking cure."" The therapy provider will look for patterns or significant events that may play a role in the client's current difficulties. Psychoanalysts believe that childhood events and unconscious feelings, thoughts, and motivations play a role in mental illness and maladaptive behaviors. Psychoanalytic therapy also makes use of other techniques including free association, exploration of , observing defenses and feelings patients may not be aware of, as well as . People undergoing psychoanalytic therapy often meet with their therapist at least once a week and may remain in therapy for a number of weeks, months, or even years. Through this process, the hope is that people will be able to gain insight and awareness of the unconscious forces that contribute to their current mental state. Patients may sometimes find that psychoanalysis can be quite intense and personal. It involves talking a great deal about past experiences, relationships, and feelings. This can also lead to feelings of discomfort as unconscious forces are brought to light. While the process can sometimes result in uneasiness, it can also be a great way to gain insight and deal with feelings that are difficult to put into words.﻿ This approach to therapy often involves provoking emotional responses and overcoming . Success often hinges on the ability to confront potentially stressful or triggering past experiences. Gaining insight into your feelings, behaviors, and experiences can help you better understand the unconscious forces that continue to exert an influence on your actions, your relationships, and your sense of self. Psychoanalytic therapy may also help you learn techniques for coping when future problems arise. Rather than falling back on unhealthy defenses, you may be better able to recognize your feelings and deal with them in a constructive manner. As with any approach to mental health treatment, psychoanalytic therapy can have its pluses and minuses. The degree to which these potential benefits and pitfalls influence the choice to use this approach depends on a variety of factors, including the individual's preferences and severity of symptoms. In the last few decades, there has been significant research validating this approach’s benefits. The therapist offers an empathetic and nonjudgmental environment where the client can feel safe in revealing feelings or actions that have led to stress and difficulties in his or her life. Often, simply sharing these burdens in the context of a therapeutic relationship can be beneficial. Furthermore, it has been shown that this type of self-examination can lead to continued emotional growth over time. As with all treatment methods, there are also potential downsides that should be considered. The financial costs associated with this treatment modality can be very high. Costs are often cited as the biggest downside of psychoanalytic therapy. This  has critics who claim that psychoanalytic therapy is too time-consuming, expensive, and generally ineffective. Some, such as Noam Chomsky and Karl Popper, have suggested that psychoanalysis lacked scientific basis. Misconceptions of this type of treatment are often connected to some of the earlier, more classical Freudian applications of psychoanalytic treatment. Psychoanalysis may be used to treat a number of different psychological conditions, including: People who are likely to benefit from this form of therapy are often those who have been experiencing symptoms for some time. People might choose psychoanalytic therapy when they have long-term symptoms of anxiety, depressed mood, and behaviors that have a negative impact on functioning and enjoyment of life. While some critics have derided the success rates of psychoanalytic therapy, recent research suggests that this treatment modality can be an effective treatment for a range of issues.﻿ One review of the effectiveness of long-term psychoanalytic therapies found moderate to large success rates for reducing symptoms of a variety of psychopathologies.﻿ Another large-scale study found that short-term psychoanalytic therapy was effective for general symptom improvement. In addition to these general improvements, the review also found that psychoanalytic treatment led to lasting improvements in somatic symptoms, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Patients who receive psychoanalytic treatment retain these gains and may continue to improve even after treatment ends. A 2010 review published in found that the scientific evidence supports that psychodynamic therapy was as effective as other evidence-based treatments. How Psychoanalysis Differs From Other Treatments What makes psychoanalytic therapy different from other forms of treatment? A review of the research comparing psychodynamic approaches to identified seven features that set the psychoanalytic approach apart.﻿ . Where CBT is centered on cognitions and behaviors, psychoanalytic therapy explores the full range of that a patient is experiencing. .People often avoid certain feelings, thoughts, and situations that they finddistressing. Understanding what patients are avoiding can help the therapist and client better explore why such avoidance comes into play. The identification of recurring patterns and themes in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.In some cases, people are aware of such repetitious actions but may be unable to break out of unhealthy or destructive patterns. At other times, patients are not aware of how such patterns influence their behaviors. . Other therapies often focus more on the here-and-now, or how current thoughts and behaviors influence how a patient functions. The psychoanalytic approach helps the patient explore their past and understand how it affects both the present and future. .Through the therapy process, patients are able to explore their relations with others, both current and past. . Because psychoanalytic therapy is so personal, the relationship between the therapist and the patient is an important part of the treatment process. . Where other therapies are often highly structured and goal-oriented, psychoanalytic therapy allows the patient to explore freely. Patients are free to give voice to fears, desires, dreams, and other urges that they have never spoken of before. If psychoanalytic therapy sounds like it might be right for you, the first step is to begin looking for a therapist who specializes in this form of treatment. To find a qualified psychoanalytic therapist, start by asking your primary care physician for recommendations. Your doctor can also put you in touch with a referral service if needed. Friends who have had a good experience with psychoanalytic treatment can also be another good source of recommendations. If you do not have a good referral from someone you know, there are a number of online therapist networks and directories that can point you in the right direction. Once you have identified a potential therapist, make a call to set up an initial consultation. During this consultation, you can further explore if psychoanalytic therapy is the right approach for you. Psychoanalytic therapy is just one mental health treatment approach that you may want to consider. This approach may provide benefits that might be well suited to your particular situation, but always talk to your doctor or therapist to determine which  method might be the most effective for your individual needs.

Here are five differences between coaching and psychotherapy to help you decide who might be more suited to help you along your journey. Psychotherapists Treat Mental Illness While Coaches Do Not One of the most important distinguishing factors between psychotherapists and coaches is that psychotherapists are trained to help people who are facing mental illnesses, and coaches are not. Even though a great deal of , mental health problems are more common than ever, impacting about one in four Americans at some point in their lifetimes.﻿ If you are seeking help for a common mental health problem such as , anxiety or , psychotherapy is the way to go. Generally speaking, coaching is more focused on helping you achieve your future goals, while psychotherapy tends to have more of a past and present focus. That being said, many coaches should be able to help you understand how the past contributes to your present, and psychotherapists can help you achieve your future goals. The focus in psychotherapy is more on healing from the past, while the focus in coaching is more on getting you to where you wish to be next. Because psychotherapy is about treating a mental health problem, it may be covered by your insurance company if you meet the criteria for a mental health disorder and the insurance company deems psychotherapy medically necessary to help you get better. Coaching is typically not covered by health insurance because the focus of coaching is not on treating an illness.  In order to legally provide psychotherapy, one requires an advanced degree and a state license to practice. To obtain a license to practice psychotherapy, one needs to meet certain criteria which include an exam and a certain number of supervised hours of practice.  While there are many certification programs for coaching, there are no governing boards for life or success coaches. Despite a lack of a governing board in the field of coaching, many coaches offer tremendous services and some originally practiced as psychotherapists. Psychotherapists face more restrictions than coaches in terms of where and how they are able to offer services. They must be licensed in the state in which they practice, for example, while coaches can work throughout all of the United States and internationally. Psychotherapy is more traditionally offered face to face in an office, while coaching happens frequently over the phone or via the internet. Even so, some psychotherapists offer services over the phone or via the internet and some coaches have offices in which they see clients. Some coaches choose to meet with clients in a public setting, which is rarer for psychotherapists. The above differences are generalizations and do not apply to all psychotherapists and coaches. In reality, the differences between two psychotherapists or two coaches may be greater than the difference between a coach and a psychotherapist, depending on who they are. If you are not clear on whether or or coach, interview a few from each profession and ask them about their approaches. Do your research to make sure that their backgrounds are legitimate, and choose the one that feels right for you.

Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Psychotherapy is a general term that is used to describe the process of treating and mental distress through the use of verbal and psychological techniques. During this process, a trained psychotherapist helps the client tackle specific or general problems such as a particular mental illness or a source of life stress. Depending on the approach used by the therapist, a wide range of techniques and strategies can be used. Almost all types of psychotherapy involve developing a , communicating and creating a dialogue, and working to overcome problematic thoughts or behaviors. Psychotherapy is increasingly viewed as a distinct profession in its own right, but many different types of professionals offer it, including , psychiatrists, counselors, , , mental health counselors, and psychiatric nurses. When many people hear the word ""psychotherapy,"" they immediately imagine a patient lying on a couch talking while a therapist sits in a nearby chair jotting down thoughts on a yellow notepad. The reality is that there are a variety of techniques and practices used in psychotherapy. The exact method used in each situation can vary based upon a variety of factors, including the training and background of the therapist, the preferences of the client, and the exact nature of the client's current problem. Here is a brief overview of the main types of therapy. While psychotherapy was practiced in various forms as far back as the time of the ancient Greeks, it received its formal start when began using talk therapy to work with patients. Techniques commonly used by Freud included the analysis of transference, dream interpretation, and free association. This involves delving into a patient's thoughts and past experiences to seek out unconscious thoughts, feelings, and memories that may influence behavior. When behaviorism became a more prominent school of thought during the early part of the twentieth-century, techniques such as different types of conditioning began to play an important role in psychotherapy. While behaviorism may not be as dominant as it once was, many of its methods are still very popular today. often uses , , and to help clients alter problematic behaviors. Starting in the 1950s, the school of thought known as began to have an influence on psychotherapy. The humanist psychologist developed an approach known as , which focused on the therapist showing to the client. Today, aspects of this approach remain widely used. The humanistic approach to psychotherapy focuses on helping people maximize their potential and stresses the importance of self-exploration, free will, and . The cognitive revolution of the 1960s also had a major impact on the practice of psychotherapy, as psychologists began to increasingly focus on how human thought processes influence behavior and functioning. Cognitive therapy is centered on the idea that our thoughts have a powerful influence on our mental well-being. For example, if you tend to see the negative aspects of every situation, you will probably have a more pessimistic outlook and a gloomier overall mood. The goal of cognitive therapy is to identify the cognitive distortions that lead to this type of thinking and replace such thoughts with more realistic and positive ones. By doing so, people are able to improve their moods and overall well-being. The approach known as (CBT) is a psychotherapeutic treatment that helps patients understand the thoughts and feelings that influence behaviors. CBT is used to treat a range of conditions including , addiction, depression, and anxiety. CBT involves cognitive and behavioral techniques to change negative thoughts and maladaptive behaviors. The approach helps people to change underlying thoughts that contribute to distress and modify problematic behaviors that result from these thoughts. Psychotherapy can take different formats depending on the style of the therapist and the needs of the patient. A few formats that you might encounter include: , which involves working one-on-one with a psychotherapist. , which involves a therapist working with a couple to help improve how the two function in their relationship , which centers on improving the dynamic within families and can include multiple individuals within a family unit , which involves a small group of individuals who share a common goal (This approach allows members of the group to offer and receive support from others, as well as practice new behaviors within a supportive and receptive group.) We've tried, tested and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, Betterhelp, and Regain. There are a number of issues or concerns for both therapists and clients. When , consider whether you feel comfortable divulging personal information to the therapist. You should also assess the therapist's qualifications, including the type of degree they hold and years of experience. People who provide psychotherapy can hold a number of different titles or degrees. Titles such as ""psychologist"" or ""psychiatrist"" are protected and carry specific educational and . Some of the individuals who are qualified to offer psychotherapy include psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, licensed social workers, and advanced psychiatric nurses. When providing services to clients, psychotherapists need to consider issues such as , patient confidentiality, and duty to warn. Informed consent involves notifying a client of all of the potential risks and benefits associated with treatment. This includes explaining the exact nature of the treatment, any possible risks, costs, and the available alternatives. Because clients frequently discuss issues that are highly personal and sensitive in nature, psychotherapists also have a legal obligation to protect a patient's right to confidentiality. However, one instance where psychotherapists have a right to breach patient confidentiality is if clients pose an imminent threat to either themselves or others. gives counselors and therapists the right to breach confidentiality if a client poses a risk to another person. One of the major criticisms leveled against psychotherapy calls into question its effectiveness. In one early and frequently cited study, a psychologist named found that two-thirds of participants either improved or recovered on their own within two years, regardless of whether they had received psychotherapy. However, in numerous subsequent studies, researchers found that psychotherapy can enhance the well-being of clients.﻿ In his book ""The Great Psychotherapy Debate,"" statistician and psychologist Bruce Wampold reported that factors such as the therapist’s personality as well as their belief in the effectiveness of the treatment played a role in the outcome of psychotherapy. Surprisingly, Wampold suggested that the type of therapy and the theoretical basis of the treatment do not have an effect on the outcome. The disagreement has motivated researchers to continue to examine and study the effectiveness of psychotherapy.﻿ You might realize that psychotherapy can help with life's problems, but it can still be difficult to seek help or to even recognize when it is time to talk to a professional. Some key signs that it might be time to see a psychotherapist include: The issue is causing significant distress or disruption in your life. If you feel that the problem you are facing interrupts a number of important areas of your life including school, work, and relationships, it may be time to see if psychotherapy can help. You are relying on unhealthy or dangerous coping mechanisms. If you find yourself dealing with your problem by smoking, drinking, overeating, or taking out your frustrations on others, seeking assistance can help you find healthier and more beneficial coping strategies. Friends and family are concerned about your well-being. If it has reached a point where other people are worried about your emotional health, it may be time to see if psychotherapy can improve your psychological state. You've read self-help books, explored some techniques you read about online, or even tried just ignoring the problem, yet things just seem to be staying the same or even getting worse. You don't have to wait until your life becomes so overwhelming that you can't cope to ask for help. The sooner you reach out, the sooner you can get the help you need to live a healthier, happier life. If you feel that you might benefit from psychotherapy, your first step is to discuss your concerns with your primary care physician. Your doctor might begin by that could cause or contribute to your symptoms. If no specific physical cause is found, your doctor can refer you to a mental health professional who is qualified to diagnose and treat mental illness. Your symptoms often play a role in the treatment and therapist you choose. For example, if the best treatment for you would require and psychotherapy, seeing a may be beneficial.﻿ A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who can prescribe medications and has specific training in the treatment of psychological and psychiatric conditions. If you would most benefit from some form of talk therapy without the addition of prescription drugs, you might be referred to a clinical psychologist or counselor. Referrals from friends and family members can sometimes be a good route to connecting with a therapist who can help you. Psychotherapy is both an art and a science. If your sessions don't feel helpful or you just don't seem to ""click"" with your current therapist, it's OK to try therapy with someone else. Keep looking until you find a professional that you feel comfortable with. As you evaluate a potential psychotherapist, consider the following questions: Does the therapist seem professional and qualified? Do you feel comfortable sharing your feelings and experiences? Are you satisfied with the extent of your interaction with the therapist? Psychotherapy comes in many forms, but all are designed to help people overcome challenges, develop coping strategies, and lead happier and healthier lives. If you are experiencing symptoms of a psychological or psychiatric disorder, you might benefit from an evaluation by a trained and experienced psychotherapist who is qualified to assess, diagnose, and treat mental health conditions. You can reap the possible benefits of psychotherapy even if you just feel that there is something ""off"" in your life that might be improved by consulting with a mental health professional.

Psychotherapy is an effective treatment that is often combined with other treatments. Psychotherapy, sometimes referred to as talk therapy, is a relationship in which the patient seeks professional help from a licensed provider to address difficult or troubling feelings, thoughts, attitudes and/or behaviors. In other words, the psychotherapist helps individuals make important changes in their lives. Psychotherapy is an effective treatment for a variety of psychological concerns. It can be a standalone treatment or combined with medications or other therapies. Your treatment team will work with you to determine which therapies offer you the best opportunity for improved health and well-being. Psychotherapy can be helpful treatment for virtually all mental health problems and concerns, including: Mood disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder) Anxiety disorders (e.g., obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, phobias) Addictions (e.g., alcoholism, substance abuse disorder, compulsive gambling) Personality disorders (e.g., borderline personality disorder, dependent personality disorder) Stress and adjustment disorders (e.g., PTSD, acute stress disorder) Psychotherapy can also benefit those who haven’t been diagnosed with a psychological disorder. A licensed therapist can help you work through stress and other conflicts that we all face throughout life, such as medical or chronic illness, major life changes, grief, sleep problems and other issues. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a blend of cognitive (thought) and behavioral (action) therapy. It may benefit people diagnosed with , and and . program combines elements of cognitive therapy with meditative practices and attitudes based on the cultivation of mindfulness. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) helps people who have problems regulating feelings and tolerating stress Metacognitive remediation therapy is a form of talk therapy to improve memory, attention and problem solving and improve participation in work and school for individuals with psychotic-spectrum disorders such as and with psychotic features. Family-focused therapy seeks to improve relationships, which may help improve treatment outcomes  Your typically involves the therapist gathering basic information about you and your goals for therapy. You'll be asked to fill out forms about your medical history, social history and current and past emotional/mental health prior to your visit. The therapist will review this information with you in your first session. In your first few sessions with your therapist, you’ll work together on a treatment plan to make sure you agree on treatment goals, what type of therapy best meets your needs and how long treatment will last. Your therapist will likely expect you to complete “homework” assignments between sessions—for example, worksheets, readings or behaviors to try. Evidence shows that patients who do between-session work tend to have better therapy outcomes. Psychotherapy sessions typically last between 45 and 60 minutes, and their frequency will be determined by your individual needs. Typically, early sessions take place weekly or every other week. As symptoms improve, sessions tend to be spaced out. Many patients begin to feel better or at least become more aware of their thoughts or actions after three to five psychotherapy sessions. A typical course of CBT lasts 10 to 16 sessions, but everyone is different and has different needs. You’ll get the most out of psychotherapy if you’re open and honest in sessions and treat therapy as a partnership, ensuring that you and your therapist set goals together and both understand the major issues to address. It’s OK if you’re not prepared right away to open up about your emotions. Bringing out certain feelings takes time. Many don’t feel entirely comfortable with the process at first, and if this is the case, you can work with your therapist to make changes that will help you get the most out of the experience.

Reihe Internationale Psychotherapie: Japan – Zwischen Tradition und westlichen Einflüssen Reihe Internationale Psychotherapie: Japan – Zwischen Tradition und westlichen Einflüssen Die Rolle klinischer Psychologen ist zwiespältig: Sie übernehmen wichtige Funktionen in der Gesundheitsversorgung, andererseits scheuen sich viele Japaner, bei psychischen Problemen Hilfe zu suchen. Klinische Psychologie und Psychotherapie haben in Japan eine wechselvolle Geschichte. Erste Ansätze, eine westlich geprägte Psychologie einzuführen, gab es bereits nach der Meiji-Restauration (1868). So kehrte beispielsweise der Philosoph Shoichi Toyama nach seinem Studium an der Universität Michigan (USA) an die Universität Tokio (Japan) zurück und setzte sich dort mit Wahrnehmung, Kognitionen, Emotionen, Gewohnheiten, Wille und Gedächtnis auseinander. Er und andere japanische Wissenschaftler beschäftigten sich zudem mit Somnambulismus und Spiritualismus, und Psychiater an der Universität Tokio behandelten hysterische Patienten mit suggestiven Techniken (zum Beispiel Hypnose) und Elektrotherapie nach Franz Anton Mesmer. Ein weiterer Vorreiter der Psychologie in Japan war Yuzero Motora. Er stammte aus einer Samurai-familie, hatte in den USA studiert und lehrte ab 1890 Psychologie an der Imperial-Universität (Japan). Er beschäftigte sich mit Aufmerksamkeitsprozessen, entwickelte Aufmerksamkeitstrainings für lernbehinderte Grundschüler und veröffentlichte seine Forschungsergebnisse unter anderem in der deutschen Zeitschrift für Kinderforschung (1911). Zu Motoras Schülern gehörte Tomokichi Fukurai, der ab 1908 an der Tokio-Imperial-Universität (Japan) lehrte. Sein Interesse galt anfangs der experimentellen Forschung, Hypnose und abnormalen Phänomenen, dann aber wandte er sich zunehmend der Parapsychologie zu und beschäftigte sich mit Hellsehen und Gedankenlesen. Er glaubte, dass entsprechend begabte Personen den Inhalt ihrer Gedanken auf eine Fotoplatte projizieren könnten, ohne eine Kamera zu benutzen, und nannte diese Technik „Gedankengrafie“ oder „Nen-Grafie“. Mit seinen Experimenten erweckte er viel Aufmerksamkeit, aber auch Misstrauen, und schon bald wurde ihm Betrug vorgeworfen, den er aber von sich wies. Es kam zum Skandal, und Fukurai wurde entlassen. Seine Forschungen hatten den Ruf der Psychologie in Japan ruiniert, und obwohl ein anderer Schüler Motoras, der Universitätsprofessor Matataro Matsumoto von der Tokio-Imperial-Universität, eine Hinwendung zu „normalen“ psychologischen Phänomenen forderte, um die Glaubwürdigkeit der wissenschaftlichen Psychologie wiederherzustellen, stagnierte die Entwicklung des Fachs von nun an. Psychoanalytische Einflüsse Zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts trafen japanische Psychiater und Wissenschaftler wie Hikozo Kakise, Marui Kiyoyasu und Heisaku Kosawa in Österreich und den USA Sigmund Freud, C. G. Jung und andere Psychoanalytiker und führten in Japan die Psychoanalyse ein, die daraufhin nicht nur Psychologie und Psychiatrie, sondern auch die Küns-te und andere gesellschaftliche Bereiche beeinflusste. Durch Kakise und Kollegen erlebte die westlich geprägte, klinische Psychologie zwischen 1912 und 1926 einen deutlichen Aufschwung in Japan. Gleichzeitig entstanden aber auch Therapien, die ihre Wurzeln in den einheimischen Traditionen, insbesondere im Buddhismus haben. Eine dieser Therapien ist die Morita-Therapie (1928), benannt nach deren Begründer, dem Psychiater Masatake (Shoma) Morita. Er litt in seiner Jugend unter neurotischen Symptomen und Ängsten, wurde psychiatrisch behandelt und entwickelte als eine Art Selbsthilfe eine Therapie, die die Akzeptanz des Schicksals und den Einklang des Menschen mit der Natur zum Ziel hat. Der Klient kämpft nicht und wehrt sich nicht, sondern nimmt das Leben widerspruchslos hin, auch neurotische Ängste. Er versucht, mit allem in Frieden zu leben und achtsam zu werden. Dadurch unterbricht er Kreisläufe und Gewohnheiten und gewinnt Einblick in sein Inneres sowie neue Sichtweisen seines Lebens und der Welt. Die Therapie gliedert sich in vier Phasen, wobei der Klient zunächst innehält und sich eine Auszeit nimmt; dann steigert er allmählich wieder seine Aktivität bis hin zu starker Anstrengung. Wichtig ist dabei, dass er das, was er im Ruhezustand gelernt hat, in sein Leben integriert und fortan ausgeglichener, geordneter und mit neuem Bewusstsein für die Natur lebt. Die Große Depression, der Ausbruch des Pazifikkrieges (1937) und der drohende Zweite Weltkrieg führten dazu, dass die japanische Regierung Gelder für wissenschaftliche Ausbildung und Forschung in den 1930er-Jahren weitgehend strich. Psychologen und Psychiater wurden in den Kriegsdienst eingezogen und während des Krieges zunehmend in der Versorgung und Rehabilitation von Verwundeten eingesetzt. Beinahe alle akademischen Aktivitäten lagen in dieser Zeit danieder. Nach der Kapitulation Japans (1945) und der Besatzungszeit (1945– 1952) kam es zu großen politischen und gesellschaftlichen Veränderungen, die auch die Wissenschaft und das Bildungssystem betrafen und die Psychologie zu einem wichtigen Bestandteil der wissenschaftlichen und demokratischen Erziehung machten. Die Besatzer (hauptsächlich US-Amerikaner) ließen die klinische Psychologie in Japan wieder aufleben und wiesen den Psychologen neben den klassischen auch neue Aufgaben zu, zum Beispiel in Beratung, Erziehung und Wirtschaft. Die klinische Psychologie wurde sehr populär, was bis heute der Fall ist, und westliche Einflüsse, wie etwa die Verhaltenstherapie (eingeführt 1956) und die nichtdirektive Beratung (nach Carl Rogers), wurden von japanischen Psychiatern und Psychologen begeistert aufgenommen. Durch Medidation zu Einsicht und Selbsterkenntnis Doch auch in dieser Zeit gab es wieder eine Art Gegenbewegung zur „Verwestlichung“ des Therapieangebots. 1954 begründete der Buddhist Ishin Yoshimoto die Naikan-Therapie und eröffnete das erste Naikan-Center. Die Naikan-Therapie zeigt einen Weg auf, der durch Aufmerksamkeit, meditative Aufarbeitung und stille, intensive Betrachtung der eigenen Lebensgeschichte alte Blockaden und Beziehungsmuster auflösen und zu Einsicht und Selbsterkenntnis führen soll. Der Klient stellt sich drei Fragen, nämlich was ein ihm nahe stehender Mensch (zum Beispiel die Mutter) in einem bestimmten Zeitraum (meist in 5-Jahres-Schritten) für ihn getan hat, was er für diesen Menschen in dem Zeitraum getan hat und welche Schwierigkeiten er diesem Menschen in diesem Zeitraum bereitet hat. Die Fragen werden innerlich, in der Stille beantwortet. Es werden nur tatsächliche Ereignisse erinnert, und der Klient versucht, mit Beschämung umzugehen, Selbstzentriertheit zu überwinden und Lösungen zu finden, um zu einer intensiven Versöhnung mit den Eltern und Angehörigen und letztlich zu einer veränderten Wahrnehmung der Welt zu gelangen. Mitte der 60er-Jahre wurden erstmals Rufe nach Akkreditierung des Psychologenberufs laut. 1964 gründeten Psychologen die Japanische Gesellschaft für klinische Psychologie (Japanese Association of Clinical Psychology, JACP), deren Bemühungen um eine staatliche Anerkennung jedoch an der damals vorherrschenden Kritik am Wissenschaftsbetrieb (Campus-Disput) und an internen Querelen scheiterten. 1982 fand die Gründung der Gesellschaft für japanische klinische Psychologie (Association of Japanese Clinical Psychology, AJCP) statt, die mit mehr als 15 000 Mitgliedern heute die größte unter den mehr als 30 Psychologenvereinigungen Japans ist. Aber auch ihr gelang es nicht, einen gesetzlich geregelten Zugang zu Ausbildung und Beruf und eine staatliche Anerkennung zu bewirken. Aus diesem Grund gab es in der Folgezeit zahlreiche Privatinitiativen, um eine Zertifizierung zu ermöglichen. So gründeten beispielsweise akademische Psychologenvereinigungen 1988 die Japanische Gesellschaft für zertifizierte klinische Psychologen (Japanese Society of Certified Clinical Psychologists, JSCCP) und die Japanische Zertifizierungskommission für klinische Psychologen (Japanese Certification Board for Clinical Psychologists, JCBCP), die mittlerweile mehr als 13 000 Psychologen zertifiziert haben. Viele Universitäten begannen, Ausbildungsprogramme zur Zertifizierung anzubieten. Trotz dieser Vorstöße ist das Zulassungsverfahren für Psychologen und Psychotherapeuten in Japan sehr unübersichtlich. Bis heute ist es ihnen nicht möglich, einen staatlich anerkannten Abschluss zu erwerben, was sich ungünstig auf ihre Beschäftigungsmöglichkeiten auswirkt. Ungeschützte Berufsbezeichnung Da die Berufsbezeichnung „Psychotherapeut“ in Japan nicht geschützt ist und keine formale Ausbildung erfordert, gibt es keine genauen Angaben über die Anzahl der Psychotherapieanbieter. Zudem darf sich jeder als Psychotherapeut ausgeben, weshalb Psychotherapie nicht nur von Ärzten und Psychologen, sondern beispielsweise auch von Sozialarbeitern, Pharmazeuten oder Zahnmedizinern praktiziert wird. Eine Übernahme der Kosten für eine zeitlich befristete Psychotherapie durch das staatliche Gesundheitssystem in Verbindung mit einer Zuzahlung durch den Klienten erfolgt nur, wenn Psychotherapie von einem Arzt verordnet wird. Der Gang direkt zum Psychotherapeuten ist daher nur möglich, wenn der Klient die Kosten selbst trägt. Klinische Psychologen in Japan sind heutzutage in ganz unterschiedlichen Bereichen tätig, beispielsweise in Schulen, Universitäten, Erziehungseinrichtungen, Sozialeinrichtungen und Wirtschaftsunternehmen. Ihre Rolle in der Gesellschaft ist jedoch zwiespältig. Einerseits übernehmen sie wichtige Funktionen in der Gesundheitsversorgung oder in der Opferbetreuung nach Terroranschlägen oder Erdbeben und erfahren dadurch viel Beachtung in der Bevölkerung, andererseits haben viele Japaner Hemmungen, einen Psychologen oder Psychotherapeuten bei psychischen Problemen aufzusuchen. Die hohen Kosten einer psychotherapeutischen Behandlung und die Scheu vor Psychotherapie fordern jedoch ihren Tribut. Wie Wissenschaftler des Nationalinstituts für Mentale Gesundheit in Tokio durch bevölkerungsrepräsentative Umfragen herausfanden, nimmt die Mehrzahl der psychisch oder psychiatrisch erkrankten Japaner, vor allem die weniger gebildeten, keinerlei medizinische oder therapeutische Hilfe in Anspruch. So auch Frau A. aus dem Fallbeispiel (siehe Kasten). „Obwohl sie unter erheblichen Depressionen, Ängsten und psychosozialen Belas-tungen leidet, wäre es typisch für japanische Verhältnisse, wenn sie erst über Umwege in psychotherapeutische Behandlung käme“, meint Yoshinobu Kanazawa von der Meiji-Gakuin-Universität. Da Japaner sehr erziehungs- und leistungsorientiert sind, würden zunächst nicht die Probleme der Mutter, sondern hauptsächlich die schulischen Schwierigkeiten der Kinder auffallen und folgenden Prozess in Gang setzen: Der Klassenlehrer der Kinder spricht mit der Mutter und konsultiert einen schulischen Berater, der oft ein klinischer Psychologe ist. Lehrer und Berater beobachten die Kinder und empfehlen der Mutter, die Kinder zu einem Erziehungszentrum (Kyoiku-Center) zu bringen. Dort führen Psychologen parallele Gespräche mit der Mutter und den Kindern. Gemeinsame Gespräche mit allen Familienmitgliedern sind hingegen unüblich, weil die meisten japanischen Psychologen in individuellen Therapien ausgebildet und mit familientherapeutischen und systemorientierten Ansätzen nicht vertraut sind; darüber hinaus wird die Mutter als wichtigste Bezugsperson der Kinder angesehen. Der Vater und andere Familienmitglieder sind deshalb von Beratung und Therapie ausgeschlossen. Die bedeutsame Rolle der Mutter für die Kinder wird in Japan allerdings auch dahingehend ausgelegt, dass die Mutter für die Kinder und somit für deren Probleme allein verantwortlich ist. Mütter mit „nicht funktionierenden“ Kindern werden deshalb oft von Familienmitgliedern, Bekannten oder Kollegen beschuldigt, stigmatisiert oder als „Rabenmütter“ beschimpft. Eine Methode, die vor allem bei der psychotherapeutischen Behandlung von Kindern eingesetzt wird, ist das „Sandspiel“, das 1965 von Hayao Kawai eingeführt wurde. Beim Sandspiel handelt es sich um eine sprachfreie Technik, bei der der Klient in einem freien, kreativen Spiel den Sand in einem Sandkasten arrangiert, um unbewussten Vorgängen Ausdruck zu verleihen. Kawai wurde zum Sandspiel durch die Lehre Jungs inspiriert; er hat die Psychologie in Japan nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg nachhaltig beeinflusst und vertrat die Meinung, dass sich Geist und Psyche des Menschen dem Psychologen nur erschließen, wenn er in die anteilnehmende Beobachtung des Klienten auch Mythen, Märchen, Literatur, Kunst, Metaphern und Bilder aus dessen Kultur einbezieht. Im Erziehungszentrum wird mithilfe projektiver und anderer Diagnoseverfahren bei Frau A. eine Depression festgestellt. Damit rückt sie zum ersten Mal selbst in den Mittelpunkt der Aufmerksamkeit. Da das Erziehungszentrum jedoch nicht für die Behandlung Erwachsener zuständig ist, wird Frau A. an einen Psychiater überwiesen. Sie kann nun eine örtliche psychiatrische Klinik, einen niedergelassenen Arzt oder eine Klinik für psychosomatische Medizin aufsuchen. Letztere heißen auf japanisch „shinryo-naika“, wobei „naika“ „innere Medizin“ bedeutet, was für japanische Ohren offenbar weniger bedrohlich klingt als „psychosomatisch“ oder „psychiatrisch“. Psychodynamische Verfahren seltener eingesetzt Nur ein Arzt darf die Diagnose stellen und über die Behandlung entscheiden. Er führt die Psychotherapie dann entweder selbst durch oder verschreibt der Patientin Antidepressiva oder Tranquillizer und bezieht einen Psychotherapeuten mit ein. Welche Art von Psychotherapie Frau A. erhält, hängt hauptsächlich von der Ausbildung und den Vorlieben des Psychotherapeuten ab. In Japan sind drei Viertel (74 Prozent) der Psychotherapeuten eklektisch und zusätzlich humanistisch (51 Prozent), psychoanalytisch und jungianisch (42 Prozent), verhaltenstherapeutisch und kognitiv-behavioral (40 Prozent) oder systemisch (17 Prozent) orientiert. Eklektisch bedeutet, dass der Therapeut Konzepte, Hypothesen und Techniken von verschiedenen Therapierichtungen auswählt, sie an den jeweiligen Klienten und seine spezifischen Probleme anpasst und sie nacheinander oder gleichzeitig einsetzt. Obwohl relativ viele Psychotherapeuten psychoanalytisch orientiert sind, werden Psychoanalyse und psychodynamische Verfahren immer seltener eingesetzt, denn das staatliche Gesundheitssystem vergütet langwierige Psychotherapien schlecht. Aus diesem Grund steigt das Interesse japanischer Therapeuten an kognitiv-behavioralen und Kurzzeittherapien. Benötigt ein Klient hingegen eine längere und intensivere Therapie, muss er sie aus eigener Tasche bezahlen. „Für japanische Psychotherapeuten ist ein gutes Arbeitsbündnis mit dem Klienten eines der wichtigsten Ziele“, erklärt Kanazawa. Allerdings sind Symptomreduktion, Veränderung von Kognitionen oder Lösungen psychischer Probleme für sie eher nebensächliche Ziele, und auch ihre therapeutische Haltung entspricht einheimischen Vorstellungen, denn sie verstehen sich in erster Linie als Lotsen und Begleiter, die ihre Klienten anleiten, sich selbst besser kennenzulernen, aufmerksam für ihr Seelenleben zu werden und Verständnis für ihre Probleme zu erlangen. Sie stehen den Klienten bei, hören zu und versuchen, an deren innerer Erfahrungswelt teilzuhaben, intervenieren aber selten. Nach dem Erstinterview, das auch Fragen nach den Umständen der Geburt, Geburtsgewicht oder Unfällen beinhalten kann, werden Behandlungsziele besprochen, die nach westlichen Vorstellungen ziemlich unbestimmt wirken. Sie bestehen beispielsweise darin, „besser mit den Kollegen auszukommen“, „sich energiegeladener zu fühlen“ oder „optimistischer und weniger ängstlich zu sein“. Der Therapieerfolg wird selten mithilfe von Testinstrumenten ermittelt und bleibt daher in der Regel subjektiv. Neben der Stärkung des Selbstwertgefühls und des allgemeinen Befindens des Klienten wird manchmal auch an einer Verbesserung der Beziehungen zu den Familienmitgliedern oder den Kollegen gearbeitet, ohne diese jedoch persönlich einzubeziehen. Gruppentherapie oder Selbsthilfegruppen und -maßnahmen werden in Japan ebenfalls äußerst selten angeboten. Dazu meint Kanazawa: „Psychotherapie wird fast ausschließlich individuell und in Einzelsitzungen durchgeführt. Das steht jedoch im Widerspruch zur kollektivistischen Kultur Japans.“ Dr. phil.

Richtlinien-Psychotherapie: Die Entscheidung über die Notwendigkeit ist komplex Richtlinien-Psychotherapie: Die Entscheidung über die Notwendigkeit ist komplex Es besteht eine erhebliche Nachfrage nach Richtlinien-Psychotherapie – bei begrenzten Ressourcen. Die Frage stellt sich immer, wann diese notwendig, indiziert, machbar, nützlich, hilfreich, wünschenswert, wirtschaftlich oder optimal ist. Etwa ein Viertel der Bevölkerung, das heißt circa 20 Millionen Menschen in Deutschland, leiden nach wiederholten epidemiologischen Untersuchungen gemäß der Kriterien von ICD-10 und DSM-IV unter psychischen Störungen. Diese können ohne Ausnahme sinnvoll und evidenzbasiert psychotherapeutisch behandelt werden, seien es Persönlichkeitsstörungen, Suchterkrankungen, Depressionen, Angsterkrankungen, schizophrene Erkrankungen oder auch Demenzerkrankungen. Des Weiteren leiden fast alle Menschen im Verlauf ihres Lebens unter körperlichen Erkrankungen mit Psychotherapieindikation. Schließlich sind alle wiederholt in ihrem Leben mit schwerwiegenden Belastungen konfrontiert, wie zum Beispiel Autounfällen, Ehescheidungen, Todesfällen, Pensionierung, negativen Migrationserfahrungen, hohen Arbeitsbelastungen oder Arbeitslosigkeit. Auch hierfür gibt es gut begründete Einsatzmöglichkeiten von Psychotherapie. Schlussendlich kann man auch gesunde Menschen unter präventiver Perspektive psychotherapeutisch unterstützen, wie zum Beispiel mit einem Stressbewältigungstraining. Es gibt also eine nahezu unbegrenzte Zahl an legitimen, fachlich begründbaren und evidenzbasierten Behandlungsindikationen für Psychotherapie. Zudem sind viele Fälle Langzeiterkrankungen, so dass regelhaft auch noch eine lebenslange Psychotherapie begründbar wäre. Bedenkt man die Zahl potenzieller Indikationen, für die es Behandlungsoptionen gibt (machbare Psychotherapie), die evidenzbasiert eine Besserung von Leid erwarten lassen (nützliche, hilfreiche oder erfolgversprechende Psychotherapie) und die auch dem Hilfsbedürfnis Betroffener (wünschenswert) entgegenkommen, dann ergibt sich daraus, dass es niemals genügend Psychotherapeuten geben kann, um alle Bedürfnisse und Indikationen für Psychotherapie abzudecken. Dies gilt auch dann, wenn man berücksichtigt, dass es viele Anwendungsformen von Psychotherapie gibt, wie langfristige Patientenführung oder supportive Psychotherapie durch niedergelassene Ärzte, die psychosomatische Grundversorgung oder die Richtlinienpsychotherapie als zielgerichtete, beantragte, begutachtete, bewilligte und kontingentierte Maßnahme. Von daher ist eine wichtige Frage, wer bei begrenzten Ressourcen unter welchen Bedingungen Psychotherapie erhalten sollte und wer nicht. Diese Unterscheidung wird sozialrechtlich mit den Begriffen der „Notwendigkeit“ und „Wirtschaftlichkeit“ beschrieben und wird im Sozialgesetzbuch V in § 12 Abs. 1 unter „Wirtschaftlichkeitsgebot“ und in § 70 Abs. 1 ausgeführt. Das „Notwendigkeitsgebot“ bezieht sich auf den Einzelfall. Notwendigkeit ist nicht gleichzusetzen mit indiziert, machbar, nützlich, hilfreich, wünschenswert, brauchbar, prognostisch erfolgversprechend oder optimal. Nützlich und hilfreich kann Psychotherapie bei allen der oben angesprochenen Behandlungsindikationen sein. Mit Blick auf das Notwendigkeitsgebot nennen die Psychotherapierichtlinien explizit Indikationsausschlüsse, wie die Förderung der schulischen oder beruflichen Anpassung sowie Ehe-, Lebens- oder Sexualberatung, und grenzen Psychotherapie zulasten der Sozialversicherungen im Sinne einer Krankenbehandlung auf psychische Störungen ein. Dabei ist unbenommen, dass zum Beispiel Eheprobleme schwere Lebensbelastungen darstellen, mit viel Leid einhergehen, negative soziale Auswirkungen haben und positiv beeinflusst werden können. Die preiswerteste Behandlung sollte angewendet werden „Notwendigkeit und Wirtschaftlichkeit“ sind zunächst zu bestimmen über die Prognose. Eine Therapie ist grundsätzlich nur dann gerechtfertigt, wenn es guten Grund zu der Annahme gibt, dass nach einer Behandlung ein nachhaltig besserer Zustand des Patienten erwartet werden kann als ohne. Das „Wirtschaftlichkeitsgebot“ ist zu operationalisieren durch einen Vergleich gegebener Behandlungsalternativen. Da Psychotherapie zulasten der Solidargemeinschaft durchgeführt wird, ist ethisch und sozialpolitisch zu fordern, dass unter gleichwertigen Behandlungsalternativen die preiswerteste zur Anwendung kommt. So kann eine Einzelpsychotherapie eines Alkoholabhängigen fachlich gut begründbar sein und dennoch nicht notwendig, da es gute Daten gibt, die zeigen, dass Selbsthilfegruppen das gleiche Ergebnis bringen. Daher wäre es im Einzelfall möglicherweise sozialrechtlich nicht korrekt und mit Blick auf die Solidargemeinschaft unethisch, Gelder für eine teure Richtlinien-Psychotherapie auszugeben. Wer privat bezahlt, kann diese Solidarpflicht ignorieren. In diesem Sinne steht jede Richtlinien-Psychotherapie auch in unmittelbarer Konkurrenz zur psychotherapeutischen Unterstützung im Rahmen der Grundversorgung, beispielsweise durch Hausärzte, da empirische Studien gezeigt haben, dass dies in vielen Fällen vergleichbare Ergebnisse bringt. Bezüglich der Praxis der Richtlinien-Psychotherapie gibt es derzeit keine verlässlichen Daten, in wie vielen Fällen (a) keine Krankheit, sondern Probleme in der Lebensführung vorliegen, (b) von Beginn an absehbar ist, dass die Prognose der Behandlung negativ ist, (c) das Therapieziel auch durch preiswertere Alternativen erreicht werden kann, (d) eine Abwägung von Kosten und Nutzen gegen eine Psychotherapie spricht. Nach eigener Erfahrung liegt regelhaft eine Indikation für Psychotherapie vor. Allerdings ist der Eindruck, dass es doch einen relevanten Anteil an Fällen gibt, in denen die Notwendigkeit nicht zwingend gegeben ist oder verneint werden kann. Es gibt Fälle, in denen allgemeine Lebensbelastungen oder die Unzufriedenheit mit der eigenen biografischen Entwicklung der Behandlungsanlass sind. Es gibt Fälle bei denen es gute Gründe für die Annahme gibt, dass sie sich spontan wieder bessern. Es gibt Fälle, bei denen von Beginn an absehbar ist, dass bei dem vorliegenden Krankheitsbild überdauernde positive Effekte unwahrscheinlich sind. Es gibt Fälle, die ein hohes Nebenwirkungspotenzial erkennen lassen, so dass die Kosten-Nutzen-Abwägung mit Fragezeichen zu versehen ist. Nach eigenem Eindruck ist in einem Drittel der Gutachtenanträge die Frage der Notwendigkeit diskutierbar, wenn auch die Quote der nicht bewilligten Anträge bei drei bis vier Prozent liegt. Werden Therapieplätze ohne Notwendigkeit vergeben, dann stehen sie nicht mehr für die Patienten zur Verfügung, bei denen eine Richtlinien-Psychotherapie unverzichtbar ist. Der Nachfragedruck wird verstärkt, die Wartelisten werden länger und die Zahl von Psychotherapien im Rahmen der Kostenerstattung steigt. Die Kosten für letztere haben sich in den vergangenen zehn Jahren von 1,7 Millionen Euro auf 15,5 Millionen Euro pro Quartal verzehnfacht. Der vielfach vorgetragene Vorschlag, dieses Problem durch die Zulassung weiterer Psychotherapeuten zu lösen, ist unrealistisch, da es niemals genug Psychotherapeuten geben kann, um die Nachfrage zu decken. In anderen Ländern wird der Zugang zur Psychotherapie dadurch gesteuert, dass von den Patienten eine Selbstbeteiligung verlangt wird, was zwar die Nachfrage einschränkt, aber auch Hilfsbedürftige in besonderer Weise trifft. Andere Gesundheitssysteme kennen den „Gate-Keeper“, das heißt, dass eine Psychotherapie nur auf Überweisung erfolgen kann, was eine fachliche Vorauswahl ermöglicht. In Deutschland wäre das dadurch zu erreichen, dass Richtlinien-Psychotherapie an eine Überweisung gebunden und der Direktzugang eingeschränkt wird. Die Krankenkassen diskutieren, die Zahl der Behandlungsfälle durch veränderte Begutachtungsfristen oder verkürzte Stundenzahlen zu erhöhen oder die Begutachtung durch standardisierte Instrumente zu ergänzen. Gutachterverfahren dient der Ressourcen-Allokation Grundsätzlich ist bei all diesen Vorschlägen zu bedenken, dass die Entscheidung über die Notwendigkeit einer Therapie sehr komplex ist, die Berücksichtigung vielfältiger Faktoren erfordert und vor allem auch ein umfassendes Fachverständnis derer, die zu urteilen haben. Das derzeitige Gutachterverfahren erfüllt prinzipiell alle diese Voraussetzungen. Allerdings wäre mit Blick auf die hohen Bewilligungsraten zu prüfen, ob nicht zu sehr auf therapeutische Aspekte der Indikationsprüfung abgestellt wird und zu wenig auf das Notwendigkeits- und Wirtschaftlichkeitsgebot. Dabei ist zu berücksichtigen, dass das Gutachterverfahren seiner Natur nach keine Kosten sparen, sondern nur darüber entscheiden kann, wer in diese mengenbegrenzte Behandlung kommt und wer anderweitig zu betreuen ist. Das heißt, es geht um eine Ressourcen-Allokation und damit um die Erfüllung des Sicherstellungsauftrags.

Schonrein die aktuelle Sachlage widerspricht den Verfassern Prof. Dr. Linden und Prof. Dr. Freyberger schlagen in ihrem Artikel eine Rationierung medizinisch notwendiger Leistungen vor, um mangelnde Versorgungskapazitäten auszugleichen. Vorgeblich soll diese Rationierung über eine entsprechend erweiterte Wirtschaftlichkeitsprüfung vollzogen werden. Im derzeitigen Gesundheitssystem erfolgt aber die Wirtschaftlichkeitsprüfung schon dahingehend, dass nur Behandlungsverfahren von den Krankenkassen übernommen werden, für die für die jeweilige Erkrankung wissenschaftliche Wirksamkeitsnachweise vorliegen. Die Wirksamkeit von Psychotherapie liegt für die ihr entsprechenden Indikationen etwa genauso hoch, wie die von Psychopharmaka. Zusätzlich muss hier Beachtung finden, dass in unserem Gesundheitssystem auch dann Behandlungen durchgeführt werden, wenn das Leiden dadurch nur gelindert oder die Verschlechterung eines Leidens nur gemindert werden kann. Das muss auch für Psychotherapie gleichermaßen gelten. Wenn eine Psychotherapie unwirtschaftlich ist, weil generell Behandlungsalternativen wirkungsvoller oder kostengünstiger sind, ist das Aufgabe des gemeinsamen Bundes­aus­schusses, hier entsprechende grundsätzliche Vorgaben zu erarbeiten. Da wurde aber jetzt ganz im Gegenteil Psychotherapie nicht weiter eingeschränkt, so wie es die Autoren hier im Grunde vorschlagen sondern sogar eine Erweiterung, die uneingeschränkte Indikation für die Behandlung von Schizophrenie, beschlossen.Außerdem ist eine zusätzliche Rationierung von Behandlungsangeboten vorgeblich unter dem Gesichtspunkt der Wirtschaftlichkeit, nur weil es zu wenig Behandlungsplätze gibt, in unserem Gesundheitssystem nicht vorgesehen. So etwas widerspricht hier dem Grundgedanken der solidarischen und für jeden gleichermaßen zugänglichen Gesundheitsversorgung. Eine solche Überlegung ist sowohl mit dem SGB, als auch mit den ethischen Grundlagen unseres Gesundheitssystems in Deutschland oder mit dem hippokratischen Eid kaum zu vereinbaren. Bei einer genaueren Prüfung der Überlegungen von Herrn Prof. Dr. Linden und Herrn Prof. Dr. Freyberger wird zusätzlich deutlich, dass die Autoren äußerst schlecht informiert sind. Das SGB V bestimmt, dass nur tatsächlich Erkrankte medizinisch behandelt werden dürfen, aber auch müssen. Das gilt auch für den Bereich der Psychotherapie. Hier davon auszugehen, dass psychotherapeutische Behandlungen in einer verifizierbaren Anzahl ohne entsprechende Indikation durchgeführt werden, ist abwegig. Repräsentative Studien, wie die der TK, belegen das. Wenn hier aber gemeint ist, dass auch Erkrankungen nach dem ICD 10 nicht behandelt werden sollen, die in Folge eines schlechten Lebenswandels entstehen, wäre das noch bedenklicher. Diese Frage müsste man dann auch bei Diabetes, Alkoholerkrankungen, Rückenleiden etc. stellen. Eine solche Rationierung gerade und ausschließlich im Bereich der psychischen Gesundheit zu fordern, ist zusätzlich sehr bedenklich und weckt hier Erinnerungen an andere Zeiten, die wir, so müsste man annehmen, hier in Deutschland doch inzwischen überwunden hätten.Auch was Kosten und Nutzen von Psychotherapie betrifft irren die Autoren: Nachgewiesen ist, dass jeder Euro, der in Psychotherapie investiert wird, etwa 3 Euro für das Gesundheits- und Sozialsystem einspart. Insofern ist Psychotherapie keine teure Behandlungsform. Auch die Zunahme der Kostenerstattungen ist nicht so erheblich wie von Prof. Linden und Prof. Freyberger dargestellt. Bei Gesamtausgaben von etwa 1,8 Mrd.. Euro für Psychotherapie, sind etwa 15 Mill. Euro an Erstattungskosten weniger als 1% der Gesamtausgaben für Psychotherapie. Dabei ist die Kostenerstattung nur etwa halb so teuer, wie das von den Autoren so favorisierte Gutacherverfahren (Kosten / Jahr etwa 28 Mio.). Dieses Gutachterverfahren kommt nicht der Volksgesundheit zu Gute, sondern nur den Gutachtern, und trifft auch nicht wirklich valide Entscheidungen – ist also im wesentlichen eine rein moralische Instanz mit der Psychotherapeuten zum sorgsamen Arbeiten angehalten werden und Psychotherapie offiziell gut begründet werden kann.Die inhaltliche und statistische Analyse des Gutachterverfahrens zeigt ohnehin, dass es keine besseren Vorraussagen liefert als z.B. testgestützte Antragsverfahren (TK Studie) intransparent ist und auch in sich wenig innere Konsistenz zeigt. Wenn nur 4% der Anträge begründet abgelehnt werden können, und dann nur die Hälfte der begründeten Ablehnungen einer genaueren Prüfung durch einen Obergutachter standhält, dann beträgt die Fehlerwahrscheinlichkeit der Ablehnungen, selbst bei einer so geringen Anzahl von Ablehnungen, 50 %. Das bedeutet, dass die Hälfte aller ablehnenden Empfehlungen falsch gewesen sind. Wenn Gutachter in Zukunft mehr ablehnen sollten, wird sich dadurch diese Fehlerwahrscheinlichkeit nicht verbessern, sondern evtl. sogar verschlechtern. Wenn die Wahrscheinlichkeit eine notwendige Behandlung fälschlicher Weise abzulehnen in dieser Größenordnung ist, dann muss ein bestehendes Auswahlverfahren mit Recht äußerst kritisch betrachtet werden und darf nicht als Instrument für eine Rationierung von Behandlungsplätzen verwendet werden. Eine Rationierung wird dann sogar willkürlich, praktisch dem Zufall überlassen. Die Fähigkeit über eine Notwendigkeit von Psychotherapie entscheiden und einen Behandlungsplan erstellen zu können ist Inhalt der Psychotherapieausbildung – so wie auch ein Arzt lernt, wann ein Blinddarm zu entfernen ist und auf welche Art und Weise. Ein Gutachterverfahren kann hier kaum zu neuen Erkenntnissen beitragen.Der Vorschlag von Prof. Freyberger und Prof. Linden ist also nicht nur mit den ethischen Grundlagen medizinischer Behandlungen nicht zu vereinbaren, sondern sogar äußerst unwirtschaftlich – also würde genau das Gegenteil von dem bewirken, was er vorgibt erreichen zu wollen. Letztendlich fehlt in dem Beitrag von Prof. Freyberger und Prof. Linden dann auch der Nachweis, a) dass Psychotherapie für die Bewältigung von Lebenssituationen ohne Krankheitswert missbraucht wird, b) Psychotherapie angewendet wird, obwohl bekannt ist, dass Psychotherapie dort keine Wirkung hätte – also von vornherein eine negative Prognose bekannt wäre, c) psychotherapeutisch behandelte Pat. verifizierbar mit anderen Mitteln günstiger behandelt werden hätten können – und dass das in einer maßgeblichen Menge keine Beachtung gefunden hätte, d) Psychotherapie angewendet wird, obwohl sie generell unwirtschaftlich sei. Auch fehlt bei den Autoren jegliche Abwägung darüber, welche Kosten Patienten im Gesundheitssystem an andrer Stelle zusätzlich verursachen, bei denen Psychotherapie abgelehnt worden ist.Aber es geht hier nicht darum den Beitrag der beiden Autoren nur zu kritisieren. Wir Psychotherapeuten benötigen eine Weiterentwicklung der Psychotherapie – auch hinsichtlich der Bestimmungen – um dem steigenden Bedarf einer sich schnell verändernden Gesellschaft gerecht werden zu können. Eine wirklich intelligente Möglichkeit für eine größere Kapazität an Psychotherapie zu sorgen, die gleichzeitig Kosten einspart, ist die Abschaffung des sogenannten Gutachterverfahrens. Der einzelne Psychotherapeut hätte damit etwa 3 Zeitstunden oder 10% pro Woche mehr Zeit für seine Patienten zur Verfügung. Wenn diese Zeit ausschließlich für Gruppenpsychotherapie verwendet werden würde, ergebe das mindestens 30% mehr Behandlungskapazitäten – wahrscheinlich etwa so viel, wie Prof. Linden und Prof. Freyberger durch ihren Vorschlag gerne – allerdings eher zu Lasten der Solidargemeinschaft – eingespart hätten. An dieser Stelle wird dann wieder die Frage nach der Zunahme der Kosten kommen. Aber: 30% Ausweitungen der Leistungen bei 10 % mehr Arbeitszeit am Patienten würde eine tatsächliche Erhöhung der Kosten für ambulante Psychotherapie um etwa 180 Mio. € bedeuten. Die Ausgaben für die gesamt ambulante Versorgung liegt bei über 60 Mrd. Euro jährlich. Die Krankenkassen geben jährlich für das Gesundheitssystem über 180 Mrd. Euro aus. Selbst wenn man die jüngsten Honorarforderungen der Psychotherapeuten in diese Rechnung noch mit einbezieht, bewegt sich die Kostenerhöhung im Promillebereich der Gesamtausgaben. Es gibt Ausgabentöpfe, die wesentlich größer sind, und trotzdem nicht so strittig diskutiert werden. Die von Prof. Freyberger und Prof. Linden geforderte Reduzierung von Psychotherapie passt hier gut in den Kanon, Psychotherapie – und damit auch alle Psychotherapiebedürftigen - in der medizinischen Versorgung weiterhin diskriminieren zu wollen.Dieser Kommentar ist dabei nicht nur meine persönliche Meinung, sondern ist von vielen Kollegen unterstützt worden. Gutachterverfahren (GAV) nicht wissenschaftliche fundiert Sehr geehrte Autoren,auch Professoren sind an die Berufsordnungen von Ärzte- bzw. Psychotherapeutenkammern gebunden. Diese besagen, dass Behandlungsentscheidungen den aktuellen wissenschaftlichen Kriterien genügen müssen.

Ethik in der Psychotherapie: „Informierte Zustimmung“ gefordert Ethik in der Psychotherapie: „Informierte Zustimmung“ gefordert Die Aufklärung des Patienten im Erstgespräch (informed consent) trägt nicht nur zur Entmystifizierung des psychotherapeutischen Prozesses bei. Auch Missverständnisse, Enttäuschungen und Rechtsstreitigkeiten können vermieden werden. Grundlage einer psychotherapeutischen Behandlung ist der zwischen Psychotherapeut und Patient abgeschlossene Behandlungsvertrag (auch Kontrakt oder Arbeitsbündnis genannt). Er kommt durch übereinstimmende Willenserklärungen der Vertragsparteien zustande. Die Einhaltung einer bestimmten Form ist nicht erforderlich, eine mündliche Vereinbarung genügt. Um jedoch einen Behandlungsvertrag eingehen zu können, müssen Patienten ausführlich informiert sein. Nur dann können sie ihr Einverständnis, das heißt ihre „informierte Zustimmung“ geben. Der Begriff „informierte Zustimmung“ beziehungsweise „informed consent“ wird seit den 70er-Jahren in der medizinischen Ethik diskutiert. Er beinhaltet das Prinzip des Respekts vor der Autonomie und dem Selbstbestimmungsrecht der Patienten. Das bedeutet, dass Patienten nicht mit manipulativen Mitteln in ihrer Entscheidung beeinflusst und auch nicht gezwungen werden dürfen, einen Behandlungsvertrag einzugehen oder einer Therapie zuzustimmen. Sie sollen allein auf Grundlage vernünftiger Argumentation und Informationsvermittlung ihre Entscheidung treffen können. Dies kommt schließlich Patienten, Therapeuten und auch der Behandlung selbst zugute, denn wenn Patienten freiwillig und motiviert bei einer Therapie mitwirken, sind Compliance und Behandlungserfolge nachweislich größer. Außerdem erhöht die informierte Zustimmung die wahrgenommene Kontrolle und Selbstverantwortung der Patienten und spiegelt das partnerschaftliche Verhältnis zwischen den Vertragsparteien wider. Die Informationsvermittlung findet hauptsächlich in den ersten Gesprächen zwischen Therapeut und Patient statt. Übrigens besteht die Pflicht des Psychotherapeuten zur Aufklärung auch dann, wenn der Patient nicht ausdrücklich danach verlangt. Folgende Punkte sind anzusprechen, damit ein Patient umfassend informiert ist und sein Einverständnis zur Behandlung geben kann: - Ziel und Zweck der Psychotherapie - die zur Anwendung gelangende psychotherapeutische Methode - Erfolgswahrscheinlichkeit - Frequenz und Dauer der Sitzungen - ungefähre Dauer der Behandlung - mögliche Settings - Honorar - Modus bei Ausfall einer Stunde - Urlaubsregelung - Schweigepflicht und ihre Grenzen - Risiken, Nebenwirkungen, emotionale und physische Belastungen durch die Psychotherapie - Alternativen zur Psychotherapie - Möglichkeiten zur Unterbrechung oder Beendigung der Psychotherapie. Gelegentlich interessieren sich Patienten für die Ausbildung und Qualifikation des Therapeuten, worüber ihnen ebenfalls Auskunft zu erteilen ist. Im Hinblick auf die Erfolgswahrscheinlichkeit sollten die Patienten unter Bezugnahme auf die Psychotherapieforschung darüber informiert werden, zu welchem Prozentsatz und in welchem zeitlichen Umfang das vorgeschlagene Behandlungsverfahren erfolgreich sein kann. „Allerdings sollte man Hoffnungen nicht übertrieben schüren, damit Patienten nicht enttäuscht sind, wenn die Therapie länger dauert oder Stagnation und Rückfälle auftreten“, erklären die Psychologen Celia Fisher und Matthew Oransky vom Fordham University Center for Ethics Education in New York. Über Alternativen zur psychotherapeutischen Behandlung muss ebenfalls aufgeklärt werden, selbst wenn es bedeutet, einen Patienten zu verlieren. Die Patienten sollten beispielsweise über Angebote informiert sein, die günstiger für sie sind, weil sie geringere oder keine Kos-ten, kürzere Fahrzeiten oder kürzere Wartezeiten auf einen Therapieplatz bieten. Auch eine medikamentöse Behandlung sollte angesprochen werden. Wird dies unterlassen, können Patienten und Therapeuten in eine missliche Lage geraten wie im Fall eines US-amerikanischen Patienten. Er unterzog sich auf Anraten eines Psychotherapeuten wegen einer Depression ein Jahr lang einer intensiven, stationären Psychoanalyse, die allerdings nicht zum Erfolg führte. Schließlich brach er die Therapie ab und ließ sich mit Antidepressiva behandeln, auf die er endlich ansprach. Trotzdem war er verbittert, dass die mangelhafte Aufklärung des Psychotherapeuten über Behandlungsalternativen seinen Leidensweg verlängert hatte und zog vor Gericht. Die Honorierung ist ein Punkt, der so früh wie möglich zum Gesprächsgegenstand gemacht werden sollte. Sofern die Krankenkasse die Behandlungskosten trägt, muss der Patient wissen, wie viele Sitzungen bezahlt werden, ob Zuzahlungen auf ihn zukommen und wie hoch der Eigenanteil ist. Bei Verfahren, die der Patient aus eigener Tasche zahlt, müssen die Höhe des Honorars, akzeptierte Zahlungsweise, Zeitpunkt der Bezahlung und Modalitäten bei Zahlungsverzug beziehungsweise -unfähigkeit angesprochen werden. Außerdem ist zu beachten, ob Dritte (zum Beispiel Arbeitgeber, Verwandte) an der Finanzierung beteiligt werden und ob Möglichkeiten staatlicher oder karitativer Unterstützung ausgeschöpft werden können. „Psychotherapeuten gehen oft zu selbstverständlich davon aus, dass jeder Patient mit den grundlegenden Zielen und Techniken einer Psychotherapie vertraut ist“, sagen Fisher und Oransky. Dabei handele es sich aber offenbar um eine Fehleinschätzung. Nur Patienten, die relativ gebildet sind, könnten weitgehend einschätzen, was auf sie zukommt. Die Vorstellungen vieler Patienten sind in der Regel geprägt von Vorurteilen, Gerüchten, Halbwissen sowie verharmlosenden oder übertriebenen Darstellungen durch Medien und Angehörige. Zudem spielen Kultur sowie die mentale und psychische Verfassung der Patienten eine Rolle. Beispielsweise gehen Patienten aus nicht westlichen Kulturen häufig davon aus, dass in einer Psychotherapie hauptsächlich Medikamente zum Einsatz kommen. Außerdem haben Patienten gelegentlich Sprachprobleme und verstehen das Gesagte – insbesondere Fachjargon – nicht im vollen Umfang. Um Verständnisschwierigkeiten zu verringern, kann ein Übersetzer hinzugezogen werden; den Patienten hilft es auch manchmal, dass sie Familienangehörige zum Erstgespräch mitbringen und anschließend die erhaltenen Informationen mit Bezugspersonen besprechen. Mental und psychisch beeinträchtigte Patienten sind ebenfalls oft nicht in der Lage, die gegebenen Informationen vollständig zu erfassen und zu überdenken. Trotzdem oder gerade deshalb sollten Psychotherapeuten sich bemühen, diese Patienten so gut wie möglich zu informieren und ihr Einverständnis zu suchen, um die Patienteninteressen zu wahren. Darüber hinaus gibt es Sonderfälle, die ebenfalls eine Aufklärung und das Einholen des Einverständnisses notwendig machen, beispielsweise wenn ein Psychotherapeut ein neues, wissenschaftlich nicht ausreichend geprüftes Verfahren einsetzen will oder wenn sich der Behandelnde in Ausbildung befindet. Im Erstgespräch oder in den ers-ten Gesprächen sollten so viele Punkte wie möglich angesprochen werden. Allerdings ist das im klinischen Alltag nicht immer möglich, zum Beispiel wenn ein Patient akut psychotisch oder selbstmordgefährdet ist. In Krisen und Notfällen kann daher auf eine umfassende Information zunächst verzichtet werden, die Aufklärung sollte aber so bald wie möglich nachgeholt werden. Das Aufklären von Patienten ist oft keine einmalige Angelegenheit, sondern als kontinuierlicher Prozess zu verstehen, denn manche Informationen liegen in der Anfangsphase einer Therapie noch nicht vor und sind erst später verfügbar. Manchmal ändern sich auch die Modalitäten oder Umstände, sodass immer wieder eine rechtzeitige und angepasste Informierung des Patienten notwendig werden kann. Ein Zuviel an Informationen, zum Beispiel über die Hintergründe von Techniken, die erst viel später zum Einsatz kommen, kann den Patienten allerdings auch kurzfristig überfordern. Hier kommt es also ebenfalls auf den richtigen Zeitpunkt und die richtige Menge an Informationen an. Auch wenn eine kontinuierliche Aufklärungsarbeit gelegentlich einen zusätzlichen Zeit- und Arbeitsaufwand für Psychotherapeuten bedeutet, lohnt sie sich meistens, denn sie trägt zur Entmystifizierung des psychotherapeutischen Prozesses bei. Außerdem können dadurch Missverständnisse, Enttäuschungen und rechtliche Auseinandersetzungen vermieden werden. Dr. phil. Marion Sonnenmoser Kontakt: Celia Fisher, Dep. of Psychology, Fordham University, Bronx, NY 10458 (USA), E-Mail: fisher@fordham.edu Auszug aus der (Muster-)Berufsordnung der Bundes­psycho­therapeuten­kammer 1) Jede psychotherapeutische Behandlung bedarf der Einwilligung und setzt eine Aufklärung voraus. Anders lautende gesetzliche Bestimmungen bleiben davon unberührt. 2) Psychotherapeuten unterliegen einer Aufklärungspflicht gegenüber Patienten über Indikation, Art der Behandlung, Therapieplan, gegebenenfalls Behandlungsalternativen und mögliche Behandlungsrisiken. Die Aufklärungspflicht umfasst weiterhin die Klärung der Rahmenbedingungen der Behandlung, zum Beispiel Honorarregelungen, Sitzungsdauer und Sitzungsfrequenz und die voraussichtliche Gesamtdauer der Behandlung. 3) Die Aufklärung hat vor Beginn einer Behandlung in einer auf die Befindlichkeit und Aufnahmefähigkeit des Patienten abgestimmten Form zu erfolgen. Treten Änderungen im Behandlungsverlauf auf oder sind erhebliche Änderungen des Vorgehens erforderlich, ist der Patient auch während der Behandlung darüber aufzuklären. 4) In Institutionen, in Berufsausübungsgemeinschaften, Kooperationsgemeinschaften und sonstigen Organisationen arbeitende Psychotherapeuten haben darüber hinaus ihre Patienten in angemessener Form über Untersuchungs- und Behandlungsmethoden, über den Ablauf der Behandlung, über besondere Rahmenbedingungen sowie über die Zuständigkeitsbereiche weiterer, an der Behandlung beteiligter Personen zu informieren.

SARS-CoV-2: Antikörper erzielt primärpräventive Wirkung bei Bewohnern und Mitarbeitern von Pflegeheimen Empfehlungen zur Diagnostik und Therapie von Eisenmangel Nichtsubstanzgebundene Abhängigkeiten im Kindes-... Soziale Schicht und Psychotherapie: Kluft zwischen den Lebenswelten Soziale Schicht und Psychotherapie: Kluft zwischen den Lebenswelten Menschen mit niedrigem sozioökonomischen Status nehmen vergleichsweise selten psychotherapeutische Hilfe in Anspruch und brechen Therapien häufiger vorzeitig ab. Der Beitrag zeigt die Gründe hierfür auf, und wie man diesen Umstand ändern könnte. Psychische Erkrankungen kommen in allen sozialen Schichten vor. Allerdings ist es für die Angehörigen mittlerer und höherer Schichten leichter, sich Hilfe zu suchen und sich Zugang zu entsprechenden Beratungs- und Behandlungsangeboten zu verschaffen. Menschen, die von niedrigem Einkommen, Armut, Arbeitslosigkeit, geringer Bildung, Migration und chronischen Krankheiten betroffen sind, nehmen hingegen vergleichsweise selten psychotherapeutische Hilfe in Anspruch und brechen Behandlungen oft vorzeitig ab. Die Psychologen Saeromi Kim (Rhode Island College, Providence, USA) und Esteban Cardemil (Carl University, Worcester, USA) nennen hierfür einige Gründe: Aufseiten der Patienten könnte dies daran liegen, dass ihnen Behandlungsangebote nicht bekannt sind, oder sie befürchten, ein Therapeut – der in der Regel einer anderen sozialen Schicht angehört – könne ihre Probleme nicht nachvollziehen und ihnen deshalb nicht helfen. Zudem haben ökonomisch schlechter gestellte Erkrankte oft nur wenig Möglichkeiten, das Fahrgeld zur Praxis oder eine Kinderbetreuung während der Therapiesitzungen zu finanzieren. Aufseiten der Therapeuten ist zu vermuten, dass manche gegenüber diesen Patienten möglicherweise voreingenommen sind oder kaum an einen Behandlungserfolg glauben und sich daher weniger engagieren oder eine distanzierte Haltung einnehmen, so dass sich keine tragfähige therapeutische Beziehung entwickeln kann. Darüber hinaus wird manchmal kritisiert, dass die meisten psychotherapeutischen Angebote auf die Bedürfnisse und Fähigkeiten der weißen Mittel- und Oberschicht (in den USA) zugeschnitten seien und die unteren sozialen Schichten außen vor ließen. Dies sind allerdings bloß Vermutungen, denn es gibt nur wenige Studien, die sich mit dem Zusammenhang zwischen sozialer Schicht und Psychotherapie befassen. Um herauszufinden, was Patienten mit niedrigem Einkommen und Bildungsstand über eine Psychotherapie denken und von ihr erwarten, haben die Psychologinnen Mindi Thompson, Odessa Cole und Rachel Nitzarim von der University of Wisconsin-Madison (Madison, USA) 16 Psychotherapiepatienten befragt. Wie sich zeigte, achteten die Befragten genau auf die sichtbaren Unterschiede zwischen der sozialen Klasse des Therapeuten und ihrer eigenen. Sie bemerkten beispielsweise die hochwertige Kleidung des Therapeuten, die gediegene Ausstattung seines Büros, die Fotografien, die von einem gut situierten Familienleben, von beruflichen Erfolgen oder von kostspieligen Hobbys, Reisen und Sammelleidenschaften kündeten, oder das teure Auto vor der Praxis. Sie waren sich bewusst, dass ihnen jemand gegenübersaß, der im Gegensatz zu ihnen in geregelten Verhältnissen lebte, einen Job und ein gutes Einkommen hatte. „Das alles schüchterte sie ein und weckte zugleich ihren Neid“, schreiben die Wissenschaftlerinnen. Zum Problem wurde dies jedoch nur, wenn die Patienten das Gefühl hatten, dass der Therapeut seine Überlegenheit mit Hilfe von Statussymbolen offen demonstrierte oder wenn er sich zu intellektuell und distanziert gab und nicht auf ihre alltäglichen Probleme einging. Dann fühlten sie sich abgewertet oder stigmatisiert und hatten Schwierigkeiten damit, dem Therapeuten zu vertrauen und einen Kontakt zu ihm herzustellen. Gab der Therapeut hingegen zu verstehen, dass er sich bemühte, sich in die Lebensumstände und Erfahrungswelt der Patienten ernsthaft einzudenken, sich mit ihren speziellen Problemen zu befassen und sie als Personen zu respektieren, dann fühlten sich die Patienten trotz gewisser Neidgefühle geborgen und waren dankbar dafür, dass sich jemand ihrer annahm. „Der Unterschied in der sozialen Schicht zwischen Therapeut und Patient beeinflusst das therapeutische Geschehen und sollte daher thematisiert werden“, meinen Kim und Cardemil. Für einen konstruktiven Umgang mit diesem Unterschied empfehlen sie Therapeuten, nicht nur die üblichen Daten zu Ausbildung, Einkommen und Beschäftigungsstatus der Patienten zu erheben, sondern auch nach den ökonomischen Verhältnissen in der Kindheit und Herkunftsfamilie zu fragen. Ferner sollten Informationen zur sozialen Unterstützung, zur Wohnumgebung, zum Zugang zu medizinischen und psychologischen Diensten oder zu finanziellen Verpflichtungen gesammelt werden, um einen tieferen Einblick in die Identität und in die früheren und aktuellen Lebensbedingungen der Patienten zu gewinnen. Psychotherapeuten werden den Autoren zufolge durch solche Erkundungen oft mit Armut, Elend und bedauernswerten Schicksalen konfrontiert und reagieren mit Mitleid, Ängsten, Hilf- und Hoffnungslosigkeit und vielleicht sogar mit einem schlechten Gewissen, weil es ihnen selbst bessergeht. Kim und Cardemil raten in solchen Fällen dazu, sich reflektierend mit diesen Gefühlen auseinanderzusetzen und sich davon motivieren zu lassen, sozial benachteiligten Patienten zu helfen. Nach Meinung der Autoren ist es wesentlich für die Arbeit mit Patienten aus ärmeren sozialen Schichten, dass sich Therapeuten einerseits mit ihrem eigenen Privilegiert-Sein, mit ihrer Schicht, ihrem gesellschaftlichen Status und ihrer sozialen Identität, andererseits mit ihren unbewussten und bewussten Vorurteilen, Einstellungen und Gefühlen diesen Patienten gegenüber auseinandersetzen, denn nur dann sei ein offenes Aufeinander-Zugehen möglich. Therapeuten sollten sich auch darüber bewusst sein, dass es womöglich immer eine Kluft zwischen der eigenen Erfahrungswelt und der der Patienten geben wird, die sich selbst durch interessiertes Nachfragen und empathisches Zuhören nur bis zu einem gewissen Grad überbrücken lässt. Aus diesem Grund plädieren die Autoren dafür, diese Tatsache einfach zu akzeptieren und sie in die therapeutische Arbeit zu integrieren. Sozial benachteiligte Patienten sprechen auf psychotherapeutische Behandlungen ebenso an wie andere Patienten, sofern bestimmte Voraussetzungen erfüllt und verschiedene Barrieren überwunden werden. Beispielsweise ist zu berücksichtigen, dass diese Patienten oft ein schwieriges und komplexes Leben führen, wenig Unterstützung erhalten, nicht selten schlechte Erfahrungen mit Autoritäten und Behörden gesammelt haben und gesellschaftlich ausgegrenzt werden. Sie fühlen sich möglicherweise falsch verstanden oder nicht beachtet, sind misstrauisch, desillusioniert und hoffnungslos, können sich nicht gut artikulieren und zeigen Scham, Ängste und Widerstände. Aus diesen Gründen erfordert es ein relativ großes Engagement von Therapeuten, sozial benachteiligte Patienten zu behandeln. Nach Meinung der Psychiaterinnen Janice Krupnick und S. Elizabeth Melnikoff von der Georgetown University School of Medicine (Washington D. C., USA) sollten sämtliche Interventionen die Einschränkungen der Patienten hinsichtlich Zeit, Geld, Bildung und Mobilität berücksichtigen und für diese akzeptabel und machbar sein. So sei es beispielsweise sinnvoll, bei der Psychoedukation auf Fremdwörter und Fachbegriffe zu verzichten und stattdessen möglichst bildhaft und anschaulich zu sprechen. Den Zugang zur Psychotherapie erleichterten außerdem Maßnahmen wie etwa das Anbieten von Sitzungen am Abend oder am Wochenende oder in leicht zugänglichen Räumlichkeiten wie etwa in einem Nebenzimmer einer Kirche, eines Gemeindezentrums oder einer Hausarztpraxis. Hier böte sich zugleich eine Kooperation mit Hausärzten, Schulen, Gemeindediensten oder Seelsorgern an. Aufgrund der sozialen Distanz zwischen dem Therapeuten und dem Patienten muss dem Aufbau einer vertrauensvollen therapeutischen Arbeitsbeziehung besondere Beachtung geschenkt werden. Um die Distanz zu reduzieren, ist es unerlässlich, den Patienten deutlich Achtung und Respekt entgegenzubringen und ihr Leben zu würdigen. Indem der Therapeut die Patienten zu Ratgebern und Experten in ihren eigenen Belangen erklärt und versucht, von den Patienten zu lernen, werden sowohl die Befürchtungen der Patienten als auch die soziale und hierarchische Distanz zwischen Therapeut und Patient reduziert. Den Patienten sollte im Verlauf der Therapie immer wieder Gelegenheit gegeben werden, nicht nur von ihren psychischen Symptomen, sondern zum Beispiel auch davon zu berichten, was ihre Lebensumstände bewirken, etwa Diskriminierung, soziale Isolation und Stress. Dies ist nicht nur für die therapeutische Beziehung, sondern auch insofern von Bedeutung, als diese Faktoren psychische Erkrankungen häufig auslösen oder aufrechterhalten. Der Frage, in welcher Weise die soziale Schicht das Leben bestimmt und Probleme verursacht, kann unter anderem in Rollenspielen, Geschichten oder Diskussionen in Verbindung mit psychotherapeutischen Techniken nachgegangen werden. Nach Meinung von Kim und Cardemil können Psychotherapeuten vom Umgang mit Patienten aus ärmeren sozialen Schichten in mancherlei Hinsicht profitieren: Sie lernen Lebens- und Erfahrungswelten kennen, zu denen sie sonst vielleicht keinen Zugang haben. Sie können daran arbeiten, ihre eigenen Barrieren zu erkennen und zu überwinden, sie machen zahlreiche Selbsterfahrungen, und sie erfahren in vielen Facetten von der Widerstandskraft, die Menschen unter widrigen Lebensumständen aufbringen können.

Generalisierte Angststörung The diagnosis and treatment of generalized anxiety disorder Dtsch Arztebl Int 2013; 110(17): ; DOI: 10.3238/arztebl.2013.0300 ; ; ; ; ; Die generalisierte Angststörung (GAS) ist mit einer Lebenszeitprävalenz von 4,3–5,9 % eine häufige und schwerwiegende Erkrankung, die in der Primärversorgung häufig unterdiagnostiziert wird. Beruhend auf einer selektiven Recherche aller verfügbaren randomisierten Studien werden Empfehlungen zur Behandlung der GAS gegeben. Unter den psychotherapeutischen Therapieverfahren haben sich verschiedene Varianten der kognitiven Verhaltenstherapie (KVT) in kontrollierten Studien als wirksam erwiesen. Zu den Medikamenten der ersten Wahl zählen selektive Serotonin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer (SSRI), selektive Serotonin-Noradrenalin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer (SNRI) sowie der Kalziumkanalmodulator Pregabalin. Trizyklische Antidepressiva sind ebenfalls wirksam, haben jedoch insgesamt mehr Nebenwirkungen als SSRI. Benzodiazepine haben eine gute akute angstlösende Wirkung, werden aber wegen einer möglichen Suchtgefahr nicht in der Dauerbehandlung eingesetzt. Das Azapiron Buspiron war in einigen Studien wirksam, die Datenlage ist allerdings inkonsistent. Die Responseraten bei einer KVT werden mit 47–75 %, bei medikamentösen Behandlungen mit 44–81 % angegeben. Durch eine evidenzbasierte Behandlung mit KVT und Medikamenten können die Symptome einer GAS gut gebessert werden. Die generalisierte Angststörung (GAS) ist eine häufige und schwerwiegende Erkrankung. Die diagnostischen Kriterien nach ICD-10 werden im und dargestellt. Charakteristisch für diese Angsterkrankung sind Sorgen, die sich auf reale Gefahren beziehen (wie der Möglichkeit, dass der Ehepartner einen Autounfall haben könnte), wobei deren Eintrittsrisiko stark überschätzt wird und die negativen Konsequenzen katastrophal ausgemalt werden. Diese Besorgnisse können sich rasch auf zahlreiche Bereiche generalisieren, wie auf die gesundheitliche, partnerschaftliche, berufliche oder finanzielle Situation des Betroffenen oder nahestehender Personen. Typisch ist ein Absicherungs- und Vermeidungsverhalten. So werden als gefährlich eingeschätzte Unternehmungen wie beispielsweise Reisen aufgeschoben oder vermieden. Die Befürchtungen führen zu den körperlichen Ausdrucksformen der Angst, die oft zu ausführlichen organmedizinischen Abklärungen Anlass geben (). Diagnose der generalisierten Angststörung nach ICD-10 Generalisierte Angststörung – Definition nach den ICD-10-Forschungskriterien Differenzialdiagnostisch müssen neben internistischen und neurologischen Erkrankungen andere psychische Störungen, vor allem andere Angststörungen abgegrenzt werden. Bei der Panikstörung treten attackenförmig Angstsymptome wie Herzrasen, Luftnot, Engegefühl in der Brust, Schwitzen, Ohnmachtsgefühle und Parästhesien auf. Sie ist häufig mit einer Agoraphobie verbunden. Die Sorgen der Patienten beziehen sich vor allem auf die gesundheitlichen Konsequenzen heftiger Angstattacken oder die Annahme einer medizinischen Ursache ihrer Symptome, und nicht – wie bei der GAS – auf die Erkrankung einer anderen nahestehenden Person. Bei der sozialen Angststörung sind die Befürchtungen auf soziale Situationen beschränkt, in denen die betreffende Person sich kritisiert oder beobachtet fühlen könnte. Bei Patienten mit einer GAS besteht eine Komorbidität mit Depressionen von 40–67 % (, ). Existieren in solchen Fällen neben Angstgefühlen Symptome wie Tagesschwankung, Früherwachen, Schuldgefühle oder Suizidideen, muss geprüft werden, ob die Depression im Vordergrund steht. Schwierig kann die Abgrenzung gegenüber einer somatoformen Störung sein, bei der wechselnde körperliche Symptome wie Herzrasen, Luftnot, Schluckstörungen oder gastrointestinale Beschwerden ohne organisches Korrelat angegeben werden. Die Patienten beharren auf wiederholten organischen Abklärungen und stehen – im Gegensatz zu GAS-Patienten – einer psychosomatischen Erklärung der Beschwerden häufig skeptisch gegenüber. Im werden vermeidbare Fehler in der Diagnostik der GAS beschrieben. Vermeidbare Fehler in der Diagnostik der Angsterkrankungen In verschiedenen epidemiologischen Befragungen in der Allgemeinbevölkerung wurden eine Lebenszeitprävalenz von 4,3–5,9 % und eine 12-Monats-Prävalenz von 0,2–4,3 % festgestellt (, ). Unter Patienten in Allgemeinpraxen zeigte sich eine Ein-Monats-Prävalenz von 7,9–9 % (). Die GAS ist bei Frauen doppelt so häufig wie bei Männern. Eine Häufung findet sich in der Altersgruppe zwischen 45 und 59 Jahren, gefolgt von der Gruppe zwischen 30 und 44 Jahren. Nach dem 60. Lebensjahr gibt es eine Abnahme (). Es handelt sich um eine unbehandelt chronisch verlaufende Erkrankung; die meisten Patienten leiden noch sechs bis zwölf Jahre nach Diagnosestellung unter der Symptomatik (). Nur zwei von fünf betroffenen Patienten begeben sich in Behandlung (). Die Ursachen der GAS sind noch nicht genau bekannt. Wie bei anderen Angststörungen werden traumatische Lebenserfahrungen, Fehlkonditionierungen, genetische Einflüsse und neurobiologische Dysfunktionen als mögliche ätiologische Faktoren diskutiert (). Die GAS tritt in Familien gehäuft auf (). In Zwillingsstudien wurde ein moderater Erbfaktor gefunden (), der geringer ausgeprägt ist als bei anderen Angsterkrankungen, zum Beispiel der Panikstörung. Zu den neurobiologischen Veränderungen, die im Zusammenhang mit der GAS diskutiert werden, zählen Störungen des Serotoninsystems, des adrenergen Systems oder der GABA-Bindung (–). In strukturellen und funktionalen Bildgebungsuntersuchungen zeigten sich bei GAS-Patienten Auffälligkeiten im Bereich der Amygdala, im dorsomedialen präfrontalen Cortex und in anderen Gebieten (–). Die folgenden Empfehlungen beruhen auf der Auswertung aller randomisierten kontrollierten Studien zur GAS, die durch Literaturrecherche mit Hilfe einer Datenbankenrecherche (Medline und ISI Web of Science) sowie durch Handsuche gefunden wurden. Die Untersuchungen wurden einer strukturierten Qualitätsprüfung auf methodologische Korrektheit (hinsichtlich Stichprobenumfang, Verblindung, Randomisierung, Statistik, Messinstrumenten usw.) nach dem SIGN Statement (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, www.sign.ac.uk) unterzogen. Zusätzlich zu den in den Leitlinien der World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry () () analysierten Studien wurden alle seit dem Erscheinen dieser Leitlinie publizierten randomisierten kontrollierten Studien gesucht; von diesen wurden 21 übernommen. Sowohl für Medikamente als auch für Psychotherapien existieren negative oder inkonklusive Studien. Nur Behandlungen, bei denen die Zahl der positiven Studien überwog, werden hier empfohlen. Kognitive-behaviorale Theorien nehmen an, dass Angststörungen wie auch andere psychische Störungen durch verzerrte, unlogische oder unrealistische Kognitionen mitverursacht werden (). Ziel der Therapie ist es, Fertigkeiten zu entwickeln, um dysfunktionale (fehlerhafte, einseitige) Annahmen und Gedanken selbstständig zu erkennen, zu unterbrechen und zu korrigieren, um sich situationsangepasster verhalten zu können (–). Psychoedukation, Konfrontationstechniken (wie In-sensu-Exposition gegenüber den Sorgeninhalten, beispielsweise befürchteten Katastrophen) (, ) und Problemlösetechniken sind weitere Elemente der KVT. Selbstverständlich ist auch der Aufbau einer tragfähigen therapeutischen Beziehung ein wichtiger Bestandteil einer Verhaltenstherapie. Im werden Therapiebausteine der KVT der generalisierten Angststörung zusammengefasst (, ). Therapiebestandteile der kognitiv-behavioralen Therapie (KVT) der generalisierten Angststörung Die Wirksamkeit der KVT ist in zahlreichen randomisierten klinischen Studien nachgewiesen. Einige Studien zeigten eine Überlegenheit gegenüber einer Wartelistenbedingung (–). Einige Vergleiche mit Placebobedingungen zeigten, dass KVT nicht nur unspezifische Psychotherapieeffekte, sondern auch spezifische Therapieelemente hat (–). Die Responseraten bei einer Verhaltenstherapie werden in den Studien mit 47–75 % angeben, wobei Response in den Studien unterschiedlich definiert wird. In den letzten Jahren wurden einige Studien zur internetbasierten KVT durchgeführt. Dabei handelte es sich entweder um eine reine Selbsttherapie mit Hilfe verschiedener Medien oder um eine durch kurze Kontakte mit Therapeuten per E-Mail oder Telefon unterstützte Behandlung (–). Es fanden sich signifikante Unterschiede zu einer Warteliste, mit Ausnahme einer Studie, bei der sich weder Internet-KVT noch psychodynamische Therapie per Internet von der Warteliste unterschieden (). Da auch Studien zum Vergleich mit einer herkömmlichen KVT mit persönlichem Therapeutenkontakt fehlen, kann Internettherapie derzeit nicht empfohlen werden. Zusätzlich ergeben sich erstattungstechnische, medizinrechtliche und ethische Probleme (zum Beispiel bei Suizidalität des Patienten). Psychodynamische (tiefenpsychologisch/psychoanalytische) Therapie – Es gibt verschiedene Ansätze zur psychodynamischen Therapie der GAS. Auf der Basis der supportiv-expressiven Psychotherapie () wurde speziell für die GAS eine psychoanalytische Fokaltherapie entwickelt (, ). Diese geht davon aus, dass bei Patienten mit dieser Angststörung unsichere Bindungen bestehen. Dabei wird angenommen, dass den psychischen Symptomen ein „zentraler Beziehungskonflikt“ zugrunde liegt. Wie bei anderen psychodynamischen Therapien wird daher Wert auf die Übertragungsbeziehung gelegt. Bei den heute durchgeführten psychodynamischen Behandlungen handelt es sich häufig um Kurzzeittherapien, bei denen eine eher aktive therapeutische Haltung bevorzugt wird. Die umfangreiche Literaturrecherche ergab nur zwei evaluierbare randomisierte kontrollierte Untersuchungen zur Wirkung einer psychodynamischen Therapie bei der GAS. In einer Studie war eine Verhaltenstherapie sowohl im Akut- als auch im Follow-up-Zeitraum wirksamer als eine psychodynamische Therapie (, ). In einer weiteren Studie sahen die Autoren eine mit der KVT vergleichbare Wirkung; die Skalen zeigten aber erhebliche numerische Unterschiede zugunsten der KVT; wegen der zu geringen Stichprobengröße kann daher eine Gleichwirksamkeit der psychodynamischen Therapie mit der KVT mit dieser Untersuchung nicht belegt werden (, ). Insgesamt reicht die Datenlage für eine Empfehlung nicht aus. Es fehlen auch Vergleiche mit einer Warteliste und mit einer aktiven Kontrollbedingung (psychologisches Placebo). Über andere Formen der psychodynamischen Therapie (tiefenpsychologisch fundierte Psychotherapie; analytische Langzeitpsychotherapie unter anderem) kann aufgrund fehlender Daten nichts ausgesagt werden. Es gibt zahlreiche kontrollierte Studien zur medikamentösen Behandlung der generalisierten Angststörung. Die Responseraten werden in den Studien mit 44–81 % angeben (, ). Die Dosierungen der Medikamente sind im angegeben. Die Vor- und Nachteile der verschiedenen Stoffgruppen sowie unerwünschte Arzneimittelwirkungen werden in gegenübergestellt. Therapieempfehlungen bei generalisierter Angststörung (GAS) (Tagesdosen), in allen Fällen wird eine zusätzliche psychotherapeutische Behandlung empfohlen Vor- und Nachteile von Medikamenten für die generalisierte Angststörung Jede medikamentöse Therapie beinhaltet ärztlicherseits eine einfühlsame psychotherapeutische Führung und Begleitung der Patienten. Bei den Antidepressiva können eventuelle unerwünschte Wirkungen gerade in den ersten Tagen der Behandlung störend wirken, während der Patient noch keinen Therapieerfolg sieht. Eine vorbeugende Aufklärung über die zu erwartenden Nebenwirkungen wie Unruhe zu Beginn der Behandlung mit selektiven Serotonin-Wiederaufnahmehemmern (SSRI) kann die Einnahmezuverlässigkeit verbessern. Durch Information über die Wirklatenz der Antidepressiva kann oft der initiale überbrückende Einsatz von Benzodiazepinen vermieden werden. Auch die proaktive Thematisierung von möglichen sexuellen Dysfunktionen () oder Gewichtszunahme () hat sich in der Praxis bewährt. Selektive Serotonin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer (SSRI) Mehrere kontrollierte Studien zeigten die Wirksamkeit der SSRIs Escitalopram (–), Paroxetin (–) und Sertralin (–). Im Allgemeinen sind SSRI gut verträglich. Nebenwirkungen wie Unruhe, Nervosität, eine Zunahme der Angstsymptomatik, die in den ersten Tagen oder Wochen einer SSRI-Behandlung auftreten, können die Compliance beeinträchtigen. Nach längerer Behandlung können sexuelle Dysfunktionen oder Absetzphänomene auftreten, die jedoch nicht mit den Entzugssymptomen nach Benzodiazepingabe vergleichbar sind (). Um nächtliche Unruhezustände und Schlaflosigkeit in der Anfangszeit der Behandlung zu vermeiden, sollten die Medikamente morgens gegeben werden. Der anxiolytische Effekt tritt meist mit einer Latenz von zwei bis sechs Wochen ein. Selektive Serotonin-Noradrenalin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer (SNRIs) In mehreren Studien konnte die Wirksamkeit des SNRI Venlafaxin gezeigt werden (, , –). Nur eine Studie zeigte keinen signifikanten Unterschied zu Placebo (). In der Regel wird die Retardform von Venlafaxin verwendet. Duloxetin war in kontrollierten Studien bei der GAS wirksam (, , –). Zu Beginn der Therapie mit SNRI können Nebenwirkungen wie Übelkeit, Unruhe oder Schlafstörungen die Compliance beeinträchtigen. Die angstlösende Wirkung tritt mit einer Latenz von zwei bis sechs Wochen ein, in manchen Fällen später. Pregabalin – Dies war in mehreren kontrollierten Studien bei der GAS wirksam (, , –). Die anxiolytische Wirkung setzt rasch ein; eine signifikante Wirksamkeit ist schon ab dem vierten Behandlungstag nachweisbar () und umfasst sowohl die psychischen als auch die somatischen Symptome der GAS (). Das Symptom Schlafstörung wird positiv beeinflusst (). Benommenheit und Schläfrigkeit sind die am häufigsten auftretenden Nebenwirkungen. Trizyklische Antidepressiva (TZA) – Imipramin ist nach kontrollierten Studien bei der GAS einsetzbar (, ). Besonders zu Beginn der Behandlung mit TZA können Nebenwirkungen wie verstärkte Angst, anticholinerge Wirkungen, Sedierung oder eine Gewichtszunahme auftreten. Insgesamt ist die Nebenwirkungshäufigkeit bei den TZA häufiger als bei moderneren Antidepressiva wie den SSRI oder SNRI, die daher vorzuziehen sind. Wenn jedoch andere Standardmedikamente nicht wirksam waren oder nicht vertragen wurden, können die TZA durchaus eine Therapieoption darstellen. Die Wirklatenz beträgt zwei bis sechs Wochen oder mehr. Benzodiazepine – Einige Benzodiazepine wurden bei GAS untersucht: Alprazolam (, –), Diazepam (, , , –), Lorazepam (, ) sowie Bromazepam (). Der anxiolytische Effekt setzt sofort nach der Einnahme ein. Insgesamt gilt die Behandlung mit Benzodiazepinen als sicher; wegen der ZNS-Dämpfung kann es allerdings zu Sedierung, Schwindel, verlängerter Reaktionszeit und anderen Nebenwirkungen kommen. Nach längerer Behandlung (also etwa vier bis acht Monate) kann – besonders bei prädisponierten Patienten – in bis zu 40 % eine Abhängigkeitsentwicklung eintreten (, ), wobei es sich in den meisten Fällen um eine Niedrigdosisabhängigkeit handelt. Toleranzphänomene, die sich in einer ständigen Dosissteigerung äußern würden, sind selten (). In der Regel sollten die Benzodiazepine daher nur in der akuten Behandlungsphase (vier bis acht Wochen) eingesetzt werden. Meist werden sie in der Kombination mit Antidepressiva eingesetzt, um deren Wirklatenz zu überbrücken. In bestimmten Einzelfällen, in denen andere Behandlungsmodalitäten nicht wirksam waren oder nicht toleriert wurden, mag gegebenenfalls ein längerfristiger Einsatz sinnvoll sein. Patienten mit einer Suchtanamnese sollten allerdings von der Behandlung ausgeschlossen werden. Es ist zu beachten, dass Benzodiazepine kaum Einfluss auf die bei einer GAS oft bestehende depressive Begleitsymptomatik haben. Der 5-HT-Agonist Buspiron zeigte sich in einigen Studien wirksam (, , –, –). Das Medikament war aber weniger wirksam als Venlafaxin (). In einer Studie war es Placebo nicht überlegen (). Die Wirksamkeit des Antihistaminikums Hydroxyzin wurde in einigen kontrollierten Studien gezeigt (, –). Allerdings fehlen Rückfallverhinderungsstudien über Zeiträume von sechs bis zwölf Monaten. Hydroxyzin hat sich in der Routinebehandlung der generalisierten Angststörung nicht durchgesetzt. Opipramol, ein Anxiolytikum, das chemisch den trizyklischen Antidepressiva ähnelt, war in einer Dreiarmstudie wirksamer als Placebo und ebenso wirksam wie Alprazolam (). Langzeitstudien fehlen. Das atypische Antipsychotikum Quetiapin, das für die Behandlung von schizophrenen Patienten entwickelt wurde, war auch bei der GAS wirksam (, –). In diesen Studien wurden deutlich geringere Dosen als in der Schizophreniebehandlung verwendet. Quetiapin ist allerdings für die Behandlung der GAS nicht zugelassen. Es kommt daher nur für die Behandlung von Patienten infrage, bei denen Standardtherapien nicht wirksam waren oder nicht vertragen wurden. Nebenwirkungen wie das metabolische Syndrom sind dann zu beachten. Agomelatin, ein neueres Antidepressivum, ist ein Melatoninagonist und 5-HT-Antagonist. In einer Studie war Agomelatin Placebo überlegen (). Eine Rückfallverhinderungsstudie zeigte Überlegenheit gegen Placebo (). Das Mittel ist noch nicht für die Behandlung der GAS zugelassen. Wegen möglicher Leberwerterhöhungen werden vor und während der Behandlung Leberfunktionstests empfohlen. In einer Studie ohne Placebokontrolle war ein standardisierter Lavendelölextrakt ebenso wirksam wie das Benzodiazepin Lorazepam (). Allerdings war die Teststärke der Studie mit n = 77 für einen Non-inferiority-Vergleich nicht ausreichend. Lorazepam wurde zudem in der Studie nur einmal täglich (statt dreimal täglich) gegeben, obwohl es eine relativ kurze Halbwertszeit hat, so dass die Wirksamkeit des Vergleichspräparats möglicherweise eingeschränkt war. Die bisher verfügbaren placebokontrollierten Studien mit „subsyndromalen“ Angststörungen weisen jedoch auf einen möglichen Substanzeffekt des Lavendelölextrakts hin (, ), der in weiteren Vergleichen mit Standardmedikamenten abzuklären wäre. In der einzigen kontrollierten Studie mit einem homöopathischen Präparat fand sich kein Unterschied zu Placebo (). Wegen ihres häufig chronischen Verlaufs erfordert die generalisierte Angststörung oft eine Langzeitbehandlung. Nach Rückfallverhütungsstudien über den Zeitraum von sechs bis zwölf Monaten waren SSRIs (Escitalopram, Paroxetin), SNRIs (Venlafaxin, Duloxetin) und Pregabalin in der Langzeit-Rückfallprophylaxe wirksamer als Placebo. Eine Metaanalyse zur Behandlung der GAS mit Antidepressiva fand robuste Behandlungseffekte (). Diese Studien legen nahe, die Behandlung nach Eintreten der Besserung noch ein halbes bis ein ganzes Jahr fortzuführen. Vor dem Absetzen sollte die Dosis gegebenenfalls schrittweise reduziert werden. Benzodiazepine werden für die Langzeitbehandlung nicht empfohlen – außer in Fällen, in denen andere Medikamente oder eine KVT nicht wirksam waren. In den Verhaltenstherapie-Studien betrug die Therapiedauer zwischen 8 und 28 Zeitstunden; zu der Frage, ob längere Therapien besser oder dauerhafter wirken als kürzere, fehlen entsprechende Studien. Abhängig von der Schwere der Erkrankung kann erfahrungsgemäß eine längere Behandlungsdauer notwendig sein. Das Vorgehen bei Patienten, die durch eine medikamentöse Standardtherapie nicht gebessert wurden, wird in dargestellt. Nur wenige Studien beschäftigten sich mit Patienten über 65 Jahre. Die Wirksamkeit von Pregabalin und Quetiapin bei älteren GAS-Patienten wurde in placebokontrollierten Studien gezeigt (). In einer Studie war Escitalopram Placebo bezüglich der Responserate überlegen (). In einer Analyse der älteren Patienten aus vier GAS-Studien erwies sich Duloxetin als effektiv (). In einer Auswertung der älteren Patienten aus fünf Studien war Venlafaxin hinsichtlich der CGI-Response wirksamer als Placebo, aber nicht auf allen primären Effizienzmaßen (). Zusammenfassend kann empfohlen werden, ältere Patienten mit Pregabalin oder Duloxetin zu behandeln; in therapieresistenten Fällen kann das nicht zugelassene Quetiapin verwendet werden. Die Wirksamkeit einer KVT konnte auch bei älteren Patienten gezeigt werden; allerdings waren die Effekte geringer als bei Patienten unter 65 Jahren (, –). Vergleich einer Psychotherapie mit einer medikamentösen Behandlung Es gibt kaum Daten zum Vergleich von Psycho- und Pharmakotherapie bei der GAS. In zwei kleinen Studien mit methodischen Problemen konnte kein Unterschied zwischen beiden Therapiemodalitäten gefunden werden; die Kombination von KVT und Diazepam war wirksamer als Diazepam allein (, ). Aus diesen Studien können keine Rückschlüsse auf die Kombination einer Psychotherapie mit den derzeit empfohlenen Medikamenten gezogen werden. Da aber beide Behandlungsformen wirksam sind und vergleichbare Effektstärken haben, spricht nichts gegen eine Kombination. Bei der Überlegung, ob ein Patient eine psychotherapeutische oder pharmakologische Behandlung oder beides erhalten sollte, sind neben Wirksamkeitserwägungen folgende Aspekte für die Indikationsstellung wesentlich: Präferenz des Patienten, unerwünschte Arzneimittelwirkungen, Wirkungseintritt, Schweregrad der Erkrankung, Komorbidität, Ökonomie, Zeitfaktoren, Verfügbarkeit von Psychotherapien und Qualifizierung des Therapeuten. In der Praxis wird häufig die Pharmakotherapie gleich begonnen, während sich bei der KVT selbst in Orten mit guter Versorgungslage oft mehrmonatige Wartezeiten ergeben (). Wenn GAS mit einer komorbiden Depression einhergeht, sollte auf eine antidepressive Pharmakotherapie nicht verzichtet werden ().

Frage Nr. 5 ist nicht eindeutig zu beantworten!Im Artikel wird an zwei Stellen gesagt, dass ""die angstlösende Wirkung der SNRI in der Regel nach einer Latenz von zwei bis sechs Wochen eintritt"" (S. 304, unten im grauen Kasten; S. 306, im zweiten Abschnitt). Die Antwortmöglichkeiten lauten u. a.:2 - 4 Wochen4 - 6 Wochen... und nun??? Wenn ich diese Fortbildung mit dem abgleiche, was mir Angstpatienten berichten, kann ich nur mit dem Kopf schütteln. Es ist traurig, dass Ärzte so einseitig auf die kognitive Verhaltenstherapie und die medikamentöse Therapie gelenkt werden. Die Psychodynamik wird vollkommen an den Rand gedrängt. In meinem Blog kritisiere ich diese ""Fortbildung"" hier ausführlich: http://www.medizin-im-text.de/blog/2013/21629/angststorung-ohje-fortbildung-im-arzteblatt-zum-kopfschutteln/Mit freundlichen GrüßenDunja Voos Silexan (Lavendelölpräparat) ist kein Homöopathikum Die Autoren bezeichnen das Lavendelölpräparat Silexan als ""homöopathisches Präparat"" (S. 307, Literaturstelle e99). Allerdings handelt es sich *nicht* um ein Homöopathikum (=in einem besonderen Verdünnungsverfahren hergestellt), sondern um ein Phytotherapeutikum (=aus einem Pflanzenextrakt gewonnen). Dies ist ein grosser Unterschied und sollte bei zukünftigen cme-Artikeln beachtet werden.

Gruppenpsychotherapie: Trends aus Nordamerika Bisher gilt die Gruppenpsychotherapie als Herausforderung: Neue Methoden sollen nun nützliches Handwerkszeug für jedes Stadium dieser Therapieform liefern. Gruppenpsychotherapien sind für Psychotherapeuten immer wieder Herausforderungen: Jede Gruppe ist anders, und ihre Eigendynamik ist kaum abzusehen. Selbst erfahrene Gruppenpsychotherapeuten erleben es daher, dass einzelne Patienten frühzeitig die Gruppe verlassen oder nicht davon profitieren. Oft können sie jedoch nicht die Gründe in Erfahrung bringen und müssen sich auf ihre subjektive Einschätzung verlassen. Unter diesen Bedingungen sind Änderungen oder rechtzeitiges Eingreifen kaum möglich. Damit Therapeuten künftig sowohl positive und als auch negative Entwicklungen von Einzelpersonen oder Gruppen objektiv und kontinuierlich beobachten können, haben deutsche und US-amerikanische Wissenschaftler ein Instrument namens CORE-R (Clinical Outcome Results Standardized Measures – Revised) im Auftrag der American Group Psychotherapy Association (AGPA) entwickelt und verbessert. Maßgeblich daran beteiligt waren Prof. Dr. Bernhard Strauss von der Universität Jena und Gary Burlingame von der Brigham Young University in Utah. CORE-R kann als Werkzeugkasten verstanden werden, in dem Therapeuten für jedes Stadium der Gruppenpsychotherapie nützliches Handwerkszeug finden. Es besteht hauptsächlich aus Handzetteln, Tests und Fragebögen, mit denen die Patienten informiert und befragt werden können. Zur Vorbereitung der Patienten auf die Gruppenpsychotherapie dienen verschiedene Handzettel, die die Patienten über Therapieform und -ziele, Besonderheiten und richtiges Verhalten in psychotherapeutischen Gruppen informieren. Außerdem erhalten die Patienten Tipps, wie sie am meisten von einer Gruppenpsychotherapie profitieren können, beispielsweise indem sie offen über ihre Gefühle und Erfahrungen berichten. Darüber hinaus enthält CORE-R einen standardisierten Vordruck einer Patientenerklärung, womit sich die Patienten verpflichten, mit Außenstehenden nicht über das Gehörte zu sprechen. Zwei weitere Instrumente helfen Therapeuten dabei, die Patienten auszuwählen und die Gruppen bestmöglichst zusammenzustellen. Mit dem Group Therapy Questionnaire (GTQ) können verschiedene Patientenvariablen erfragt werden, zum Beispiel Therapieerfahrungen, Erwartungen, Symptome, Krisen, Ziele, Ängste und Barrieren der Patienten. Anhand der gewonnenen Daten lässt sich bereits im Vorfeld abschätzen, ob Gruppenpsychotherapie für den jeweiligen Patienten eine geeignete Therapieform darstellt. Der Group Selection Questionnaire (GSQ), der auch als deutsche Version vorliegt, erfasst unter anderem Erwartungen, die Fähigkeit zur Teilnahme an Gruppensitzungen sowie soziale Kompetenzen. Er erlaubt eine relativ zuverlässige Prognose, welche Patienten möglicherweise nicht von Gruppenpsychotherapie profitieren werden. Zur Beobachtung und Beurteilung des Therapieprozesses gibt CORE-R Therapeuten gleich mehrere Instrumente an die Hand. Sie dienen dazu, die Qualität des therapeutischen Bündnisses, die Atmosphäre innerhalb der Gruppe und die Bindung der Gruppenmitglieder aus Sicht der Patienten zu erfassen. Ein weiterer Fragebogen gibt dem Therapeuten Auskunft, ob die Patienten ihn als einfühlsam und fürsorglich wahrnehmen. Auch der Therapieerfolg kann mithilfe mehrerer Fragebögen überprüft werden. Durch mehrfachen Einsatz während und nach der Gruppenpsychotherapie erfährt der Therapeut, wie sich Symptome, Selbstwertgefühl und zwischen-menschliche Probleme der Patienten im Laufe der Therapie entwickeln. Darüber hinaus kann er in Erfahrungen bringen, wie die Patienten die Gruppenpsychotherapie rückwirkend beurteilen. Die meisten Tests und Fragebögen sind relativ kurz. Für das Ausfüllen und Auswerten werden jeweils circa fünf bis 20 Minuten benötigt. Guidelines stellen eine praxisorientierte Hilfe dar Zusätzlich zu CORE-R hat die AGPA kürzlich Leitlinien veröffentlicht, die Gruppenpsychotherapeuten in jeder Phase des Therapieprozesses Rat und Anregungen bieten sollen. Die „Practice guidelines for group psychotherapy“ (im Weiteren kurz: Guidelines) sind im Internet in Form eines 85-seitigen pdf-Dokuments zu finden und können kostenlos heruntergeladen werden (www. agpa.org). Sie sind in elf Hauptkapitel und zahlreiche Unterkapitel unterteilt, die sich hauptsächlich auf einzelne Therapiephasen beziehen. Zwei Kapitel befassen sich darüber hinaus mit ethischen Überlegungen sowie mit der Kombination von Gruppenpsychotherapie und anderen Behandlungsformen. Die einzelnen Kapitel sind klar strukturiert und informieren relativ umfassend sowohl über allgemeine als auch spezielle Fragen. Am Ende jedes Kapitels findet man eine Zusammenfassung. Die Guidelines sind in leicht verständlichem Englisch verfasst und orientieren sich hauptsächlich an praktischen Fällen und Fragestellungen. Im Hinblick auf die Beendigung von Gruppenpsychotherapie gehen sie beispielsweise auf die Besonderheiten der letzten Therapiephase ein und befassen sich mit unterschiedlich zeitlich befristeten Gruppen. Sie beschreiben sowohl mögliche Prozesse und Schwierigkeiten als auch Rollen und Aufgaben des Gruppenpsychotherapeuten in dieser Phase. Darüber hinaus wird auf Sonderfälle eingegangen, zum Beispiel, wenn eine Gruppenpsychotherapie vorzeitig beendet werden oder der Therapeut die Gruppe unerwartet verlassen muss. Die Guidelines stellen eine praxisorientierte Hilfe für Gruppenpsychotherapeuten dar. Ein Vorteil der Guidelines besteht darin, dass sie aktuelle gruppenpsychotherapeutische Erkenntnisse berücksichtigen und auf empirischen Studien basieren. Darüber hinaus sind sie schulenübergreifend verfasst. Eine Tendenz, lediglich US-amerikanische Verhältnisse abzubilden, ist kaum festzustellen. Daher können die Guidelines auch Gruppenpsychotherapeuten im deutschsprachigen Raum von Nutzen sein. Im Hinblick auf Gruppenpsychotherapie gibt es in Deutschland verhältnismäßig wenig Forschung im Vergleich zur Einzelpsychotherapie. Im Gegensatz dazu wurden in angloamerikanischen Ländern in den letzten Jahren viele Studien zur Wirkung und zum Prozess von Gruppenbehandlungen veröffentlicht. Allerdings hat sich der Fokus verschoben. Standen anfangs noch die allgemeine Wirksamkeit und der Vergleich zwischen Einzel- und Gruppentherapie im Mittelpunkt des Interesses, sind es heute vermehrt die Effekte in störungsspezifischen Gruppen. Auch hinsichtlich der Dauer und der Methode unterscheidet sich die nordamerikanische von der europäischen Vorgehensweise: Während in den USA vorrangig empirische gestützte, kognitiv-behaviorale Kurzzeittherapien eingesetzt werden, herrschen im europäischen Raum noch naturalistische Studien vor. „Gruppenpsychotherapie findet in Europa hauptsächlich in stationären Einrichtungen statt, ist überwiegend psychodynamisch orientiert und dauert deutlich länger“, berichtet Prof. Dr. Bernhard Strauss vom Universitätsklinikum Jena. Während Gruppenpsychotherapie in Deutschland in der stationären Behandlung einen festen Platz hat, wird sie ambulant immer seltener eingesetzt, da sie offenbar zu schlecht honoriert wird und mit zu viel Verwaltungsaufwand verbunden ist. Auch einige US-amerikanische Autoren vermelden einen gewissen Rückgang der Gruppenbehandlung. Allerdings wird dieser in den USA durch eine Ausweitung des Verständnisses von Gruppenarbeit kompensiert. Die professionelle Arbeit und Leitung von Gruppen ist längst nicht mehr die alleinige Domäne von Psychotherapeuten, sondern wird mittlerweile auch von Beratern, Supervisoren und Trainern im außerklinischen, insbesondere im sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Bereich angeboten. Ob sich die pragmatische und evidenzorientierte Ausrichtung, die zurzeit in den USA vorzufinden ist, unter dem Druck von Globalisierung und Öko­nomi­sierung im Gesundheitswesen auch bald in Europa durchsetzt, bleibt abzuwarten.

Psychotherapie: Honorar für Sprechstunde und Akutbehandlung nachgebessert Psychotherapie: Honorar für Sprechstunde und Akutbehandlung nachgebessert Berlin – Psychotherapeutische Sprechstunden und Akutbehandlung werden nachträglich höher bewertet. Sie werden künftig genauso vergütet wie die Gebührenordnungspositionen der Richtlinien-Psychotherapie. Das hat heute der Bewertungsausschuss (BA) entschieden, wie die Kassenärztliche Bundesvereinigung () mitteilte. Ursprünglich waren die neuen Leistungen der Psychotherapie niedriger bewertet worden. Dagegen hatte die KBV vor dem Landessozialgericht Berlin-Brandenburg geklagt. Wie das Bun­des­ge­sund­heits­mi­nis­ter­ium (BMG) heute auf Anfrage des betonte, habe es den alten BA-Beschluss bisher nicht beanstandet. Das Prüfverfahren dazu laufe noch, sagte eine Sprecherin. Das BMG will nun den veränderten Beschluss des BA in die Prüfung einbeziehen, hieß es. Die KBV kündigte unterdessen an, den Rechtsweg nicht weitergehen zu wollen. Man werde die Klage beim Landessozialgericht zurückziehen, sagte KBV-Chef Andreas Gassen heute im Anschluss an die Sitzung des Bewertungsausschusses. Im ursprünglichen Vergütungsbeschluss des Erweiterten Bewertungsausschusses (EBA) vom 29. März 2017, der mit Stimmen des GKV-Spitzenverbandes und des Vorsitzenden Jürgen Wasem gegen die Stimmen der KBV gefallen war, waren für die Sprechstunde sowie für die Akutbehandlung bei einer Dauer von mindestens 25 Minuten 42,75 Euro, bei 50 Minuten 85,50 Euro vorgesehen. Das waren etwa 3,5 Prozent weniger als die Krankenkassen für die Richtlinien-Psychotherapie bezahlen. Jetzt erhalten die Vertragsärzte und -psychotherapeuten für eine Sitzung von mindestens 25 Minuten 44,33 Euro, bei einer Dauer von 50 Minuten 88,56 Euro. Das entspricht einer Therapiestunde im Rahmen der Richtlinien-Therapie. Ich freue mich, dass die Kassenseite ihre Position noch einmal überdacht hat. „Unser Engagement für die psychotherapeutische Versorgung der Patienten ist erfolgreich gewesen und ich freue mich, dass die Kassenseite ihre Position noch einmal überdacht hat“, erklärte Gassen heute. Die Entscheidung werde dazu beitragen, „dass mit den neuen psychotherapeutischen Leistungen das erreicht wird, was der Gesetzgeber beabsichtigt hat: Den Versicherten ein kurzfristig verfügbares und niedrigschwelliges Versorgungsangebot in ausreichendem Umfang zur Verfügung zu stellen“, stellte KBV-Vorstand Stephan Hofmeister fest. Psychothe­rapie-Vergütung: Bundesminis­terium prüft noch Berlin – Die künftige Vergütung der neuen Psychotherapieleistungen ist noch offen. Im Augenblick prüft das Bundesministerium für Gesundheit (BMG) noch die Beschlüsse des Erweiterten Bewertungsausschusses (EBA) zu den neuen Leistungen, die seit April gelten. Darauf hat die Bundesregierung in einer Antwort auf eine kleine Anfrage der Fraktion Bündnis 90/Die Grünen hingewiesen [...] Psychotherapeutische Sprechstunde und Akutbehandlung wurden im Rahmen der Überarbeitung der Psychotherapie-Richtlinie durch den Gemeinsamen Bundes­ausschuss zum 1. April 2017 neu eingeführt. Ziel der Neuerungen war, Menschen mit psychischen Problemen einen schnelleren und niedrigschwelligen Zugang zum Therapeuten zu ermöglichen. Die Sprechstunde soll dazu dienen, im Rahmen eines Erstgespräches abzuklären, ob der Patient eine Therapie benötigt oder ob ihm mit anderen Beratungs- und Unterstützungsangeboten geholfen werden kann. Die Akutbehandlung wiederum ermöglicht Menschen in einer konkreten Krisensituation einen direkten Zugang zum Therapeuten ohne lange Genehmigungsverfahren der Krankenkasse.

96a23100-8956-4310-82a2-2dedb786ede4,"Biodynamic Psychology: Healing Through the Body's Wisdom listed in , originally published in Biodynamic Therapy was developed by the Norwegian Psychotherapist, Clinical Psychologist and Physiotherapist Gerda Boyesen (1922-2005), who lived and taught in London, where she died last December after an extraordinary rich and fulfilled life. It is a great joy for me to be part of the Biodynamic community, and I highly appreciate the opportunity to share some of my insights into one of the most important psychotherapeutic techniques today: a technique that uses the treasure of body's wisdom, a technique that reaches far beyond words to find healing, where pure verbal therapy gets to its end. Wilhelm Reich, student of Sigmund Freud, was the first to understand and introduce the importance of body and touch into psychotherapy. He laid the foundation for modern body psychotherapy. Gerda Boyesen was one of the second generation's pioneers. She was already studying psychology, when she started to work with Ola Raknes, one of Reich's close students in Norway. To fully understand the body and its anatomy, she additionally trained as a physiotherapist, where she got in touch with a very effective neuro-muscular massage technique,[1] which became the basis of Boyesen's 'Deep Draining', and the foundation of 'Biodynamic Massage'. The term 'Biodynamic' refers to the concept of life energy flowing naturally in a healthy body. This flow of energy is either supported or disturbed by our personal life experiences. The more it becomes disturbed, the less healthy we'll feel in our physical and psychological existence. Our life story is inscribed in our bodies. The way we develop our posture, the tonus of our muscles, the curves of the spine, the form of a toe, the shape of a face are all connected with the happy and the less happy experiences in our lives. Biodynamic Psychology believes that every human being has a whole and complete inner core remaining unaffected by life's turbulences, called the Primary Personality. Its counterpart though, the Secondary Personality, feeds on all life's experiences, which make us suppress or distort our primary impulses of true self-expression. Thus, over time, the way we present ourselves to the world is formed and crystallizes in a person's character and body posture.[2] Here is a simple explanation of this process: Let's assume something frightening happens to a child. Its primary reaction would be either to scream, cry or run away out of fear; to hit, kick or shout out of anger; or maybe at the end of the experience to reach out for its mother out of the need for comfort. The urge to express these feelings is not only psychological, but is a very physical, mostly instinctual reaction in the vegetative system. It can be described as a movement of fluid (or 'life energy') in the body. If the expression gets blocked, the fluid will not dissolve and cause waste in mind and body. Tension builds up in the muscles to hold back the physical expression. On the emotional level the child will feel frustrated, confused, unworthy, helpless… and in deep stress. This physical and emotional tension remains in and affects the vegetative system long after the original urge has subsided and been forgotten. If this process is repetitive, armouring happens. Armouring means that a certain muscle or a group of muscles become so stuck in their expressions that a chronic blockage arises. Reich was mainly talking about muscular armouring, meaning the skeletal muscles, whereas Boyesen found that the armouring is also happening on the even deeper level of the visceral, the muscles of the guts. The guts, she found out, are deeply involved in a person's self-regulation of stress and conflict (see below 'psychoperistalsis'). We learn to suppress the urge to express ourselves from early age on, because in individual families and in society generally, the spontaneous expression of certain feelings is not welcomed. There may be prohibitions, disapproval, punishments or even more serious traumatic experiences, like physical violence and sexual abuse, to make us repress or restrict the instinctual responses. A certain amount of stress and conflict is quite natural to human life. And it is true that the human body and psyche has got an in-built self-healing and self-regulating ability, which can deal with this limited amount very well. Once the limit is stepped over, self-regulation stops working properly and a blockage starts to establish. The good news is that the Primary Personality, even though it can be heavily covered by many layers, is never destroyed. With few exceptions, most people have healthy aspects with a good, flowing contact to the Primary. These aspects might be hidden away, but they are in a way just waiting to be rediscovered. So they will easily be accessible for a client and provide a positive force and source of strength. Subtle impulses are incessantly sent out from the core to the brain and body, carrying healing wisdom in the form of what physical movement, what sound, or what other expression or action is necessary, in order to release and re-balance the stuck energy of that person in this moment. One of the aims of Biodynamic Body Psychotherapy is to help the client to regain awareness of these subtle impulses 'impinging from within', and learn to trust and follow their guidance towards the enfolding of the true self. Biodynamic Body Psychotherapy disposes over a wide range of techniques to work through a person's layers of armouring, in respect of the person's pace and in a gentle, allowing way. On this path the client will most certainly meet his/her resistance. It is one of the fundamental beliefs of Biodynamic Psychotherapy that resistance needs and deserves respect, and its attitude towards it is one of open, loving inquisitiveness and understanding: why is that resistance there? What is/was its job? What does it need to let go? Once valued for its aims and purposes, linked to the past, the resistance will soften and allow being seduced to give way to more appropriate behaviour for that person's life now. Because blockages manifest on the vegetative and, therefore, subconscious level, an essential part of the therapy works beyond words, in direct contact with life energy (hence its name 'vegetotherapy'). We can be mentally very aware of an issue, but as long as it is not cleared out of the body's system, it will most certainly continue to give us trouble. This process develops gently in the safe environment of the therapeutic setting before it integrates more and more into the person's outer life. Ultimately, the person's self-regulation will be restored and fully functional again, so that he/she will be able to deal with the minor disturbances of everyday life on his/her own. Harmony, health and a deeper feeling of pleasure in being alive usually emerge out of this process. The Spiritual Embrace of Biodynamic Body Psychotherapy Biodynamic Body Psychotherapy acknowledges the spiritual dimension of our existence. I feel the wish to emphasize how I personally work on this premise. I see Body Psychotherapy (among many other methods and ways) as a very powerful tool to learn as much as we can about the path and intention of our soul here on earth, and to nourish that sparkling star in our heart, which radiates love and a 'yes' for life. I see every blockage as a blessed obstacle with the potential to wake us up and guide us to merge with our Primary Personality, which is directly linked with the higher self. Wonderful moments full of awe happen, when a client experiences this contact: deep healing is taking place. There is no need for words; peace, harmony and love radiate naturally from that person and pervade every cell of his or her body as well as the direct environment. It is like witnessing a miracle in all its simple beauty. The limits of my work, and any kind of Psychotherapy, lie for my understanding within the boundaries of the spiritual blueprint of a person's life at this moment in time, and I see my work in service of this greater perspective. Biodynamic therapy works in depth with the link between mind, body and spirit. The attitude of the therapist is one of cooperation with the client. Together they set out on the journey to explore and understand where the symptoms or issues the client brought to the sessions originate, and what the person needs to regain his or her balance. The therapist takes sides with the healthy core and supports the client in his or her ability to connect with that core and listen to its messages. Non-verbal language is used as a means of communicating between the conscious and subconscious, for example in exploring a spontaneous gesture or movement, expression of the eyes or the sound of the voice. Non-verbal therapeutic interventions are for example, specially devised massages, breath work, body awareness, regression therapy, vegetotherapy and emotional expression. Touch is part of biodynamic psychotherapy, but will only be used with the understanding and agreement of the client. Verbal psychotherapy is to a certain extent always part of the setting. At the beginning and the end of a session, the verbal part functions like a bridge between the day-to-day life and the therapy session, and often it is important for the client to verbalize her/his experiences from the session in order to integrate it fully in his/her life. There might be sessions when verbal psychotherapy is what the client needs in this moment of his/her process. But the Biodynamic therapist will be aware of the non-verbal language and thus read between the spoken words. Biodynamic Massage works within the above outlined holistic perspective of body, mind and spirit. It can be part of the therapeutic journey, or it can be used as a treatment in its own right. How does it differ from other holistic/therapeutic forms of massage? Biodynamic Psychology knows and uses the techniques and effects of classical massage, as well as those of the more spiritually oriented new-age massage types, and very similar results can be expected: general improvement of the metabolism, balance of the respiratory system, reduction of stress and stress-related symptoms (headaches, insomnia), calming of the nervous system, easing of muscular tensions and related physical pains and aches (back, neck, shoulders), release of toxins and aura balance, to name just a few. But some essential aspects surpass the areas of common ground hugely and give biodynamic massage its unique character: the Biodynamic Therapist is trained to communicate through touch with the vegetative system in order to bring the stuck energy and tensions to a release. Boyesen discovered that the peristaltic sounds gave her a feedback about how the body, (always understood as in unity with the whole person), and mainly its vegetative system, responds to the touch of the therapist. This reaction can be different for every few inches of the body. The peristaltic sounds are part of the self-healing or self-regulating ability of the body and they indicate the digestion of emotional stress. This function of our intestines Boyesen called the 'psychoperistalsis'. The biodynamic therapist may use an electrical stethoscope to keep track of the sounds during the treatment. Biodynamic massage knows about the effect of touch: 'When we touch a body, we touch the whole person'. Every massage is, in a way, an intimate meeting. Even the simplest body contact touches at issues around closeness and distance, and massage tends to associate with the regressive moments and corresponding emotions in a person's life. A biodynamic therapist knows about this dynamic. She or he is also aware of the effects of transference and counter transference any situation of physical closeness may cause, and is able to deal with it professionally. Sometimes this process will not show on a conscious level of interaction or it will be very natural and easy, and sometimes it may induce the step from massage to psychotherapy. Knowing about the delicate balance of traumatic and life affirmative tendencies of a person, Boyesen developed a series of massage sequences, especially designed to trick the guardians of the unconscious (resistance) in order to finally convince them of the safeness of pleasurable alternatives. The 'deep draining' is a very powerful technique, where the subtle communication between the therapist and the vegetative system of the client must be used with high expertise. It needs a minimum of eight to ten sessions with intervals of body psychotherapy to integrate the changes on all levels. Vegetative reactions such as diarrhoea, sweating, headaches, deep tiredness and so on, can occur and indicate the release of toxins on the physical level. For a biodynamic massage treatment the therapist may use a massage table or work on a mattress on the floor. For success of the treatment it is not necessary to work on bare skin; it is up to the client to decide if he/she wants to be touched directly on the skin or not. It is up to the therapist to decide the use of any oils or lotions for the treatment. Some massages follow a fixed structure, like the back massage, belly massage, exit massage (head, hands, feet) and all the 'deep draining' treatments. But many others follow the client's verbalized needs, the feedback of the peristaltic sounds and the therapist's intuition. Biodynamic massage is suitable for those looking for release of stress-related symptoms and other psycho-physiological conditions. Headaches, anxiety, insomnia, depression, arthritis, ME, etc, have been treated successfully; for those looking for a pleasurable relaxing massage; and for those wanting to increase their body awareness and wanting to embark on a journey of self-discovery through a body-centred approach. The 'deep draining' is suitable for those on the path of self- discovery, willing to commit for a certain time and looking for the combination of massage and psychotherapy. Group therapy, in contrast to the 1:1 setting relying on the relationship between client and therapist, offers a diversity of relationships similar to real life, optimal ground to explore different ways of contact with each other and the self. It creates the possibility to encounter immediate emotional reality and its effect on the body and mind in a continuous process. The participants find a deeper sense of their true nature and come to understand what is going on in their present lives in the light of their past experiences. Trust, openness and speaking out freely transforms the group into a safe and secure place, where it is OK to experiment with and share a newly found truth, or to try for the first time to speak up for yourself. Eventually fear and shame can be overcome and a deep loving understanding towards ourselves and each other arises. Beginning to know that 'I am OK the way I am!' is a truly wonderful and freeing experience. 1. This was the method of Aadel Bulow Hansen, who had her own clinic in Norway. Bulow Hansens's massages – without her having any knowledge of Reich's theories – succeeded in melting the muscular armouring. Gerda Boyesen trained with her and part of the training was to receive the massages herself, which opened Boyesen's process to a level she hadn't been able to reach before. 2. Even though there are other aspects involved in character formation, like genetic inheritance, character types have been and still are important for Body Psychotherapy. very infomative (so thats how it works)wonderful article, by a wonderful practioner. everyone needs this. , an experienced Biodynamic Body Psychotherapist, trained with the Gerda Boyesen Institute and ESBPE (European School for Biodynamic Psychology) for five years in Biodynamic Psychology, Body Psychotherapy and Massage.
