Anxiety medication and have opposing effects. Thus in many cases, only the anxiety is treated with medication, as its effects are more disabling. Here are some interventions, ideas and tips for dealing with anxiety in children with ADHD. You can use most of them at home or in the classroom. Social skills training are usually weekly groups conducted by a therapist. However, these skills can be taught and reinforced even at home, or in the classroom. Help the child gain confidence in social situations that they face every day. Provide opportunities for the child to develop conversation skills and other social behaviors. Give feedback and appreciate the child when he or she gets it right. Help the child practice skills that they are not confident about in front of a mirror. This type of therapy can help older children or adolescents with ADHD to identify negative thoughts and dispute them. You too, can use this concept at home or school, by teaching the child to be positive and see the good in every situation. Support the child through anxious times by saying positive, encouraging statements and building their confidence. Some children can learn to keep their anxiety under control with relaxation techniques. These include deep breathing, and lying still and closing their eyes for a few minutes. The child needs to be taught to practice these techniques whenever he or she gets anxious. Parents or teachers may need to remind the child to stop and use relaxation techniques when they find that the child is very anxious. Children who do not get enough sleep at night are prone to anxiety. Make sure the child’s bedroom is noise free, and eliminate any disturbances. Set up a routine for sleeping every night that requires the child to get into bed at a specific time even if they are not feeling sleepy. Exercise lowers stress levels in children with ADHD. Encourage exercise by introducing the child to sports, dance, self defense and other enjoyable physical activities. Allot physical chores in the house or classroom, to channel the . Children who aim for perfection often get very anxious when things don’t go right. Teach the child that some things in life don’t always happen smoothly, and thus they should just accept it if they make a mistake. Schedules and routines help a person with anxiety feel safer. The regularity of daily tasks helps the child to feel safe and secure. It provides them with order and stability. However, whenever there is going to be a change in the routine or schedule, ensure that you prepare the child for it and let him or her know what is going to happen. Learning about their emotions and learning to accept them is a big step towards overcoming anxiety. However, the child needs to be a little older to understand their condition. You can start by teaching children to label common emotions and deal with them constructively. Over time, you can help the child understand how anxiety affects their life. Thus, these are some ideas for dealing with anxiety in ADHD children. Early diagnosis and treatment of the anxiety can help the child with ADHD cope better with the challenges in their life.

Image Credit: Eviart / Shutterstock Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. The condition is characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, which can cause significant behavioral, academic, social and cognitive impairments. It is thought that more than 60% of those diagnosed with ADHD will also have at least one other comorbid psychological disorder. Anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are among the most common psychiatric disorders thought to affect approximately 19% of adults each year in the US. The disorder is characterized by persistent feelings of worry, fear, and a sense of being overwhelmed on a daily basis. What separates an anxiety disorder to general anxiety or worry that people might experience is the fact that those with anxiety disorders worry excessively and unrealistically about everyday occurrences such as health, family, and the future. The excessiveness is typically difficult to control, which can significantly impact the individual’s ability to manage their daily life, and alongside this, many may experience additional physical and psychological symptoms. Anxiety disorders are thought to affect approximately 32% of adolescents at some point between ages 13 and 18-years. Like many disorders, anxiety may be experienced alongside comorbid disorders such as ADHD. It is argued that those with ADHD may experience anxiety disorders as a result of their ADHD and the impairments and dysfunctions it can cause. Furthermore, research has found that this anxiety can often be experienced in cases of undiagnosed and therefore untreated ADHD. Individuals with comorbid anxiety and ADHD typically develop anxiety at an earlier age, experience more extreme symptoms of anxiety, and substance abuse issues compared to those with just ADHD. Furthermore, ADHD is often diagnosed significantly later in those with comorbid anxiety compared to those with ADHD alone. This is thought to occur as the anxiety might inhibit impulsivity. Research has suggested that the comorbidity seen between ADHD and anxiety may be due to similarities in neurological deficits. For example, in both disorders, deficits often experienced are associated with executive control and poor prefrontal activity. It is suggested that treatment should focus on addressing the ADHD symptoms as this may ultimately reduce anxiety, which is often experienced as a by-product. ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Asperger’s ASD is comprised of a set of neurodevelopment disorders which are characterized by deficits in nonverbal interactions, such as facial expressions, body gestures, reduced eye contact, and social behaviors which typically present within the first three years of infancy. The disorder affects males 2-3 times more than females; however, like in ADHD, this may be due to under-recognition of ASD symptoms in females. Autism, specifically, is a developmental disability which causes differences in how a person interacts with others and perceives their environment. As a spectrum disorder, individuals will experience specific difficulties to varying degrees, which may affect them in different ways. Asperger syndrome is categorized as a type of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Those with the disorder often experience issues with nonverbal communication, social interaction coupled with repetitive and limited interests and behavior. Compared to those with ASD, individuals with Asperger’s are often considered to be at the high functioning end of the spectrum. Comorbidity between ADHD and those on the autism spectrum is thought to occur among 14% to 78% of affected persons. Research has highlighted differences in patterns of deficits in top-down processing in children with ADHD and ASD. Typically, children with ASD struggle with cognitive flexibility (the ability to switch tasks or attention readily), and planning, compared to those with ADHD who often face difficulty sustaining attention and inhibition. However, children with ASD and ADHD symptoms often present deficits in inhibition, which is similar to those with ADHD alone. Differences in working memory have also been noted in those with ASD. Treatment options may need to be adapted in individuals with both ADHD and ASD. Social skills training is often used to treat children with ASD. However, it has been found to have limited effectiveness on managing symptoms in those with ADHD and ASD due to deficits in working memory, delayed recall, and acquisition. This may complicate such interventions as effective social interaction often relies on the ability to take-turns and maintain attentional focus, which requires working memory. Depression is a common mood disorder characterized by loss of interest in activities previously found pleasurable and persistent feelings of sadness. There are five main depressive disorders with the most prevalent being major depressive disorder (MDD). Similarities between the disorders include somatic and cognitive changes, sadness, emptiness, and irritable mood that significantly impair the individual’s ability to manage their daily life. Depression is a common psychological mood disorder which can be chronic for those with the condition, as can be ADHD. A body of research has shown links between both disorders, with approximately 9% to 38% of those with ADHD are also diagnosed with depression. The combination of both conditions can often present challenges to clinicians. can often exacerbate the symptoms, and therefore the dysfunctions of ADHD further. Additionally, it is suggested that those who present with MDD at a later stage following their may develop severe dysfunction compared to those with just MDD. It is suggested that those with ADHD experience demoralization, extreme unhappiness and sad or low mood. Due to the dysfunction they often face, the inability to reach their potential can create a sense of loss or hopelessness often association with MDD. Research including the self-reported feelings of those with ADHD found that those with ADHD and MDD reported a lower quality of life compared to those with just MDD. It is assumed that antidepressants may be beneficial in treating symptoms in those with ADHD and depression as the medication has been found to be effective in treating both conditions in isolation. Furthermore, particular tricyclic and fluoxetine antidepressants have been found to be safe when used alongside stimulants. While most consider dyslexia to be characterized predominantly by difficulty with reading, those with the psychological disorder may have deficits in visual processing, working memory, phonology and auditory skills also. Individuals with dyslexia often report issues of seeing the text shifting on pages and having difficulties with the glare given off by white paper. Furthermore, some may show indications of experiencing binocular problems, whereby they miss out lines or words, lose their place often while reading or misread words entirely. Impairments in both ADHD and dyslexia can often have a synergistic effect whereby one contributes to the worsening of the other. Therefore, individuals with both disorders may experience more significant deficits in academic performance and cognitive processes. Treatment options should look at addressing both disorders in order to improve optimal levels of performance, especially in school and workplace settings. Munir S., & Takov V. (2019). Chand S.

Abstract Abstract Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral disorder in children, and the prevalence is increasing. Physicians should evaluate for ADHD in children with behavioral concerns (e.g., inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, oppositionality) or poor academic progress using validated assessment tools with observers from several settings (home, school, community) and self-observation, if possible. Physicians who inherit a patient with a previous ADHD diagnosis should review the diagnostic process, and current symptoms and treatment needs. Coexisting conditions (e.g., anxiety, learning, mood, or sleep disorders) should be identified and treated. Behavioral treatments are recommended for preschool-aged children and may be helpful at older ages. Effective behavioral therapies include parent training, classroom management, and peer interventions. Medications are recommended as first-line therapy for older children. Psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine, are most effective for the treatment of core ADHD symptoms and have generally acceptable adverse effect profiles. There are fewer supporting studies for atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine, and they are less effective than the psychostimulants. Height, weight, heart rate, blood pressure, symptoms, mood, and treatment adherence should be recorded at follow-up visits. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral disorder in childhood. The prevalence increased by an estimated 3% annually between 1997 and 2006. Recent national data show that up to 11% of four- to 17-year-olds have had an ADHD diagnosis, 8.8% currently have the diagnosis, and 6.1% are receiving a medication for ADHD.  Enlarge     Print Children four years and older and adolescents with poor attention, distractibility, hyperactivity, impulsiveness, poor academic performance, or behavioral problems at home or at school should be evaluated for ADHD. Behavioral therapy should be the primary treatment for ADHD in children younger than six years, and it may be helpful at older ages. Treatment of ADHD in children six years and older should start with medication. Psychostimulants (e.g., methylphenidate [Ritalin], dextroamphetamine) are the most effective therapy for core ADHD symptoms and have generally acceptable adverse effect profiles.

Medication is effective for treating ADHD symptoms, and studies suggest that earlier identification and treatment may improve longer-term educational, work, and social outcomes. This article is based on the University of Michigan Health System guideline for ADHD and includes information from other guidelines and reviews. Abstract Although the etiology of ADHD is not fully understood, genetic and neurologic factors play important roles. ADHD is two to eight times more common in persons who have a first-degree relative with the condition. In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in brain structure, and neuronal functioning and connectivity, which appear to be correlated with ADHD severity. Abstract The diagnosis of ADHD should be considered in patients four years or older with poor attention, distractibility, hyperactivity, impulsiveness, poor academic performance, or behavioral problems at home or at school. More boys have ADHD overall; however, the inattentive subtype is more common in girls. Although no evidence supports universal screening for ADHD at well visits, physicians should be attentive to patients' and guardians' concerns about academic performance and behavioral problems. Abstract The evaluation of ADHD in children and adolescents includes a history and physical examination, review of information across home and community settings , and application of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria . The physician should ask about the presence and duration of core ADHD symptoms and the degree of functional impairment from the perspective of the patient, family, and school. The physician should also evaluate for other possible conditions that may mimic or coexist with ADHD   . For instance, sleep problems can affect daytime functioning and account for mild ADHD symptoms. One-third of individuals with ADHD have a comorbid diagnosis.

ADHD includes three subtypes: primarily inattentive (e.g., distracted, poor organization and follow-through); primarily hyperactive-impulsive (e.g., fidgety, overly active, interrupts); and combined. A positive family history for ADHD is supportive of an ADHD diagnosis. Physicians who inherit a patient with a previous ADHD diagnosis should review the diagnostic process, and current symptoms and treatment needs. Rating scales should be included in the medical record to monitor progress and adjust treatment accordingly. ADHD cannot be reliably diagnosed in children younger than four years. Although it is difficult to determine whether symptoms are beyond the expected behavior of four- and five-year-olds,  validated behavioral rating scales for this age group can improve diagnostic confidence. Children typically present with ADHD symptoms during the early school years. Patients with primarily hyperactive-impulsive or combined types may present with behaviors considered as problematic before those with primarily inattentive features. Patients with the primarily inattentive type may not present until academic requirements become greater (e.g., by the fourth grade). A comorbid learning disorder should be considered if academic progress is poor. Patients should be assessed for sleep problems, such as obstructive sleep apnea, particularly those with snoring and daytime behavioral problems; adenotonsillar hypertrophy; neuromuscular abnormalities; or obesity. New onset of ADHD symptoms is less common beyond 12 years of age, but may occur because of increased academic demands or if subtle symptoms are unrecognized at an earlier age. Learning disabilities, mental health conditions, sleep problems, and substance abuse should be considered because they may mimic ADHD or be a comorbidity. Two teachers who know the patient well, and possibly other supervisory adults (e.g., coaches, group leaders), should provide information about the patient's symptoms. Behavioral rating scales are also available for self-report at this age. Abstract The goal of ADHD treatment is to improve symptoms, optimize functional performance, and remove behavioral obstacles. The primary care physician should provide families with ADHD-specific resources and general parenting advice. Children with ADHD may qualify for accommodations at school under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act or under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Parents can request an evaluation to determine eligibility for these accommodations or for an individualized education plan (IEP) through their child's school district.  Enlarge     Print American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry http://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Resource_Centers/ADHD_Resource_Center/Home.aspx http://www.healthychildren.org/english/health-issues/conditions/adhd/Pages/default.aspx https://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/diseases-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd.html http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml U.S. government (education rights): Department of Education http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/osep/index.html and American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry http://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Resource_Centers/ADHD_Resource_Center/Home.aspx http://www.healthychildren.org/english/health-issues/conditions/adhd/Pages/default.aspx https://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/diseases-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd.html http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml U.S. government (education rights): Department of Education http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/osep/index.html and Treatment of children younger than six years should begin with behavioral therapy. Medications may be considered if ADHD symptoms are moderate to severe and not responsive to behavioral therapy. Therapy should start with medications in children six years and older. Behavioral treatments are also recommended for older children; however, they are particularly helpful if medication response is poor or associated with adverse effects. The Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD assessed treatment effects in 579 children seven to nine years of age. Patients received intensive behavioral therapy, medication, combined behavioral therapy and medication, or standard treatment by community physicians over 14 months. Similar benefits were observed for behavior, social skills, relationships and academics in children who received medication alone compared with those who received medication and behavioral therapy. Longer-term analyses suggest that behavioral treatment provides additional benefits beyond medication alone, particularly regarding treatment satisfaction for parents and teachers and in children with lower socioeconomic status. Effective behavioral therapies include parent training, classroom management, peer interventions, and combinations of these interventions. Parent training, in group or individual formats, provides education to improve their understanding about ADHD, behavioral problems, and child development. This training also helps them employ positive parenting strategies (e.g., praise and rewards for targeted behaviors) and reduce disruptive child behaviors (e.g., planned ignoring of behavior and use of consequences). Treatment often involves seven to 12 weekly sessions and has demonstrated improved child behavior and parent satisfaction. Classroom management focuses on strategies to improve classroom routines and structure, a token economy to shape positive behaviors, and a daily behavioral report card to monitor progress and provide feedback to the child, parent, and team. Peer interventions include social skills training and time-intensive, adult-mediated interactions to improve social behaviors. Medications reduce core ADHD symptoms for most children. summarizes common ADHD medications. Psychostimulants (e.g., methylphenidate [Ritalin], dextroamphetamine, and mixed amphetamine salts such as dextroamphetamine/amphetamine [Adderall]) are the most effective and safe option, and are the first choice for ADHD treatment in national guidelines and reviews. Atomoxetine (Strattera) and alpha-2 receptor agonists (e.g., guanfacine [Tenex], clonidine [Catapres]) are also effective but have fewer supporting studies and are less effective than psychostimulants. Reasons for starting with a second-line drug include strong family preference for a nonstimulant medication, concern about drug diversion (although some long-acting stimulants reduce this risk), or comorbid conditions that might also be managed by a single medication (e.g., an anxiety or tic disorder).  Enlarge     Print Common Medications for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 2.5 mg twice to three times daily (maximum, 30 mg per day) Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Metadate, Concerta, Daytrana, Quillivant)† Tablet: 18 mg (maximum, 54 mg per day if < 13 years of age, 72 mg per day if ≥ 13 years of age and ≤ 2 mg per kg per day) ≤ 70 kg: 0.5 mg per kg for 3 days, then increase to 1.2 mg per kg per day; > 70 kg: 40 mg per day for 3 days, then increase to 80 to 100 mg per day (maximum, 1.4 mg per kg) Regular release: 0.05 mg at night for 3 to 7 days, then increase to 3 or 4 doses per day (maximum, 0.2 mg per day for < 41 kg, 0.3 mg per day for 41 to 45 kg, and 0.4 mg per day for > 45 kg) Extended release: 0.1 mg at night for 7 days, then increase by 0.1 mg twice daily every week (maximum, 0.4 mg per day) Regular release: 0.5 mg at night for 7 days, then increase by 0.5 mg twice daily every 3 to 7 days (maximum, 2 mg per day for < 40.5 kg, 3 mg per day for 40.5 to 45 kg, 4 mg per day for > 45 kg Extended release: 1 mg morning or night for 7 days, increase by 1 mg per week (maximum, 4 mg per day) Psychostimulants are first-line and nonpsychostimulants second-line in terms of effectiveness for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. *—Estimated retail price for 30 days at the starting dosage, based on information obtained at (accessed April 21, 2014).

Generic price listed first; brand price listed in parentheses. Other medications used for ADHD include antidepressants (e.g., bupropion [Wellbutrin], trazodone), atypical antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone [Risperidal], aripiprazole [Abilify]), and mood stabilizers (e.g., carbamazepine [Tegretol]). These are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating ADHD and are used off-label when psychostimulants, atomoxetine, or alpha-2 receptor agonists are ineffective, or for treatment of comorbid conditions. . These medications affect central nervous system dopaminergic pathways. In addition to symptom reduction, academic performance may also improve; children with ADHD who are taking a stimulant are less likely to be held back a grade. Stimulant medication does not increase the incidence of substance abuse and may improve driving performance in younger drivers who have ADHD. About 70% of patients respond to the first stimulant medication, and 90% to 95% respond to a second stimulant. Of the medication studies involving preschool children, methylphenidate is most supported. Adverse effects of stimulant medication are generally dose dependent and include reduced appetite, abdominal discomfort, headache, irritability, anxiousness, sleep problems, and a small reduction in height velocity that may attenuate with time and/or reverse after discontinuation of treatment. Preschoolers may also have mood lability. Although depression and suicidal ideation are rare, family members should be informed about the risk. Small increases in heart rate and blood pressure have also been observed; significant elevations are rare. Evidence that stimulants increase the risk of cardiac problems is conflicting. National guidelines recommend that physicians consider electrocardiography and/or cardiology referral before initiating psychostimulants in patients with a history of heart disease, palpitations, syncope, or seizures, or with a family history of sudden cardiac death, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or long QT syndrome. Tic and Tourette syndrome symptoms affect about 2% to 12% of the general population, but about 20% of patients with ADHD. The presence of tics is not a contraindication for stimulant use; however, the current consensus is that although stimulant use does not clearly worsen tics, it may do so in individual cases. Treatment with atomoxetine or the addition of an alpha-1 receptor agonist may lessen comorbid tics. Psychostimulant dosing should start low and increase once to twice weekly based on feedback from parents, the patient, and teachers. No evidence shows that one psychostimulant agent is superior. A younger child who cannot swallow pills may benefit from liquid or spansule preparations (which can be sprinkled on food). An older child or teenager may benefit from long-acting preparations and/or the addition of a short-acting compound after school to provide sufficient coverage for homework or other activities. Long-acting preparations have the advantage of less frequent dosing but can be more costly than short-acting options. . Atomoxetine is a nonstimulant medication that affects noradrenergic systems. Atomoxetine may also be effective for comorbid mood or anxiety disorders and has no abuse risk. These factors may be beneficial in the treatment of adolescents with ADHD. Adverse effects include somnolence, gastrointestinal upset/nausea (particularly if the dose is advanced too quickly), and reduced appetite. Full therapeutic effect is reached in about four to six weeks. . These antihypertensive agents are also beneficial as alternatives or adjuncts to stimulant treatment for ADHD. Potential advantages of guanfacine over clonidine include a longer half-life and fewer sedative and hypotensive effects. Both are useful in combination with stimulants for patients who have ADHD and comorbid sleep problems, tics, or Tourette syndrome. Physician follow-up is recommended one month after initiating treatment. Height, weight, heart rate, blood pressure, symptoms, mood, and treatment adherence should be monitored at follow-up visits. Monthly visits may be required until medication dosing and timing are optimized. When an acceptable regimen is determined, follow-up is recommended at least every three months during the first year, and two or three times per year thereafter to assess control of symptoms, treatment adherence, and the presence of comorbid conditions. Medication holidays are unnecessary unless adverse effects (e.g., decreased growth velocity) are a concern. : In addition to the literature search for the University of Michigan Health System guideline, we searched Essential Evidence Plus, the Cochrane Library, and the National Guideline Clearinghouse using the key terms attention deficit disorder and attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity, and combined with the additional search terms general treatment, drug treatment, harm, risk factors, and guidelines.

If you are a healthcare professional and you find any issue, please reach out to When prescribed correctly, Xanax and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common combination. Xanax, or alprazolam, is a benzodiazepine medication Benzodiazepines make gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter, stick around longer in brain cells. In patients with anxiety, this effect has a near-immediate calming effect. Someone with ADHD has a low attention span, and they are overly impulsive and overly active. ADHD affects mostly children. Two out of three children with ADHD go onto have it as an adult. People with ADHD have difficulty managing racing or anxious thoughts. However, Xanax is not used to control symptoms of anxiety. Xanax is approved to treat people with panic and anxiety disorder. Both panic and anxiety disorders are debilitating conditions that make it hard for a person to function in usual situations. Xanax may be useful for people with both an anxiety condition and ADHD. Like other benzodiazepines, Xanax is habit-forming and should only be used short-term. Over time, Xanax loses the ability to manage anxiety symptoms but continues to be addictive even when it no longer works well for anxiety. Therefore, Xanax may be helpful for certain people with anxiety and ADHD at first, but should not be used for a long period. Xanax acts as a depressant but most medications that treat ADHD are stimulants. You should not combine these medications unless they are prescribed by a physician. ADHD medications and Xanax have the potential for abuse. Some commonly prescribed medications for ADHD are: Xanax does not have any drug interactions with those ADHD medications. However, having no known drug interactions does not mean that the combination is safe. Potential Side Effects of Mixing ADHD Medication with Xanax People who abuse ADHD medication, whether it is prescribed or not, might take Xanax to ease some of the . Some symptoms of stimulant abuse include: Xanax can help reduce the unpleasant side effects of stimulant abuse. Stimulants are usually habit-forming, and using a second habit-forming drug to treat the side effects of the first can lead to developing a drug addiction. Keep the following key points in mind regarding Xanax and ADHD: Xanax is a habit-forming prescription drug that treats anxiety and panic disorder People with ADHD can be hyperactive, impulsive and inattentive Xanax should never be used to treat symptoms of ADHD Xanax can be used for people with an anxiety disorder and ADHD Sometimes people who abuse stimulants take Xanax to help ease the side effects of the stimulant Both Xanax and many ADHD medications are addictive and may require inpatient rehab treatment If you live with a substance use disorder and a co-occurring mental health disorder, like having a Xanax addiction along with ADHD, today and take the first step toward a healthier future.

a53519b2-5631-428e-89c8-e3a177d01b77,"Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Medications - A Look at the Available Medication Options Non-Stimulant Treatments for Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Finding the Right Treatment for Adult Attention Deficit Disorder There are several different types of adult that may be prescribed to treat the symptoms of the disorder. The most commonly prescribed medications are stimulants. There are also non-stimulant options, though they may not work as quickly as stimulant medications. In some cases, adults cannot take stimulants because of certain health conditions or because of problems with substance abuse, so for them, non-stimulant drugs are a good option. Antidepressants may also be prescribed as the sole treatment for the condition, or in addition to other attention deficit disorder medications. Stimulant medications, such as, Ritalin, Concerta, and Adderall are the most commonly prescribed medications for adults with attention deficit disorder. These stimulant drugs work quickly and often dramatically to treat the most problematic symptoms. Almost immediately after taking the medications, adults become more alert, less anxious, and more organized. They are also more able to concentrate and have fewer problems with impulsivity. The most commonly reported side effects of stimulants for include insomnia and changes in appetite. These appetite changes can result in rapid weight loss, and is one reason that some adults cannot take stimulants. Adults who have had problems with substance abuse may not be able to take stimulants either because they are a controlled substance. The effects of stimulant drugs do not last all day, so for adults who work long hours, they may not be a good option. Non-Stimulant Treatments for Adult Attention Deficit Disorder For adults who cannot take, or choose not to take stimulant drugs, there are other options available. Straterra is the only non-stimulant drug that is approved by the FDA for treating the symptoms of adult attention deficit disorder at this time. It offers the same benefits as stimulant drugs, but it does not begin working as quickly. It can take weeks to see the full effects of the drug, but when this happens the benefits last all day. Since taking Straterra does not pose a risk of substance abuse, it is a good option for some adults. Sometimes, antidepressants are prescribed to treat the symptoms of adult attention deficit disorder. Some will increase concentration, though they do not always work as well as other treatments for the disorder. They are sometimes prescribed along with other attention deficit disorder medications because they can help patients deal with the depression and anger issues that can co-occur. Finding the Right Treatment for Adult Attention Deficit Disorder It can sometimes be difficult to find the right treatment for adult attention deficit disorder, so the process may involve trial and error. The treatment will depend on the severity of the disorder and whether or not the patient has a history of substance abuse. How patients react to the medication is another factor that helps decide the proper treatment. Some adults with attention deficit disorder respond well to stimulant medications, while others may not be able to handle the side effects. Not every medication will deliver the same results to every person, so finding the right treatment option often requires a lot of patience. The good news is, there are many different adult attention deficit disorder medications out there to choose from. https://www.medicinenet.com/adhd_in_adults/page3.htm American Academy of Family Physicians: Adult ADD: Evaluation and Treatments in Family Medicine https://www.mayoclinic.com/health/adult-adhd/DS01161/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs A Guide to Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder Relationships Treating the Difficult and Persistent Condition of Severe ADHD in Adults Yoga and Meditation for Kids with ADHD: The Benefits ADHD Stimulation Therapy - Can Light and Sound Therapy Help my ADHD Child?

She's also a psychotherapist, the author of the bestselling book ""13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do,"" and the host of the Mentally Strong People podcast. Many adults with (ADHD) also struggle with anxiety that impairs their lives. Sometimes this anxiety develops as a result of the ADHD symptoms. If you have difficulty managing the everyday demands of life, are chronically late, forgetful, have trouble meeting deadlines and obligations, become overwhelmed with finances, tune out in conversations, speak or act impulsively, lack tact in social situations—then certainly this can bring about feelings of chronic anxiety. You may worry about keeping track of it all. You may worry about what will go wrong next. When will the next ""let down"" occur? What will I say next to embarrass myself or someone else? You may dread that next time when you are rushing to an important appointment that you will surely be late to again. Sometimes adults with ADHD also worry in a different way. It can be so difficult to manage daily activities that you may find yourself experiencing anxiety in a pressured way as you try to organize yourself. Do these concerns sound familiar? ""I must remember to turn in the contract by Feb. 1""; ""The report has to be finished by Monday""; and ""I cannot forget to pick up the kids early from school Friday because they have a dentist appointment."" In these situations, your mind may get fixated on worry. For some people, this is a . For others, this self-imposed pressure becomes even more debilitating. With such enormous worry and burden hanging over your head, you may find that you shut down even more. Some people even experience a sense of paralysis that prevents them from moving forward at all. In addition to the anxiety symptoms associated with ADHD described above, research does find a strong association between ADHD and anxiety disorders. Roughly 40% to 60% of adults with ADHD also have an anxiety disorder.﻿ Anxiety disorders can manifest themselves in a variety of physical, mood, cognitive and behavioral symptom patterns. Common features of these disorders are excessive anxiety, worry, nervousness, and fear. This is often accompanied by feelings of restlessness, being ""keyed up"" or constantly on edge, problems with concentration (or mind going blank), sleep disturbances, muscle tension, irritability, fatigue, and feeling overwhelmed. It can be very difficult to relax and participate fully in life with these impairing symptoms. The person quickly begins to avoid situations in which a negative outcome could occur. If that person is able to face these situations, he or she may only be able to do so by spending excessive time and effort preparing. The anxiety can result in procrastination in behavior or decision-making and the need to repeatedly seek reassurances due to worries. It is clear that features of ADHD—inattention, restlessness, procrastination, sleep problems, feeling overwhelmed—can overlap with symptoms of anxiety. So one of the first steps in planning treatment is to decipher whether these impairments are coming from the ADHD (secondary to the ADHD) or whether they are the result of a separate, co-existing anxiety disorder. Whether or not a person meets the diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder, it is clear that symptoms of ADHD can result in chronic anxiety that can further impair a person’s functioning, happiness, and level of self-esteem. It is important to the full spectrum of ADHD.

Although there is no cure for the disorder, it can be successfully treated. There are several different approaches for treating adults, but generally some combination of medication and behavioral therapy yields the best results. . Prescription drugs that are used to treat ADHD in children usually are effective for most adults with the predominantly inattentive form of ADHD. However, the dosage and frequency of medications may have to be adjusted early during the course of treatment. It is important to match the needs of the person with ADHD with the characteristics of the drug. The major classes of prescription medications that are prescribed for ADHD are psychostimulants, antidepressants, and nonstimulant drugs. These treatments affect the neurotransmitters that send signals to brain cells. are the medications of choice in treating ADHD. The two types that are most commonly used are and methylphenidate. Mixed amphetamine salts are marketed under the brand name Adderall®. is sold under the brand names Ritalin®, Concerta®, Metadate® and others. Immediate release, sustained released and extended release forms of amphetamine and methylphenidate are available. The dosage and frequency of these medications may have to be adjusted to maximize their effectiveness. Extended-release formulations are recommended over immediate-release formulations.In certain cases, if psychostimulants are not effective or the person has a co-existing psychological disorder that may be affected by stimulant treatment, other medications might be prescribed. Drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, bupuprion (Wellbutrin®) and venlafaxine (Effexor®) increase norepinephrine levels in the brain and have a positive effect on the symptoms of ADHD. These drugs are not approved by the FDA for this indication, although they are used off-label. These medications may be required in cases where a patient does not respond to stimulants or has an adverse reaction to them. They may also be used for people with co-existing psychiatric conditions. Atomoxetine (®) was the first nonstimulant drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat ADHD in adults. Guanfacine (®, ®) is another example of a nonstimulant medication. . Various approaches may be used to treat adults with inattention problems. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps patients identify problem behaviors and create and implement strategies to self-regulate (control your behavior, emotions and thoughts), change behavior and achieve goals. With CBT, patients identify automatic or irrational thoughts that may result in negative behavior and replace them with positive thoughts and behaviors. Acceptance Commitment Therapy is another form of therapy designed especially to empower individuals to pursue personal values and engage in behavior consistent with their values as opposed to trying to change the individual. Other programs have been developed to enhance self-management, but these are not yet widely available. Group therapy may be effective for adults with ADHD, especially for women. Coaching is a relatively new approach that has become more popular over the past few years. Coaches help people with ADHD handle the challenges of daily life by providing feedback, recommendations and encouragement, and directing the individual to attend to their own solutions to problems. They also offer practical solutions to address certain issues--such as time management and organization--and help their clients achieve goals.

Sometimes symptoms of other conditions can be masked by the symptoms of ADHD. It’s estimated that of people with ADHD have a comorbid, or coexisting, condition. Anxiety is one condition that is often seen in people with ADHD. About of adults and up to of children with ADHD also have an anxiety disorder. Keep reading to learn more about the connection between these two conditions. If you have ADHD, it may be difficult to recognize the symptoms of anxiety. ADHD is an ongoing condition that often starts in childhood and can continue into adulthood. It can affect your ability to concentrate, and may result in behavioral problems, such as: An anxiety disorder is more than just feeling occasionally anxious. It’s a mental illness that is serious and long lasting. It can make you feel distressed, uneasy, and excessively frightened in benign, or regular, situations. If you have an anxiety disorder, your symptoms may be so severe that they affect your ability to work, study, enjoy relationships, or otherwise go about your daily activities. The symptoms of ADHD are slightly different from those of anxiety. ADHD symptoms primarily involve issues with focus and concentration. Anxiety symptoms, on the other hand, involve issues with nervousness and fear. difficulty listening to and following instructions Even though each condition has unique symptoms, sometimes the two conditions mirror each other. That can make it difficult to tell whether you have ADHD, anxiety, or both. Though a professional evaluation is necessary, family members may be able to tell the difference between ADHD and anxiety. The key is to watch how your symptoms present over time. If you have anxiety, you may be unable to concentrate in situations that cause you to feel anxious. On the other hand, if you have ADHD, you’ll find it difficult to concentrate most of the time, in any type of situation. If you have both ADHD and anxiety, the symptoms of both conditions may seem more extreme. For example, anxiety can make it even more difficult for someone with ADHD to pay attention and follow through on tasks. It’s not clear why there’s a connection between ADHD and anxiety, and doctors don’t fully understand what causes either condition. Genetics may be responsible for both conditions, and may also cause comorbidity. have also observed several other conditions that are commonly seen alongside ADHD, including: Possible causes for ADHD include genetics, environmental toxins, or premature birth. It’s possible that these causes could also contribute to anxiety. Treating ADHD and anxiety simultaneously may be challenging because some medications for ADHD can exacerbate anxiety symptoms. Both conditions need to be treated, though. Your doctor may choose to focus first on the condition that’s the most disruptive to your quality of life. They may also provide suggestions for ways to manage the other condition. The treatments your doctor may recommend for both ADHD and anxiety include: It’s important to be truthful and open with your doctor about your symptoms. This is especially true if you suspect you’re experiencing two conditions simultaneously. Your doctor will want to know if a treatment is making one or both of your conditions worse. That will help them tailor your treatment. If you have ADHD, it’s important to tell your doctor about all of your symptoms, even if you think they’re unrelated. It’s possible you could have an additional condition, such as anxiety. You should also let your doctor know about any new symptoms, as you could develop anxiety or another condition over time. Once your doctor has diagnosed you with both ADHD and anxiety, you’ll be able to begin treatment for both conditions. An anxiety disorder is a mental condition that needs to be treated by a mental health professional. There are things you can do, though, to try to reduce your symptoms. In some people, anxiety may be triggered by specific events, like speaking in public or calling someone on the phone. Once you’ve identified your triggers, work with your doctor to help come up with ways to manage your anxiety in these situations. For example, preparing notes and practicing a presentation may help you feel less anxious when speaking in front of others. Being tired may trigger anxiety or increase your risk for feeling anxious. Try to sleep for seven to eight hours every night. If you’re having trouble falling asleep, try meditating or taking a warm bath before bed to help quiet your mind. Also plan to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day. Setting a sleep schedule can be an effective way to train your body to sleep when it’s time for bed. If you continue to have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, talk to your doctor. If you’re taking medication for your anxiety or ADHD, it could be interfering with your sleep. You may also need to temporarily take a sleep aid. Don’t start taking any additional medication without first discussing it with your doctor. Some medications may make your anxiety or ADHD symptoms worse. If you have ADHD, you may find it hard to complete tasks. This can make anxiety worse in some people. To avoid this, create a schedule and stick to it. Expect each activity to take longer than you think. You don’t want to set unrealistic goals for yourself, as this can increase anxiety. Writing in a journal can help clear your mind. There’s no wrong way to keep a journal. It’s only meant for you, so you should feel comfortable writing down anything that’s on your mind. Writing in a journal may also help you pinpoint things you want to discuss with your doctor or therapist. Exercise may help reduce anxiety. In a review of studies, that exercise reduced anxiety in numerous different studies. More research is needed to fully understand how exercise affects anxiety. Aim for 30 minutes of exercise a day. If you’re new to exercise, start small and work your way up to longer, more intense workouts. Treatment for anxiety can take time, and you may need to try several treatments before finding one that works for you. Be patient with your doctor and, most importantly, with yourself.

a2473669-a99d-4475-93e4-0a0a91b02253,"How Non-Stimulant ADHD Medications Make Children Act Today, there are several different kinds of ADHD medications on the market, each of them having their own set of positive and negative effects. Stimulants are the most commonly prescribed medications for children with ADHD because they quickly and drastically improve the symptoms of ADHD in the majority of patients. In some cases, non-stimulant drugs are prescribed to children, and they also improve the symptoms of ADHD, but the improvements are not as fast and drastic. How ADHD medications make children act has a big impact on what type of medication they will be prescribed. Some children have negative side effects from stimulant medications, so non-stimulant medications often work better for them. Too much of either type of medication can have very negative effects, so proper dosage is also important. As previously stated, stimulant medications, such as Ritalin and Concerta, are the most commonly prescribed medications for the treatment of ADHD in children. This is because they work for such a large percentage of children. Almost immediately after taking a stimulant medication, the child will be more alert and more able to focus. Their behavior also dramatically improves shortly after taking the medication. They are able to get more accomplished and they are also much more calm and organized. The medication also allows them to build relationships with their peers because they are more able to get along with others. Although stimulant medications work well for some children, there are also some negative effects of them. While not all children will experience negative effects, there are still some worth mentioning. The more common, negative effects of stimulant medications are a decrease in appetite, headaches, nausea, insomnia, and irritabilty. In some cases, the dosage is too high for the child, which can cause him or her to be aggressive and moody. How Non-Stimulant ADHD Medications Make Children Act Non-stimulant medications, such as Straterra and Intuniv, are the next most commonly prescribed medications for children with ADHD. These types of medications are not fast acting, which means that it may take a while to see their effects. Since they act more slowly, they also do not wear off abruptly like stimulant medications do. Both Strattera and Intuniv have shown to increase attention span and reduce hyperactivity in children with ADHD. They are both also known for controlling impulsivity in children with the disorder. Unlike stimulants, these medications do not typically cause insomnia or agitation. The most common negative effects of Straterra include nausea, dizziness, fatique, and mood swings. In rare cases, this drug can cause children to have thoughts of suicide, so it is important to watch out for that. Children who take Intuniv generally do not have thoughts of suicide, but it may cause nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and irritability. Finding the right ADHD medication for children often involves a lot of trial and error. Some children will have effects from some medications, while other children will not. If you’re wondering how does ADHD medication make kids act, it varies from one child to another; so paying attention to the behaviors exhibited while on medication is extremely important.

Jensen, Keith C. Conners, Robert Findling, Elliot Wineburg, Isabel Carotenuto, Thomas R. Einarson, Michael Iskedjian Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood neurobehavioral disorder characterized by inattention hyperactivity and impulsivity. Prevalence estimates in elementary school children generally range from 3% to 8%. ADHD is frequently treated with psychostimulant medications which have been shown to improve both cognitive and behavioral outcomes for most children. Objective: The goal of this study was to estimate the total expected costs for the treatment and management of school-age children with ADHD using 6 commonly prescribed pharmacotherapies: methylphenidate immediate-release/extended-release (MPH IR/ER) methylphenidate immediate-release (MPH IR) Metadate® CD (branded MPH IR/ER) Concerta™ (branded MPH ER) Ritalin® (branded MPH IR) and Adderall® (a combination of dextroamphetamine and amphetamine salts). Methods: A literature review and clinical assessment using a 27-question survey instrument were used to capture information on the clinical characteristics of ADHD including common treatment regimens clinical management of patients pathways of care and components of care. A meta-analysis provided response rates for 3 commonly used pharmacotherapies: Metadate CD MPH IR and Adderall. Information from the clinical assessment and the meta-analysis were used to populate a decision-analytic model to compute total expected cost for each comparator. Results: The average total annual expected cost per patient was $1487 for Metadate CD $1631 for Concerta $1792 for MPH IR/ER $1845 for MPH IR $2080 for Ritalin and $2232 for Adderall. Conclusions: Metadate CD had the lowest total expected cost and Adderall had the highest total expected cost among the ADHD pharmacotherapies evaluated. The differences were attributable to differences in drug-acquisition costs and the need for in-school dosing of twice-daily and thrice-daily medications.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition in which a person has trouble paying attention and focusing on tasks, tends to act without thinking, and has trouble sitting still. It may begin in early childhood and can continue into adulthood. Without treatment, ADHD can cause problems at home, at school, at work, and with relationships. In the past, ADHD was called attention deficit disorder (ADD). The exact cause is not clear, but ADHD tends to run in families. People with ADHD are easily distracted. They have a hard time focusing on any one task. This is called hyperactivity. Children with ADHD may squirm, fidget, or run around at the wrong times. Teens and adults often feel restless and fidgety. They aren't able to enjoy reading or other quiet activities. People with ADHD may talk too loud, laugh too loud, or become angrier than the situation calls for. Children may not be able to wait for their turn or to share. This makes it hard for them to play with other children. Teens and adults may make quick decisions that have a long-term impact on their lives. They may spend too much money or change jobs often. ADHD is often diagnosed when a child is between 6 and 12 years old. Teachers may notice symptoms in children who are in this age group. First, the child will have tests to make sure that he or she doesn't have other problems such as , , or anxiety disorder. The doctor will use guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association to diagnose ADHD. The doctor may also look at written reports about the child's behavior. Parents, teachers, and others who have regular contact with the child prepare these reports. There is no cure for ADHD, but treatment may help control the symptoms. Treatment may include medicines and behavior therapy. Parents and other adults need to closely watch children after they begin to take medicines for ADHD. The medicines may cause side effects such as loss of appetite, headaches or stomachaches, tics or twitches, and problems sleeping. Side effects usually get better after a few weeks. If they don't, the doctor can lower the dose. Therapy focuses on making changes in the environment to improve the child's behavior. Often, counseling and extra support at home and at school help children succeed at school and feel better about themselves. Many adults don't realize that they have ADHD until their children are diagnosed. Then they begin to notice their own symptoms. Adults with ADHD may find it hard to focus, organize, and finish tasks. They often forget things. But they also often are very creative and curious. They love to ask questions and keep learning. Some adults with ADHD learn to manage their lives and find careers that let them use those strengths. Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve your health. Decision Points focus on key medical care decisions that are important to many health problems. Actionsets are designed to help people take an active role in managing a health condition. Growth and Development: Helping Your Child Build Self-Esteem The exact cause of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) isn't known. But it may run in families. Ongoing research is focused on finding the that cause a person to be likely to get ADHD. A mother's use of cigarettes, alcohol, or other drugs during pregnancy may increase the risk for ADHD. Also, exposure to lead may cause symptoms linked with ADHD. Although many parents believe that foods with sugar and food additives make their children more hyperactive, these foods haven't been shown to cause ADHD. People with ADHD are easily distracted. They have a hard time focusing on any one task. Children with ADHD may squirm, fidget, or run around at the wrong times. Teens and adults often feel restless and fidgety. They aren't able to enjoy reading or other quiet activities. People with ADHD may talk too loud, laugh too loud, or become angrier than the situation calls for. Children may not be able to wait for their turn or to share. This makes it hard for them to play with other children. Teens and adults may make quick decisions that have a long-term impact on their lives. They may spend too much money or change jobs often. These symptoms affect all people who have ADHD. But typical behavior varies by age. In preschool-age children, symptoms are often the same as normal behavior for young children. In children between the ages of 6 and 12, signs of ADHD are more obvious than in other age groups. In teens between the ages of 13 and 18, problems that began in earlier years may continue or get worse. may not be as noticeable as in other age groups. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be hard to identify in a young child. It can be hard to tell the difference between normal behavior and ADHD symptoms in young children. But after a child starts school, ADHD becomes more noticeable. ADHD is most often diagnosed in children ages 6 to 12. During this time, ADHD can disrupt many aspects of a child's life. Learning, adjusting to change, sleeping, and getting along with others are all potential problem areas. About 60 to 85 out of 100 children with ADHD still have symptoms during the teen years. These children may be less mature than their peers. They may lag behind in reaching typical for the age group. Teens with ADHD may also have more problems when they are driving cars. They get more speeding tickets and have serious car accidents more often. They should be watched closely by a licensed adult when they are learning to drive. may have trouble focusing, organizing, and finishing tasks. But they are often able to adjust to the workplace better than they did in the classroom as children. People with ADHD often have one or more other disorders. These include , , , , and . Raising a child who has ADHD can be a challenge. Parents must consistently watch their child. They must respond to problem behavior in the right way. If other issues are causing stress within a family (such as divorce, violence, or drug or alcohol use), it may be even harder to deal with a child who has ADHD. Treatment can help control symptoms. It can allow a child to grow and develop normally. The greatest risk factor for ADHD is having an inherited tendency for the condition. Environmental factors, such as certain parenting methods, may influence how symptoms of ADHD are expressed. But they don't cause ADHD. Your child is showing signs of ADHD that are causing problems at home or school. These signs include , , and/or . Parents and teachers often notice this behavior during the child's first few years in school. Your child shows signs of other mental health disorders, such as or , that last more than a few weeks or seem to be getting worse. Your child is having academic or behavioral problems at school. Ask your doctor about his or her training and experience related to ADHD. The doctor must be able to identify and distinguish behaviors that can be subtle and complicated. Also, make sure that your doctor has enough time to evaluate you or your child. Accurate diagnosis and successful treatment of ADHD takes repeated office visits and observations. Your doctor should also be able to coordinate between other health professionals, family members, teachers, and caregivers. Health professionals who can diagnose and treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with medicine include: (may specialize in developmental problems). (may specialize in adults or children and adolescents). (may specialize in child or adult nervous systems). who specialize in psychiatry or pediatrics. Health professionals who do not prescribe medicines but can provide behavior therapy or family counseling include: . Psychologists also frequently diagnose ADHD. A doctor relies on a combination of exams, tests, and other information to diagnose attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The doctor will look at guidelines created by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The diagnosis will be based on: Medical history. The doctor will ask about the child's social, emotional, educational, and behavioral history. . These are used by parents and teachers to evaluate the child's symptoms. Before meeting with your doctor, think about at what age your child's symptoms began. You and other caregivers should record when the behavior occurs and how long it lasts. An important part of evaluation for ADHD is thinking about the kinds of problems caused by the behaviors. How much do they affect schooling and social behavior? Your child may have to find out if behavior problems are caused by other conditions with similar symptoms. For example, children with ADHD may have a hard time learning to read, write, or do math problems. Testing for these will help teachers form the best plan for a child with these problems. If you are concerned about how your child's temperament, learning skills, and behavior are developing, talk with your doctor during your next visit. Treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) relies on a combination of medicines and behavior therapy. Treatment with medicine depends on the age of your child. The first step is an accurate diagnosis of ADHD and an understanding of your child's strengths and weaknesses. Learning about ADHD will help you and your child's siblings better understand how to help your child. Your child's doctor may recommend that your child take a stimulant medicine. These medicines include amphetamine (for example, Adderall or Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (for example, Concerta, Metadate CD, or Ritalin). Stimulants improve symptoms in about 70 out of 100 children who have ADHD. If stimulant medicines have bothersome side effects or aren't effective, your child's doctor might recommend a nonstimulant medicine such as atomoxetine (Strattera), clonidine (Kapvay), or guanfacine (Intuniv). These medicines may be used alone or in combination with stimulant medicines. Through , parents learn strategies, such as positive reinforcement, to improve a child's behaviors. Children learn skills for problem solving, communication, and self-advocacy. Behavior therapy is more helpful when used with medicine than when used by itself. Some children with ADHD also have other conditions, such as or . Behavior therapy can help treat some of these conditions. Counseling may help children and adults who have ADHD recognize problem behaviors and learn ways to deal with them. For both parents and children, counseling can be a place to air frustrations and deal with stress. To learn more, see . There are many things you can do to help your child at home and at school. To learn more, see . Many adults don't realize that they have ADHD until their children are diagnosed. Then they begin to recognize their own symptoms. Some adults with ADHD learn to manage their lives and find careers in which they can use their intellectual curiosity and creativity to their advantage. But many adults have difficulties at home and work. Like children with ADHD, adults may benefit from medicine combined with psychological support.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition in which a person has trouble paying attention and focusing on tasks, tends to act without thinking, and has trouble sitting still. It may begin in early childhood and can continue into adulthood. Without treatment, ADHD can cause problems at home, at school, at work, and with relationships. In the past, ADHD was called attention deficit disorder (ADD). The exact cause is not clear, but ADHD tends to run in families. People with ADHD are easily distracted. They have a hard time focusing on any one task. This is called hyperactivity. Children with ADHD may squirm, fidget, or run around at the wrong times. Teens and adults often feel restless and fidgety. They aren't able to enjoy reading or other quiet activities. People with ADHD may talk too loud, laugh too loud, or become angrier than the situation calls for. Children may not be able to wait for their turn or to share. This makes it hard for them to play with other children. Teens and adults may make quick decisions that have a long-term impact on their lives. They may spend too much money or change jobs often. ADHD is often diagnosed when a child is between 6 and 12 years old. Teachers may notice symptoms in children who are in this age group. First, the child will have tests to make sure that he or she doesn't have other problems such as , , or anxiety disorder. The doctor will use guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association to diagnose ADHD. The doctor may also look at written reports about the child's behavior. Parents, teachers, and others who have regular contact with the child prepare these reports. There is no cure for ADHD, but treatment may help control the symptoms. Treatment may include medicines and behavior therapy. Parents and other adults need to closely watch children after they begin to take medicines for ADHD. The medicines may cause side effects such as loss of appetite, headaches or stomachaches, tics or twitches, and problems sleeping. Side effects usually get better after a few weeks. If they don't, the doctor can lower the dose. Therapy focuses on making changes in the environment to improve the child's behavior. Often, counseling and extra support at home and at school help children succeed at school and feel better about themselves. Many adults don't realize that they have ADHD until their children are diagnosed. Then they begin to notice their own symptoms. Adults with ADHD may find it hard to focus, organize, and finish tasks. They often forget things. But they also often are very creative and curious. They love to ask questions and keep learning. Some adults with ADHD learn to manage their lives and find careers that let them use those strengths. Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve your health. Decision Points focus on key medical care decisions that are important to many health problems. Actionsets are designed to help people take an active role in managing a health condition. Growth and Development: Helping Your Child Build Self-Esteem The exact cause of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) isn't known. But it may run in families. Ongoing research is focused on finding the that cause a person to be likely to get ADHD. A mother's use of cigarettes, alcohol, or other drugs during pregnancy may increase the risk for ADHD. Also, exposure to lead may cause symptoms linked with ADHD. Although many parents believe that foods with sugar and food additives make their children more hyperactive, these foods haven't been shown to cause ADHD. People with ADHD are easily distracted. They have a hard time focusing on any one task. Children with ADHD may squirm, fidget, or run around at the wrong times. Teens and adults often feel restless and fidgety. They aren't able to enjoy reading or other quiet activities. People with ADHD may talk too loud, laugh too loud, or become angrier than the situation calls for. Children may not be able to wait for their turn or to share. This makes it hard for them to play with other children. Teens and adults may make quick decisions that have a long-term impact on their lives. They may spend too much money or change jobs often. These symptoms affect all people who have ADHD. But typical behavior varies by age. In preschool-age children, symptoms are often the same as normal behavior for young children. In children between the ages of 6 and 12, signs of ADHD are more obvious than in other age groups. In teens between the ages of 13 and 18, problems that began in earlier years may continue or get worse. may not be as noticeable as in other age groups. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be hard to identify in a young child. It can be hard to tell the difference between normal behavior and ADHD symptoms in young children. But after a child starts school, ADHD becomes more noticeable. ADHD is most often diagnosed in children ages 6 to 12. During this time, ADHD can disrupt many aspects of a child's life. Learning, adjusting to change, sleeping, and getting along with others are all potential problem areas. About 60 to 85 out of 100 children with ADHD still have symptoms during the teen years. These children may be less mature than their peers. They may lag behind in reaching typical for the age group. Teens with ADHD may also have more problems when they are driving cars. They get more speeding tickets and have serious car accidents more often. They should be watched closely by a licensed adult when they are learning to drive. may have trouble focusing, organizing, and finishing tasks. But they are often able to adjust to the workplace better than they did in the classroom as children. People with ADHD often have one or more other disorders. These include , , , , and . Raising a child who has ADHD can be a challenge. Parents must consistently watch their child. They must respond to problem behavior in the right way. If other issues are causing stress within a family (such as divorce, violence, or drug or alcohol use), it may be even harder to deal with a child who has ADHD. Treatment can help control symptoms. It can allow a child to grow and develop normally. The greatest risk factor for ADHD is having an inherited tendency for the condition. Environmental factors, such as certain parenting methods, may influence how symptoms of ADHD are expressed. But they don't cause ADHD. Your child is showing signs of ADHD that are causing problems at home or school. These signs include , , and/or . Parents and teachers often notice this behavior during the child's first few years in school. Your child shows signs of other mental health disorders, such as or , that last more than a few weeks or seem to be getting worse. Your child is having academic or behavioral problems at school. Ask your doctor about his or her training and experience related to ADHD. The doctor must be able to identify and distinguish behaviors that can be subtle and complicated. Also, make sure that your doctor has enough time to evaluate you or your child. Accurate diagnosis and successful treatment of ADHD takes repeated office visits and observations. Your doctor should also be able to coordinate between other health professionals, family members, teachers, and caregivers. Health professionals who can diagnose and treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with medicine include: (may specialize in developmental problems). (may specialize in adults or children and adolescents). (may specialize in child or adult nervous systems). who specialize in psychiatry or pediatrics. Health professionals who do not prescribe medicines but can provide behavior therapy or family counseling include: . Psychologists also frequently diagnose ADHD. A doctor relies on a combination of exams, tests, and other information to diagnose attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The doctor will look at guidelines created by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The diagnosis will be based on: Medical history. The doctor will ask about the child's social, emotional, educational, and behavioral history. . These are used by parents and teachers to evaluate the child's symptoms. Before meeting with your doctor, think about at what age your child's symptoms began. You and other caregivers should record when the behavior occurs and how long it lasts. An important part of evaluation for ADHD is thinking about the kinds of problems caused by the behaviors. How much do they affect schooling and social behavior? Your child may have to find out if behavior problems are caused by other conditions with similar symptoms. For example, children with ADHD may have a hard time learning to read, write, or do math problems. Testing for these will help teachers form the best plan for a child with these problems. If you are concerned about how your child's temperament, learning skills, and behavior are developing, talk with your doctor during your next visit. Treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) relies on a combination of medicines and behavior therapy. Treatment with medicine depends on the age of your child. The first step is an accurate diagnosis of ADHD and an understanding of your child's strengths and weaknesses. Learning about ADHD will help you and your child's siblings better understand how to help your child. Your child's doctor may recommend that your child take a stimulant medicine. These medicines include amphetamine (for example, Adderall or Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (for example, Concerta, Metadate CD, or Ritalin). Stimulants improve symptoms in about 70 out of 100 children who have ADHD. If stimulant medicines have bothersome side effects or aren't effective, your child's doctor might recommend a nonstimulant medicine such as atomoxetine (Strattera), clonidine (Kapvay), or guanfacine (Intuniv). These medicines may be used alone or in combination with stimulant medicines. Through , parents learn strategies, such as positive reinforcement, to improve a child's behaviors. Children learn skills for problem solving, communication, and self-advocacy. Behavior therapy is more helpful when used with medicine than when used by itself. Some children with ADHD also have other conditions, such as or . Behavior therapy can help treat some of these conditions. Counseling may help children and adults who have ADHD recognize problem behaviors and learn ways to deal with them. For both parents and children, counseling can be a place to air frustrations and deal with stress. To learn more, see . There are many things you can do to help your child at home and at school.

But many adults have difficulties at home and work. Like children with ADHD, adults may benefit from medicine combined with psychological support. This support includes education about the disorder, support groups and/or counseling, and skills training. Skills training may include: in adults include: Stimulant medicines.

34511b03-b262-4159-b907-6210e63320c8,"I have depression because I feel it is genetic and then I have a life situation that causes me chronic stress. Chronic stress leads me to depression. I will be mentally ill bipolar, mainly depressive side for the rest of my life. I don't like that fact yet it is just the way it is. Medication helps me immensely and I will be on it the rest of my life. I am lucky to have found a great psychiatrist. As for natural remedies for depression, medical marijuana has helped me immensely in the past. It helps me with stress, therefore depression. /m m jdoctor com/benefits-of-medical-marijuana-according-experts/ So this is my story. I hope you find peace and feel better. The most common medications used to treat ADHD include stimulants. Rarely, stimulants are used for treatment resistant depression. There are also off-label drugs such as Wellbutrin that are used off-label to treat ADHD and are proven effective for depression. In some cases, depression that occurs with ADHD may be caused by poor treatment for the symptoms of ADHD. Also, some doctors will prescribe two separate drugs (one for ADHD and one for depression). Can you take medication for both ADHD and depression? Yes; a doctor can prescribe medication for both ADHD and depression. In some cases, two medications will be prescribed (one medication for ADHD and another for depression). Some drugs such as Wellbutrin are prescribed to treat depression and work for ADHD as well. The most common way of treating depression is a combination of both medications and therapy. Severe depression can be treated with Electroshock Therapy but it's rarely used. Depression can be treated with Zoloft or generic Zoloft medications. Both medications work the same, and the generic drug is cheaper. If you can, get the doctor to write a prescription that includes the generic form of the drug. You will get the same relief at a fraction of the cost. No, you should not take these 2 medications together because they both are in the same class of drug and treat the same things. These drugs are used to treat depression and fibromyalgia. Answer: Strattera is used for the main purpose of treating ADHD; it is not a controlled substance or a stimulant. It may have been shown to treat depression for some people although this is controversial due to the new black box warning for strattera claiming it causes suicidal thoughts in children. my psychiatrist prescribed this to me to treat both adhd and depression. however the only outcome from taking 40mg of this crap for 6 weeks was horrible heartburn. i highly recomment NOT taking this medication for the treatment of depression especially if you are under 18, but i am not a doctor and ultimately the decision is yours, i hope this helps**** No, they are differing drugs, but both have been used to treat ADHD. Does Strattera and Adderall have the same properties to treat ADHD.? They are different Pharmacueticals but are both used for ADHD. Their method of Action will be slightly Different in creating the Effect It is used to treat both clinical depression and nerve pain. These two medications are used to treat ADHD; they both belong to a category of drugs known as psychostimulants that increase dopamine release in the brain. They should only be used together if your doctor prescribes them to you to be taken together. What is the connection between ADHD and depressive Disorder? Both ADHD and depression can be caused by a hormonal imbalance (eg. Seratonin). It is also more likely that people will get depressive disorder if they already have a mental illness such as ADHD, schizophrenia, or bipolar. There are several drugs on the market today that treat both anxiety and depression. Your doctor will prescribe which one best fits your level of anxiety and depression. Can you take medication for ADHD and depression together? yes. everyday i take both my adderall and Prozac. I'm not sure about other adhd meds. but i do know adderall is safe to take with Prozac. Paroxetine is the generic of Paxil, it treats both depression and OCD What are the most popular prescription medications used to treat bi polar? The most popular prescription medications to treat bi polar are lithium and abilify. Both help lower mood swing flare ups. What drugs for depression and anxiety are safe to take for a person who has Porphyria? There are many medications that are safe to take for both anxiety and depression, in fact there are medicines traditional used for depression that are now prescribed purely for anxiety. These anti-depressants are generally SNRIs or SSRIs. For example, Celexa has been used to treat both. Always check with your doctor when considering taking two medication at the same time, particularly if you are on a MAOI. Yes. Both can be used for the treatment of adhd. Some doctors prefer to combine both medications as one causes hunger (imipramine) and the other (adderall) is an appetite suppressant. Is Bupropion XL and adderall okay to take together? Amphetamine (addreall) is not contraindicated with Bupriopion (Wellbutrin). For example, some psychiatrists may treat ADHD with Adderall and concurrent depression with Bupropion. Occasionally, Adderall or other stimulants may be used by psychiatrists to treat refractory depression (depression that doesn't respond well to first-line treatments). Adderall for depression is an off-label use. Anyways, Adderall and Bupropion XL are not contraindicated by each other. However, this warning applies: ""Adderall + Bupropion XL: Caution Advised. Combo may incease risk of seizures (additive effects)."" If you have any pesonal or family history of seizures, be sure to discuss this with your prescribing physician. If there are separate physicians prescribing the Adderall and Bupropion, make sure they are both aware you are on both medications. Follow the advice of your physicians and pharmacists Yes Ritalin and Prozac (fluoxetine) work in very different ways and are able to be taken together, I take both of them to help with both ADHD and depression and there are no side effects from taking them both simultaniously. Two of the most common medications used to treat secretions are both antimuscarinic - scopolamine and glycopyrrolate. Streptomycin (given as a shot in a muscle) and gentamicin (given as either a shot in a muscle or through a needle in the vein) are both used to treat tularemia. Dual Depression is the diagnosis made when a person is diagnosed with dysthymia (which is a less severe, but more consistent form of depression) along with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (which includes periods of severe depression). Sometimes in an attempt to treat dual depression, two different anti-depressant types may be prescribed at the same time in an attempt to treat both disorders. There are lots of sites with information about ADHD symptoms. The WebMD and Healthline sites are both great sites with accurate information about ADHD in both children and adults. There are many medications that can be used to treat PCOS. Metformin and birth control pills are both common with this condition. Should you use clotrimazole cream or miconazole nitrate to treat fugal infection knowing that both have the same price? Both medications are used similarly to treat the same infections. Miconazle may also be used to treat angular cheilitis, Different forms of the medications exist for different treatments, such as orally, topically, or vaginally. Be sure to read the package instructions or ask a doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about any use. No; Adderall contains amphetamine and Concerta contains methylphenidate. Both drugs are used to treat ADHD or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. When did organ music become associated with baseball? Ano ang kultura at tradisyon ng bansang England o inglaterra?

Abstract Abstract Symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are present in as many as 9 percent of school-age children. ADHD-specific questionnaires can help determine whether children meet diagnostic criteria for the disorder. The recommended evaluation also includes documenting the type and severity of ADHD symptoms, verifying the presence of normal vision and hearing, screening for comorbid psychologic conditions, reviewing the child's developmental history and school performance, and applying objective measures of cognitive function. The stimulants methylphenidate and dextroamphet-amine remain the pharmacologic agents of first choice for the management of ADHD. These agents are equally effective in improving the core symptoms of the disorder, but individual children may respond better to one stimulant medication than to another. Achievement of maximal benefit may require titration of the initial dosage and dosing before breakfast, before lunch and in the afternoon. The family physician should tailor the treatment plan to meet the unique needs of the child and family. Psychosocial, behavioral and educational strategies that enhance specific behaviors may improve educational and social functioning in the child with ADHD. Up to 19 percent of school-age children have behavioral problems, with up to one half of them displaying attention or hyperactivity problems.  Frequently, family physicians are asked to evaluate and treat a child who does poorly in school, has disruptive relationships with peers or defies parental discipline. Although attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) could account for such symptoms, physicians should remember that symptoms consistent with ADHD can be due to other disorders . This article suggests a systematic approach to implementing key elements of the practice guidelines formulated by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) for the evaluation and treatment of children with presumed ADHD. Both guidelines recommend using ADHD-specific rating scales to obtain parent and teacher ratings of core symptoms, basing the diagnosis on the criteria for ADHD as given in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV),  and screening for comorbid disorders. The AACAP proposes augmenting the standard history and physical examination with a review of the child's developmental and family history, confirmation of normal hearing and vision in the child, and an assessment of family stressors and coping style . A detailed evaluation can be a challenge for the family physician who first learns of a child's difficulties during a routine office visit when parents are intent on obtaining stimulant medication for a child who has already been “diagnosed” with ADHD by themselves or teachers. This initial office visit may only allow time to listen to the parents' concerns, explain the need for a thorough evaluation and arrange for further data collection. A systematic approach to diagnosis can help the physician avoid the tempting (and seemingly time-efficient) urge to forego a comprehensive evaluation, write a prescription and “monitor progress” at a subsequent visit. Parents and teachers should understand that a careful and complete evaluation will span several office visits and may require special testing or consultation. Parents and teachers can better accept the postponement of immediate treatment if the physician communicates an understanding of the behaviors that concern them, indicates a shared commitment to doing what is best for the child and explains the elements of a stepwise, comprehensive approach to the proper diagnosis of the child's problem behaviors. Medication effects (e.g., antihistamine decongestants, beta agonists, anticonvulsants) Mental retardation (e.g., fetal alcohol syndrome, fragile X syndrome, phenylketonuria) Improper learning environment (e.g., unsafe, disruptive)* Mismatch of school curriculum with child's ability (e.g., gifted, learning-disabled) Poor parenting (e.g., inappropriate, inconsistent, punitive)* Medication effects (e.g., antihistamine decongestants, beta agonists, anticonvulsants) Mental retardation (e.g., fetal alcohol syndrome, fragile X syndrome, phenylketonuria) Improper learning environment (e.g., unsafe, disruptive)* Mismatch of school curriculum with child's ability (e.g., gifted, learning-disabled) Poor parenting (e.g., inappropriate, inconsistent, punitive)* Abstract A number of questions need to answered before the diagnosis of ADHD can be established. Do the child's symptoms fulfill DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of ADHD? Despite broad endorsement for using ADHD-specific behavior rating scales and DSM-IV criteria to diagnose and monitor ADHD, most primary care physicians use neither. Yet proper diagnosis of ADHD requires a clear understanding of the type and severity of academic difficulties and the core ADHD behaviors that occur at home and in school. The DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of ADHD are given in . Examples of practical ADHD-specific rating scales that elicit DSM-IV criteria for inattention and hyperactivity are provided in ; norms for patient age and gender, and scoring information for physicians are provided in . Children with scores above the 93rd percentile generally meet the DMS-IV criteria for the diagnosis of ADHD. Administration of the scales should be repeated periodically as part of an overall assessment of the child's response to treatment. It is important to verify that the child's vision and hearing are normal. Visual and auditory problems can contribute to poor school performance and inattention. Does the child's history suggest the presence of a comorbid psychiatric disorder? Some of the behaviors in ADHD can be manifestations of, or coexist with, other psychiatric disorders. As many as one third of children with ADHD also have oppositional defiant disorder, one fourth to one half have conduct disorder, one fifth have depression and one fourth have anxiety. Preschool-age children and adolescents who have not been previously diagnosed with ADHD are more likely to have comorbid psychiatric conditions. The family physician can screen for comorbid psychiatric disorders using questions such as those given in . Positive responses should prompt more formal evaluation and consideration of the DSM-IV criteria for such disorders. Although ADHD behaviors alone may result in poor school performance, it is important to remember that 20 to 30 percent of children with ADHD also have learning disabilities. Cognitive testing may be beneficial in the child whose reading or language achievement is below grade level. This testing can be used not only to assess learning disabilities but also to identify academic strengths and suggest educational interventions to improve school performance. Some physicians choose to determine the need for formal cognitive testing after observing the impact of stimulant medication on a child's ADHD symptoms and school performance. Combined AAP and AACAP Practice Guidelines for the Evaluation of ADHD In a child six to 12 years of age who presents with inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, academic underachievement or behavior problems, the primary care physician should initiate an evaluation for ADHD. The initial assessment should include the following: Standard history and physical examination, with the AACAP recommending a review of the child's developmental history, confirmation of normal hearing and vision, and a review of the family history for ADHD, learning difficulties or psychiatric illness Family assessment, with the AACAP recommending assessment of family stressors and family coping style The diagnosis of ADHD requires that a child meet diagnostic criteria for the disorder (see ). The assessment of ADHD requires evidence directly obtained from parents or care-givers regarding the core symptoms of ADHD in various settings, child's age at onset of the symptoms, duration of symptoms and degree of functional impairment. Use of (ADHD-specific) scales is a clinical option when evaluating a child for ADHD. Use of broad-band scales is not recommended in the diagnosis of ADHD. The assessment of ADHD requires evidence obtained directly from the classroom teacher (or other school professional) regarding the core symptoms of ADHD, duration of symptoms, degree of functional impairment and coexisting conditions in the child. A physician should review any reports from a school-based multidisciplinary evaluation, including assessments from the child's teacher or other school-based professional. Use of (ADHD-specific) scales is a clinical option when evaluating a child for ADHD. Use of broad-band scales is not recommended in the diagnosis of ADHD. The evaluation of a child with ADHD should include an assessment for coexisting conditions (i.e., learning and language disabilities, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety and depression). Other diagnostic tests are not routinely indicated to establish the diagnosis of ADHD.

Six (or more) of the following symptoms of inattention have persisted for at least six months to a degree that is maladaptive and inconsistent with developmental level: Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, work or other activities Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores or duties in the work-place (not due to oppositional behavior or failure to understand instructions) Often has difficulties organizing tasks and activities Often avoids, dislikes or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort (such as schoolwork or homework) Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., toys, school assignments, pencils, books or tools) Six (or more) of the following symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity have persisted for at least six months to a degree that is maladaptive and inconsistent with developmental level: Often fidgets with hands or feet, or squirms in seat Often leaves seat in classroom or in other situations in which remaining seated is expected Often runs about or climbs excessively in situations in which it is inappropriate (in adolescents or adults, may be limited to subjective feelings of restlessness) Often has difficulty playing or engaging in leisure activities quietly Is often “on the go” or acts as if “driven by a motor” Often blurts out answers before questions have been completed Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations or games) Some hyperactive-impulsive or inattention symptoms that caused impairment were present before the age of seven years. Some impairment from the symptoms is present in two or more settings (e.g., at school [or work] and at home). There must be clear evidence of clinically significant impairment in social, academic or occupational functioning.

Family dysfunction can cause behaviors consistent with those occurring in ADHD. Similarly, family tensions can exacerbate existing ADHD. Therefore, it is important to inquire about family stressors and coping methods. For instance, the family physician should understand the family's philosophical approach to discipline, as well as their difficulties in disciplining the child with ADHD. Do the findings of the child's history or physical examination suggest the need for additional diagnostic testing? ADHD is a clinical diagnosis. Blood tests and imaging studies of the brain are not recommended in the routine evaluation of the child with ADHD symptoms. Diagnostic testing should be guided by the findings of the history and physical examination. A family history of mental retardation, fragile X syndrome, phenylketonuria or degenerative neurologic disorder suggests the need for further evaluation. Similarly, dysmorphic features and abnormalities of growth, development or neurologic function may reflect a genetic disorder (e.g., fragile X syndrome), a prenatal insult (e.g., alcohol abuse by the mother) or a chronic medical condition. Abstract A comprehensive treatment plan should address not only the child's symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, but also the child's academic performance, social interactions and family function. The AACAP recommends a multimodal treatment plan. One reason for this recommendation is that even though pharmacotherapy improves attention and decreases excessive physical activity, these symptomatic improvements do not necessarily enhance the child's function in educational or social domains. Thus, it is reasonable to recommend parental support and education to improve coping abilities, suggest behavioral interventions to improve conduct at home and school, and advocate educational intervention to optimize academic progress. Screening Questions to Detect Comorbid Conditions in the Child with ADHD* Does the child have recurrent thoughts of death or suicide? Is the child violent or cruel toward people or animals? Has the child deliberately destroyed others' property? Has the child been involved in delinquent behavior? Does the child argue with adults and actively defy rules? Does the child show repetitive vocal or motor tics? Does the child exhibit inappropriate sexual behavior? *—Positive responses should prompt more formal evaluation and consideration of the diagnostic criteria for such disorders.

The Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA) was a well-designed randomized trial comparing four ways to treat ADHD: protocol-based medication management alone, intensive behavioral treatment alone, combined medication and behavioral (multimodal) treatment, or community care. In the community-care group, children with ADHD and their parents received information about their comprehensive assessments and the available mental health resources for ADHD in their community. In this group, the decision to use medications, behavioral interventions, or both, was left to the discretion of community-based physicians and the children's parents. Two thirds of the children in the community-care group received stimulant medications. The study showed that protocol-based medication management plus intensive behavioral therapy did not improve core ADHD symptoms better than protocol-based medication management alone, but that both strategies were superior to community care. Intensive behavioral treatment alone was nearly equal in effectiveness to community care, confirming the viability of specialized behavioral treatment for parents who prefer nonpharmacologic treatment of ADHD. Most family physicians cannot access the intensive behavioral treatment used in the MTA study. However, they can create multimodal treatment plans using elements of various psychosocial, behavioral and educational interventions. Psychosocial interventions should help the child with ADHD gain social skills and have more satisfying interactions with peers and family members. For instance, encouraging children with ADHD to participate in sports or other recreational activities may promote self-esteem and improve positive relationships with peers and adults. ADHD advocacy and support groups can help parents adapt to the challenges of living with a child who has ADHD. These groups can also help parents learn useful behavior management and discipline strategies. Individualized counseling may benefit the child with ADHD who has a comorbid psychologic condition. This form of counseling can also be helpful if the family has been experiencing emotional distress. Behavioral interventions use positive rewards to encourage appropriate behaviors and reduce problem behaviors. These interventions begin with a detailed description of specific behaviors and the environmental conditions that elicit and reinforce them. Interventions are most effective when parents and school personnel focus on a limited number of specific behaviors, agree to a system of rewards and consequences, and apply the consequences quickly and consistently in all settings. The purpose of educational interventions is to maximize the likelihood of the child's academic success by developing areas of strength, adapting to special needs and remediating knowledge and skill deficits. Schools have a legal responsibility to determine whether a child is eligible for special educational services, such as tutoring or adaptation of educational methods, and to ensure that these services are provided. Teachers may suggest academic skills training to help the child follow directions, use time efficiently, check his or her work, take notes and study effectively. An evidence-based review by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (formerly the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research) found that most studies of ADHD treatments were limited by one or more design deficiencies in sample size, descriptions of primary outcomes, measurement of compliance or assessment for comorbid disorders. Despite these limitations, the authors of the review concluded that ADHD symptoms tend to improve over time with or without treatment, that stimulant medications and desipramine improve core symptoms more effectively than placebo, and that currently available stimulants have equal efficacy. Although stimulant medications improve core ADHD symptoms in up to 80 percent of properly diagnosed children, the diagnosis of ADHD cannot be reliably confirmed or excluded based on a positive or negative response to stimulants. Stimulant medications may improve excessive physical activity, inattention, impulsivity and poor self-control, physical and verbal aggression, and low academic productivity. Treatment with these agents may not improve antisocial behavior, reading skills or academic achievement. Reported adverse effects of stimulant medications include insomnia, decreased appetite, stomach pain, headache, emergence or worsening of tics, decreased growth velocity, tachycardia, blood pressure elevation, rebound or deterioration of ADHD behaviors when medication wears off, emotional lability, irritability, social withdrawal and flattened affect. Because many of these signs and symptoms are reported in children with ADHD who receive a placebo, it is prudent to document the presence or absence of potential adverse effects before a stimulant drug is initiated. Of the stimulant drugs used to treat ADHD, only pemoline (Cylert) is associated with an increased risk of liver damage and hepatic failure. Accordingly, the package insert warns that pemoline should not be prescribed without first obtaining informed consent using the form supplied by the manufacturer of the drug. The package insert also recommends monitoring serum alanine aminotransferase levels before pemoline therapy is initiated and every two weeks thereafter. A number of stimulants, some with short-and long-acting formulations, are listed in .- The table includes recommendations for initial and maximal dosages, some based on body weight. When reviewing these recommendations, the physician should remember that the response to stimulant medication is not directly related to the dose per kilogram of body weight or to serum drug levels. Because the MTA medication management strategy produced results that were superior to those for community care, the family physician may wish to emulate this strategy for prescribing stimulants. The MTA protocol first identified the best dose of methylphenidate by measuring the effect of placebo and various methylphenidate doses on the findings of ADHD rating scales completed by parents and teachers. Methylphenidate doses of 5, 10 and 15 or 20 mg were administered at breakfast and lunch, with one half of the dose (rounded to the nearest 5 mg) given in the afternoon. An inadequate response to methylphenidate was followed first by a trial of dextroamphetamine, then pemoline and then imipramine. Dosages were increased if the rating scales showed an incomplete response or were decreased to alleviate adverse effects.

Information from references , and through . In some children, stimulant medications with longer half-lives may be beneficial if the effects of short-acting preparations are too brief (two and one-half to three hours), if symptoms worsen at the end of the dosing interval or if administering medication at school is problematic. A combination agent containing amphetamine and dextroamphetamine (Adderall) has a rapid onset and longer duration of action than methylphenidate; in appropriate dosages, it may prevent rebound symptoms. However, no study has shown that this agent is superior to the dextroamphetamine stimulants. Because of lack of efficacy or the emergence of adverse effects, stimulant therapy is unsuccessful in 25 to 30 percent of children. A child may respond poorly to stimulant medication because of an undiagnosed comorbid condition, the emergence of psychosocial stressors or noncompliance. In the MTA study, children were given bupropion or haloperidol if stimulants proved ineffective. Desipramine and clonidine have also been suggested as alternatives to stimulants in children with ADHD. Parents of children with ADHD may inquire about alternatives to drug treatment, including dietary modification, nutritional supplements, homeopathy and vision therapy. The family physician should be familiar with the studies that have evaluated the efficacy of these treatments. The most widely studied dietary modifications for the treatment of ADHD are the additive-free Kaiser-Permanente diet and the Feingold diet. These diets have been found to produce behavioral or cognitive improvement in approximately 5 percent of hyperactive children. Unfortunately, this response rate is no better than the expected response to placebo. Parents of a child with ADHD who wish to pursue dietary modification should do so in consultation with a physician to monitor progress and in consultation with a dietitian to ensure nutritional adequacy. They should also recognize the potential risk of forgoing pharmacologic treatment, which has many benefits. Reducing or eliminating sugar to treat ADHD has widespread support among lay persons and in the lay press. However, controlled trials have not shown that the ingestion of sugar has an effect on activity or aggression in normal or hyperactive children. ADHD symptoms are not improved by supplementing a child's diet with iron, magnesium, pyridoxine or zinc if no nutritional deficiency exists. Similarly, megavitamin therapy does not improve ADHD behaviors and may produce toxic effects. Eye muscle exercises and special eyeglass lenses have not proved beneficial in children with ADHD. Further assessment by a psychiatrist or developmental-behavioral pediatrician may be beneficial for children with ADHD who have comorbid psychiatric conditions, who do not respond to stimulants or who have extremely difficult problems in their relationships with peers, teachers or family. Referral is also indicated for children with developmental abnormalities or mental retardation and severe symptoms of ADHD. Abstract Follow-up visits should occur as often as needed to monitor the effects of a comprehensive treatment plan. The MTA study, which showed that combined medication and behavioral treatment was superior to standard community care, used monthly 30-minute medication management visits to encourage and advise children and parents, review ADHD rating scales and adjust medication dosages. Because the child with ADHD frequently has low self-esteem and few successes, the family physician should start each visit by having the child and parent report positive experiences with hobbies, athletics, peer activities, family interactions or academic performance. Then the physician should monitor the effects of medications by reviewing ADHD-specific rating scales and inquiring about possible adverse drug effects.

8b065d2e-0f78-4175-bb3a-bf05b56a68c1,"| | > > > > Anxiety Disorders and ADHD As with disruptive behavior disorders, there is a great deal of overlap between anxiety disorders and ADHD. About one fourth of children with ADHD also have an anxiety disorder. Likewise, about one fourth of children with anxiety disorders have ADHD. This includes all types of anxiety disorders—generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation anxiety, and phobia (including social anxiety). Younger children with overanxious disorder or separation anxiety are especially likely to also have ADHD. Anxiety disorders are often more difficult to recognize than disruptive behavior disorders because the former’s symptoms are internalized—that is, they often exist within the mind of the child rather than in such outward behavior as verbal outbursts or pushing others to be first in line. An anxious child may be experiencing guilt, fear, or even irritability and yet escape notice by a parent, teacher, or pediatrician. Only when her symptoms are expressed in actual behavior, such as weight loss, sleeplessness, or refusal to attend school, will she attract the attention she needs. It is important to ask your child’s pediatrician or psychologist to talk with your child directly if you suspect the presence of persistent anxiety in addition to her ADHD. Identifying an anxiety disorder in your child can be difficult not only because her symptoms may be internal, but because certain signs of anxiety—particularly restlessness and poor concentration—may be misinterpreted as symptoms of ADHD. Children with an anxiety disorder, however, experience more than a general lack of focus or a restless response to boredom. Their anxiety and worry are clear-cut, often focusing on specific situations or thoughts. They may seem tense, irritable, tired, or stressed out. They may not sleep well, and may even experience brief panic attacks—involving pounding heart, difficulty breathing, nausea, shaking, and intense fears—that occur for no apparent reason.While their school performance may be equivalent to that of children with ADHD alone, they tend to experience a wider variety of social difficulties and have more problems at school than children with ADHD alone. At the same time, they may behave in less disruptive ways than children with ADHD alone because their anxiety inhibits spontaneous or impulsive behavior. Instead they may tend to seem inefficient or distracted—having a great deal of difficulty remembering facts or processing concepts or ideas. Your child can be an important source of information that may lead to a diagnosis of anxiety disorder, although some children are reluctant to admit to any symptoms even if they are quite significant. If the possibility of an anxiety disorder concerns you, be sure to discuss any fears or worries she has and listen carefully to her response. Report her comments to her pediatrician and/or psychologist, and encourage her to  Does she seem excessively worried or anxious about a number of situations or activities (such as peer relationships or school performance)? Are her fears largely irrational—that is, overly exaggerated or unrealistic—rather than realistic worries about punishment for negative behavior? Does she find it difficult to control her worrying? Does her anxiety lead to restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability,muscle tension, and/or sleep disturbance? Does her anxiety or its outward symptoms significantly impair her social, academic, or other functioning? Does her anxiety occur more days than not, and continue for a significant duration? Have her anxiety symptoms lasted for at least 6 months? Do her bouts of anxiety occur at least 3 to 5 times per week and last for at least an hour? Is her anxiety unrelated to another disorder, substance abuse, or other identifiable cause? A child who is distressed over a life event, who is abusing drugs, or whose family is in conflict may exhibit some of the symptoms of anxiety disorder. It is important to consider these other causes as the reason for anxiety instead of a formal anxiety disorder. As a young child, did she experience developmental delays or severe anxiety at being separated froma parent, express frequent or numerous fears, or experience unusual stress? Children with ADHD and a coexisting anxiety disorder are more likely to have experienced developmental delays in early childhood and more stressful life events such as parental divorce or separation. Have others in her family been diagnosed with anxiety disorders? Anxiety disorders tend to run in families. A careful review of your family’s medical history may provide insight into your child’s condition. These are some symptoms of anxiety disorders, and their presence may indicate a need to have your child evaluated by her pediatrician or mental health provider. The sooner your child is properly treated for anxiety, the sooner she can improve her functioning and balance in her daily life. Treatment for children with ADHD and an anxiety disorder relies on a combination of approaches geared to each child’s specific situation—including educating the child and her family about the condition, encouraging ongoing input from school personnel, initiating behavior therapy including cognitive behavioral techniques, as well as traditional psychotherapy, family therapy, and medication management. Behavior therapies are among the most proven and effective non-medication treatments for anxiety disorders. (The effectiveness of traditional psychotherapy has been less well studied.) Behavior therapies target caused by the anxiety rather than focusing on the child’s internal conflicts. Cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques help children into a more positive framework so that they can become more assertive and increase their level of positive functioning. For example, a child can learn to identify anxious feelings and thoughts, recognize how her body responds to anxiety, and devise a plan to cut down on these symptoms when they appear. Other behavioral techniques that can be used for treating anxiety include modeling appropriate behaviors, role-playing, relaxation techniques, and gradual desensitization to the specific experiences that make a given child anxious. Decisions about medication treatment of ADHD and a coexisting anxiety disorder depend largely on the relative strength of each condition. In the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA) study of large numbers of children with ADHD and various coexisting conditions, behavioral treatments were equally as effective as medication treatment for children with ADHD and parent-reported anxiety symptoms. It was not known, however, how many of these children had true anxiety disorders. In general, if your child’s ADHD symptoms impede her functioning more than the anxiety does, and a medication approach is recommended, her pediatrician may choose to begin treating her with stimulants first. As he adjusts her dosage for maximal effect, he will monitor her for side effects such as jitteriness or overfocusing—possible responses to stimulants among children with ADHD and an anxiety disorder. If your child’s ADHD symptoms improve with stimulant medication and her anxiety diminishes as well, her pediatrician may want to review her diagnosis to discern whether the anxiety stemmed from the ADHD-related behavior and was not a sign of an anxiety disorder. If the ADHD symptoms improve but your child’s anxiety remains, her pediatrician may decide to add another type of medication. These medications can include a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA).  ADHD: A Complete and Authoritative Guide (Copyright © 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics) The information contained on this Web site should not be used as a substitute for the medical care and advice of your pediatrician.

(Dotdash) — All rights reserved Arlin Cuncic, MA, is the author of ""Therapy in Focus: What to Expect from CBT for Social Anxiety Disorder"" and ""7 Weeks to Reduce Anxiety."" Daniel B. Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania. As many as 80% of people with (ADHD) will have at least one other psychiatric condition in their lifetime.﻿ Just as untreated ADHD can lead to unnecessary problems in everyday life, can cause a tremendous amount of harm in those with ADHD if left undiagnosed and untreated. Though any anxiety disorder can coexist with ADHD, (SAD) is one of the most common. Learning the differences between the two conditions is important in the management and treatment of both. It's entirely possible that anxiety disorders occur much more frequently in people with ADHD than they do in the general population. According to the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, 47% of adults with ADHD have an anxiety disorder—approximately 30% have SAD, specifically.﻿﻿ More research is needed to understand why ADHD and SAD co-occur in some people and not in others. Although experts don't know for certain why ADHD and SAD tend to occur together, some think that the —genetics, environmental toxins, or premature birth—may also influence anxiety disorders. Still, others believe that ADHD symptoms, themselves, contribute to anxiety. Often, ADHD symptoms—such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity—put a person at greater risk for being teased, bullied, or otherwise socially rejected. Fearing further rejection, many withdraw into themselves, that they find threatening.﻿﻿ On the surface, SAD and ADHD can sometimes look alike. The following are just a few ways symptoms of ADHD and SAD overlap:﻿ : People with SAD may struggle to make and maintain friendships due to fears about rejection. Someone with ADHD is likely to have low impulse control and trouble picking up on social cues, making it difficult to sustain friendships. : A person with SAD may seem tuned out, but they are really just distracted by worries. Those with ADHD are inattentive because of differences in the brain that affect focus. : People with SAD might become stuck on a task and be too anxious to ask for help. Those with ADHD might not turn in an assignment because of poor planning skills and forgetfulness. Unfortunately, some symptoms of SAD can be misinterpreted as ADHD symptoms, and it isn't until outward behaviors—such as weight loss, sleeplessness, or refusal to attend social settings—that the social anxiety becomes more apparent. As a result, SAD often goes undiagnosed in those who also have ADHD. There are no clear or published guidelines on how to treat co-occurring ADHD and SAD. Only after your doctor determines how your anxiety functions can they develop the best treatment plan to meet your needs. For instance, if your anxiety and ADHD are functioning independently of one another, your doctor may decide to treat both conditions simultaneously. Or they may choose to treat whichever condition is causing you the most problems first before moving on to the other condition. However, if your doctor believes that your anxiety is being caused or heavily influenced by your ADHD, your doctor may take a different approach to treatment. If your anxiety is the result of ADHD, your doctor may decide to treat your ADHD first with medications as this may reduce your anxiety symptoms. Common medications used to treat ADHD include: : Although stimulants primarily treat ADHD symptoms, as ADHD symptoms are controlled, you may also find some relief from your anxiety. In one study examining children and adolescents with ADHD and SAD comorbidity, (methylphenidate) was found to be associated with a significant improvement in both ADHD and SAD symptoms.﻿ A similar study found the same improvements in adults using extended-release Ritalin.﻿ : Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) like (atomoxetine) may target both ADHD and anxiety symptoms. A 2009 study found that Strattera improved both ADHD and comorbid SAD in adults.﻿ While medication has historically been the first line of treatment for ADHD, many people also benefit from non-medication therapies, and that is especially true of people who are also living with an anxiety disorder. Approaches such as can address many of the underlying challenges of both ADHD and SAD—as well as the complicated symptoms that overlap between them. The goal of CBT is to provide techniques and practice for managing anxiety so that those with SAD. A specific technique your therapist might recommend is , a type of CBT most often used when treating SAD, in which you and your therapist work together to gradually expose you to anxiety-provoking situations so you can develop healthy coping mechanisms and, over time, the situations elicit less fear. In other types of CBT, you can learn and practice and . A co-occurring diagnosis of SAD can be a lifelong reality for someone with ADHD. It's OK to feel overwhelmed. Learning more about the connection between these two conditions is the first step toward lessening the impact they have on your life. Just take a deep breath and know that with the right support, you can manage both ADHD and SAD, and thrive in life. Learn the best ways to manage stress and negativity in your life.

Borschuk, Casey Rodweller, Objective: The current study examined the association between asthma and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in a clinical pediatric sample. Methods: Demographic and neuropsychological data for children with a billing diagnosis of ADHD were extracted from a clinical database. Families completed standard rating scales. Seventy-one patients with a co-morbid asthma diagnosis were identified and matched by age to a group of 71 patients with only ADHD. Results: Children with asthma and ADHD were more likely to display clinically elevated levels of hyperactivity, externalizing behaviors, anxiety, and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors compared to children with ADHD alone. Boys with asthma and ADHD had more symptoms than boys with only ADHD of somatization and emotional internalizing, while girls with asthma and ADHD had more symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity, conduct problems, anxiety, and emotional internalizing compared to girls with only ADHD. Conclusions: Findings suggest that in children with ADHD, co-morbid asthma is associated with increased behavioral and internalizing symptoms, with distinct gender differences present. Increased behavioral and internalizing symptoms seen in children with both asthma and ADHD may be due to the burden of their medical condition.

Abstract Abstract Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects 30 to 50 percent of adults who had ADHD in childhood. Accurate diagnosis of ADHD in adults is challenging and requires attention to early development and symptoms of inattention, distractibility, impulsivity and emotional lability. Diagnosis is further complicated by the overlap between the symptoms of adult ADHD and the symptoms of other common psychiatric conditions such as depression and substance abuse. While stimulants are a common treatment for adult patients with ADHD, antidepressants may also be effective. Cognitive-behavioral skills training and psychotherapy are useful adjuncts to pharmacotherapy. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) receives considerable attention in both medical literature and the lay media. Historically, ADHD was considered to be primarily a childhood condition. However, recent data suggest that symptoms of ADHD continue into adulthood in up to 50 percent of persons with childhood ADHD. Because ADHD is such a well-known disorder, adults with both objective and subjective symptoms of poor concentration and inattention are likely to present to family physicians for evaluation. While the symptoms of ADHD have been extended developmentally upward to adults, most of the information about the etiology, symptoms and treatment of this disorder comes from observations of and studies in children. Research on adult ADHD is in an early stage. The criteria for ADHD emphasize a childhood presentation, and there is growing evidence that the diagnostic features of ADHD take a different form in adults. For several reasons, family physicians may be uncomfortable evaluating and treating patients with symptoms of ADHD, particularly adults without a previously established ADHD diagnosis. First, the criteria for ADHD are not objectively verifiable and require reliance on the patient's subjective report of symptoms. Second, the criteria for ADHD do not describe the subtle cognitive-behavioral symptoms that may affect adults more than children. Third, the most effective treatment is long-term use of a schedule II drug with potential for abuse. The family physician's role as diagnostician is further complicated by the high rates of self-diagnosis of ADHD in adults. Many of these persons are influenced by the popular press. Studies of self-referral suggest that only one third to one half of adults who believe they have ADHD actually meet formal diagnostic criteria. While family physicians are knowledgeable about childhood ADHD, there is a noticeable absence of guidelines for primary care evaluation and treatment of adults with symptoms of the disorder. Abstract The criteria for ADHD as specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV), are described in . DSM-IV describes three subtypes of the disorder: predominantly hyperactive, predominantly inattentive and a mixed type with symptoms of the other two forms. Symptoms should be persistently present since age seven. While a longstanding symptom history is often difficult to elicit clearly in adults, it is a key feature of the disorder. 1. Six (or more) of the following symptoms of inattention have persisted for at least six months to a degree that is maladaptive and inconsistent with developmental level: a. Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, work or other activities b. Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities c. Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly d. Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores or duties in the workplace (not due to oppositional behavior or failure to understand instructions) e. Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities f. Often avoids, dislikes or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort (such as schoolwork or homework) g. Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., toys, school assignments, pencils, books or tools) h. Is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli 2. Six (or more) of the following symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity have persisted for at least six months to a degree that is maladaptive and inconsistent with developmental level: a. Often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat b. Often leaves seat in classroom or in other situations in which remaining seated is expected c. Often runs about or climbs excessively in situations in which it is inappropriate (in adolescents or adults, may be limited to subjective feelings of restlessness) d. Often has difficulty playing or engaging in leisure activities quietly e. Is often “on the go” or often acts as if “driven by a motor” g. Often blurts out answers before questions have been completed i. Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations or games) B. Some hyperactive-impulsive or inattentive symptoms that caused impairment were present before age 7 years. C. Some impairment from the symptoms is present in two or more settings (e.g., at school [or work] and at home). D.

Adults who have retained some, but not all, of the symptoms of childhood ADHD may be best diagnosed as having ADHD in partial remission. While the DSM-IV criteria for ADHD may be applied to adults, these dimensions tend to reflect presentations in children. The subtlety of ADHD symptoms among adults has led to several modifications of existing criteria. Rather than requiring six DSM-IV symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity, some investigators propose requiring only five such behaviors for older patients. In addition, the symptoms take different forms in adults. There is growing consensus that the central feature of ADHD is disinhibition. Patients are unable to stop themselves from immediately responding, and they have deficits in their capacity for monitoring their own behavior. Hyperactivity, while a common feature among children, is likely to be less overt in adults. The “on the go” drivenness seen in many ADHD children is replaced in adults with restlessness, difficulty relaxing and a feeling of being chronically “on edge.” Deficits in sustained attention and concentration are likely to remain and may become more apparent in late adolescence and early adulthood as responsibilities increase. Appointments, social commitments and deadlines are frequently forgotten. Impulsivity often takes the form of socially inappropriate behavior, such as blurting out thoughts that are rude or insulting. While many of the symptoms are reported by others in the patient's life, the problem often expressed by adults with ADHD is frustration over the inability to be organized. Prioritizing is another common source of frustration. Important tasks are not completed while trivial distractions receive inordinate time and attention. Wender developed a set of ADHD criteria, referred to as the Utah criteria, that reflect the distinct features of the disorder in adults . The diagnosis of ADHD in an adult requires a longstanding history of ADHD symptoms, dating back to at least age seven. In the absence of treatment, such symptoms should have been consistently present without remission. In addition, hyperactivity and poor concentration should be present in adulthood, along with two of five additional symptoms: affective lability; hot temper; inability to complete tasks and disorganization; stress intolerance; and impulsivity. Two of the following: Adapted from Wender PH. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995:122–43. Two of the following: Adapted from Wender PH. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995:122–43. The Utah criteria include the emotional aspects of the syndrome. The episodes of hot temper, typified by frequent angry eruptions out of proportion to the precipitants, often “blow over” more quickly for the patient than for coworkers and family members. Affective lability is characterized by brief, intense affective outbursts ranging from euphoria to despair to anger, and is experienced by the ADHD adult as being out of control. Under conditions of increased emotional arousal from external demands, the patient becomes more disorganized and distractible. Another model of adult ADHD diverges from DSM-IV but overlaps with Wender's criteria and includes five areas. In this model, the five core ADHD dimensions include the following: activation and organization; sustained attention; sustained energy and effort; managing affective interference; and working memory and accessing recall. Activation refers to difficulties initiating and organizing daily tasks. Sustained attention includes such aspects as distractibility, daydreaming and having to reread material to understand it. Sustained energy and effort refers to drowsiness, inconsistent performance and poor task completion. Managing affective interference includes difficulty managing criticism as well as being easily frustrated, irritable and poorly motivated. Memory difficulties encompass recent and remote memory for daily activities and task-related materials. Another model, which serves as the basis for the Copeland symptom checklist for ADHD in adults, includes eight dimensions: inattention and distractibility; impulsivity; activity level problems; noncompliance; underachievement, disorganization and learning problems; emotional difficulties; poor peer relations; and impaired family relationships. Abstract The subtlety and subjectivity of ADHD symptoms in adults, together with the absence of a single “gold standard” for confirming the diagnosis, make assessment particularly challenging. Evaluation of adults with symptoms of ADHD requires weighing and integrating a range of data, including the patient's history, the patient's self-report of symptoms and mental status testing . A thorough history should include an emphasis on past school performance and conduct, previous and current psychiatric therapies, and reports of specific symptoms of inattention, distractibility and disorganization. ADHD is currently understood as a neurobehavioral condition that is typically apparent in preschool years and becomes more pronounced in the early elementary grades. Obtain a developmental history. Attempt to corroborate information with other sources, such as parents, spouse and school report cards. Symptoms should be consistently present since early childhood. Inquire about impact of core ADHD symptoms on current occupational, school and relationship functioning. Assess attention, concentration, distractibility and short-term memory by having patient perform screening tasks in the office setting. Assess for the presence of other psychiatric disorders and substance abuse. If results are equivocal, refer patient for psychologic evaluation. Obtain a developmental history.

Assess attention, concentration, distractibility and short-term memory by having patient perform screening tasks in the office setting. Assess for the presence of other psychiatric disorders and substance abuse. If results are equivocal, refer patient for psychologic evaluation. An extended, consistent pattern of ADHD symptoms, dating back to early childhood, should be uncovered during history taking. Patients with ADHD may have difficulty accurately recalling relevant history.Adult patients should be asked to provide any available school records and gather information from parents and other adults who knew them as children. Because adults with ADHD may not appreciate their symptoms, the patient's spouse or another significant person in the patient's life should ideally be included in the interview. The recent onset of symptoms or sporadic episodes of symptoms should raise concern about the appropriateness of the diagnosis of ADHD. The three most commonly used self-report measures for ADHD are the Wender rating scale,  the Copeland symptom checklist and the Brown scale . While self-report instruments may be useful for initial screening, they should not be used alone to diagnose adult ADHD. High scores are likely in a variety of psychiatric conditions. Problems with attention, concentration, affective lability, impulsivity and task completion are non-specific and can be associated with many forms of psychopathology. Features of Self-Report Scales for Adults with ADHD Broad range of cognitive, emotional and social symptoms Cognitive symptoms associated with difficulty initiating and maintaining optimal arousal level Features of Self-Report Scales for Adults with ADHD Broad range of cognitive, emotional and social symptoms Cognitive symptoms associated with difficulty initiating and maintaining optimal arousal level Mental status testing is often useful when evaluating the patient's cognitive functioning in the office, but impaired performance on mental status testing may result from numerous psychiatric and medical conditions. Cognitive tasks include recitation of serial 7s for assessment of concentration, digit span forward and backward for assessment of attention, and immediate recall for assessment of short-term memory. Short-term memory can be evaluated by asking patients to verbally recall a short paragraph that was read to them. The patient's ability to attend to relevant stimuli while ignoring distractions can be assessed through vigilance tasks in which the patient is read a string of letters and told to tap a finger when a target letter is spoken. Verbally administered mathematic problems are more demanding tasks that require concentration and problem solving. The medical evaluation should include a neurologic examination. There are suggestions that patients with ADHD exhibit a greater incidence of “soft neurologic signs,” including problems with right-left discrimination, motor overflow movements and sequencing difficulties. Laboratory tests may include a serum lead level and thyroid function tests. Abstract Patients with a range of psychiatric conditions may emphasize difficulty with concentration, attention or short-term memory when they describe their problems to the physician.  It is important to exclude other psychiatric conditions, most of which are actually more prevalent than ADHD among adults . Major depression and substance abuse, in particular, commonly accompany adult ADHD. Psychiatric Disorders to Consider in the Differential Diagnosis of ADHD in Adults Subjective report of poor concentration, attention and memory; difficulty with task completion Enduring dysphoric mood or anhedonia; sleep and appetite disturbance Hyperactivity, difficulty with maintaining attention and focus; mood swings Enduring dysphoric or euphoric mood; insomnia; delusions Exaggerated apprehension and worry; somatic symptoms of anxiety Difficulties with attention, concentration and memory; mood swings Pathologic pattern of substance use with social consequences; physiologic and psychologic tolerance and withdrawal Personality disorders, particularly borderline and antisocial personality Arrest history (antisocial personality); repeated self-injurious or suicidal behavior (borderline personality); lack of recognition that behavior is self-defeating Psychiatric Disorders to Consider in the Differential Diagnosis of ADHD in Adults Subjective report of poor concentration, attention and memory; difficulty with task completion Enduring dysphoric mood or anhedonia; sleep and appetite disturbance Hyperactivity, difficulty with maintaining attention and focus; mood swings Enduring dysphoric or euphoric mood; insomnia; delusions Exaggerated apprehension and worry; somatic symptoms of anxiety Difficulties with attention, concentration and memory; mood swings Pathologic pattern of substance use with social consequences; physiologic and psychologic tolerance and withdrawal Personality disorders, particularly borderline and antisocial personality Arrest history (antisocial personality); repeated self-injurious or suicidal behavior (borderline personality); lack of recognition that behavior is self-defeating Importantly, most adults with ADHD do not have a “pure” form of the disorder. Comorbidity is more likely to be the rule than the exception. It is not clear whether these comorbid psychiatric conditions are a psychologic effect of preexisting ADHD or are simply associated with ADHD. For example, substance abuse may have developed as a way to reduce the frustration arising from distractibility, inattention and impulsivity. If a comorbid psychiatric disorder exists in a patient with ADHD, the patient should be educated about the ADHD symptoms that will resolve with stimulant therapy and the symptoms of the other psychiatric condition that may warrant additional treatment. In addition to the physical examination and laboratory findings, a thorough history is valuable in the differential diagnosis. Medical conditions that may mimic adult ADHD include hyperthyroidism, petit mal and partial complex seizures, hearing deficits, hepatic disease and lead toxicity. In addition, sleep apnea and drug interactions should be considered as possible causes of inattention and hyperactivity. Patients with a history of head injury may also have problems with attention, concentration and memory. Abstract The pathophysiologic basis of ADHD centers on an imbalance in catecholamine metabolism in the cerebral cortex, and the agents used to treat this disorder in adults, as in children, enhance the availability of dopamine and norepinephrine.  Pharmacotherapy options are summarized in . As with children, stimulants are the most commonly used category of medications in adults with ADHD.

Montvale, N.J.: Medical Economics Data, 2000. Cost to the patient will be higher, depending on prescription filling fee. Methylphenidate (Ritalin) and dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) are effective in improving attention and concentration, and in reducing impulsivity in adults with ADHD. Although chemically distinct from the other two agents, pemoline (Cylert) has a mechanism of action that is similar to that of methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine. These agents stimulate the release of catecholamines from storage sites at the synapses of the central nervous system. Because catecholamine receptors are pervasive throughout the central nervous system, the exact focus of the pharmacologic effect is unclear. Increased norepinephrine and dopamine concentrations in the brain stem, midbrain or frontal cortex have been postulated to be responsible for the increased attention span and concentrating ability that occurs with the use of stimulants. Because stimulants may produce these effects in patients without ADHD and because not all patients with ADHD improve with such therapy, the patient's response cannot be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of ADHD. Each of the currently available stimulants appears to be equally effective in the management of symptoms of ADHD, but they differ in their time course of action. Stimulants are usually well tolerated and are associated with only mild side effects. A common initial side effect is sleep disturbance, characterized by the delayed onset of sleep. While initial insomnia can be a side effect of stimulant medication, it is also a common complaint of adults with untreated ADHD. Therefore, if sleep problems develop after initiation of therapy, it may be helpful to assess the patient's sleep patterns for several weeks before altering the dosage or the timing of administration. Another side effect of stimulants may be a decrease in appetite, resulting in weight loss. The cardiovascular effects of stimulants are of potentially greater concern in adults than in children. Mild increases in heart rate and blood pressure may occur but are not usually clinically significant. Because the effects of stimulants on blood pressure may be variable, blood pressure should be controlled and closely monitored when initiating treatment with stimulants in patients with hypertension. Because of the risk of hepatitis with pemoline, the use of this agent is recommended only in patients who have failed to respond to other stimulants. A baseline serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determination should be obtained before initiating therapy with pemoline and every two weeks during therapy. According to the manufacturer, pemoline therapy should be discontinued if the ALT level exceeds two times the upper limits of normal or if symptoms of liver disease develop. The manufacturer of pemoline has developed a consent form that describes the risks associated with this drug and recommends that patients sign the form before initiation of therapy. Some prescribing issues surround the use of controlled substances such as stimulants. Caution should be exercised not only in making the diagnosis of ADHD but also in avoiding the use of stimulants in patients with a history of substance abuse. On the other hand, adult patients may require larger dosages than those usually prescribed to children. Therefore, it is important to document the patient's symptoms and the patient's response to each dosage as the amount is titrated upward. Because methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine are C-II controlled substances, most states limit prescriptions to a 30-day supply and do not authorize refills. In addition, written copies of the prescription are usually required. Such requirements necessitate frequent contact between the patient and physician for reevaluation and prescription renewal. Pemoline is classified as a C-IV controlled substance, which can usually be refilled up to five times over the six months following the initial prescription. As a means of increasing the concentration of catecholamines in the central nervous system, antidepressants that inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine have been evaluated for the treatment of ADHD. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), which inhibit the uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, may be effective, while the response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been less promising in adults with ADHD. The secondary amine TCAs, such as desipramine (Norpramin) and nortriptyline (Pamelor), may be preferred because of greater effects on norepinephrine than on serotonin and a better side effect profile. Bupropion (Wellbutrin), an atypical antidepressant with more stimulant properties than the TCAs, may be effective as well. Therapy with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors has produced variable responses in patients with ADHD, but may be tried in patients who have responded poorly to other therapies. Antidepressant therapy in adults with ADHD may be particularly helpful in reducing affective instability and controlling a coexistent mood disturbance. Because of the different effects of stimulants and antidepressants, some patients may benefit from the combination of a stimulant and an antidepressant. Adverse effects of antidepressants often limit the ability to titrate the dose to an effective level. Because of the possibility of cardiac conduction abnormalities, an electrocardiogram should be obtained before initiating TCA therapy and after the dosage is stabilized. Drowsiness is common but may be minimized by taking the antidepressant at bedtime and slowly titrating to the target dosage. Anti-cholinergic effects such as dry mouth, constipation and urinary retention may also be troublesome. Weight gain and postural hypotension may be problematic. Sexual dysfunction is more common with the agents that affect serotonin reuptake, so it may be less common with secondary amine TCAs. If sedation is problematic, bupropion may be an alternative agent. However, the use of bupropion is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizures. If an antidepressant is tolerated at an effective dosage, it may be a reasonable alternative in patients with coexisting depression or an alternative to a controlled substance. Sympatholytics have also been used in the management of ADHD. Clonidine (Catapres) is a centrally acting alpha agonist that decreases sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system. While this agent may be beneficial in children and adolescents, particularly those with significant hyperactivity and aggressive behavior, the benefits in adults are less clear. Sedation is the most common adverse effect of clonidine. The antihypertensive effects of clonidine may be beneficial in a patient with hypertension but may limit its usefulness in other patients. Abstract Adults with ADHD benefit considerably from direct education about the disorder. They can use information about their deficits to develop compensatory strategies. Planning and organization can be improved by encouraging patients to make lists and use computerized schedules. Placing a large calendar with important dates and deadlines in a central location in the home or workplace is a valuable memory aid. Ways to reduce distractions may include having a clutter-free desk, a carrel-style desk or a windowless office. ADHD adults may benefit from going to work early to accomplish tasks before coworkers arrive and phones begin ringing. Most adults are aware of their “personal clock” and know their prime times for completing intellectually demanding tasks. Task completion can be improved by systematically breaking down large projects into manageable “chunks,” each with its own deadline. Adults with ADHD should be educated about their elevated risk for drug and alcohol dependence and should be encouraged to drink in moderation or practice abstinence. Abstract Marital and individual counseling and self-help groups are often valuable adjuncts to pharmacotherapy and skill training. Among newly diagnosed adults in particular there may be an extended psychologic history of low self-esteem, failure, frequent job changes and relationship problems. Individual psychotherapy that focuses on core issues of self-worth along with ways to improve the patient's ability to monitor work and social skills can be invaluable. Married patients often have significant relationship conflicts stemming from forgotten commitments, impulsive decisions and emotional outbursts. Working with the couple to enhance communication skills, conflict resolution and problem solving, and educating the patient's spouse about ADHD can dramatically improve the relationship. Finally, self-help organizations such as Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder (CHADD; 800-233-4050) provide didactic information about the disorder.

6f268bb3-523d-41f8-8def-1ced8787d380,"(ADHD) is a mental health condition affecting a huge number of children, adolescents and sometimes adults. The patients exhibit the symptoms of hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity. Children with ADHD are usually seen to have difficulties in managing their emotions and organizing themselves. They tend to get into a trouble at school and elsewhere because of their inability to process information before reacting. While being particularly common in children, the disorder is seen across all age groups except in geriatric individuals. ADHD affects people from all races and ethnicities equally. Psychological wiring of the brain of an individual with ADHD is different from that of an unaffected individual. Imbalances in the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain are commonly seen in the patients with ADHD. The frontostriatal circuit of the brains of ADHD patients has been the area of focus for several studies aiming to understand neural responses in ADHD patients. Large scale trials with samples from diverse geographical populations are being carried out to understand the patterns of ADHD, its prognosis, and its association with other concurrent mental health conditions in a better manner. ADHD, just like any other neurological condition, is often associated with mental disorder comorbidity. More than 60% children with ADHD are reported to have one or more co-existing mental health conditions. The typical challenge these comorbidities present is that their symptoms are often overlapping with those of ADHD. Because of this, oftentimes an accurate diagnosis becomes extremely complicated. The inaccuracy or delay in diagnosis can be a major concern affecting the mental health and quality of life of the patient. A comprehensive evaluation of all the symptoms, medical history, and various psychometric tests help a psychiatrist to reach to a conclusive and any other comorbid conditions. Commonly reported conditions co-existing with ADHD can be classified into three major categories: Included under this umbrella are depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. When children face difficulties in coping, especially when they face problems at school due to ADHD, they tend to feel extremely sad and hopeless. As such, ADHD patients face difficulties paying attention to things and organizing themselves, which are magnified when coupled with depression. Approximately 10-15% of the children with ADHD suffer from comorbid depression. These patients often have suicidal inclinations due to lack of self-worth. While worries and fears are normal elements of growth, an excessive amount of fear causes anxiety disorder in children. At least 20% children with ADHD suffer from one of the following types of anxiety disorder: – Constant state of fearfulness about the future and things happening in life – Excessive fear of being away from the family or a figure of attachment – Feeling of being constantly worried while meeting people and an inability to socialize Some children with ADHD are also reported to have developed bipolar disorder. They experience mood swings characterized by periods of extreme happiness and extreme anger or irritation. An early diagnosis of comorbid mood disorders is very crucial in the management of these conditions. Talking openly to the family members, and doctor of these patients can help a lot. Psychiatrists often prefer cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for curing these ailments over antidepressant and anxiolytic medications in children. It is characterized by marked and unreasonable aggression. Patients with CD are likely to cause serious injuries to themselves and others. They tend to break rules and often damage others’ property on purpose. The diagnosis of ADHD in a child increases the likelihood of the diagnosis of CD. ODD is characterized by persistent defiant behavior around known people such as family members, friends, and peers. Children with ODD often get angry, lose their temper, and behave disrespectfully. In extreme cases, they also tend to hurt individuals who they believe have hurt them. While relatively rare, this condition is generally accompanied by ADHD. Children with Tourette syndrome typically display repetitive mannerisms including blinking eyes, clearing throats and sniffing. Around 25% of the children with ADHD are diagnosed with at least one behavioral/conduct related condition. As always, early treatment can work wonders. Conduct and behavioral problems are usually handled by the behavioral training of parents,; thebehavioral treatment of the child, and sometimes medications. In addition to inattentiveness (a classic ADHD symptom), children with ADHD often suffer from other learning disabilities. These include dysgraphia (difficulty in writing), dyslexia (difficulty in identifying letters correctly), and dyscalculia (difficulty with processing numbers). Co-existence of other mental health conditions with ADHD is statistically proven based on the available data. Scientists believe that stimulation of common physiological pathways and regions of the brain are responsible for comorbid neurological disorders. Further research is indeed essential to pinpoint particular regions of the brain causing these comorbidities to arise and to develop targeted treatment approaches for these conditions. www.psychologytoday.com/.../adhd-commonly-co-occurs-other-mental-health https://www.additudemag.com/when-its-not-just-adhd/ All Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Content Last Updated: Feb 26, 2019 Please use one of the following formats to cite this article in your essay, paper or report: Patel, HH.

However, nowadays several children suffer from both Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Furthermore, studies have revealed that Ritalin, a central nervous system stimulant, has effective characteristics for controlling symptoms of both ADHD and ADD. Ritalin happens to be an extremely effective medication for ADHD nevertheless, with high abuse potential parental guardians must recognize the benefits in addition to both helpful and harmful side-effects. In today’s society, people utilize Ritalin in an effective way, nevertheless like any other drug when taken incorrectly there are many symptoms and possibility for potential abuse. Ritalin in classified asThe generic name for Ritalin is methylphenidate, a central nervous system stimulant, generally taken to treat those with ADD, ADHD, and narcolepsy (“Ritalin: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects & Warnings,” n.d.). In turn, to completely grasp who would benefit from taking Ritalin, one must first understand the difference and similarities between ADD and ADHD. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a chronic condition that is classified by the following: attention difficulty, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness. Children diagnosed with this condition often lose or forget things, unorganized, difficulty remaining seated, and frequently interrupt others. According to the Journal of Pediatric Pharmacology and Therapeutics, “ADHD is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders in childhood. ADHD can impact not only school performance, but also social interaction. If untreated, this could lead to delinquent behavior” (Briars, 2016, p.2). That being said, noticing this condition early in one’s The reviews all seem to share the same topic that ADHD must remain relevant. The medication may not be for every child, but the question of the safety of the children is. What is ADHD? Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder also known as “ADHD”, is a mental disorder which seems to be a very common childhood brain disorder and the disorder continues through adolescence and adulthood. Children with ADHD have a hard time focusing so paying attention becomes unbearable. Parents must understand that everyone shows signs of ADHD at times, so the DMS (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) has a specific guideline for determining ADHD. (Aschenbrenner, Diane S.) Showing signs of ADHD could mean the child is suffering from chronic fear of mild seizures. If the child has problems in school it could mean one of three things. One is the child actually has ADHD. The child has trouble paying attention and may get frustrated with school. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children Introduction: Most people have heard of the term Attention Deficit Hyperactive (ADHD) disorder. “Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurobiological disorder that interferes with an individual’s ability to attend to tasks (inattention), inhibits one’s behavior (impulsivity), and may interfere with a person’s ability to regulate one’s activity level (hyper-activity) in developmentally appropriate ways (Barkley 19)”. The most important job for teachers and parents is to separate fact from fiction, to clarify what we know and don’t know. Properly diagnosing ADHD, medication choices, and behavioral interventions are the key focal point. Is medication truly worth the side effects? A doctor might also prescribe it to treat depression. Ritalin and other drugs in the stimulant class, work by increasing the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin in the brain. Ritalin has been tested and proven safe to use in children ages six and older. The most popular use of Ritalin is in the treatment of Attention-deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which can affect children as well as adults. It is usually noticeable and brought to light when a child starts school, although it can be diagnosed earlier than this. These are some of the symptoms the medication is supposed to correct, not inflict. One side effect that cannot be medically proven is that Ritalin is being highly abused in schools. ADHD children are taking the drugs with their friends to get ""high"" and have a good time. ADHD could, although not likely, ruin the USA and possibly the world. People need to figure out a cure for ADD and ADHD, and soon, because it affects myriad people across America, and is causing a ton of problems. Children are having an exhausting time focusing in classrooms and adults who have ADD straining themselvs to driving. Who knows, maybe the future cure will help them pay attention and allow them to keep their creativity. So in conclusion we talked about how children get ADD or ADHD, how it affects children, and how it affects adults. There are several warning signs which can indicate the possibility that a child may be affected by the disorder. These include difficulties adhering to instructions, talking a lot, disorganization, leaving homework or other chores unfinished, and having problems paying attention to details or responding (NINDS Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder Information Page, 2011). The fact that the disorder is considerably prevalent and costly has prompted research efforts in finding treatment and management approaches for ADHD. The research into this mental illness has been largely inspired by findings regarding its physiological basis which has paved way for discovering treatment approaches. It is imperative for those taking care of children affected with ADHD to understand the diagnosis, prognosis and phenomenology of ADHD so as to provide quality care for the affected (Sefa, 2007). ADHD affects 8-10% of school-aged children. Research indicates the frontal lobe (basal ganglia, caudate nucleus, cerebellum, and other areas) plays a significant role in ADHD because they are involved in complex processes that regulate behavior. These higher order processes are often called executive functions. Executive functions include processes like inhibition, working memory, planning, self-monitoring, verbal regulation, motor control, maintaining, and changing mental set and emotional regulation. A person with ADHD often feels like they have information bouncing around in the brain.

But, unfortunately, our generation seeks instant gratification, requiring immediate correction when time is of the essence; not wanting to wait it out and see if the children are able to develop in to well-behaved individuals. Again, the children suffer the most. ADHD has dramatically risen in diagnoses, whether it is a true diagnosis remains to be seen.

Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, is an affliction dealing with inattentiveness, impulsiveness, over-activity, or a combination of these traits. For children or adolescents to be diagnosed with ADHD they must be out of the range of normalcy for the child’s peer group. ADHD is a behavioral disorder that affects approximately 3 to 15 percent of school age children. It is estimated that boys are three times more likely than girls to have this disorder based on diagnoses, though the reasons for this are as-yet-unknown. ADHD is the most common behavioral disorder affecting children today and is found among 3 to 5 percent (some sources report 8 to 10 percent or more) of school-aged children. ADHD may run in families but the cause is unknown. It appears to be present as the brain is developing in an early stage, and brain imaging studies are finding that the brains of children with ADHD are different from those of the children who don’t have the disorder. Learning disabilities, depression, behavior difficulties, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and many other problems can be confused with ADHD. A child thought to have this problem should be examined by an expert to figure out exactly what is wrong. Children with ADHD often have other developmental problems, behavioral problems, or psychiatric problems. There are two main groups of symptoms for children with ADHD: Inattentiveness Doesn’t give adequate attention to details or makes careless mistakes Avoids or dislikes activities that require sustained mental focus Hyperactivity Leaves seating when in situations where you’re supposed to remain seated Interrupts or intrudes into otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conversations Many times children are incorrectly diagnosed as ADHD or remain undiagnosed, often leading to other learning disabilities or other mental health problems being missed completely. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) gives the following guidelines to diagnose this problem: Children must display at least six attentive symptoms or six hyperactive or impulsive symptoms, and some symptoms must appear before age 7 Symptoms must last at least six months in 2 settings or more and cannot be a result of another problem Symptoms must be debilitating enough to cause severe difficulties in many settings (school, home, and among peers) For older children, ADHD is considered to be in remission when they still exhibit symptoms but fail to meet the full definition of the problem. A child exhibiting symptoms of ADHD should be given an evaluation by a doctor. Any evaluation must include a questionnaire for parents and teachers, and a psychological evaluation of the child and related family. This evaluation will include IQ testing, psychological testing, and a complete examination of the developmental, mental, nutritional, physical, and psychosocial aspects of all participants. Treating this should be a partnership between the healthcare provider and parents (or caregiver) and the child. For this to work it is very important that you: Determine the appropriate medication for your chilkd Attend regular follow-ups with your child’s doctor that will include input from teachers, family, and the child If treatment is unsuccessful you should make sure the child actually has ADHD. Check medications for alternatives and make sure the treatment plan is being followed or check for other medical conditions that could cause similar problems. It is shown that a combination of medications and behavioral treatment works best. There are several different types of medications available. Psychostimulants are the most commonly used medications. Psychostimulants have a reverse effect on people with ADHD, including a calming effect. These drugs include: Methylphenidate (, Concerta, Metadate, Daytrana) Atomoxetine (Strattera) is a non-psychostimulant that has proven to be effective in treating children with ADHD. Note that some medications can cause death in children with heart problems. Be sure to talk to your doctor first before medicating your child. Therapy is an important component in helping the child and parents understand and control the stress related to this problem. A system of rewards has been shown to be an effective alternative to punishment of a child with ADHD-related behavioral problems. It is also important to handle disruptive behavior appropriately. Keep a consistent schedule for your child’s activities (homework, meals, activities) Set clear rules and boundaries for your child with rewards for good behavior Alternative treatments are popular, including focusing on herbs and supplements as well as chiropractic solutions, but there is little evidence to support that any of these work. ADHD is a long-term, chronic condition that can lead to substance abuse, failure in school, problems at work, and trouble with law enforcement. Call your health care provider immediately if your school’s personnel suspect ADHD because early identification and treatment can avert many problems associated with ADHD.

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children (ADHD in Children) Medical Editor: When Should Someone Seek Medical Care for Childhood ADHD? What Tests Do Specialists Use to Diagnose ADHD in Children? Can ADHD Be Seen in Brain Scans of Children With the Disorder? Can a Preschool-Aged Child Be Diagnosed With ADHD? What Are the Risks of the Use of Stimulant Medication and Other Treatments in Children? What Are Other Forms of Therapy for Children With ADHD? Doctor's Notes on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms (ADHD) refers to a chronic biobehavioral disorder that initially manifests in childhood and is characterized by problems of , impulsivity, and/or inattention. Not all affected individuals manifest all three behavioral categories. These symptoms have been associated with difficulty in academic, emotional, and social functioning. The diagnosis is established by satisfying specific criteria, and the condition may be associated with other neurological conditions, significant behavioral problems (for example, oppositional defiant disorder), and/or developmental/learning disabilities. Therapeutic options included the use of medication, behavioral therapy, and adjustments in day-to-day lifestyle activities. ADHD is one of the more common disorders of childhood. Studies in the United States indicate that approximately 8%-10% of children satisfy the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. ADHD is diagnosed more in boys than girls. While previously believed to be ""outgrown"" by adulthood, current opinion indicates that many children will continue throughout life with symptoms that may affect both occupational and social functioning. Some medical researchers note that approximately 40%-50% of ADHD-hyperactive children will have (typically non-hyperactive) symptoms that persist into adulthood. The medical community recognizes three basic forms of the disorder: Primarily inattentive: recurrent inattentiveness and inability to maintain focus on tasks or activities. In the classroom, this may be the child who is ""spacing out"" and ""can't stay on track."" Primarily hyperactive-impulsive: Impulsive behaviors and inappropriate movement (fidgeting, inability to keep still) or restlessness are the primary problems. Unlike the inattentive ADHD-type child, this individual is more often the ""class clown"" or ""class manifestation leads to recurrent disruptive problems. Combined: This is a combination of the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive forms. The combined type of ADHD is the most common. The predominantly inattentive type is being recognized more and more, especially in girls and in adults. The predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type, without significant attention problems, is rare. We are still learning about ADHD, and experts' understanding of the disorder is still being refined. Some believe, for example, that the term ""attention deficit"" is misleading. They maintain that people with ADHD are actually able to pay attention too well, rather than too little, but have difficulty regulating their attention, leaving them unable to properly focus. Others have trouble ignoring irrelevant details and/or focus so intensely on specific details that they miss the bigger and broader picture. Many ADHD sufferers cannot shift gears from one thing to another when they need to, leaving them unable to focus on what needs to be done. Extreme difficulty getting a child to stop playing a video game to come to dinner is a common example. Contrary to some media accounts, attention disorders are not new. Childhood hyperactivity was a focus of interest in the early 1900s. Today, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention are the focus, but disability related to hyperactivity and distractibility has been alluded to throughout medical history. Historical figures of diverse backgrounds and accomplishment have demonstrated behavior compatible with ADHD. Mozart composed and remembered entire musical compositions but disliked the tedious task and attention to detail necessary when transcribing to paper. Einstein would spend hours and even days sitting quietly in a chair doing ""thought experiments,"" including complex series of mathematical calculations and revisions. Ben Franklin failed in school due to his perfectionist and impulsive behaviors. He later mastered five languages (self-taught) and was highly respected as an author, scientist, inventor, and businessman (publisher). What is new is the greater awareness of ADHD thanks to rapidly mounting research findings. In the United States, ADHD affects about 8%-10% of children. Similar rates are reported in other developed countries such as Germany, New Zealand, and Canada. In most cases, the unusual behaviors are noticed by the time the child is about 7 years old, although ADHD is occasionally diagnosed for the first time in teenagers or young adults. Children with ADHD are often noted to be emotionally delayed, with some individuals having a delay in maturity of up to 30% when compared with their peers. Thus a 10-year-old student may behave like a 7-year-old; a 20-year-old young adult may respond more like a 14-year-old teenager. Boys are more likely than girls to be diagnosed with ADHD. At one time, the ratio of boys to girls with ADHD was thought to be as high as 4:1 or 3:1. This ratio has been decreasing, however, as more is known about ADHD. For instance, greater recognition of the inattentive form of ADHD has increased the number of girls diagnosed with the disorder. People identified with ADHD in adulthood are almost as likely to be women as men, suggesting that we may have been missing the diagnosis in many young girls. Approximately one-quarter of those with ADHD have significant learning disabilities, including problems with oral expression, listening skills, reading comprehension, and mathematics. There is disagreement over whether ADHD persists as children grow into adults. Some believe that most children simply grow out of ADHD. Others believe that ADHD persists into adulthood. About one-third of children with ADHD continue to have the disorder into adulthood. Hyperactive symptoms may decrease with age, usually diminishing at , perhaps because people tend to learn how to gain greater self-control as they mature. Inattention symptoms are less likely to fade with maturity and tend to remain constant into adulthood. As we learn more about ADHD, certain subtypes will likely be found to cause more adult dysfunction than others. People with ADHD are much more likely than the general population to have other related conditions such as learning disorders, , ophthalmic convergence insufficiency, , disorder, antisocial personality disorder, disorder, conduct disorder, and obsessive-compulsive behavior. People with ADHD are also more likely than the general population to have a family member with ADHD or one of the related conditions. The abbreviated term ADHD denotes the condition commonly known as: The pathogenesis (cause) of ADHD has not been totally defined. One theory springs from observations regarding variations in functional brain-imaging studies between those with and without symptoms. Similar variations have been shown in studies of the structure of the brain of affected and unaffected individuals. Animal studies have demonstrated differences in the chemistry of brain transmitters involved with judgment, impulse control, alertness, planning, and mental flexibility. A genetic predisposition has been demonstrated in (identical) twin and sibling studies. If one identical twin is diagnosed with ADHD, there is a 92% probability of the same diagnosis in the twin sibling. When comparing nonidentical twin sibling subjects, the probability falls to 33%. Overall population incidence is felt to be 8%-10%. Genes that control the relative levels of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters seem to be different in ADHD, and levels of these neurotransmitters are out of normal balance. and other imaging studies suggest that these imbalances occur in parts of the brain that control certain types of movement and executive functions. These areas of the brain may be smaller and/or less active in people with ADHD. The six major tasks of executive function that are most commonly distorted with ADHD are the following: Shifting from one mind-set or strategy to another (that is, flexibility) Organization (for example, anticipating both needs and problems) Working memory (that is, receiving, storing, then retrieving information within ) The symptoms of (ADHD) are not physical symptoms such as ear pain or but rather exaggerated or unusual behaviors. The type and severity of symptoms vary greatly among people with ADHD. The severity of symptoms depends on the degree of abnormality in the brain, the presence of related conditions, and the individual's environment and response to that environment. The diagnostic criteria for ADHD are outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health, 5th ed. ( 2013) by the American Psychiatric Association. All of the symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity must have persisted for at least six months to a degree that is maladaptive and inconsistent with the developmental level of the child. Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, work, or other activities Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (not due to oppositional behavior or failure to understand instructions) Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort (such as schoolwork or homework) Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (for example, toys, school assignments, pencils, books, or tools) Often fidgets with hands or or squirms in seat Often leaves seat in classroom or in other situations in which remaining seated is expected Often runs about or climbs excessively in situations in which it is inappropriate Often has difficulty playing or engaging in leisure activities quietly Often blurts out answers before questions have been completed Often interrupts or intrudes on others (for example, butts into conversations or games) In addition, some hyperactive, impulsive, or inattention symptoms that cause present difficulties were present before 7 years of age and are present in two or more settings (at school [or work] or at home). There must be clear evidence of significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning, and the symptoms are not entirely caused by another severe physical disorder (for example, severe illness associated with ) or mental disorder (for example, , other psychotic disorders, severe disabling mood disorders, etc.). Inattention symptoms are most likely to manifest at about 8 to 9 years of age and commonly are lifelong in duration. The delay in onset of inattentive symptoms may reflect its more subtle nature (versus hyperactivity) and/or variability in the maturation of cognitive development. Hyperactivity symptoms are usually obvious by 5 years of age and peak in severity between 7-8 years of age. With maturation, these behaviors progressively decline and generally have been ""outgrown"" by adolescence. Impulsive behaviors are commonly linked to hyperactivity and also peak at about 7-8 years of age; however, unlike their hyperactive counterpart, impulsivity issues remain well into adulthood. Impulsive adolescents are more likely to experiment with high-risk behaviors (drugs, sexual behavior, driving, etc.). Impulsive adults have a higher rate of financial mismanagement (impulse buying, gambling, etc.). Many children without ADHD may also demonstrate one or more of these behaviors. However, the difference between these children and the child with ADHD is that the behaviors are disruptive, are considered inappropriate for the child's developmental stage, persist for months or years, and occur both at home and at school. A child with ADHD almost never exhibits all of the symptoms, but the symptoms that are present appreciably hinder the child's social, psychological, and/or educational development. The behaviors of ADHD can mimic mood disorders (for example, or ), anxiety, or personality disorder. Those conditions must be ruled out or adequately treated before a definitive diagnosis of ADHD can be made. When Should Someone Seek Medical Care for Childhood ADHD? A school-age child may need evaluation for ADHD if he or she exhibits any of the following behaviors: Has shorter attention span than peers and needs frequent teacher intervention to keep on task. Parents will often report the need for constant surveillance during homework. Daydreams excessively while supposed to be completing tasks Disrupts classroom by leaving seat, moving around room, talking inappropriately, and/or engaging others in play Provokes daily arguments at home about completing homework and chores Evaluation and treatment of a child with ADHD can generally be handled by the child's pediatrician. A thorough history and complete physical exam are prerequisite to establishing the correct diagnosis. Should educational testing be indicated, this may be done utilizing an educational psychologist via the school district or by private means. Some children with ADHD have associated complicating medical or behavioral health issues (for example, , , etc.) and specialty evaluation may be indicated. Such specialists would include a pediatric neurologist, pediatric psychologist, or psychiatrist. What Tests Do Specialists Use to Diagnose ADHD in Children? The evaluation of a child suspected of having ADHD is multidisciplinary, involving comprehensive medical, developmental, educational, and psychosocial evaluations. Interviewing parents and the patient along with contact with the patient's teacher(s) is crucial. Investigation regarding the family history for behavioral and/or social problems is helpful. While direct person-to-person contact is considered vital at the outset of an investigation, follow-up studies may be guided by comparing standardized questionnaires (from parents and teachers) completed prior to intervention and subsequent to medication, behavioral therapy, or other treatment approaches. While there is no unique finding on the physical exam in patients with ADHD, unusual physical features should prompt consideration of consultation with a geneticist due to the high association with ADHD behavioral patterns and well-recognized genetic syndromes (for example, ). At this time, no lab test, X-ray, imaging study, or procedure is known to suggest or confirm the diagnosis of ADHD. Specific tests may be ordered if indicated by specific symptoms. Physicians and parents should be aware that schools are federally mandated to perform an appropriate evaluation if a child is suspected of having a disability that impairs academic functioning. This policy was strengthened by regulations implementing the 1997 reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Act (IDEA), which guarantees appropriate services and a free, appropriate public education to children with disabilities from ages 3 to 21. If the assessment performed by the school is inadequate or inappropriate, parents may request that an independent evaluation be conducted at the school's expense. Furthermore, some children with ADHD qualify for special-education services within the public schools, under the category of ""Other Health Impaired,"" although not all children with an established diagnosis of ADHD will qualify for special services based upon school district testing. If a child is deemed in need of special services, the special-education teacher, school psychologist, school administrators, classroom teachers, along with parents, must assess the child's strengths and weaknesses and design an Individualized Education Program (IEP). These special-education services for some children with ADHD are available through IDEA. Despite this ""federal mandate,"" the reality is that many school districts, because of underfunding or understaffing, are unable to perform an ""appropriate evaluation"" for all children suspected of having ADHD. The districts have the latitude to define the degree of ""impairment of academic functioning"" necessary to approve ""appropriate evaluation."" This usually means the children who are failing or near-failing in their academic performance. A very large segment of the ADHD-affected children will be ""getting by"" (not failing) academically (at least in their early years of school), but they are usually achieving well below their potential and getting more and more behind each year on the academic prerequisite skills necessary for later school success. Thereafter, further educational testing may be requested from the school district. Unfortunately, some families will have to assume the financial burden of an independent educational evaluation. These evaluations are commonly done by an educational psychologist and may involve approximately eight to 10 hours of testing and observation spread out over several sessions. A primary goal of an educational evaluation is to exclude/include the possibility of learning disorders (for example, dyslexia, language disorders, etc.). Research has shown that ADHD does seem to cluster in families. Several investigations have demonstrated that children who have ADHD usually have a least one close relative (child or adult) who also has ADHD. At least one-third of all fathers who have ADHD will produce a child with ADHD. With the newer realization that adults may also experience ADHD symptoms, it is not unusual to have a parent's ""problem at my job"" be credited to ADHD -- often at the same time that their child's diagnosis is being established! Lastly, several studies have demonstrated a number of genes that may reflect a role in altered brain neurochemistry that provides a physiologic basis for this disorder and inheritance pattern. No one knows for sure whether the prevalence of ADHD per se has risen, but it is very clear that the number of children identified with the disorder and who obtain treatment has risen over the past decade. Some of this increased identification and increased treatment-seeking is due in part to greater media interest, heightened consumer awareness, and the availability of effective treatments. Teachers are better trained to recognize the condition and suggest that the family seek help, especially in the more mild to moderate cases. The condition itself is so much more clearly defined and more concisely diagnosed now. The diagnosis of ADHD is also less of a social stigma than in the past. This more enlightened perspective reflects the understanding that ADHD is a biochemical disorder and not merely an ""out of control child."" As such, more parents are receptive to medical therapy for the condition rather than resorting to less effective home/school discipline techniques. Interestingly, the increase in prevalence of ADHD is not solely an American phenomenon but has been noted also in other countries. Whether the number of patients with ADHD has truly increased or rather our better recognition and acceptance of ADHD as a diagnosis has ""increased"" remains to be further defined. Can ADHD Be Seen in Brain Scans of Children With the Disorder? Neuroimaging research has shown that the brains of children with ADHD differ fairly consistently from those of children without the disorder in that several brain regions and structures tend to be smaller. There is also a lack of expected symmetry between the right and left brain hemispheres. Overall, brain size is generally 5% smaller in affected children than children without ADHD. While this average difference is observed consistently, it is too small to be useful in making the diagnosis of ADHD in a particular individual. In addition, there appears to be a link between a person's ability to pay continued attention and measures that reflect brain activity. In people with ADHD, the brain areas that control attention appear to be less active, suggesting that a lower level of activity in some parts of the brain may be related to difficulties sustaining attention. It is important to reiterate that these laboratory observations are not yet sufficiently sensitive or specific enough to use to establish or confirm the diagnosis of ADHD or to monitor the effectiveness of treatment. Can a Preschool-Aged Child Be Diagnosed With ADHD? The diagnosis of ADHD in the preschool-aged (under 5 years old) child is possible, but it can be difficult and should be made cautiously by experts well trained in childhood neurobehavioral disorders. A variety of physical problems, emotional problems, developmental problems (especially language delays), and adjustment problems can sometimes imitate ADHD in this age group. It is certainly not mandatory that the preschool-aged child showing ADHD-suggestive symptoms be placed in a preschool. The first line of therapy for children of this age showing ADHD-like symptoms is not stimulant medication therapy but rather environmental or behavioral therapy. This type of therapy can be carried out in the home with appropriate training supplied to the parents. If the child is to be placed in a preschool, the caretakers must be equally trained in the techniques of behavioral therapy. Stimulant therapy can reduce oppositional behavior and improve mother-child interaction, but it is usually reserved for severe cases or used when a child does not respond to environmental or behavioral interventions. The two major components of treatment for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are behavioral therapy and medication. Home and school interventions: Parents can help their child's behavior with specific goals such as: (1) maintaining a daily schedule, (2) keeping distractions to a minimum, (3) setting small and reasonable goals, (4) rewarding positive behavior, (5) using charts and checklists to keep a child ""on task,"" and (6) finding activities in which the child will succeed (sports, hobbies). Children with ADHD may require adjustments in the structure of their educational experience, including tutorial assistance and the use of a resource room. Many children function well throughout the entire school day with their peers. However, some patients with ADHD will benefit from a ""pull-out session"" to complete tasks, review specific homework assignments, and develop ""management"" skills necessary for higher education. Extended time for class work/tests may be necessary as well as assignments written on the board and preferential seating near the teacher. If necessary, an IEP (Individualized Educational Program) should be developed and reviewed periodically with the parents. ADHD is considered a disability falling under U.S. Public Law 101-476 (Individuals With Disabilities Education Act or IDEA). As such, individuals with ADHD may qualify for ""appropriate accommodations within the regular classroom"" within the public-school system. In addition, the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) indicates that secular private schools may be required to provide similar ""appropriate accommodations"" in their institution. Psychotherapy: ADHD coaching, a support group, or both can help teens feel more normal and provide well-focused peer feedback and coping skills. Counselors such as psychologists, child and adolescent psychiatrists, behavioral/developmental pediatricians, clinical social workers, and advanced practice nurses can be invaluable to both the children and families. Behavior modification and family therapy are usually necessary for the best possible outcome. The medications used to treat ADHD are psychoactive. This means they affect the chemistry, and thus the functioning, of the brain. Psychostimulants are by far the most widely used medications in treating ADHD. When used appropriately, approximately 80% of individuals with ADHD show a very good to excellent response in reduction of symptoms. These medications stimulate and increase activity of areas of the brain with neurotransmitter imbalances. The exact mechanism of how these drugs relieve symptoms in ADHD is unknown, but these medicines are linked to increases in brain levels of the neurotransmitters and . Low levels of these neurotransmitters are linked to ADHD. The most common adverse effects occur over the short term. They include loss of appetite, disturbances, rebound (for example, agitation, anger, lethargy as the last dose starts to wear off), and mild anxiety. Most individuals who take psychostimulants for ADHD build up tolerance to adverse effects within a few weeks. Individuals with certain coexistent psychiatric disorders (for example, psychosis, , some disorders of anxiety or ) are particularly vulnerable to adverse effects if they do not receive appropriate concurrent treatment for the coexistent condition. The psychostimulants most often used in ADHD include the following: (, , Quillivant XR, , , ) () is a non-stimulant used to treat ADHD. This medication has been used for fewer years than the stimulants, and less is known about its long-term side effects. This drug has several benefits over stimulants, but its use may also carry several negative aspects. It is not a controlled substance and is not considered a drug of potential abuse by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Since it is not a controlled substance, pharmacies may accept phone-requested medical refills. It is usually taken only once a day for full 24-hour effectiveness. It is much less likely than stimulants to disrupt eating or sleeping. For some children, atomoxetine is not enough to control their ADHD symptoms. Many other children do very well on this medicine alone. Specialists treating individuals with ADHD have found Strattera seems to best help improve the problems associated with a disruption in executive function skills. Inattention and hyperactivity symptoms are less responsive. When starting Strattera therapy, a gradually increasing dosage schedule is recommended. It may take up to three weeks before full therapeutic benefit is achieved. For this reason, patients may need to remain on previously prescribed stimulant medication during the ""build up"" phase. In addition, Strattera must be taken daily; short-term ""medication holidays"" (for example, school vacations and weekends) will limit Strattera's efficacy. Studies have indicated a higher than expected incidence of ideation during early treatment. This occurred in patients with pure ADHD as well as in those patients with ADHD accompanied by other emotional disorders (for example, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder). Some medications originally developed to treat depression () also have important roles in treating some individuals with ADHD. Since these medicines have been used for many years to treat other mental-health conditions, their adverse effects are well understood. (): an that increases levels of neurotransmitters norepinephrine and/or in the brain (): an antidepressant that increases levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, especially dopamine (): an antidepressant that increases levels of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine in the brain Other medicines that were originally developed to treat (alpha agonists) may also be useful in the treatment of those having ADHD. Again, due to widespread and long-term use, their side effects are well known to doctors. Clonidine (): an alpha-2 agonist that stimulates certain receptors in the brain stem; the overall effect is to ""turn down the volume"" of hyperactive movement and speech (, ): Recently, the U.S. FDA has licensed the use of guanfacine as a non-stimulant medication effective in treating ADHD when used in conjunction with other stimulant medications. It is not felt to be nearly as effective when used as a sole agent. Both a short-term preparation (Tenex) and a long-term preparation (Intuniv) are available. Unfortunately, 18% of Intuniv users discontinued use of their medication due to side effects, including drowsiness (35%), (25%), and (14%). What Are the Risks of the Use of Stimulant Medication and Other Treatments in Children? Stimulant medications have been successfully used to treat patients with ADHD for more than 50 years. This class of medication, when used under proper medical supervision, has an excellent safety record in patients with ADHD. In general, the side effects of the stimulant class of medications are mild, often transient over time, and reversible with adjustment in dosage amount or interval of administration. The incidence of side effects is highest when administered to preschool-aged children. Common side effects include appetite suppression, disturbances, and . Less common side effects include an increase in heart rate/, , and emotional changes (social withdrawal, nervousness, and moodiness). Patients treated with the methylphenidate patch (Daytrana) may develop a skin sensitization at the site of application. Approximately 15%-30% of children treated with stimulant medications develop minor motor tics (involuntary rapid twitching of facial and/or neck and shoulder muscles). These are almost always short lived and resolve without stopping the use of medication. A recent investigation studied the possibility of stimulant medication used to treat ADHD and cardiovascular side effects. Concern focused on a possible association with , heart rate and rhythm disturbances, and . At this time, there is no certainty in a proposed relationship to these events (including sudden death) when medication is used in a pediatric population screened for prior cardiovascular symptoms or structural pathology of the heart. A positive family history for certain conditions (for example, unusual heart rhythm patterns) may be considered a risk factor. The current position of the American Academy of Pediatrics is that a screening is not indicated before the initiation of stimulant medication in a patient without risk factors. ""Diversion"" is the transfer of medication from the patient for whom it was prescribed to another individual. Several large studies have indicated that 5%-9% of grade and high school students and 5%-35% of college-aged individuals reported use of non-prescribed stimulant medication, and 16%-29% of students for whom stimulant medications were prescribed reported being approached to give, trade, or sell their medication. Misuse was more frequently seen in whites, members of fraternities and sororities, and students with a lower GPA. Diversion was more likely with the short-acting preparations. The most common reasons cited for use of non-prescribed stimulants were ""helped with studying,"" improved alertness, drug experimentation, and ""getting high."" ADHD is a controversial diagnosis for several reasons. Many well-meaning individuals have spoken out against making children behave according to a norm or taking medications for the sake of improving grades. These individuals have expressed concern about or drugging children. This kind of concern is valid; however, the following must also be considered. The negative consequences of not using medication for children with ADHD have to be weighed against the known risks. Long-term outcome studies have now been conducted with large numbers of adults diagnosed with ADHD as children, and one clear finding is that those who received medication for their disorder in childhood are more functional and have a better quality of life as adults than those who had the symptoms of the disease but did not receive medicine. Stimulants used for ADHD do not cause addiction. Although tolerance usually develops for the stimulant-associated effects of , , or mild , tolerance does not develop to the increased levels of neurotransmitters. These medications should not be used just to improve grades or quiet down classrooms. School performance should be looked at as a sign of how well the child is doing, just like other areas of health. These medications often improve school performance dramatically, which is linked to better social skills and heightened self-esteem. But grades should be a marker, not a goal. Studies that have examined whether taking a psychostimulant for ADHD in childhood contributes to future substance abuse have shown this to not be the case. In fact, in one very large study, children who received stimulant medication for ADHD had half the risk of future substance abuse of similar children with ADHD who did not receive medication. The use of psychostimulants in children should be scrutinized carefully. Fortunately, methylphenidate (Ritalin [and its long active formulation, Concerta], historically the most widely prescribed medication for ADHD) has been available for many years. This long period of clinical experience has shown that this is one of the safest medications used in children. What Are Other Forms of Therapy for Children With ADHD? No specific food or has been clearly shown to have a significant positive or negative effect on the symptoms or course of ADHD. People with ADHD should eat a healthy diet and probably avoid . That having been said, if the family's experience with a person having ADHD is that some sort of dietary change, such as decreased refined intake, helps, then if the person is not deprived of necessary nutrients, there is certainly no harm in trying to follow such a plan. A good rule of thumb is to discuss the plan with the family doctor or whoever is providing the primary treatment for the ADHD symptoms. Regular physical activity has been shown to play an important role in some of the common related conditions (for example, depression, anxiety) and to improve concentration. Regular may be beneficial in people with ADHD. Several studies on children with ADHD not taking medication have shown an improvement in concentration and reduction in inattentive and hyperactive behaviors if one hour of vigorous after-school play occurs before starting homework. CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) therapies are considered and/or tried in over half of patients with ADHD. Many times these modalities are used covertly and it is important for the treating physician to inquire about CAM to encourage open communication and review the risks versus benefits of such an approach. CAM treatment modalities incorporating vision training, and megavitamin therapy, herbal and , biofeedback, and applied kinesiology have all been advocated. The benefits of these approaches, however, have not been confirmed in double-blinded controlled studies. Families should be aware that such programs might require a long-term financial commitment that may not have insurance reimbursement as an option. Recent research on the benefits of specific polyunsaturated (EPA and DHA) supplementation has demonstrated a therapeutic benefit in several well-designed studies. Further research in this area will hopefully shed light on how these work. The primary-care provider, behavioral pediatrician, or child and adolescent psychiatrist will want to see the caregiver and the child often at first to monitor progress and response to therapy. Once the individual's condition is stabilized, follow-up visits will be regular but less frequent. The frequency of follow-up visits is quite variable and is dictated by the person's characteristics and convenience, provider experience, and use of psychotherapy. Follow-up visits every four to 12 weeks are often appropriate for the first year. After that, visits every three to four months for medication assessment may be adequate for a person whose condition is stable. Behavioral therapy may need to be ongoing for months or years. Federal and state laws grant special educational accommodations for children with ADHD and learning disabilities. Local school districts and regional/state departments of education can provide specific resources available in the local community. No clear methods for preventing ADHD are currently known. While some people have suggested that certain diets, teaching or methods, or other approaches may keep ADHD from developing, unfortunately, none of these approaches has stood up to rigorous scientific testing so far. On the other hand, once the symptoms have begun and careful assessment has produced an ADHD diagnosis, various specific behavioral and learning techniques can be used by teachers and family to help get symptoms under better control. These should be discussed with the treating doctor so that the right interventions can be applied for the specific person. Literature supports the clinical observation that 40%-50% of children with ADHD will have symptoms persist into adulthood. One caveat needs to be studies previously conducted focused on a patient population of males who were evaluated or treated by psychiatrists/psychologists or in clinics specially developed for such a patient population. The value of generalizing these results to the entire patient population with ADHD should be done with caution. Fortunately, new studies are being conducted to address this issue. Education: Follow-up studies of children with ADHD growing into adolescence showed impairment of academic success. A few studies into adulthood have demonstrated persistence of these findings. Completion of expected schooling, lower achievement scores, and failure of courses are areas of concern. Employment: The rate of adult employment of those with and without a diagnosis of ADHD did not vary; however, those with ADHD did have occupations with a lower ""job status."" Socialization issues: As noted above, a significant subset of children with ADHD has accompanying disruptive behavior disorders (oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, ODD and CD). In studies that followed children with ADHD into adulthood, between 12%-23% have socialization problems, versus 2%-3% of the general population. Substance abuse: Studies examining whether those with ADHD have a higher likelihood for such high-risk behaviors are controversial. The largest study to date supports other smaller studies that indicate ADHD patients who consistently take their medication have twice the likelihood of not using drugs or excessive . Driving: A teen with ADHD is two to four times more likely to have a motor-vehicle accident or have his/her license suspended than a peer without such a diagnosis. Impulsivity and inattention again seem to be limited when at-risk teens consistently take their recommended medication. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), whether it affects an adult or a child, brings many challenges. People with ADHD can learn, achieve, succeed, and create a happy life for themselves with effort. But making changes is not always easy. Sometimes it helps to have someone to talk to. This is the purpose of support groups. Support groups consist of people in the same situation. They come together to help each other and to help themselves. Support groups provide reassurance, motivation, and inspiration. They help individuals see that their situation is not unique and not hopeless, and that gives them power. They also provide practical tips on coping with ADHD and navigating the medical, educational, and social systems that people will rely on for help for themselves or their child. Being in an ADHD support group is strongly recommended by most mental-health professionals. Support groups meet in person, on the telephone, or on the Internet. To find a support group that works for you, contact the following organizations. You can also ask a health-care professional, behavioral therapist, education specialist, or look on the Internet. 800-939-1019 Children and Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder800-233-4050 Federation of Families for Children's Mental Health703-684-7710 412-341-1515 Attention Deficit Disorder AssociationPO Box 7557Wilmington DE 19803800-939-1019 Children and Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD)8181 Professional Place, Suite 150Landover, MD 20785800-233-4050 Learning Disabilities Association of America4156 Library RdPittsburgh, PA 15234-1349412-341-1515 National Center for Learning Disabilities381 Park Avenue South, Suite 1401New York, NY 10016888-575-7373 National Dissemination Center for Children With Disabilities (NICHCY)PO Box 1492Washington, DC 20013800-695-0285 6001 Executive BoulevardBethesda, MD 20892-9663866-615-6464 Work together as a team.

(Dotdash) — All rights reserved Akeem Marsh, MD, is a board-certified child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist who has dedicated his career to working with medically underserved communities. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurobehavioral condition that is usually first diagnosed during childhood. More than six million children between the ages of two and 17 have been diagnosed with ADHD.﻿ It is characterized by patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that make it difficult for people to pay attention and control their behaviors. ADHD is a lifelong condition. While symptoms do change with time, they can still interfere with an adult's functioning. Relationships, health, work, and finances are just a few areas that may be impacted. There are treatment options, including medications and therapies, as well as coping strategies that can help you to live well with ADHD. The exact causes of ADHD are not known but experts believe there are a number of factors at play. Genetics are thought to play a significant role in causing ADHD, but environmental factors also contribute and often interact with genetic predispositions. Factors that can increase the risk of ADHD include certain illnesses such as meningitis, exposure to toxins such as lead, and poor nutrition or substance use during pregnancy. There is no simple lab test or questionnaire that can determine if a person has ADHD. Mental health professionals conduct an evaluation and can use a variety of tools including IQ tests, interviews, measures of attention, rating scales, and other assessments to evaluate symptoms and determine if they meet the criteria for diagnosis. ADHD is classified as a mental illness, but can also be described as a neurodevelopmental disorder. It is important to recognize that mental illness is a broad term that refers to any type of condition that impacts a person's thoughts, moods, or behaviors. Because the three primary symptoms of ADHD—inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity—all impact these areas, ADHD is considered a form of mental illness. There is a strong genetic component to ADHD. Estimates suggest that the genetic heritability of the condition is over 70%. However, having a genetic predisposition does not necessarily mean that you will develop ADHD. Research has found that there are several genes that play a role and it is the interaction of these genes along with environmental influences that may cause the disorder. ADHD may be considered a disability according to the guidelines established by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) if you have impairments that limit one or more major life activities (such as work or school). There must be a record of this impairment or others must be able to perceive these challenges. This means some people who have ADHD may request accommodations at work or school. ADHD has gone through several name changes over the years and one of these former names was attention deficit disorder (ADD). While the term no longer represents an official diagnosis, it is still sometimes used to describe the inattentive presentation of the condition without hyperactivity. People with this presentation of the condition have trouble staying on task. Neurobehavioral disorders are a group of conditions that involve behavioral issues that accompany brain-related conditions or injuries. ADHD is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders to affect children.﻿ Other examples include autism spectrum disorder and traumatic brain injury. Behavior therapy utilizes techniques such as conditioning and reinforcement to teach desired behaviors and eliminate unwanted ones. For children with ADHD, this approach can often help improve behavior and self-control. Techniques used in behavior therapy include praising or rewarding good behavior and allowing people to experience the logical consequences of negative behaviors. Impulsive behaviors are those that are poorly planned, risky, premature, and sometimes inappropriate for the situation. Such behaviors can seem unpredictable and, because they are not well-conceived, can lead to poor outcomes. Impulsivity is a symptom of ADHD that is often caused by an inability to focus and control behaviors. This presentation of ADHD is characterized by difficulties with attention and focus. Symptoms include having trouble focusing, not paying attention to details, difficulty organizing tasks, being easily distracted, not following instructions, forgetting to do routine things, avoiding activities that require sustained focus, frequently losing things, and not listening to what others are saying.﻿ This presentation of ADHD is marked by hyperactive and impulsive behaviors without the symptoms of inattention. Symptoms often include moving constantly, squirming, fidgeting, and talking excessively. People with this presentation struggle to stay seated, move on to new tasks without finishing previous ones, interrupt others, and blurt out things without thinking.﻿ In this presentation of ADHD, people exhibit symptoms of both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Symptoms include trouble focusing on tasks, fidgeting, talking excessively, and saying things without thinking. Children and adults may be diagnosed with a combined presentation if they experience six or more symptoms of inattention and six or more symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity.

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Teens Medical Author: Medical Editor: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Teens Facts What Are Causes and Risk Factors for ADHD in Teens? How Do ADHD Symptoms Differ in Teen Boys and Girls? What Do Doctors Use to Diagnose ADHD in Teens? Are There Home Remedies for ADHD in Teens (Dietary Modification)? What Are Complications of ADHD in Teens? Is It Possible to Prevent Teen ADHD? What Is the Prognosis of Teen ADHD? Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Teens Topic Guide Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Teens Facts () is a behavior disorder that is characterized by or restlessness, impulsivity, and/or distractibility that interfere with the person's life in some way. While there is no single cause of ADHD, there are many factors that increase the risk of developing the disorder. Symptoms of ADHD in teens tend to be somewhat different compared to the disorder in younger children or in adults. There can be some differences between teenage boys and girls in their symptoms of ADHD. If a medical or mental-health professional suspects that a teen has ADHD, he or she will likely undergo an extensive medical interview and physical examination. Treatment of ADHD usually involves some combination of organizational and/or educational changes, psychotherapy, and/or medication. It is important for the ADHD teen and his or her family to work closely with the prescribing doctor to decide whether treatment with medications is an appropriate intervention. Monitoring for effectiveness and potential side effects of medications is also essential. There are many possible complications associated with ADHD, particularly if it remains untreated. ADHD usually requires treatment for it to be adequately managed. There are many support groups for people who suffer from ADHD. (ADHD) is a behavioral disorder that involves abnormal thought processing. The symptoms of this disorder have been described in the known medical literature for at least the past 200 years. It is characterized by problems focusing, sitting still, and/or controlling impulses. It can have a significantly negative impact on the sufferer's ability to make and keep friends and other relationships and do well in high school, at work, and/or the community in general. Low self-esteem is a common side effect of the behaviors displayed by a teen with ADHD. ADHD is understood as either one of three types: the primarily inattentive type, the primarily impulsive/hyperactive type, and the combined type. The primarily inattentive type is characterized by the person having great difficulty listening, focusing, organizing his or herself, and completing tasks. A teen with the inattentive version of ADHD generally does not have a significant problem managing their impulses or activity level. The primarily impulsive/hyperactive type of ADHD tends to result in the opposite set of symptoms compared to the inattentive type. Such a patient will have significant attention problems since he/she has great trouble sitting still, waiting their turn to talk, and managing their impulses. The individual who has the combined type of ADHD struggles with some aspects of inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity. What Are Causes and Risk Factors for ADHD in Teens? ADHD is quite common. Among school-aged children, this disorder has been found to occur from 2%-20%, translating to 4.5 million children 3-17 years of age. While boys are still thought to develop this illness more often than girls, improved assessment of girls has resulted in the gender gap in diagnosis being significantly less than in years past. While there is no single known cause of ADHD, boys tend to develop this condition a bit more often than girls, and young people who have one or both parents with the disorder are more likely to develop it. Children who have ADHD are at risk for becoming teenagers and adults with the condition. A child whose mother suffers from , smoked cigarettes, or used other drugs or whose parents have lower levels of education are more at risk for having ADHD. Other risk factors for developing ADHD include the person's mother having medical problems and to the abdomen during their . There is some birth order research that supports the theory that first-born children tend to have a higher likelihood of developing ADHD compared to their siblings. Common symptoms and signs of ADHD can include the following: Trouble paying close attention or making careless mistakes Does not seem to be listening when directly spoken to Avoids or fails to follow through on instructions or to finish tasks (including homework) Often avoids or dislikes tasks that require sustained attention Frequently loses things needed to perform tasks or activities Has trouble staying seated when doing so is necessary or expected Often blurts out answers or interrupts others impulsively Frequently has trouble waiting his or her turn during activities While symptoms of hyperactivity in people with ADHD tend to decrease with age, most of the differences in symptoms of this disorder in adolescents compared to children and adults have much to do with the tasks that tweens and teens are called on to do at this stage of their lives. For example, teens with ADHD tend to show lower grade point averages, lower levels of class placement (for example, remedial versus honors or advanced placement), and higher rates of course failure. Also, teens with this diagnosis tend to complete and turn in a much lower percentage of in-class and homework assignments and are much less likely to be working up to their potential. Adolescents with ADHD are significantly more likely to be absent or tardy from school, and they can be over eight times more likely than adolescents without ADHD to drop out of high school. ADHD teens tend to be more impulsive drivers and have more accidents due to risky behaviors. Research has also shown that ADHD teens have more difficulty making and keeping well-adjusted friends. Unfortunately, in the face of the unique and significant impact that ADHD can have on their lives, teens tend to be the least willing to receive treatment compared to their younger and older counterparts. Research shows that adolescents are often more likely to have a negative perception of treatment and to be more likely to expect to have a bad experience as a result of ADHD treatment. is more common in teens with ADHD than their peer non-ADHD population. The abbreviated term ADHD denotes the condition commonly known as: How Do ADHD Symptoms Differ in Teen Boys and Girls? Studies indicate that the symptoms of ADHD look different at times in teenage boys and girls. Specifically, girls tend to develop and be diagnosed with the disorder at later ages. Above preschool age, girls tend to exhibit inattention more often than impulsive and hyperactive symptoms and overall have more subtle symptoms. Girls also seem to be more at risk for also developing internalizing mental-health problems like , , and suicidal behaviors compared to boys. Interestingly, boys of preschool age with ADHD tend to have less deviant, less severe symptoms compared to preschool girls with ADHD. What Do Doctors Use to Diagnose ADHD in Teens? Many health-care professionals may help diagnose and treat individuals with ADHD: licensed mental-health therapists, pediatricians, family physicians, or other primary-care professionals, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, licensed counselors, and social workers. If one of these professionals suspects that a teen has ADHD, he or she will likely undergo an extensive medical interview and physical examination. As part of this examination, the teen may be asked a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help assess the risk of ADHD. Symptoms of ADHD may be associated with a number of other medical or mental-health conditions or can be a side effect of various medications. For example, teens with ADHD, , or may all suffer from significant irritability. Therefore, routine laboratory tests are often performed during the initial evaluation to rule out other causes of symptoms. Occasionally, an X-ray, scan, or other imaging study may be needed. Well-recognized diagnostic criteria for ADHD are as follows: Six or more symptoms of inattention that last for at least six months, is not adaptive, and not consistent with the sufferer's developmental level Six or more symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity for at least six months, is not adaptive, inconsistent with the sufferer's developmental level, and not solely symptoms of oppositional disorder, defiance, irritability, or trouble understanding the task or associated instructions Some of the above symptoms that caused problems occurred before 7 years of age Several of the symptoms take place in at least two settings (for example, school, home, work, with friends, relatives, other activities) Clear clinically significant problems in social, academic, or occupational functioning ADHD symptoms do not only occur as part of , or other psychotic disorder, and are not better explained by another mental-health disorder. There are a variety of treatments available for managing ADHD during adolescence, including several effective treatment medications, educational or vocational interventions, nutritional interventions, as well as specific forms of psychotherapy. Are There Home Remedies for ADHD in Teens (Dietary Modification)? For individuals who may be wondering how to manage the symptoms of ADHD using treatment without prescribed medications, nutritional interventions are sometimes used. While treatment such as limiting exposure to food additives, preservatives, and processed sugars in the teen's have been found to be helpful for some people with some ADHD, the research data is still considered to be too limited for many physicians to recommend nutritional interventions. Also, placing such restrictions on the eating habits of a teenager can prove to be nearly impossible and set up a power struggle for the individual with ADHD and his or her parents and other caretakers. One natural remedy called phosphatidylserine (Vayarin) is being increasingly seen as a potentially effective treatment of ADHD. Vayarin is a prescription nutritional supplement that consists of and is thought to work by increasing what is thought to be a deficit in in the brains of many individuals with ADHD. There is some research that supports its use as an alternate to current standard therapy. However, a recent review of the literature did not fully support that finding. Medical management of ADHD in teens may involve medications, educational or vocational interventions, psychotherapy, or some combination of these. Medications in the stimulant class are known to be quite effective for treating ADHD. Examples of stimulant medications used to treat this condition include short-acting medications like () and (), intermediate-acting medications like amphetamine ( and Adderall-XR), and long-acting stimulants like methylphenidate slow release (, ), dexmethylphenidate (Focalin-XR), and (). A long-acting dextroamphetamine () is also available. However, for some individuals, the side effects of the medication prevent these medications from being appropriate. Therefore, specific nonstimulant medications, which are also approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for effective treatment of ADHD, are prescribed for those individuals. Examples of nonstimulant medications include (), ( or ), and clonidine (Kapvay). Medications that are often used to treat depression, like () and (), can also be helpful in the treatment of ADHD for some individuals. As anything that is ingested carries a risk of side effects, it is important for the ADHD patient and his or her family to work closely with the prescribing doctor to decide whether treatment with medications is an appropriate intervention and, if so, which medication should be administered. The kinds of side effects caused by a medication are highly specific to which medication it is and to the group of medications it is in. The person being treated should therefore discuss potential medications with their treating physician and be closely monitored for the possibility of side effects that can vary from minor to severe, and can very rarely even be life-threatening. The behavioral, educational/vocational, and psychotherapy components of treatment for ADHD are at least as important as the medication treatment. Dealing with the specific challenges that teens with ADHD present takes patience, understanding, and a balance of structure and flexibility. Knowing that the brains of people with ADHD tend to be about three years less mature than those of people without the disorder can go a long way in terms of learning how to handle ADHD teenagers at home or in the classroom. For example, the delay in brain maturation often results in teens with ADHD having trouble processing information and recalling information in a timely way. That often translates into challenges with tasks like writing essays or test questions, completing multistep math problems, recalling what is read, and finishing long-term assignments. Teachers and schools who are savvy at working with teens who suffer from ADHD often use techniques like physical and visual teaching materials, memory games, frequent breaks, and strategic seating to help the adolescent with this issue achieve their highest academic potential on a daily basis. Another kind of psychotherapy used to treat ADHD is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Behavior therapy seeks to help those with this condition identify and decrease the irrational thoughts and behaviors that reinforce maladaptive behaviors and can be administered either individually or in . CBT that seeks to help the ADHD sufferer decrease the tendency to pay excessive attention to potential threats has also been found to be helpful, particularly for teens who have or depression in addition to ADHD. Behavioral techniques that are often used to decrease ADHD involve the parents, teachers, and other adult caretakers understanding the circumstances surrounding both positive and negative behaviors and how each kind of behavior is encouraged and discouraged. Specifically, learning when and where specific behaviors occur can go a long way toward understanding how to encourage the behavior happening again if it's positive or extinguishing it if the behavior is negative. Being aware of how the reactions of others contribute to a behavior's continuing or not continuing tend to help the teen with ADHD shape their behaviors more positively. Also, developing a fair and effective repertoire of ways to encourage positive behaviors and provide consequences for negative behaviors is a key component of any behavior management plan and therefore in adolescents with ADHD. Often, a combination of medication and nonmedication interventions produces good results. Depending on the course of treatment deemed most appropriate, improvement may be noticed in a fairly short period of time, from two to three weeks to two to three months. Thus, appropriate treatment for ADHD can relieve symptoms or at least substantially reduce their severity and frequency, bringing significant relief to many people with this condition. There are also things that people with ADHD can do to help make treatment more effective. Since substances like and illicit drugs can worsen ADHD, they should be avoided. Other tips to manage ADHD symptoms include getting adequate , using visual techniques, as well as seeking reminders from parents or teachers to remember tasks and assignments, respectively. People with an ADHD may also need treatment for other emotional problems. Depression and anxiety have often been associated with ADHD, as have alcohol and . Recent research also suggests that attempts are more frequent in people with ADHD. Fortunately, these problems associated with ADHD can be overcome effectively, just like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder itself. Sadly, many teens with ADHD do not seek or receive treatment. What Are Complications of ADHD in Teens? Is It Possible to Prevent Teen ADHD? What Is the Prognosis of Teen ADHD? There are many possible complications associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. For example, people with ADHD have more academic risks and behavior problems like discipline problems, failing a grade, truancy, being expelled, dropping out, and not advancing to college. Teens with this disorder may have more accidents, both driving and otherwise. Particularly when untreated, people with ADHD are at risk for having trouble functioning at work, in relationships, and in society in general. Teens with the condition are also more likely to experience involvement with the juvenile justice system. As environmental and social insults like maternal drug use and medical and emotional issues are risk factors for developing ADHD, prevention or treatment of those issues can help prevent ADHD. Also, early treatment of people with ADHD can decrease the impact of the condition on the person's life as they move into adulthood. ADHD can also have a significant effect on the mood, behavior, relationships, school, work, and other aspects of the lives of those who have it. For example, people with ADHD are more likely to experience a depressive illness than those without it. On a positive note, research indicates that when treated during childhood or adolescence rather than waiting until adulthood, individuals with ADHD tend to develop other psychiatric conditions less often than adults who do not receive treatment until adulthood. CHADD (Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder): Where can people find additional information on ADHD? American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry American Counseling Association American Psychiatric Association American Psychological Association National Association of Social Workers National Mental Health Association There are a number of assessments that are completed by physicians, parents, and teachers. No single scale or source should be used to make the diagnosis of ADHD. It requires information from multiple sources. These include the following: The Vanderbilt Assessment Scale is a tool which reviews symptoms associated with ADHD and other psychiatric diagnoses. This is generally completed by a teacher and a parent. This is primarily used for children in elementary school. Conners Scale is a symptom rating tool that can be used for children aged 2-18 years and is completed by teachers, parents, and even self-administered by adolescents. The child behavior checklist is also called the Achenbach Checklist and is completed by parents, teachers, and the child and is a subjective evaluation of behaviors consistent with ADHD.

Adult ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Adults) Medical Author: Michael J. Peterson, MD, PhD Medical Editor: How Do Health Care Professionals Diagnose Adult ADHD? When Should Someone Seek Medical Care for Adult ADHD? Are There Adult ADHD and Home Remedies? Where Can People Find More Information on Adult ADHD? () is well recognized in children and adolescents, and is increasingly being recognized in adults. The labels used to describe this cluster of problems have changed many times over the past 100 years, but currently () and () are the most commonly used diagnostic terms. As with most psychiatric disorders, the causes of ADHD are not fully understood, but the condition is thought to be due to a combination of genetic factors, exposures, and life experiences. Symptoms of ADHD lead to poorer performance, particularly at school and work, than would be expected. Attention deficit disorder is defined as a neurodevelopmental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (). ADHD includes primarily problems with inattention and/or hyperactivity. However, because inattention and hyperactive behavior affect emotions and relationships with others, the impact of ADHD can be broad and pervasive. The problems with attention and/or hyperactivity start in childhood, but for many people, these continue into adulthood too. In order to be diagnosed with ADHD, an adult must have a history of symptoms that start during childhood. The requires the presence of symptoms before the age of 12, since recall of symptoms earlier in life is difficult or impossible to reliably establish. Therefore, by definition, there can't be a diagnosis of adult-onset ADHD. A recent study suggested that there may actually be a different type of ADHD that starts in adulthood. However, this finding is quite controversial and contrary to currently accepted diagnosis and treatment recommendations. A second study was published shortly after this one and argued that diagnoses of adult-onset ADHD are actually better explained by substance use disorders, , and other conditions that can impair attention. It is important to recognize that inattention due to ADHD does not affect all areas in someone's life equally. When people with ADHD are involved in an area that naturally holds their interest, they may pay attention as well as, or nearly as well as, others. However, when tasks are repetitive or hold less interest for that person, these individuals often experience greater difficulty maintaining focus and remaining on task. Because of this, those with ADHD may be prone to procrastination, and their behavior may be perceived as immature or inappropriate. As children with ADHD grow up, their overtly hyperactive-impulsive qualities often diminish, while the inattentive and disorganized patterns of behavior tend to persist. Adults with ADHD often fit this pattern: inattention, disorganization, and low tolerance of frustration or boredom, combined with the childhood history of inattention and hyperactivity. In adults, inattention tends to cause the most impairment and problems. Compared with unaffected people, those with ADHD often require more practice over longer periods of time to develop effective habits and behavior. These issues can result in complications in many aspects of life, including school or job achievement, performance in athletic activities, driving, as well as success in relationships, specifically friendships, dating, and marriage. The acceptance of has changed dramatically over the last 20 years. Based on accepted knowledge at the time, the indicated that most adolescents and adults outgrew ADHD and did not have persistent symptoms as adults. More recently, however, it is thought that 60%-70% of adults who had ADHD as children continue to have significant symptoms that cause impairment. Recent studies indicate that around 5% of children and 2%-4% of adults are affected by ADHD. Males seem to be more likely to have ADHD, with one and a half to two times as many males as females affected. When assessing adults for ADHD, it is critical to establish the presence of symptoms in childhood, and to rule out other psychiatric and non-psychiatric medical disorders that can cause attention problems (this includes mood, , and psychotic disorders; personality disorders; substance use disorders; ; and cognitive disorders). Adults with ADHD are also at higher risk of also having other comorbid psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders, , and anxiety disorders. Rather than having any single cause, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is thought to be related to both genetic and life-experience factors. ADHD tends to run in families, supporting a genetic component. However, no specific gene(s) have been shown to cause ADHD. Additionally, many people with ADHD may not have a personal family history. Similarly, exposure to various toxins or experiences can increase the risk of having ADHD. Prenatal exposure to , , and other drugs of abuse can increase the risk of ADHD. Similarly, low birth weight, traumatic birth, or other early childhood traumas or infections may also increase an individual's risk. However, it is critical to understand that most people with any one of these exposures still will not have ADHD. Biologically, ADHD is a neurochemical and neuroanatomical disorder, meaning that specific brain chemicals and brain regions are affected. People with ADHD are thought to have several chemicals (still to be determined) in the brain that are not present in the right quantities in the right places at the right times. Both (DA) and (NE; noradrenaline) are brain chemicals involved in regulating both attention and reward pathways in the brain and are thought to be affected by ADHD. Many of the medications used to effectively treat ADHD alter brain levels of DA and NE, adding support to the hypothesis that ADHD is related to their function. Neuroimaging research has shown both that children with ADHD show differences in how their brains develop, as well as identifying areas in the adult brain that seem to function differently. Although brain images are helping us to understand these disorders, an or cannot be used to establish a diagnosis of ADHD. Risk factors for are thought to include male gender, but some of that is known to be the result of the symptoms of ADHD potentially seeming less apparent in girls. Since is equally identified in men and women, gender is not a risk factor for this disorder in adults. Other risk factors for ADHD are thought to include medical or mental health issues in a father, before birth, being the product of unintended , and history of head trauma. Being breastfed is thought to be a protective factor against developing ADHD. Symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents are predominantly external and easy to observe, such as physical hyperactivity. An exception is predominantly inattentive ADHD, formerly referred to as ADD, which is more common in girls. With age, a decrease in observable symptoms of ADHD seems to occur. Adults with ADHD have a longer delay before refocusing when their attention is misdirected, and they have difficulty switching tasks. The hyperactivity and impulsivity of are often more subtle than those symptoms types in children. For example, while hyperactivity may result in children being fidgety and frequently getting up from sitting, this symptom in adults may involve the adult getting bored easily and being unhappy about having to sit still rather than having to frequently change their position. On neuropsychological tests, these individuals often have trouble with sustained effort, planning, organization, visual tracking, and listening attentively. ADHD is characterized by a long-term history of inattention, impulsiveness, and variable amounts of hyperactivity. Remember that all of these symptoms are normal human characteristics, so ADHD is not diagnosed solely based on the presence of these normal human behaviors. ADHD is determined by the degree of these behaviors and their interference with important areas of life. People with ADHD have these normal human characteristics to an excessive degree, with a poor ability to easily control them. The Evolution of ADHD Characteristics From Childhood to Adulthood Inner restlessnessInability to relaxUnhappy/discontent when inactive Blurting outTouching or exploringCan't stay in lineTemper tantrums or outburstsInterrupting, impatientSnap decisions, recklessnessSwitching tasks rapidlyFeeling ""down"" when bored or ""up"" when excited/stimulated DistractibleCannot finish workDoes not appear to hearOften forgetfulDisorganization, forgetfulnessPoor time managementMisses parts of conversations Although some adults with ADHD may not meet the full criteria used to diagnose ADHD in children, they may still experience significant impairment in certain aspects of life. Depending on their professional or domestic situation, these adults may need to deal with more complex abstract issues that can be difficult depending on the severity of their ADHD. Consequently, a given individual's perception of his or her own degree of impairment may vary. Some characteristics of adult ADHD include the following (remember these are normal human behaviors; ADHD is diagnosed based on the presence and severity of more than one of these characteristics): : A person may feel restless, be unable to relax or settle down, or be discontent unless active. Attention difficulties: Someone may have trouble keeping his or her mind on a conversation. For example, a man or woman may be constantly aware of other things going on around him even when trying to filter them out. Or the individual may have difficulty reading, finishing a task, with focus, or may experience frequent forgetfulness. Affective lability: This means that someone shifts from a normal mood to or excitement, and these shifts can be either reactive or spontaneous. Disorganization or inability to complete tasks: An affected person may be disorganized at work, home, or school. One frequently does not complete tasks or switches from one task to another. Short temper with short-lived explosive outbursts: A person may lose control for short times or be easily provoked to anger or constantly irritable, and these problems may interfere with personal relationships. Impulsivity: Impulsiveness may be minor (for example, talking before thinking, interrupting conversation, impatience) or major. Abruptly starting or stopping relationships (for example, multiple marriages, separations), antisocial behavior (for example, shoplifting), and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities without recognizing possible consequences (for example, buying sprees) are examples of major impulsivity. The bottom line is that waiting to do something induces discomfort. Emotional overreaction: Someone may react excessively or inappropriately with , confusion, uncertainty, anxiety, or anger to ordinary stresses. These emotional responses interfere with problem-solving abilities. Other psychiatric conditions, such as a substance-abuse disorder, major affective disorder (like or ), anxiety disorders, or schizoaffective disorder, , antisocial personality disorder, and must be ruled out as a cause of the symptoms. Similarly, other medical conditions, including disorders (like [OSA]; ; deprivation), traumatic brain injuries, cognitive disorders, or () may also cause problems with attention. How Do Health Care Professionals Diagnose Adult ADHD? In adults, the requires five or more symptoms of inattention, and/or five or more symptoms of hyperactivity to make the diagnosis. In children, six or more symptoms are required; this is a recognition that there may be fewer symptoms (or they may be more subtle) in adults, but still they cause significant impairment. Many of the symptoms must have been present at or before age 12. The symptoms must cause significant impairment in at least two different settings (for example, home and work; school and home; etc.) and must not be better explained by another diagnosis. Several screening tools, self-tests or checklists, spousal reports, and parent report questionnaires, including the Connors rating scale, the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale Symptom Checklist, and others are available for the assessment of adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the diagnostic power of these tests is still being determined, so adult ADHD is diagnosed from qualitative data more than from quantitative tests. It is generally useful (and recommended) to get a history of symptoms from others close to the individual (for example, parents, spouse or partner, siblings) to better confirm the diagnosis. Currently, there are no blood tests, genetic tests, or imaging studies that can accurately diagnose ADHD. Most specialists who treat mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety also have experience in treating ADHD, particularly since it is a relatively common disorder. In the past, child and adolescent psychiatrists and pediatricians had the most experience with ADHD treatment, since the majority of diagnoses were in children and adolescents. As awareness of adult ADHD has increased (and as those diagnosed as children have grown to adulthood), more adult psychiatrists and family medicine and internal medicine doctors have gained expertise with treating adults with ADHD. Only licensed physicians (MD or DO doctors, including psychiatrists, pediatricians, family doctors and primary care providers) or Advanced Practice Nurse Prescribers (APNP) working with physicians can also prescribe medications for ADHD. You may find that some professional therapists and counselors (clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, professional counselors) will specialize in therapy approaches to addressing ADHD symptoms. A variety of other professionals may provide education or coaching services to help with ADHD. However, they may not be required to have professional licensing, and it is important to look into their experience, training, and references from clients or referring providers. When Should Someone Seek Medical Care for Adult ADHD? Adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can have a negative impact on the life of the sufferer. Some commonly reported problems include the following: Academic, vocational, and extracurricular (for example, in athletic, club, or volunteer activities) success below what is expected based on intelligence and education Adult ADHD is diagnosed based on determining the presence of symptoms during childhood, establishing a long-term pattern, and demonstrating current impairment. This information can be gathered from interviewing parents, friends, siblings, and spouses or partners, as well as from screening tools, including rating scales and self-reports. Finding a doctor who treats adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) could be difficult since the occurrence of this condition in adults is only recently recognized. The following are some helpful questions to ask when looking for medical care: How many adults have you given the diagnosis of ADHD in the past five years? (The more the better, but even a few a year is far better than none.) What percent of your practice has a primary diagnosis of ADHD? (Again, the higher the percentage the better, but 5%-10% is far better than none.) How familiar are you with the day-to-day burden of having ADHD? (How intimate is the doctor's understanding of ADHD on a daily basis?) What is your treatment philosophy? (You want to determine if the clinician will work with you and be open to suggestions if he or she will call all the shots or if the treatment is individually tailored.) Do you regularly read materials or attend conferences related to adult ADHD? (Try to learn what the clinician does to maintain current knowledge about adult ADHD and its treatment protocols.) How do you diagnose ADHD? How many visits will it take and how much will it cost? What medications are you likely to prescribe? (Ask psychologists how they handle the medication part of treatment because psychologists cannot prescribe medications in most areas.) Keep track of who you called and how they answered these questions. Are There Adult ADHD and Home Remedies? Research suggests that adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often respond extremely well to stimulants and at times . Treatment options and successes are similar to those in . Counseling, also called psychotherapy, can play an important role in treatment by helping to develop increased awareness of ineffective habits. Therapy can also be a way to develop activities to build organizational and planning skills. However, no current research has demonstrated that counseling alone will eliminate the actual symptoms of ADHD; rather, counseling can become more effective once an effective medication is found. Medication will ""start the engine"" but not necessarily provide a way to ""steer."" In other words, counseling may help with issues of marital instability or poor interpersonal skills but by itself will not end inattention, impulsivity, or feelings of restlessness. So far, there is not much research showing consistent benefit from home remedies in the treatment of adult ADHD. When medication is used effectively for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), patients notice a significant improvement in control. Objective observers, such as acquaintances or coworkers, should notice more focus, better concentration, and improved task completion. Remembering what medicines do and do not do is very important. Medicine, when used successfully, simply helps a person with ADHD function more like a person without ADHD. As a comparison, using medication is like putting on glasses. It makes the system function more appropriately, just like glasses help a person achieve 20/20 vision. Medication alone will not make a person with ADHD sit down and write a paper any more than glasses alone will. Medication allows the to send its chemical messages more efficiently, but it does not provide skills or motivation to perform. Medication is designed to help a person with ADHD be less distracted, so that he or she can stick to a plan and achieve daily goals. People with ADHD who are on effective medication can have improved attention span, concentration, memory, coordination, mood, and task completion. At the same time, daydreaming, hyperactivity, anger, and immature or oppositional behavior may decrease. Medical treatment allows a person's intellectual capabilities that were already present to function more appropriately. The medications available for managing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can have slightly different effects from individual to individual, and currently no method exists to tell which will work best. Medications indicated for ADHD are thought to work by improving the imbalance of neurochemicals that are thought to contribute to ADHD. Some commonly prescribed medications include the following: Stimulants (U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approved for ADHD, except Cylert) (, , , Metadate, , Quillivant, ) or pre-Dextroamphetamine (Adderall, , , , Zenzedi) Pemoline sodium (Cylert); no longer available in the United States due to instances of severe toxicity Nonstimulants (Only the medications indicated with an * are FDA approved for treating ADHD) Antidepressants (None of these medications are FDA approved for treating ADHD.) If one medication does not work effectively, some of the others are often tried because individuals may respond quite differently to each one. Medications in different groups used in combination may be more effective than each medication alone for some people. In general, the medications used to treat ADHD in adults are the same ones used to treat ADHD in children. Stimulants are the most commonly used class of medications for treating ADHD in adults and children. All of these medications increase brain levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. Both of these brain chemicals are thought to be related to the ability to sustain attention. Stimulants are misused or abused by some people, and can be addictive, so they should be used with care and may not be appropriate for some individuals. Almost all people will see an improvement in their attention, focus, and performance on certain tasks while taking a stimulant. This is important to know, since there is a common myth that a positive effect from a stimulant can prove a diagnosis of ADHD. On a related note, it has become increasingly common for high school and college students to misuse stimulants (for example, take them without a prescription or take more than prescribed) as a cognitive enhancer or performance-enhancing drug (PED) as a way to try to improve their academic performance. While there are far fewer studies on the long-term effects of stimulant medications like Ritalin, Adderall, or Focalin, some research shows that the effectiveness of stimulants sometimes wanes over time. The FDA approved nonstimulant medications work in a slightly different way. Atomoxetine (Strattera) increases norepinephrine levels and is not an addictive medication. Both guanfacine and clonidine modulate the sympathetic (fight or flight) nervous system and are thought to decrease the impulsiveness related to ADHD. Certain antidepressants are also used to treat ADHD, since they may also affect dopamine and norepinephrine levels. None of the antidepressants have an FDA approval for ADHD treatment; however, they may be a useful treatment option, particularly when stimulant medications are contraindicated, have caused intolerable side effects, or have not improved symptoms. The antidepressants most commonly used for ADHD are bupropion (Wellbutrin), venlafaxine (Effexor), and duloxetine (Cymbalta). Older (TCAs) such as imipramine (Tofranil, ), desipramine (Norpramin), and nortriptyline (Pamelor) are less often prescribed for treatment of ADHD because they are more likely to cause more serious side effects. medications and atomoxetine may increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (in children, adolescents, and young adults in their early 20s) as side effects of the medication, particularly in individuals with a history of bipolar or other mood disorder, or a personal or family history of suicidal behavior. Medication can help some or all of the following areas: Verbal and/or behavioral impulsivity (for example, blurting out, interrupting others, acting before thinking) Trouble waking up (not getting out of bed in the morning) Excessive irritability without cause and/or easy frustration Episodic explosiveness, emotional outbursts, or temper tantrums If an ADHD medication is not significantly helping with a number of these concerns or is causing uncomfortable or problematic side effects, ask about changing the dosage or changing medicine. While a number of natural remedies and changes in to treat ADHD have been tried, research indicates that many such interventions are either too restrictive to daily life to implement in a realistic way or have yet to be found to have a significant impact on ADHD symptoms. Although medications are generally considered to be the first-line treatment, psychotherapy may be an option when medications are not effective or are not an option for other reasons. The types of psychotherapy with the best evidence for improving ADHD symptoms are cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or behavioral therapy. CBT for ADHD is aimed at improving cognitive organization and planning as well as training of behaviors that are impairing function. CBT can also be combined with medication, and some studies have shown this combination to be more effective than either treatment alone. Most adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are undiagnosed, untreated, and unaware that help is available. Their symptoms occur in varying types and severity from impairment in interpersonal relations to underemployment to low self-esteem and being insecure. An ADHD coach is professionally trained to guide and support a person in overcoming the challenges of living with ADHD at work, school, and home. In contrast to CBT, coaching can be used on an as-needed basis and tends to focus on a particular problem. Specifically, ADHD coaches help people with ADHD to do the following: Improve organizing skills and design organizing systems. Plan projects, clearly identify tasks, and manage time. Improve crucial lifestyle habits such as diet, sleep, and . ADHD coaching can supplement the treatment from a doctor and counselor. Coaches have frequent contact with their clients (in person or over the phone) and can help determine the success of different medications or other treatments, providing observations and advice that can be used to tailor treatment. ADHD coaching is not psychotherapy; some people work with a coach while also working with a therapist or counselor. Coaching sessions deal with what's happening in the client's life with emphasis on challenges, opportunities, and strategies for success. Coaches can provide support between sessions by email or phone, and some assign homework that helps the client accomplish his or her objectives in living with ADHD. In addition to coaching, which is not covered by insurance and can be expensive, many support groups are available for adult ADHD. Groups can be found online or through a therapist. Preventing exposure of people to environmental toxins like smoke in the womb, mercury, lead and pesticides before or after birth seem to help prevent ADHD. Being breastfed and having adequate intake of nutrients like , zinc, magnesium, and are thought to be other protective factors against developing ADHD. Encouraging in young children is believed to have a role in preventing ADHD by promoting neurological development. An estimated one-third of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) progress satisfactorily into their adult years, while another one-third continue to experience some problems, and the final one-third continue to experience and often develop significant problems. Many of these negative outcomes are linked to continued, severe, and persistent ADHD symptoms. Studies are demonstrating that adults with ADHD report similar symptoms as described in children with ADHD, but the daily impact of these symptoms is clearly different. Treatment with appropriate medication can significantly improve the outcome for ADHD. For example, effectively managing symptoms with medication can be a key factor in the prevention of another psychiatric disorder or of academic failure. Other significant statistics about adult outcomes of ADHD include that only 11% of adults with this disorder are accurately diagnosed or receive treatment, nearly 50% of adults with ADHD also suffer from an anxiety disorder, about 40% have a different type of co-occurring mood disorder, and about 15% also develop a substance-abuse disorder. Emerging evidence suggests that the combination of medication, cognitive therapy, and life coaching appears to significantly improve the prognosis of adults with ADHD.

a7dbb72c-8810-4af7-a9b1-f8650cb1015e,"ADHD is known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Many of the symptoms of adult ADHD are similar to the symptoms of child ADHD. Those who suffer with ADHD struggle with the inability to control their daily lives. ADHD not only affects the individual who has it, but it also affects everyone around them. Extensive research has been conducted on ADHD and to date there are still no definite answers as to what exactly causes this disorder. Theory suggests that ADHD is caused by a neurological and chemical deficiency that affects the development of the central nervous system. It is believed that this lack of development directly affects the part of the brain responsible for concentration. ADHD is also believed to be partly due to genetic inheritance. A large majority of individuals afflicted with this disorder will also have a relative who has ADHD. There are at least three main characteristics of ADHD that include several sub characteristics, and not every individual with adult ADHD will experience them all. The main characteristics include Inattentiveness, Hyperactivity,... Just not everyday all day like a person with ADHD. This does not only affect the person with the disorder but the people around them. Whether it is your mom and dad, teacher, friends, or siblings. They need to understand that ADHD is a real disability that effects all aspects of a person’s life. “Additionally, there are now brain studies that show that when someone with ADHD is told to “just try harder” and does, the result can be anxiety and a brain that actually starts to shut down it’s primary executive functions (Booth).” For a while now scientists have come up with many different theories about ADHD. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) ADHD and its diagnosis and treatment have been considered controversial since the 1970s. The controversies have involved clinicians, teachers, policymakers, parents and the media. Opinions regarding ADHD range from not believing it exists at all to believing there are genetic and physiological bases for the condition as well as disagreement about the use of stimulant medications in treatment. Some sociologists consider ADHD to be a ""classic example of the medicalization of deviant behavior, defining a previously non medical problem as a medical one.” Most healthcare providers in U.S. accept that ADHD is a genuine disorder with debate in centering mainly around how it is diagnosed and treated. Among the behavioral disorders that are commonly diagnosed, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, ADHD, is the most prevalent among youth and children. Hysteria is a serious personality disorder that manifests in patients as odd, random behaviors, not only psychologically, but physically as well. There is no known cure however symptoms can be managed through different treatments on a case by case basis. There are many different affects of hysteria, many of which are Psychological Symptoms. Eysenck’s challenge to psychotherapy: a view of the effects 50 years on. written by Russell Meares, Janine Stevenson, Roberto D’Angelo, assess the affects of hysteria. Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder that causes severe mental disturbances which disrupt ones thoughts, speech, and behavior. According to Paul Thompson, Associate Professor of Neurology, one percent of the world’s population suffers from this disorder. There is no one specific cause of schizophrenia, because it is caused by a combination of problems during development. It is a disorder which not only affects the patient, but their family and society as well. Schizophrenia can be a debilitating disorder, however, there are many treatments that can allow people who suffer from it to lead normal lives. Question: What affects does marijuana use have in patients that have ADHD? Thesis: It is true that many people who have ADHD also abuse substances and they are miss diagnosed and do not get the proper treatment. This is the most common co-occurring disorder and very difficult to diagnose. Although the cause of ADHD is unknown, it is alleged to be a brain-based biological disorder; substance abuse however is a combination of cognitive, behavioral, and physiologic disorder. This combination also makes it difficult to treat because People with the ADHD condition have problems with control of impulse behaviors, paying attention and some may be found out to be very active. Do You Have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)? There will always be controversy around ADHD using basic checklists of common adolescent symptoms and behaviors that can be confusing diagnosing since the symptoms imitate other disorders. Many people argue that ADHD is part of normal childhood and that the disease is fictional. While the question regarding the validity of ADHD is surrounded by controversy, scientific and psychiatric associations provide evidence that support its legitimacy. Bipolar Disorder The severe mood fluctuations of bipolar or manic-depressive disorders have been around since the 16-century and affect little more than 2% of the population in both sexes, all races, and all parts of the world (Harmon 3). Researchers think that the cause is genetic, but it is still unknown. The one fact of which we are painfully aware of is that bipolar disorder severely undermines its victims ability to obtain and maintain social and occupational success. Because the symptoms of bipolar disorder are so debilitation, it is crucial that we search for possible treatments and cures. The characteristics of bipolar disorder are significant shifts in mood that go from manic episodes to deep depressive episodes in a up and down trip that seemingly never ends. Generally this disorder is diagnosed in children at early stages of development. The causes of this disorder may be related to gender, depression, emotions, environmental factors, and developmental factors. ADHD children are often mistaken with excessive maladaptive behavior, and the opposite goes for children who are merely active in daily living. Some children are misdiagnosed with ADHD and medicated thereafter. However the children diagnosed correctly with ADHD may not respond to medication. Most researcher think the cause of ADHD is biological; differences in several parts of the brain, brain activity, levels of certain neurotransmitters, and genetic factors. However, learning disabilities might be related to emotional problems such as depression or frustration that is caused by the environment, and this emotional and behavioral problems often interfere with learning. In fact, the NJCLD (National Joint Committe on Learning Disabilities, 1994) states that learning difficulties often occur along with other problems such as social or emotional disorder (Bornstein, et al., 2002). People tend to ignore or avoid, and differently treating people with ADHD without being aware of the importance of environment role to the people with ADHD especially in their treatment process. This leads to the research question: “To what extent does the environment affects the treatment of people with ADHD?” The topic was... ... middle of paper ... ...niel Neeleman, who has ADHD. Amongst the many is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Children who have short attention span and are not able to stay on task are considered to have this disorder. Here we will examine characteristics and symptoms that are common to those who share this disorder, including the history and how its many issues can often be treated. What is “ADHD”? : A Brief History Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurological disorder commonly diagnosed in children, hindering an individual's ability to attend to responsibilities, capability to control one's behavior, and interferes with the ability to regulate one's activity level.

b6925932-d0fc-4951-8785-5ef32242062c,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a psychological condition thought to affect approximately 3-7% of school-aged children in the United States. It is characterized by deficits in hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention, which present over a range of clinical features. Research has shown that boys are three times more likely to receive a than girls. While girls symptoms are often subtle and therefore harder to identify, but this difference is also thought to be due to poor use of diagnostic criteria and the expectation that boys are more likely to have ADHD. As it is diagnosed in childhood, and symptoms may improve with time, the prevalence is higher in children than adults. The fifth edition of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM 5), groups symptoms for ADHD in children into two categories. Often blurts out answers before a question has been fully asked. Using the DSM 5, a psychologist or psychiatrist will review the symptoms presented by the child. In order for a child under 16 years-old to be diagnosed with ADHD a minimum of six symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactive/impulsivity must be present, and these must be inappropriate for their development level, and present for at least six months. In addition to these symptoms, the following criteria must be met to diagnose ADHD: A proportion of symptoms must be displayed in two or more settings, such as at home and school. Symptoms must significantly impact the child’s quality of life. A proportion of hyperactive-impulsive or inattention symptoms must be experienced before the age of 12. Symptoms are not better attributed to other psychological disorders such as Personality Disorders and do not only occur during psychotic or schizophrenic episodes. Depending on the combination of symptoms present, children will be diagnosed with one of three presentations of ADHD. If the criterion for inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity are met. If the criterion for inattention is met, but hyperactivity-impulsivity is not met. If the criterion for hyperactivity-impulsivity is met, but inattention is not met. In addition to collecting ADHD symptoms, the therapist will take a detailed medical history in order to identify the presence or absence of other psychological disorders. They will also examine the child’s medical and developmental history to rule out any medications or medical conditions that could exacerbate, predispose or mimic the ADHD symptoms in the child. Information may also be gathered from teachers regarding the nature of hyperactive/impulsive and/or inattentive symptoms in the classroom. Questionnaires and rating scales such as the Conners’ Rating Scales-Revised may be completed by caregivers and teachers to provide objective data to confirm the diagnosis. Research has suggested a range of genetic, non-genetic and environmental causes of ADHD. Due to the effectiveness of medications such as psychostimulants and noradrenergic tricyclics drugs in treating ADHD symptoms, dopamine and noradrenaline neurotransmitters are thought to play a role in the disordered physiological processes that accompany the syndrome. Differences in the activation of the prefrontal and frontal regions of the brain have been found in those with ADHD. These areas of the brain play a role in the regulation of behavior, in particular impulsivity. Damage to the prefrontal and frontal lobes of the brain can cause a deficit in executive function which can lead to issues with impulsivity and a lack of behavioral regulation often seen in those with ADHD. Family and twin studies have demonstrated that ADHD might have a genetic link. One study found that having a sibling or family with ADHD meant you were two to eight times more likely to develop the disorder. Other factors include, drug, alcohol and cigarette use during pregnancy, low birth weight and exposure of toxins such as lead. There is a range of treatment options, including behavior therapy and medication which aim to help manage symptoms appropriately, ensuring that those with ADHD can maintain a high quality of life. Therapy and training carried out by the child themselves and/or their caregivers aims to change behavior. Children with ADHD can be taught a range of social skills to help them adapt to social situations. Parents can be taught the skills and techniques needed to reward and encourage positive behavior in their child. Behavioral interventions, led by teachers and parents, can help children manage bad habits and disruptive behavior by increasing organization and removing distractions. Group education sessions can let caregivers learn more about ADHD in order to support their child. Furthermore, stress management techniques can be taught to help them deal with any frustrations allowing them to respond to their child’s behavior is a calm manner. There are two main types of medication typically prescribed to treat ADHD; stimulants and non-stimulants. Common stimulants include methylphenidates such as Daytrana, Concerta and Ritalin and act on noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways in the prefrontal cortex. Both can be taken in once or twice daily long-acting formulations. Common non-stimulants include atomoxetine – a selective presynaptic norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. They are not usually first-line agents used to treat ADHD. However, they may be prescribed if a child does not respond well to stimulant medication. Children with moderate to severe cases of ADHD are often prescribed a combination of medication and therapeutic treatment. Some parents and caregivers are reluctant for their child to take stimulant medication as it can lead to abuse and addiction. However, research has found a reduced risk of alcohol, smoking and substance use disorders in those taking stimulant medication compared to those left untreated. Some children may experience side effects from taking medication such as sleep disturbances, weight loss and a loss of appetite. In some cases, children may be advised to take a break from their ADHD medication by a medical professional – there are several reasons for this. Taking a break can allow doctors to examine the effectiveness of the medication and see whether the child still needs to use it. For example, children with ADHD can often “outgrow” their symptoms and therefore, no longer need medication or require a reduced dosage. Similarly, if there have been no reported symptoms for over a year while on medication or performance has improved despite the dosage remaining the same, then a break may be suggested. ADHD is not classified as a learning disability. However, research has shown that approximately 20-30% of children with ADHD will also be diagnosed with a learning disability. Furthermore, the relationship between academic achievement and ADHD is driven less by the presence of hyperactive-impulsive symptoms and more by inattentiveness. Research has demonstrated that both ADHD and learning disabilities share deficits in processing speed and working memory, which may attribute to academic difficulties. Although similarities exist between ADHD and learning disabilities and their impact on education, ADHD is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder and not a learning disability. Children will often go through periods of being slightly hyperactive, inattentive or restless. This is typical for children and does not necessarily mean they have ADHD. However, if symptoms of hyperactivity are more regular, have lasted for more than six months, and extend into two or more environments, such as at home and school, then this may be a cause for concern. Typically, as a child develops, they become more effective at managing their behavior, particularly their impulses and behavior regulation. If their symptoms of hyperactivity seem to be different to those at a similar age, then it may advisable to speak to a doctor, particularly if the hyperactivity is causing significant disruption to the child’s quality of life. Like many psychological disorders, symptoms can vary in severity. When making a diagnosis, psychologists or psychiatrists have to categorize the severity of symptoms into three categories; mild, moderate and severe. Children may be diagnosed with mild ADHD if they have fewer symptoms than those needed to receive an ADHD diagnosis using the DSM 5 diagnostic criteria and do not appear to seriously impair a child’s life. If symptoms and functional impairment range between “mild” and “severe” then the child is diagnosed with moderate ADHD. If a child has multiple symptoms, both more than those needed to make a firm ADHD diagnosis and many of which are severe and have significant marked impairment on function, then they will be diagnosed with severe ADHD. Treatment-wise, those with severe cases of ADHD are often prescribed a combination of medication and behavioral therapy to treat their symptoms. Research shows that boys are more frequently diagnosed with ADHD compared to girls, and there are differences in the types of symptoms typically displayed by each gender. Girls are less likely to exhibit disruptive rule-breaking, impulsive and hyperactive behavior and are often less likely to be referred for evaluation. Furthermore, it is suggested that symptoms of inattention in girls may be misdiagnosed as a learning disorder. However, girls who do experience ADHD often experience significant impairment and can develop substance abuse, mood, anxiety and eating disorders. National Institute of Mental Health. (2016).

ADHD and depression are separate disorders but tend to have much overlap. If you've been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression, you might wonder what this means for you in terms of prognosis, treatment, and lifestyle changes you can make to improve your situation. Before we start to disentangle the complex relationship between ADHD and depression, it's important to understand individually what is involved with each diagnosis. is a neurodevelopmental disorder, which means that it is present from childhood and persists throughout your lifetime. People diagnosed with ADHD may exhibit what is called an executive function deficit: they struggle to follow tasks through to completion and easily become disorganized, missing appointments and losing their things. ADHD is usually diagnosed in childhood and can be categorized into three different presentations. People with inattentive ADHD have difficulty sustaining attention for tasks that they find boring, have trouble organizing their thoughts and following conversations, and may be easily distracted by what's going on around them or their own internal dialogue. People with hyperactive-impulsive ADHD have a constant feeling of being restless, may say things spontaneously without thinking first, and find it hard to stay still (such as sitting in a classroom for lessons). Combination of Inattentive and Hyperactive-Impulsive People with the combined presentation will experience both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. is more than just sadness or a case of the blues. Many people experience recurrent episodes that can last anywhere from weeks to months or longer. Below are the most common symptoms of depression: Having trouble falling asleep or waking up through the night Depression can make it hard to do everyday tasks like going to work or school, taking care of your personal hygiene, and eating healthy meals. It is also a life-threatening illness when it is severe and leads to suicidal ideation. How do ADHD and depression overlap? We know that these are comorbid conditions, which means that when you are diagnosed with one, the odds of you also being diagnosed with the other are higher. Below are some facts on the overlap of ADHD and depression: Teens with ADHD are 10 times more likely than their peers without ADHD to develop depression Depression is three times more prevalent in adults with ADHD compared to adults without ADHD. People diagnosed with depression tend to have rates of ADHD diagnosis of about 30 to 40%. 70% of people diagnosed with ADHD may also experience depression in their lifetime. Furthermore, in a study that examined data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, it was found that rates of ADHD were higher among those who had severe depression, chronic depression, early-onset depression, or comorbid anxiety. This suggests a strong relationship between ADHD and depression. With respect to suicidal ideation, a study of 627 undergraduates showed that a diagnosis of ADHD was related to increased suicidal ideation. This relationship was affected by various factors such as management of negative emotions, emotional awareness, and goal-oriented behavior. If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the at for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our . Sometimes it can be hard to tell ADHD and depression apart. This is because there are overlapping symptoms, but also because some ADHD medications can cause side effects that mimic depression such as loss of appetite or sleeping difficulties. While both ADHD and depression involve issues related to mood, concentration, and motivation, they do differ. A person with ADHD may experience temporary mood lability all the way back to childhood, while a person with depression tends to have mood episodes, beginning in the teens or later, that last at least weeks or months. A person with ADHD can be motivated when something feels interesting to them, whereas a person with depression finds everything hard, regardless of whether it is interesting or exciting to them normally when they are not depressed. A person with ADHD has trouble falling asleep because of an active mind and not feeling tired, while a person with depression may feel tired but unable to sleep due to negative thoughts and , may wake up through the night, or may sleep too long. The symptoms of ADHD are lifelong while major depression symptoms tend to last for a certain period before often improving to a normal level of functioning. What are the risk factors for having comorbid ADHD and depression? Below are some of the risk factors that have been identified. Although ADHD is more common in males, females are more likely to have comorbid ADHD and depression. Those diagnosed as inattentive type are more likely to also have a diagnosis of depression. When a mother has depression during pregnancy, this is linked to a higher likelihood of giving birth to a child who is later diagnosed with ADHD, depression, or both. Being diagnosed with ADHD during childhood is related to an increased risk of depression and suicidal thoughts later in life. People who have untreated ADHD are at higher risk for depression due to secondary issues such as low . What types of treatment are offered if you have overlapping ADHD and depression? It really depends on your particular situation. In general, the approach is to work on the condition that is most impairing first. While therapy can address both issues at once, often medication is prescribed for one condition and then the other. What medications might you be prescribed? Below is a list of some options you might be given: Stimulants such as (amphetamine/dextroamphetamine) may be prescribed for ADHD. Stimulants help to increase brain chemicals that improve focus. However, they can have side effects such as loss of appetite or trouble sleeping. Nonstimulants such as Strattera (atomoxetine) may also be prescribed for ADHD. Antidepressants may be prescribed for depression including (bupropion), which can also help relieve symptoms of ADHD. Antidepressants can take several weeks before you will know if they are working. Psychotherapy for ADHD aims at improving focus and building self-esteem, while therapy for depression may target identifying and replacing negative thoughts and behaviors (which may also be helpful for ADHD). In one study of 77 adults with ADHD, those who had received extensive psychotherapyt and were less likely to have ruminative thinking were shown to be more resilient to episodes of depression. We've tried, tested and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, Betterhelp, and Regain. What can you do on your own to improve your ADHD and depression? The basics are most important: eat healthy meals, exercise regularly (aerobic exercise is important if you have ADHD), and practice good sleep hygiene. Another good strategy is to prevent yourself from becoming bored if you have ADHD, as this can worsen your mood. One way to accomplish this is to keep an ""interest closet"" or another spot in your home where you store activities that you can do when you are feeling bored. Add things like books you want to read, crafts you want to do, etc. so that there's never a time that you're at a loss. ADHD and depression tend to overlap, so it's important to consult your doctor if you believe you may have symptoms of either mental health issue. Both need to be treated swiftly to avoid secondary problems down the road; however, the prognosis is good when you receive help tailored to your individual situation.

For a diagnosis, the symptoms should appear before a person is twelve years old, be present for more than six months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities). In children, problems paying attention may result in poor . Additionally, there is an association with other and . Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many people with ADHD can have sustained attention for tasks they find interesting or rewarding (known as ). Despite being the most commonly studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children and adolescents, the precise cause or causes are unknown in the majority of cases. Genetic factors are estimated to make up about 75% of the risk. Nicotine exposure during pregnancy may be an environmental risk. It does not appear to be related to the style of parenting or discipline. It affects about 5–7% of children when diagnosed via the criteria and 1–2% when diagnosed via the criteria. As of 2019, it was estimated to affect 84.7 million people globally. Rates are similar between countries and differences in rates depend mostly on how it is diagnosed. ADHD is diagnosed approximately two times more often in boys than in girls, although the disorder is often overlooked in girls because their symptoms are often less disruptive. About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have and between 2–5% of adults have the condition. In adults, inner restlessness, rather than hyperactivity, may occur. Adults often develop which compensate for some or all of their impairments. The condition can be difficult to tell apart from other conditions, as well as from high levels of activity within the range of normal behavior. recommendations vary by country and usually involve some combination of medications, , and lifestyle changes. The British guideline emphasises environmental modifications and education for individuals and carers about ADHD as the first response. If symptoms persist, then parent-training, medication, or psychotherapy (especially ) can be recommended based on age. Canadian and American guidelines recommend medications and behavioral therapy together, except in preschool-aged children for whom the first-line treatment is behavioral therapy alone. For children and adolescents older than 5, treatment with stimulants is effective for at least 24 months; however, their long-term effectiveness is unclear and there are potentially serious side effects. The medical literature has described symptoms similar to those of ADHD since the 18th century. ADHD, its diagnosis, and its treatment have been since the 1970s. The controversies have involved clinicians, teachers, policymakers, parents, and the media. Topics include ADHD's causes and the use of stimulant medications in its treatment. Most healthcare providers accept ADHD as a genuine disorder in children and adults, and the debate in the scientific community mainly centers on how it is diagnosed and treated. The condition was officially known as () from 1980 to 1987, while before this it was known as . Inattention, hyperactivity (restlessness in adults), disruptive behavior, and impulsivity are common in ADHD. Academic difficulties are frequent as are problems with relationships. The symptoms can be difficult to define, as it is hard to draw a line at where normal levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity end and significant levels requiring interventions begin. According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (), symptoms must be present for six months or more to a degree that is much greater than others of the and they must cause significant problems functioning in at least two settings (e.g., social, school/work, or home). The criteria must have been met prior to age twelve in order to receive a diagnosis of ADHD. This requires at least 6 symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity for those under 17 and at least 5 for those 17 years or older. ADHD is divided into three primary subtypes: (ADHD-PI or ADHD-I), predominantly hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD-PH or ADHD-HI), and combined type (ADHD-C). The table ""DSM-5 symptoms"" lists the symptoms for ADHD-I and ADHD HI. Symptoms which can be better explained by another psychiatric or medical condition, which the individual has, are excluded. Most or all of the following symptoms, excluding situations where these symptoms are better explained by another psychiatric or medical condition: Be easily distracted, miss details, forget things, and frequently switch from one activity to another Become bored with a task after only a few minutes, unless doing something they find enjoyable Have difficulty focusing attention on organizing or completing a task Have trouble completing or turning in homework assignments, often losing things (e.g., pencils, toys, assignments) needed to complete tasks or activities Have difficulty processing information as quickly and accurately as others Have trouble understanding details; overlooks details Most or all of the following symptoms, excluding situations where these symptoms are better explained by another psychiatric or medical condition: Dash around, touching or playing with anything and everything in sight; Have trouble sitting still during dinner, school, and while doing homework; Have difficulty performing quiet tasks or activities; Blurt out inappropriate comments, show their emotions without restraint, and act without regard for consequences; Have difficulty waiting for things they want or waiting their turn in games; Often interrupt conversations or others' activities; Meet the criteria for both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive ADHD. Girls with ADHD tend to display fewer hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms but more symptoms pertaining to inattention and distractibility. Symptoms of hyperactivity tend to go away with age and turn into ""inner restlessness"" in teens and adults with ADHD. People with ADHD of all ages are more likely to have problems with , such as social interaction and forming and maintaining friendships. This is true for all subtypes. About half of children and adolescents with ADHD experience social rejection by their peers compared to 10–15% of non-ADHD children and adolescents. People with attention deficits are prone to having difficulty processing verbal and nonverbal language which can negatively affect social interaction. They also may drift off during conversations, miss social cues, and have trouble learning social skills. Difficulties managing anger are more common in children with ADHD as are poor and delays in and motor development. Although it causes significant difficulty, many children with ADHD have an attention span equal to or better than that of other children for tasks and subjects they find interesting. In children, ADHD occurs with other disorders about two-thirds of the time. Some commonly associated conditions include: (ASD): this disorder affects social skills, ability to communicate, behaviour, and interests. As of 2013, the allows for a simultaneous diagnosis of both ASD and ADHD. have been found to occur more commonly in the ADHD population. have been found to occur in about 20–30% of children with ADHD. Learning disabilities can include developmental speech and language disorders and academic skills disorders. ADHD, however, is not considered a learning disability, but it very frequently causes academic difficulties. . Adolescents and adults with ADHD are at increased risk of . This is most commonly seen with or . The reason for this may be an altered reward pathway in the brains of ADHD individuals. This makes the evaluation and treatment of ADHD more difficult, with serious substance misuse problems usually treated first due to their greater risks. and ADHD commonly co-exist. They can also occur as a side effect of medications used to treat ADHD. In children with ADHD, is the most common sleep disorder with behavioral therapy the preferred treatment. Problems with sleep initiation are common among individuals with ADHD but often they will be deep sleepers and have significant difficulty getting up in the morning. is sometimes used in children who have sleep onset insomnia. (ODD) occurs in about 25% of children with an inattentive presentation and 50% of those with a combined presentation. It is characterized by angry or irritable mood, argumentative or defiant behaviour and vindictiveness which are age-inappropriate. (CD) occurs in about 25% of adolescents with ADHD. It is characterized by aggression, destruction of property, deceitfulness, theft and violations of rules. Adolescents with ADHD who also have CD are more likely to develop in adulthood. Brain imaging supports that conduct disorder and ADHD are separate conditions. (SCT) is a cluster of symptoms that potentially comprises another attention disorder. It may occur in 30–50% of ADHD cases, regardless of the subtype. (especially and ). Boys diagnosed with the combined ADHD subtype are more likely to have a mood disorder. Adults with ADHD sometimes also have bipolar disorder, which requires careful assessment to accurately diagnose and treat both conditions. has been found to be more common in those with ADHD and is often due to . However, restless legs can simply be a part of ADHD and requires careful assessment to differentiate between the two disorders. People with ADHD have an increased risk of . A 2016 systematic review found a well established association between ADHD and obesity, and sleep disorders, and tentative evidence for association with and , while another 2016 systematic review did not support a clear link between celiac disease and ADHD, and stated that routine in people with ADHD is discouraged. Certain studies have found that people with ADHD tend to have lower scores on (IQ) tests. The significance of this is controversial due to the differences between people with ADHD and the difficulty determining the influence of symptoms, such as distractibility, on lower scores rather than intellectual capacity. In studies of ADHD, higher IQs may be over represented because many studies exclude individuals who have lower IQs despite those with ADHD scoring on average nine points lower on standardized intelligence measures. In individuals with high intelligence, there is increased risk of a missed ADHD diagnosis, possibly because of compensatory strategies in highly intelligent individuals. Studies of adults suggest that negative differences in intelligence are not meaningful and may be explained by associated health problems. The positive traits of ADHD is a new avenue of research, and is therefore limited. However, some strengths have been identified. A 2020 review found that creativity may be associated with ADHD symptoms, particularly and quantity of creative achievements, but not with the disorder of ADHD itself. Divergent thinking is the ability to produce creative solutions which differ significantly from each other, and consider the issue from multiple perspectives. Those with ADHD are advantaged in this form of creativity as they tend to have diffuse attention, allowing rapid switching between aspects of the task under consideration; flexible , allowing them to remember and use more distantly-related ideas which is associated with creativity; and impulsivity, which causes people with ADHD to consider ideas which others may not have. However, people with ADHD may struggle with , which is a process of creativity which requires sustained effort and consistent use of executive functions to weed out solutions which aren't creative from a single area of inquiry. In entrepreneurship, there has been interest in the traits of people with ADHD. This is due in part to a number of high-profile entrepreneurs with ADHD. People with ADHD are more interested in entrepreneurship, and have some traits which are useful to entrepreneurial skills: , , impulsivity, risk-taking, and hyper-focus. On a purely mechanical level, the symptomatic mechanisms of ADHD are generally understood. ADHD is generally the result of neurological dysfunction, more specifically, processes related to the production and use of in the brain. With that said, most ADHD cases are of unknown causes. It is believed to involve interactions between genetics, the environment, and social factors. Certain cases are related to previous infection or trauma to the brain. indicate that the disorder is often inherited from the person's parents, with genetics determining about 75% of cases in children and 35% to potentially 75% of cases in adults. Siblings of children with ADHD are three to four times more likely to develop the disorder than siblings of children without the disorder. Arousal is related to , and ADHD presents with low dopaminergic functioning. Typically, a number of genes are involved, many of which directly affect neurotransmission. Those involved with dopamine include , , , , , , and Other genes associated with ADHD include , , , , , , and . A common variant of a gene called is estimated to be responsible for about 9% of cases and when this variant is present, people are particularly responsive to stimulant medication. The (DRD4–7R) causes increased inhibitory effects induced by and is associated with ADHD. The DRD4 receptor is a that inhibits . The DRD4–7R mutation results in a wide range of behavioral , including ADHD symptoms reflecting split attention. The DRD4 gene is both linked to novelty seeking and ADHD. People with are more likely to have ADHD. The genes domain-containing 1 (GFOD1) and (CHD13) show strong genetic associations with ADHD. CHD13's association with ASD, , , and make it an interesting candidate causative gene. Another candidate causative gene that has been identified is adhesion-G protein-coupled-receptor-L3 (ADGRL3). In Zebrafish, knockout of this gene causes a loss of dopaminergic function in the ventral and the fish display a hyperactive/impulsive . In order for to be used as a tool for diagnosis, more validating studies need to be performed. However, smaller studies have shown that in genes related to neurotransmission or the complex of the can reliably predict a person's response to . Rare genetic variants show more relevant clinical significance as their penetrance (the chance of developing the disorder) tends to be much higher. However their usefulness as tools for diagnosis is limited as no single gene predicts ADHD. ASD shows genetic overlap with ADHD at both common and rare levels of genetic variation. may have played a role in the high rates of ADHD, particularly hyperactive and impulsive traits in males. Some have hypothesized that some women may be more attracted to males who are risk takers, increasing the frequency of genes that predispose to hyperactivity and in the gene pool. Others have claimed that these traits may be an adaptation that help males face stressful or dangerous environments with, for example, increased impulsivity and exploratory behavior. In certain situations, ADHD traits may have been beneficial to society as a whole even while being harmful to the individual. The high rates and heterogeneity of ADHD may have increased and benefited society by adding diversity to the despite being detrimental to the individual. In certain environments, some ADHD traits may have offered personal advantages to individuals, such as quicker response to predators or . In the Ariaal people of Kenya, the 7R allele of the DRD4 gene results in better health in those who are but not those who are living in one spot. See also: In addition to genetics, some environmental factors might play a role in causing ADHD. Alcohol intake during pregnancy can cause which can include ADHD or symptoms like it. Children exposed to certain toxic substances, such as or , may develop problems which resemble ADHD. Exposure to the insecticides and is associated with an increased risk; however, the evidence is not conclusive. Exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy can cause problems with central nervous system development and can increase the risk of ADHD. Extreme , very , and extreme neglect, abuse, or social deprivation also increase the risk as do certain infections during pregnancy, at birth, and in early childhood. These infections include, among others, various viruses (, , , ). There is an association between long term but not short term use of during pregnancy and ADHD. At least 30% of children with a later develop ADHD and about 5% of cases are due to brain damage. Some studies suggest that in a small number of children, artificial or may be associated with an increased prevalence of ADHD or ADHD-like symptoms, but the evidence is weak and may only apply to children with . The and the have put in place regulatory measures based on these concerns. In a minority of children, or to certain foods may worsen ADHD symptoms. Research does not support popular beliefs that ADHD is caused by eating too much refined sugar, watching too much television, parenting, poverty or family chaos; however, they might worsen ADHD symptoms in certain people. The youngest children in a class have been found to be more likely to be diagnosed as having ADHD, possibly due to their being developmentally behind their older classmates. This effect has been seen across a number of countries. They also appear to use ADHD medications at nearly twice the rate as their peers. In some cases, the diagnosis of ADHD may reflect a or a poor , rather than problems with the individuals themselves. In other cases, it may be explained by increasing academic expectations, with a diagnosis being a method for parents in some countries to get extra financial and educational support for their child. Typical behaviors of ADHD occur more commonly in children who have experienced violence and emotional abuse. The suggests that because the boundaries between ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" behavior are socially constructed, (i.e. jointly created and validated by all members of society, and in particular by , parents, teachers, and others) it then follows that subjective valuations and judgements determine which diagnostic criteria are used and, thus, the number of people affected. This could lead to the situation where the DSM-IV arrives at levels of ADHD three to four times higher than those obtained with the ICD-10. , a supporter of this theory, has argued that ADHD was "" ... invented and then given a name"". Current models of ADHD suggest that it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brain's , particularly those involving and . The dopamine and norepinephrine pathways that originate in the and project to diverse regions of the brain and govern a variety of cognitive processes. The and which project to the and are directly responsible for modulating (cognitive control of behavior), motivation, reward perception, and motor function; these pathways are known to play a central role in the of ADHD. Larger models of ADHD with additional pathways have been proposed. The left prefrontal cortex is often affected in ADHD. In children with ADHD, there is a general reduction of volume in certain brain structures, with a proportionally greater decrease in the volume in the left-sided . The also shows thinning in individuals with ADHD compared to controls. Other brain structures in the prefrontal-striatal-cerebellar and prefrontal-striatal-thalamic circuits have also been found to differ between people with and without ADHD. The subcortical volumes of the , , , , and appears smaller in individuals with ADHD compared with controls. Inter-hemispheric asymmetries in tracts have also been noted in children with ADHD, suggesting that disruptions in temporal integration may be related to the behavioral characteristics of ADHD. Previously it was thought that the elevated number of in people with ADHD was part of the pathophysiology but it appears that the elevated numbers are due to adaptation to exposure to stimulants. Current models involve the and the . ADHD psychostimulants possess treatment efficacy because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems. There may additionally be abnormalities in , , or pathways. The symptoms of ADHD arise from a deficiency in certain (e.g., , , and ). Executive functions are a set of that are required to successfully select and monitor behaviors that facilitate the attainment of one's chosen goals. The executive function impairments that occur in ADHD individuals result in problems with staying organized, time keeping, excessive , maintaining concentration, paying attention, ignoring distractions, regulating emotions, and remembering details. People with ADHD appear to have unimpaired long-term memory, and deficits in long-term recall appear to be attributed to impairments in working memory. The criteria for an executive function deficit are met in 30–50% of children and adolescents with ADHD. One study found that 80% of individuals with ADHD were impaired in at least one executive function task, compared to 50% for individuals without ADHD. Due to the rates of brain maturation and the increasing demands for executive control as a person gets older, ADHD impairments may not fully manifest themselves until adolescence or even early adulthood. ADHD has also been associated with motivational deficits in children. Children with ADHD often find it difficult to focus on long-term over short-term rewards, and exhibit impulsive behavior for short-term rewards. ADHD is diagnosed by an assessment of a child's behavioral and mental development, including ruling out the effects of drugs, medications and other medical or psychiatric problems as explanations for the symptoms. It often takes into account feedback from parents and teachers with most diagnoses begun after a teacher raises concerns. It may be viewed as the extreme end of one or more continuous found in all people. Whether someone responds to medications does not confirm or rule out the diagnosis. As imaging studies of the brain do not give consistent results between individuals, they are only used for research purposes and not diagnosis. In North America, DSM-V criteria are used for diagnosis, while European countries usually use the ICD-10. With the DSM-IV criteria a diagnosis of ADHD is more likely than with the ICD-10 criteria. It is classified as . Additionally, it is classified as a along with ODD, CD, and . A diagnosis does not imply a . Associated conditions that should be screened for include anxiety, depression, ODD, conduct disorder, and learning and language disorders. Other conditions that should be considered are other neurodevelopmental disorders, , and . Diagnosis of ADHD using (QEEG) is an ongoing area of investigation, although the value of QEEG in ADHD is currently unclear. In the United States, the has approved the use of QEEG to evaluate ADHD. The approved test uses the ratio of EEG to activity to guide diagnosis; however, at least five studies have failed to replicate the finding. Self-rating scales, such as the and the are used in the screening and evaluation of ADHD. As with many other psychiatric disorders, formal diagnosis should be made by a qualified professional based on a set number of criteria. In the United States, these criteria are defined by the in the . Based on the DSM criteria, there are three sub-types of ADHD: type (ADHD-PI) presents with symptoms including being easily distracted, forgetful, daydreaming, disorganization, poor concentration, and difficulty completing tasks. ADHD, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type presents with excessive fidgetiness and restlessness, hyperactivity, difficulty waiting and remaining seated, immature behavior; destructive behaviors may also be present. ADHD, combined type is a combination of the first two subtypes. This subdivision is based on presence of at least six out of nine long-term (lasting at least six months) symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity–impulsivity, or both. To be considered, the symptoms must have appeared by the age of six to twelve and occur in more than one environment (e.g. at home and at school or work). The symptoms must be for a child of that age and there must be clear evidence that they are causing social, school or work related problems. In the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems () by the , the symptoms of are analogous to ADHD in the DSM-5. When a (as defined by ICD-10) is present, the condition is referred to as . Otherwise, the disorder is classified as , or . The latter is sometimes referred to as . In the implementation version of , the disorder is classified under 6A05 and hyperkinetic disorder no longer exists. The defined subtypes are similar to those of the DSM: (6A05.0); (6A05.1); (6A05.2). However, the ICD-11 includes two 'residual' categories for individuals who do not quite match any of the defined subtypes: (6A05.Y) where the clinician includes detail on the individual's presentation; and (6A05.Z) where the clinician does not provide detail. Main article: Adults with ADHD are diagnosed under the same criteria, including that their signs must have been present by the age of six to twelve. Questioning parents or guardians as to how the person behaved and developed as a child may form part of the assessment; a family history of ADHD also adds weight to a diagnosis. While the core symptoms of ADHD are similar in children and adults they often present differently in adults than in children, for example excessive physical activity seen in children may present as feelings of restlessness and constant mental activity in adults. It is estimated that between 2–5% of adults have ADHD. Around 25–50% of children with ADHD continue to experience ADHD symptoms into adulthood, while the rest experience fewer or no symptoms. Currently, most adults remain untreated. Many adults with ADHD without diagnosis and treatment have a disorganized life and some use or as a coping mechanism. Other problems may include relationship and job difficulties, and an increased risk of criminal activities. Associated mental health problems include: depression, anxiety disorder, and learning disabilities. Some ADHD symptoms in adults differ from those seen in children. While children with ADHD may climb and run about excessively, adults may experience an inability to relax, or they talk excessively in social situations. Adults with ADHD may start relationships impulsively, display sensation-seeking behavior, and be short-tempered. Addictive behavior such as substance abuse and are common. The DSM-V criteria do specifically deal with adults, unlike those in DSM-IV, which were criticized for not being appropriate for adults; those who presented differently may lead to the claim that they outgrew the diagnosis. Having ADHD symptoms since childhood is usually required to be diagnosed with adult ADHD. However, a proportion of adults who meet criteria for ADHD would not have been diagnosed with ADHD as children. Most cases of late-onset ADHD develop the disorder between the ages of 12-16 and can therefore be considered early adult or adolescent onset ADHD. feelings of hopelessness, or unhappiness Symptoms of ADHD, such as low mood and poor self-image, mood swings, and irritability, can be confused with , or as well as with . Some symptoms that are due to anxiety disorders, antisocial personality disorder, developmental disabilities or mental retardation or the effects of substance abuse such as intoxication and withdrawal can overlap with some ADHD. These disorders can also sometimes occur along with ADHD. Medical conditions which can cause ADHD-type symptoms include: , , , , , , , untreated , and . Primary sleep disorders may affect attention and behavior and the symptoms of ADHD may affect sleep. It is thus recommended that children with ADHD be regularly assessed for sleep problems. Sleepiness in children may result in symptoms ranging from the classic ones of yawning and rubbing the eyes, to hyperactivity and inattentiveness. can also cause ADHD-type symptoms. Rare tumors called and may cause similar symptoms to ADHD. Reviews of ADHD have noted that platelet expression, urinary , urinary , and urinary levels consistently differ between ADHD individuals and healthy control. These measurements could potentially serve as diagnostic biomarkers for ADHD, but more research is needed to establish their diagnostic utility. Urinary and phenethylamine concentrations are lower in ADHD individuals relative to controls and the two most commonly prescribed drugs for ADHD, and , increase phenethylamine in treatment-responsive individuals with ADHD. Lower urinary phenethylamine concentrations are also associated with symptoms of inattentiveness in ADHD individuals. (EEG) is not accurate enough to make the diagnosis. Main article: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder management The management of ADHD typically involves or medications either alone or in combination. While treatment may improve long-term outcomes, it does not get rid of negative outcomes entirely. Medications used include stimulants, atomoxetine, agonists, and sometimes antidepressants. In those who have trouble focusing on long-term rewards, a large amount of improves task performance. ADHD stimulants also improve persistence and task performance in children with ADHD. There is good evidence for the use of in ADHD and they are the recommended first line treatment in those who have mild symptoms or are preschool-aged. Psychological therapies used include: input, , , , , school-based interventions, social skills training, behavioral peer intervention, organization training, and . has been used, but it is unclear whether it is useful. Parent training may improve a number of behavioral problems including oppositional and non compliant behaviors. There is little high quality research on the effectiveness of family therapy for ADHD, but the evidence that exists shows that it is similar to community care and better than placebo. ADHD-specific support groups can provide information and may help families cope with ADHD. Training in social skills, behavioral modification and medication may have some limited beneficial effects. The most important factor in reducing later psychological problems, such as major depression, , school failure, and substance use disorders is formation of friendships with people who are not involved in delinquent activities. medications are the pharmaceutical treatment of choice. They improve symptoms in 80% of people, although improvement is not sustained if medication is ceased. appears to improve symptoms as reported by teachers and parents. Stimulants may also reduce the risk of unintentional injuries in children with ADHD. studies suggest that long-term treatment with amphetamine or methylphenidate decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD. A 2018 review found the greatest short-term benefit with methylphenidate in children and amphetamines in adults. The long-term effects of ADHD medication have yet to be fully determined, although stimulants are generally beneficial and safe for up to 2 years. However, there are side-effects and contraindications to their use. There is low-quality evidence of serious or non-serious harmful side effects due to methylphenidate taken by children and adolescents. Careful monitoring of children while taking this medication is recommended. A large overdose of ADHD stimulants is commonly associated with symptoms such as and . Although very rare, at therapeutic doses these events appear to occur in approximately 0.1% of individuals within the first several weeks after starting amphetamine therapy. Administration of an medication has been found to effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. Regular monitoring has been recommended in those on long-term treatment. Stimulant therapy should be stopped periodically to assess continuing need for medication, decrease possible growth delay, and reduce tolerance. Long-term misuse of stimulant medications at doses above the therapeutic range for ADHD treatment is associated with and . Untreated ADHD, however, is also associated with elevated risk of substance use disorders, conduct disorders. The use of stimulants appears to either reduce these risks or have no effect on it. The negative consequences of untreated ADHD has lead some guidelines to conclude that the dangers of not treating severe ADHD are greater than the potential risks of medication, regardless of age. The safety of these medications in pregnancy is unclear. There are a number of non-stimulant medications, such as , , , and that may be used as alternatives, or added to stimulant therapy. There are no good studies comparing the various medications; however, they appear more or less equal with respect to side effects. Stimulants appear to improve academic performance while atomoxetine does not. Atomoxetine, due to its lack of addiction liability, may be preferred in those who are at risk of recreational or compulsive stimulant use. There is little evidence on the effects of medication on social behaviors. Antipsychotics may also be used to treat aggression in ADHD. on when to use medications vary by country. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends use for children only in severe cases, though for adults medication is a first-line treatment. Conversely, most United States guidelines recommend medications in most age groups. Medications are especially not recommended for preschool children. Underdosing of stimulants can occur and result in a lack of response or later loss of effectiveness. This is particularly common in adolescents and adults as approved dosing is based on school-aged children, causing some practitioners to use weight-based or benefit-based off-label dosing instead. Regular , particularly , is an effective for ADHD in children and adults, particularly when combined with stimulant medication, although the best intensity and type of aerobic exercise for improving symptoms are not currently known. In particular, the long-term effects of regular aerobic exercise in ADHD individuals include better behavior and motor abilities, improved (including attention, , and , among other cognitive domains), faster , and better memory. Parent-teacher ratings of behavioral and socio-emotional outcomes in response to regular aerobic exercise include: better overall function, reduced ADHD symptoms, better self-esteem, reduced levels of anxiety and depression, fewer somatic complaints, better academic and classroom behavior, and improved social behavior. Exercising while on stimulant medication augments the effect of stimulant medication on executive function. It is believed that these short-term effects of exercise are mediated by an increased abundance of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. are not recommended as of 2019 by the , the , or the due to insufficient evidence. A 2013 meta-analysis found less than a third of children with ADHD see some improvement in symptoms with supplementation or decreased eating of artificial food coloring. These benefits may be limited to children with food sensitivities or those who are simultaneously being treated with ADHD medications. This review also found that evidence does not support removing other foods from the diet to treat ADHD. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid supplementation was found by a 2018 review to not improve ADHD outcomes. A 2014 review found that an results in a small overall benefit in a minority of children, such as those with allergies. A 2016 review stated that the use of a as standard ADHD treatment is not advised. A 2017 review showed that a few-foods elimination diet may help children too young to be medicated or not responding to medication, while free fatty acid supplementation or decreased eating of artificial food coloring as standard ADHD treatment is not advised. Chronic deficiencies of iron, magnesium and iodine may have a negative impact on ADHD symptoms. There is a small amount of evidence that lower tissue levels may be associated with ADHD. In the absence of a demonstrated (which is rare outside of developing countries), is not recommended as treatment for ADHD. However, zinc supplementation may reduce the minimum of when it is used with amphetamine for the treatment of ADHD. ADHD persists into adulthood in about 30–50% of cases. Those affected are likely to develop coping mechanisms as they mature, thus compensating to some extent for their previous symptoms. Children with ADHD have a higher risk of unintentional injuries. One study from Denmark found an increased risk of death among those with ADHD due to the increased rate of accidents. Effects of medication on functional impairment and (e.g. reduced risk of accidents) have been found across multiple domains. Rates of smoking among those with ADHD are higher than in the general population at about 40%. Main article: Epidemiology of attention deficit hyperactive disorder Percent of people 4–17 ever diagnosed in the US as of 2011 ADHD is estimated to affect about 6–7% of people aged 18 and under when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria. When diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria rates in this age group are estimated at 1–2%. Children in North America appear to have a higher rate of ADHD than children in Africa and the Middle East; this is believed to be due to differing methods of diagnosis rather than a difference in underlying frequency. If the same diagnostic methods are used, the rates are more or less the same between countries. It is diagnosed approximately three times more often in boys than in girls. This difference between sexes may reflect either a difference in susceptibility or that females with ADHD are less likely to be diagnosed than males. Rates of diagnosis and treatment have increased in both the United Kingdom and the United States since the 1970s. Prior to 1970, it was rare for children to be diagnosed with ADHD while in the 1970s rates were about 1%. This is believed to be primarily due to changes in how the condition is diagnosed and how readily people are willing to treat it with medications rather than a true change in how common the condition is. It is believed that changes to the diagnostic criteria in 2013 with the release of the DSM-5 will increase the percentage of people diagnosed with ADHD, especially among adults. Timeline of ADHD diagnostic criteria, prevalence, and treatment Main article: History of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Hyperactivity has long been part of the human condition. Sir describes ""mental restlessness"" in his book An inquiry into the nature and origin of mental derangement written in 1798. He made observations about children showing signs of being inattentive and having the “fidgets”. The first clear description of ADHD is credited to in 1902 during a series of lectures he gave to the Royal College of Physicians of London. He noted both nature and nurture could be influencing this disorder. proposed an association between brain damage and behavioral or learning problems which was able to be validated by the encephalitis lethargica epidemic from 1917 through 1928. The terminology used to describe the condition has changed over time and has included: in the DSM-I (1952) ""minimal brain dysfunction,"" in the DSM-II (1968) ""hyperkinetic reaction of childhood,"" and in the DSM-III (1980) ""attention-deficit disorder (ADD) with or without hyperactivity."" In 1987 this was changed to ADHD in the DSM-III-R and the DSM-IV in 1994 split the diagnosis into three subtypes, ADHD , ADHD hyperactive-impulsive type and ADHD combined type. These terms were kept in the DSM-5 in 2013. Other terms have included ""minimal brain damage"" used in the 1930s. In 1934, became the first medication approved for use in the United States. Methylphenidate was introduced in the 1950s, and dextroamphetamine in the 1970s. The use of stimulants to treat ADHD was first described in 1937. Charles Bradley gave the children with behavioral disorders Benzedrine and found it improved academic performance and behavior. Until the 1990s, many studies ""implicated the prefrontal-striatal network as being smaller in children with ADHD"". During this same period, a genetic component was identified and ADHD was acknowledged to be a persistent, long-term disorder which lasted from childhood into adulthood. ADHD was split into the current three sub-types because of a field trial completed by Lahey and colleagues. Main article: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder controversies ADHD, its diagnosis, and its treatment have been controversial since the 1970s. The controversies involve clinicians, teachers, policymakers, parents, and the media. Positions range from the view that ADHD is within the normal range of behavior to the hypothesis that ADHD is a genetic condition. Other areas of controversy include the use of stimulant medications in children, the method of diagnosis, and the possibility of overdiagnosis. In 2009, the , while acknowledging the controversy, states that the current treatments and methods of diagnosis are based on the dominant view of the academic literature. In 2014, , one of the early advocates for recognition of the disorder, spoke out against overdiagnosis in a article. In contrast, a 2014 peer-reviewed medical literature review indicated that ADHD is under diagnosed in adults. With widely differing rates of diagnosis across countries, states within countries, races, and ethnicities, some suspect factors other than the presence of the symptoms of ADHD are playing a role in diagnosis. Some sociologists consider ADHD to be an example of the of deviant behavior, that is, the turning of the previously issue of school performance into a medical one. Most healthcare providers accept ADHD as a genuine disorder, at least in the small number of people with severe symptoms. Among healthcare providers the debate mainly centers on diagnosis and treatment in the much greater number of people with mild symptoms. American Psychiatric Association (2013).

Up till now, there is no conclusive evidence for a relationship between ADHD and CD.

It is possible that in untreated patients with CD, neurologic symptoms such as chronic fatigue, inattention, pain, and headache could predispose patients to ADHD-like behavior (mainly symptoms of inattentive type), which may be alleviated after GFD treatment.

It promotes the ""cognitive control"" of behavior: the selection and successful monitoring of behavior to facilitate attainment of chosen goals. Aspects of cognitive control in which DA plays a role include working memory, the ability to hold information ""on line"" in order to guide actions, suppression of prepotent behaviors that compete with goal-directed actions, and control of attention and thus the ability to overcome distractions. Cognitive control is impaired in several disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. ...

As most treatment guidelines and prescribing information for stimulant medications relate to experience in school-aged children, prescribed doses for older patients are lacking. Emerging evidence for both methylphenidate and Adderall indicate that when weight-corrected daily doses, equipotent with those used in the treatment of younger patients, are used to treat adults with ADHD, these patients show a very robust clinical response consistent with that observed in pediatric studies. These data suggest that older patients may require a more aggressive approach in terms of dosing, based on the same target dosage ranges that have already been established – for methylphenidate, 1–1.5–2 mg/kg/day, and for D,L-amphetamine, 0.5–0.75–1 mg/kg/day.... In particular, adolescents and adults are vulnerable to underdosing, and are thus at potential risk of failing to receive adequate dosage levels. As with all therapeutic agents, the efficacy and safety of stimulant medications should always guide prescribing behavior: careful dosage titration of the selected stimulant product should help to ensure that each patient with ADHD receives an adequate dose, so that the clinical benefits of therapy can be fully attained.

Neurodevelopmental disorder marked by difficulty focusing, or excessive activity and impulsive behavior Attention-deficit disorder, hyperkinetic disorder (ICD-10) People with ADHD may find it more difficult than others to focus on and complete tasks such as schoolwork. Difficulty paying , excessive activity, Based on symptoms after other possible causes ruled out Normally active young child, , , , , () is a characterized by , or excessive activity and , which are otherwise not Some individuals with ADHD also display difficulty regulating emotions or problems with . For a diagnosis, the symptoms should appear before a person is twelve years old, be present for more than six months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities). In children, problems paying attention may result in poor . Additionally, there is an association with other and . Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many people with ADHD can have sustained attention for tasks they find interesting or rewarding (known as ). Despite being the most commonly studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children and adolescents, the precise cause or causes are unknown in the majority of cases. Genetic factors are estimated to make up about 75% of the risk. Nicotine exposure during pregnancy may be an environmental risk. It does not appear to be related to the style of parenting or discipline. It affects about 5–7% of children when diagnosed via the criteria and 1–2% when diagnosed via the criteria. As of 2019, it was estimated to affect 84.7 million people globally. Rates are similar between countries and differences in rates depend mostly on how it is diagnosed. ADHD is diagnosed approximately two times more often in boys than in girls, although the disorder is often overlooked in girls because their symptoms are often less disruptive. About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have and between 2–5% of adults have the condition. In adults, inner restlessness, rather than hyperactivity, may occur. Adults often develop which compensate for some or all of their impairments. The condition can be difficult to tell apart from other conditions, as well as from high levels of activity within the range of normal behavior. recommendations vary by country and usually involve some combination of medications, , and lifestyle changes. The British guideline emphasises environmental modifications and education for individuals and carers about ADHD as the first response. If symptoms persist, then parent-training, medication, or psychotherapy (especially ) can be recommended based on age. Canadian and American guidelines recommend medications and behavioral therapy together, except in preschool-aged children for whom the first-line treatment is behavioral therapy alone. For children and adolescents older than 5, treatment with stimulants is effective for at least 24 months; however, their long-term effectiveness is unclear and there are potentially serious side effects. The medical literature has described symptoms similar to those of ADHD since the 18th century. ADHD, its diagnosis, and its treatment have been since the 1970s. The controversies have involved clinicians, teachers, policymakers, parents, and the media. Topics include ADHD's causes and the use of stimulant medications in its treatment. Most healthcare providers accept ADHD as a genuine disorder in children and adults, and the debate in the scientific community mainly centers on how it is diagnosed and treated. The condition was officially known as () from 1980 to 1987, while before this it was known as . Inattention, hyperactivity (restlessness in adults), disruptive behavior, and impulsivity are common in ADHD. Academic difficulties are frequent as are problems with relationships. The symptoms can be difficult to define, as it is hard to draw a line at where normal levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity end and significant levels requiring interventions begin. According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (), symptoms must be present for six months or more to a degree that is much greater than others of the and they must cause significant problems functioning in at least two settings (e.g., social, school/work, or home). The criteria must have been met prior to age twelve in order to receive a diagnosis of ADHD. This requires at least 6 symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity for those under 17 and at least 5 for those 17 years or older. ADHD is divided into three primary subtypes: (ADHD-PI or ADHD-I), predominantly hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD-PH or ADHD-HI), and combined type (ADHD-C). The table ""DSM-5 symptoms"" lists the symptoms for ADHD-I and ADHD HI. Symptoms which can be better explained by another psychiatric or medical condition, which the individual has, are excluded. Most or all of the following symptoms, excluding situations where these symptoms are better explained by another psychiatric or medical condition: Be easily distracted, miss details, forget things, and frequently switch from one activity to another Become bored with a task after only a few minutes, unless doing something they find enjoyable Have difficulty focusing attention on organizing or completing a task Have trouble completing or turning in homework assignments, often losing things (e.g., pencils, toys, assignments) needed to complete tasks or activities Have difficulty processing information as quickly and accurately as others Have trouble understanding details; overlooks details Most or all of the following symptoms, excluding situations where these symptoms are better explained by another psychiatric or medical condition: Dash around, touching or playing with anything and everything in sight; Have trouble sitting still during dinner, school, and while doing homework; Have difficulty performing quiet tasks or activities; Blurt out inappropriate comments, show their emotions without restraint, and act without regard for consequences; Have difficulty waiting for things they want or waiting their turn in games; Often interrupt conversations or others' activities; Meet the criteria for both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive ADHD. Girls with ADHD tend to display fewer hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms but more symptoms pertaining to inattention and distractibility. Symptoms of hyperactivity tend to go away with age and turn into ""inner restlessness"" in teens and adults with ADHD. People with ADHD of all ages are more likely to have problems with , such as social interaction and forming and maintaining friendships. This is true for all subtypes. About half of children and adolescents with ADHD experience social rejection by their peers compared to 10–15% of non-ADHD children and adolescents. People with attention deficits are prone to having difficulty processing verbal and nonverbal language which can negatively affect social interaction. They also may drift off during conversations, miss social cues, and have trouble learning social skills. Difficulties managing anger are more common in children with ADHD as are poor and delays in and motor development. Although it causes significant difficulty, many children with ADHD have an attention span equal to or better than that of other children for tasks and subjects they find interesting. In children, ADHD occurs with other disorders about two-thirds of the time. Some commonly associated conditions include: (ASD): this disorder affects social skills, ability to communicate, behaviour, and interests. As of 2013, the allows for a simultaneous diagnosis of both ASD and ADHD. have been found to occur more commonly in the ADHD population. have been found to occur in about 20–30% of children with ADHD. Learning disabilities can include developmental speech and language disorders and academic skills disorders. ADHD, however, is not considered a learning disability, but it very frequently causes academic difficulties. . Adolescents and adults with ADHD are at increased risk of . This is most commonly seen with or . The reason for this may be an altered reward pathway in the brains of ADHD individuals. This makes the evaluation and treatment of ADHD more difficult, with serious substance misuse problems usually treated first due to their greater risks. and ADHD commonly co-exist. They can also occur as a side effect of medications used to treat ADHD. In children with ADHD, is the most common sleep disorder with behavioral therapy the preferred treatment. Problems with sleep initiation are common among individuals with ADHD but often they will be deep sleepers and have significant difficulty getting up in the morning. is sometimes used in children who have sleep onset insomnia. (ODD) occurs in about 25% of children with an inattentive presentation and 50% of those with a combined presentation. It is characterized by angry or irritable mood, argumentative or defiant behaviour and vindictiveness which are age-inappropriate. (CD) occurs in about 25% of adolescents with ADHD. It is characterized by aggression, destruction of property, deceitfulness, theft and violations of rules. Adolescents with ADHD who also have CD are more likely to develop in adulthood. Brain imaging supports that conduct disorder and ADHD are separate conditions. (SCT) is a cluster of symptoms that potentially comprises another attention disorder. It may occur in 30–50% of ADHD cases, regardless of the subtype. (especially and ). Boys diagnosed with the combined ADHD subtype are more likely to have a mood disorder. Adults with ADHD sometimes also have bipolar disorder, which requires careful assessment to accurately diagnose and treat both conditions. has been found to be more common in those with ADHD and is often due to . However, restless legs can simply be a part of ADHD and requires careful assessment to differentiate between the two disorders. People with ADHD have an increased risk of . A 2016 systematic review found a well established association between ADHD and obesity, and sleep disorders, and tentative evidence for association with and , while another 2016 systematic review did not support a clear link between celiac disease and ADHD, and stated that routine in people with ADHD is discouraged. Certain studies have found that people with ADHD tend to have lower scores on (IQ) tests. The significance of this is controversial due to the differences between people with ADHD and the difficulty determining the influence of symptoms, such as distractibility, on lower scores rather than intellectual capacity. In studies of ADHD, higher IQs may be over represented because many studies exclude individuals who have lower IQs despite those with ADHD scoring on average nine points lower on standardized intelligence measures. In individuals with high intelligence, there is increased risk of a missed ADHD diagnosis, possibly because of compensatory strategies in highly intelligent individuals. Studies of adults suggest that negative differences in intelligence are not meaningful and may be explained by associated health problems. Possible positive traits of ADHD are a new avenue of research, and therefore limited. Studies are being done on whether ADHD symptoms could potentially be beneficial. A 2020 review found that creativity may be associated with ADHD symptoms, particularly and quantity of creative achievements, but not with the disorder of ADHD itself. Divergent thinking is the ability to produce creative solutions which differ significantly from each other, and consider the issue from multiple perspectives. Those with ADHD symptoms could be advantaged in this form of creativity as they tend to have diffuse attention, allowing rapid switching between aspects of the task under consideration; flexible , allowing them to remember and use more distantly-related ideas which is associated with creativity; and impulsivity, which causes people with ADHD symptoms to consider ideas which others may not have. However, people with ADHD may struggle with , which is a process of creativity that requires sustained effort and consistent use of executive functions to weed out solutions which aren't creative from a single area of inquiry. People with the actual disorder often struggle with executive functioning. In entrepreneurship, there has been interest in the traits of people with ADHD. This is due in part to a number of high-profile entrepreneurs having traits that could be associated with ADHD. Some people with ADHD are interested in entrepreneurship, and have some traits which could be considered useful to entrepreneurial skills: , , impulsivity, risk-taking, and hyper-focus. On a purely mechanical level, the symptomatic mechanisms of ADHD are generally understood. ADHD is generally the result of neurological dysfunction, more specifically, processes related to the production and use of in the brain. With that said, most ADHD cases are of unknown causes. It is believed to involve interactions between genetics, the environment, and social factors. Certain cases are related to previous infection or trauma to the brain. indicate that the disorder is often inherited from the person's parents, with genetics determining about 75% of cases in children and 35% to potentially 75% of cases in adults. Siblings of children with ADHD are three to four times more likely to develop the disorder than siblings of children without the disorder. Arousal is related to , and ADHD presents with low dopaminergic functioning. Typically, a number of genes are involved, many of which directly affect neurotransmission. Those involved with dopamine include , , , , , , and Other genes associated with ADHD include , , , , , , and . A common variant of a gene called is estimated to be responsible for about 9% of cases and when this variant is present, people are particularly responsive to stimulant medication. The (DRD4–7R) causes increased inhibitory effects induced by and is associated with ADHD. The DRD4 receptor is a that inhibits . The DRD4–7R mutation results in a wide range of behavioral , including ADHD symptoms reflecting split attention. The DRD4 gene is both linked to novelty seeking and ADHD. People with are more likely to have ADHD. The genes domain-containing 1 (GFOD1) and (CHD13) show strong genetic associations with ADHD. CHD13's association with ASD, , , and make it an interesting candidate causative gene. Another candidate causative gene that has been identified is adhesion-G protein-coupled-receptor-L3 (ADGRL3). In Zebrafish, knockout of this gene causes a loss of dopaminergic function in the ventral and the fish display a hyperactive/impulsive . In order for to be used as a tool for diagnosis, more validating studies need to be performed. However, smaller studies have shown that in genes related to neurotransmission or the complex of the can reliably predict a person's response to . Rare genetic variants show more relevant clinical significance as their penetrance (the chance of developing the disorder) tends to be much higher. However their usefulness as tools for diagnosis is limited as no single gene predicts ADHD. ASD shows genetic overlap with ADHD at both common and rare levels of genetic variation. may have played a role in the high rates of ADHD, particularly hyperactive and impulsive traits in males. Some have hypothesized that some women may be more attracted to males who are risk takers, increasing the frequency of genes that predispose to hyperactivity and in the gene pool. Others have claimed that these traits may be an adaptation that help males face stressful or dangerous environments with, for example, increased impulsivity and exploratory behavior. In certain situations, ADHD traits may have been beneficial to society as a whole even while being harmful to the individual. The high rates and heterogeneity of ADHD may have increased and benefited society by adding diversity to the despite being detrimental to the individual. In certain environments, some ADHD traits may have offered personal advantages to individuals, such as quicker response to predators or . In the Ariaal people of Kenya, the 7R allele of the DRD4 gene results in better health in those who are but not those who are living in one spot. See also: In addition to genetics, some environmental factors might play a role in causing ADHD. Alcohol intake during pregnancy can cause which can include ADHD or symptoms like it. Children exposed to certain toxic substances, such as or , may develop problems which resemble ADHD. Exposure to the insecticides and is associated with an increased risk; however, the evidence is not conclusive. Exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy can cause problems with central nervous system development and can increase the risk of ADHD. Extreme , very , and extreme neglect, abuse, or social deprivation also increase the risk as do certain infections during pregnancy, at birth, and in early childhood. These infections include, among others, various viruses (, , , ). There is an association between long term but not short term use of during pregnancy and ADHD. At least 30% of children with a later develop ADHD and about 5% of cases are due to brain damage. Some studies suggest that in a small number of children, artificial or may be associated with an increased prevalence of ADHD or ADHD-like symptoms, but the evidence is weak and may only apply to children with . The and the have put in place regulatory measures based on these concerns. In a minority of children, or to certain foods may worsen ADHD symptoms. Research does not support popular beliefs that ADHD is caused by eating too much refined sugar, watching too much television, parenting, poverty or family chaos; however, they might worsen ADHD symptoms in certain people. The youngest children in a class have been found to be more likely to be diagnosed as having ADHD, possibly due to their being developmentally behind their older classmates. This effect has been seen across a number of countries. They also appear to use ADHD medications at nearly twice the rate as their peers. In some cases, the diagnosis of ADHD may reflect a or a poor , rather than problems with the individuals themselves. In other cases, it may be explained by increasing academic expectations, with a diagnosis being a method for parents in some countries to get extra financial and educational support for their child. Typical behaviors of ADHD occur more commonly in children who have experienced violence and emotional abuse. The suggests that because the boundaries between ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" behavior are socially constructed, (i.e. jointly created and validated by all members of society, and in particular by , parents, teachers, and others) it then follows that subjective valuations and judgements determine which diagnostic criteria are used and, thus, the number of people affected. This could lead to the situation where the DSM-IV arrives at levels of ADHD three to four times higher than those obtained with the ICD-10. , a supporter of this theory, has argued that ADHD was "" ... invented and then given a name"". Current models of ADHD suggest that it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brain's , particularly those involving and . The dopamine and norepinephrine pathways that originate in the and project to diverse regions of the brain and govern a variety of cognitive processes. The and which project to the and are directly responsible for modulating (cognitive control of behavior), motivation, reward perception, and motor function; these pathways are known to play a central role in the of ADHD. Larger models of ADHD with additional pathways have been proposed. The left prefrontal cortex is often affected in ADHD. In children with ADHD, there is a general reduction of volume in certain brain structures, with a proportionally greater decrease in the volume in the left-sided . The also shows thinning in individuals with ADHD compared to controls. Other brain structures in the prefrontal-striatal-cerebellar and prefrontal-striatal-thalamic circuits have also been found to differ between people with and without ADHD. The subcortical volumes of the , , , , and appears smaller in individuals with ADHD compared with controls. Inter-hemispheric asymmetries in tracts have also been noted in children with ADHD, suggesting that disruptions in temporal integration may be related to the behavioral characteristics of ADHD. Previously it was thought that the elevated number of in people with ADHD was part of the pathophysiology but it appears that the elevated numbers are due to adaptation to exposure to stimulants. Current models involve the and the . ADHD psychostimulants possess treatment efficacy because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems. There may additionally be abnormalities in , , or pathways. The symptoms of ADHD arise from a deficiency in certain (e.g., , , and ). Executive functions are a set of that are required to successfully select and monitor behaviors that facilitate the attainment of one's chosen goals. The executive function impairments that occur in ADHD individuals result in problems with staying organized, time keeping, excessive , maintaining concentration, paying attention, ignoring distractions, regulating emotions, and remembering details. People with ADHD appear to have unimpaired long-term memory, and deficits in long-term recall appear to be attributed to impairments in working memory. The criteria for an executive function deficit are met in 30–50% of children and adolescents with ADHD. One study found that 80% of individuals with ADHD were impaired in at least one executive function task, compared to 50% for individuals without ADHD. Due to the rates of brain maturation and the increasing demands for executive control as a person gets older, ADHD impairments may not fully manifest themselves until adolescence or even early adulthood. ADHD has also been associated with motivational deficits in children. Children with ADHD often find it difficult to focus on long-term over short-term rewards, and exhibit impulsive behavior for short-term rewards. ADHD is diagnosed by an assessment of a child's behavioral and mental development, including ruling out the effects of drugs, medications and other medical or psychiatric problems as explanations for the symptoms. It often takes into account feedback from parents and teachers with most diagnoses begun after a teacher raises concerns. It may be viewed as the extreme end of one or more continuous found in all people. Whether someone responds to medications does not confirm or rule out the diagnosis. As imaging studies of the brain do not give consistent results between individuals, they are only used for research purposes and not diagnosis. In North America, DSM-V criteria are used for diagnosis, while European countries usually use the ICD-10. With the DSM-IV criteria a diagnosis of ADHD is more likely than with the ICD-10 criteria. It is classified as . Additionally, it is classified as a along with ODD, CD, and . A diagnosis does not imply a . Associated conditions that should be screened for include anxiety, depression, ODD, conduct disorder, and learning and language disorders. Other conditions that should be considered are other neurodevelopmental disorders, , and . Diagnosis of ADHD using (QEEG) is an ongoing area of investigation, although the value of QEEG in ADHD is currently unclear. In the United States, the has approved the use of QEEG to evaluate ADHD. The approved test uses the ratio of EEG to activity to guide diagnosis; however, at least five studies have failed to replicate the finding. Self-rating scales, such as the and the are used in the screening and evaluation of ADHD. As with many other psychiatric disorders, formal diagnosis should be made by a qualified professional based on a set number of criteria. In the United States, these criteria are defined by the in the . Based on the DSM criteria, there are three sub-types of ADHD: type (ADHD-PI) presents with symptoms including being easily distracted, forgetful, daydreaming, disorganization, poor concentration, and difficulty completing tasks. ADHD, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type presents with excessive fidgetiness and restlessness, hyperactivity, difficulty waiting and remaining seated, immature behavior; destructive behaviors may also be present. ADHD, combined type is a combination of the first two subtypes. This subdivision is based on presence of at least six out of nine long-term (lasting at least six months) symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity–impulsivity, or both. To be considered, the symptoms must have appeared by the age of six to twelve and occur in more than one environment (e.g. at home and at school or work). The symptoms must be for a child of that age and there must be clear evidence that they are causing social, school or work related problems. In the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems () by the , the symptoms of are analogous to ADHD in the DSM-5. When a (as defined by ICD-10) is present, the condition is referred to as . Otherwise, the disorder is classified as , or . The latter is sometimes referred to as . In the implementation version of , the disorder is classified under 6A05 and hyperkinetic disorder no longer exists. The defined subtypes are similar to those of the DSM: (6A05.0); (6A05.1); (6A05.2). However, the ICD-11 includes two 'residual' categories for individuals who do not quite match any of the defined subtypes: (6A05.Y) where the clinician includes detail on the individual's presentation; and (6A05.Z) where the clinician does not provide detail. Main article: Adults with ADHD are diagnosed under the same criteria, including that their signs must have been present by the age of six to twelve. Questioning parents or guardians as to how the person behaved and developed as a child may form part of the assessment; a family history of ADHD also adds weight to a diagnosis. While the core symptoms of ADHD are similar in children and adults they often present differently in adults than in children, for example excessive physical activity seen in children may present as feelings of restlessness and constant mental activity in adults. It is estimated that between 2–5% of adults have ADHD. Around 25–50% of children with ADHD continue to experience ADHD symptoms into adulthood, while the rest experience fewer or no symptoms. Currently, most adults remain untreated. Many adults with ADHD without diagnosis and treatment have a disorganized life and some use or as a coping mechanism. Other problems may include relationship and job difficulties, and an increased risk of criminal activities. Associated mental health problems include: depression, anxiety disorder, and learning disabilities. Some ADHD symptoms in adults differ from those seen in children. While children with ADHD may climb and run about excessively, adults may experience an inability to relax, or they talk excessively in social situations. Adults with ADHD may start relationships impulsively, display sensation-seeking behavior, and be short-tempered. Addictive behavior such as substance abuse and are common. The DSM-V criteria do specifically deal with adults, unlike those in DSM-IV, which were criticized for not being appropriate for adults; those who presented differently may lead to the claim that they outgrew the diagnosis. Having ADHD symptoms since childhood is usually required to be diagnosed with adult ADHD. However, a proportion of adults who meet criteria for ADHD would not have been diagnosed with ADHD as children. Most cases of late-onset ADHD develop the disorder between the ages of 12-16 and can therefore be considered early adult or adolescent onset ADHD. feelings of hopelessness, or unhappiness Symptoms of ADHD, such as low mood and poor self-image, mood swings, and irritability, can be confused with , or as well as with . Some symptoms that are due to anxiety disorders, antisocial personality disorder, developmental disabilities or mental retardation or the effects of substance abuse such as intoxication and withdrawal can overlap with some ADHD. These disorders can also sometimes occur along with ADHD. Medical conditions which can cause ADHD-type symptoms include: , , , , , , , untreated , and . Primary sleep disorders may affect attention and behavior and the symptoms of ADHD may affect sleep. It is thus recommended that children with ADHD be regularly assessed for sleep problems. Sleepiness in children may result in symptoms ranging from the classic ones of yawning and rubbing the eyes, to hyperactivity and inattentiveness. can also cause ADHD-type symptoms. Rare tumors called and may cause similar symptoms to ADHD. Reviews of ADHD have noted that platelet expression, urinary , urinary , and urinary levels consistently differ between ADHD individuals and healthy control. These measurements could potentially serve as diagnostic biomarkers for ADHD, but more research is needed to establish their diagnostic utility. Urinary and phenethylamine concentrations are lower in ADHD individuals relative to controls and the two most commonly prescribed drugs for ADHD, and , increase phenethylamine in treatment-responsive individuals with ADHD. Lower urinary phenethylamine concentrations are also associated with symptoms of inattentiveness in ADHD individuals. (EEG) is not accurate enough to make the diagnosis. Main article: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder management The management of ADHD typically involves or medications either alone or in combination. While treatment may improve long-term outcomes, it does not get rid of negative outcomes entirely. Medications used include stimulants, atomoxetine, agonists, and sometimes antidepressants. In those who have trouble focusing on long-term rewards, a large amount of improves task performance. ADHD stimulants also improve persistence and task performance in children with ADHD. There is good evidence for the use of in ADHD and they are the recommended first line treatment in those who have mild symptoms or are preschool-aged. Psychological therapies used include: input, , , , , school-based interventions, social skills training, behavioral peer intervention, organization training, and . has been used, but it is unclear whether it is useful. Parent training may improve a number of behavioral problems including oppositional and non compliant behaviors. There is little high quality research on the effectiveness of family therapy for ADHD, but the evidence that exists shows that it is similar to community care and better than placebo. ADHD-specific support groups can provide information and may help families cope with ADHD. Training in social skills, behavioral modification and medication may have some limited beneficial effects. The most important factor in reducing later psychological problems, such as major depression, , school failure, and substance use disorders is formation of friendships with people who are not involved in delinquent activities. medications are the pharmaceutical treatment of choice. They improve symptoms in 80% of people, although improvement is not sustained if medication is ceased. appears to improve symptoms as reported by teachers and parents. Stimulants may also reduce the risk of unintentional injuries in children with ADHD. studies suggest that long-term treatment with amphetamine or methylphenidate decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD. A 2018 review found the greatest short-term benefit with methylphenidate in children and amphetamines in adults. The long-term effects of ADHD medication have yet to be fully determined, although stimulants are generally beneficial and safe for up to 2 years. However, there are side-effects and contraindications to their use. There is low-quality evidence of serious or non-serious harmful side effects due to methylphenidate taken by children and adolescents. Careful monitoring of children while taking this medication is recommended. A large overdose of ADHD stimulants is commonly associated with symptoms such as and . Although very rare, at therapeutic doses these events appear to occur in approximately 0.1% of individuals within the first several weeks after starting amphetamine therapy. Administration of an medication has been found to effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. Regular monitoring has been recommended in those on long-term treatment. Stimulant therapy should be stopped periodically to assess continuing need for medication, decrease possible growth delay, and reduce tolerance. Long-term misuse of stimulant medications at doses above the therapeutic range for ADHD treatment is associated with and . Untreated ADHD, however, is also associated with elevated risk of substance use disorders, conduct disorders. The use of stimulants appears to either reduce these risks or have no effect on it. The negative consequences of untreated ADHD has lead some guidelines to conclude that the dangers of not treating severe ADHD are greater than the potential risks of medication, regardless of age. The safety of these medications in pregnancy is unclear. There are a number of non-stimulant medications, such as , , , and that may be used as alternatives, or added to stimulant therapy. There are no good studies comparing the various medications; however, they appear more or less equal with respect to side effects. Stimulants appear to improve academic performance while atomoxetine does not. Atomoxetine, due to its lack of addiction liability, may be preferred in those who are at risk of recreational or compulsive stimulant use. There is little evidence on the effects of medication on social behaviors. Antipsychotics may also be used to treat aggression in ADHD. on when to use medications vary by country. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends use for children only in severe cases, though for adults medication is a first-line treatment. Conversely, most United States guidelines recommend medications in most age groups. Medications are especially not recommended for preschool children. Underdosing of stimulants can occur and result in a lack of response or later loss of effectiveness. This is particularly common in adolescents and adults as approved dosing is based on school-aged children, causing some practitioners to use weight-based or benefit-based off-label dosing instead. Regular , particularly , is an effective for ADHD in children and adults, particularly when combined with stimulant medication, although the best intensity and type of aerobic exercise for improving symptoms are not currently known. In particular, the long-term effects of regular aerobic exercise in ADHD individuals include better behavior and motor abilities, improved (including attention, , and , among other cognitive domains), faster , and better memory. Parent-teacher ratings of behavioral and socio-emotional outcomes in response to regular aerobic exercise include: better overall function, reduced ADHD symptoms, better self-esteem, reduced levels of anxiety and depression, fewer somatic complaints, better academic and classroom behavior, and improved social behavior. Exercising while on stimulant medication augments the effect of stimulant medication on executive function. It is believed that these short-term effects of exercise are mediated by an increased abundance of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. are not recommended as of 2019 by the , the , or the due to insufficient evidence. A 2013 meta-analysis found less than a third of children with ADHD see some improvement in symptoms with supplementation or decreased eating of artificial food coloring. These benefits may be limited to children with food sensitivities or those who are simultaneously being treated with ADHD medications. This review also found that evidence does not support removing other foods from the diet to treat ADHD. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid supplementation was found by a 2018 review to not improve ADHD outcomes. A 2014 review found that an results in a small overall benefit in a minority of children, such as those with allergies. A 2016 review stated that the use of a as standard ADHD treatment is not advised. A 2017 review showed that a few-foods elimination diet may help children too young to be medicated or not responding to medication, while free fatty acid supplementation or decreased eating of artificial food coloring as standard ADHD treatment is not advised. Chronic deficiencies of iron, magnesium and iodine may have a negative impact on ADHD symptoms. There is a small amount of evidence that lower tissue levels may be associated with ADHD. In the absence of a demonstrated (which is rare outside of developing countries), is not recommended as treatment for ADHD. However, zinc supplementation may reduce the minimum of when it is used with amphetamine for the treatment of ADHD. ADHD persists into adulthood in about 30–50% of cases. Those affected are likely to develop coping mechanisms as they mature, thus compensating to some extent for their previous symptoms. Children with ADHD have a higher risk of unintentional injuries. One study from Denmark found an increased risk of death among those with ADHD due to the increased rate of accidents. Effects of medication on functional impairment and (e.g. reduced risk of accidents) have been found across multiple domains. Rates of smoking among those with ADHD are higher than in the general population at about 40%. Main article: Epidemiology of attention deficit hyperactive disorder Percent of people 4–17 ever diagnosed in the US as of 2011 ADHD is estimated to affect about 6–7% of people aged 18 and under when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria. When diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria rates in this age group are estimated at 1–2%. Children in North America appear to have a higher rate of ADHD than children in Africa and the Middle East; this is believed to be due to differing methods of diagnosis rather than a difference in underlying frequency. If the same diagnostic methods are used, the rates are more or less the same between countries. It is diagnosed approximately three times more often in boys than in girls. This difference between sexes may reflect either a difference in susceptibility or that females with ADHD are less likely to be diagnosed than males. Rates of diagnosis and treatment have increased in both the United Kingdom and the United States since the 1970s. Prior to 1970, it was rare for children to be diagnosed with ADHD while in the 1970s rates were about 1%. This is believed to be primarily due to changes in how the condition is diagnosed and how readily people are willing to treat it with medications rather than a true change in how common the condition is. It is believed that changes to the diagnostic criteria in 2013 with the release of the DSM-5 will increase the percentage of people diagnosed with ADHD, especially among adults. Timeline of ADHD diagnostic criteria, prevalence, and treatment Main article: History of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Hyperactivity has long been part of the human condition. Sir describes ""mental restlessness"" in his book An inquiry into the nature and origin of mental derangement written in 1798. He made observations about children showing signs of being inattentive and having the “fidgets”. The first clear description of ADHD is credited to in 1902 during a series of lectures he gave to the Royal College of Physicians of London. He noted both nature and nurture could be influencing this disorder. proposed an association between brain damage and behavioral or learning problems which was able to be validated by the encephalitis lethargica epidemic from 1917 through 1928. The terminology used to describe the condition has changed over time and has included: in the DSM-I (1952) ""minimal brain dysfunction,"" in the DSM-II (1968) ""hyperkinetic reaction of childhood,"" and in the DSM-III (1980) ""attention-deficit disorder (ADD) with or without hyperactivity."" In 1987 this was changed to ADHD in the DSM-III-R and the DSM-IV in 1994 split the diagnosis into three subtypes, ADHD , ADHD hyperactive-impulsive type and ADHD combined type. These terms were kept in the DSM-5 in 2013. Other terms have included ""minimal brain damage"" used in the 1930s. In 1934, became the first medication approved for use in the United States. Methylphenidate was introduced in the 1950s, and dextroamphetamine in the 1970s. The use of stimulants to treat ADHD was first described in 1937. Charles Bradley gave the children with behavioral disorders Benzedrine and found it improved academic performance and behavior. Until the 1990s, many studies ""implicated the prefrontal-striatal network as being smaller in children with ADHD"". During this same period, a genetic component was identified and ADHD was acknowledged to be a persistent, long-term disorder which lasted from childhood into adulthood. ADHD was split into the current three sub-types because of a field trial completed by Lahey and colleagues. Main article: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder controversies ADHD, its diagnosis, and its treatment have been controversial since the 1970s. The controversies involve clinicians, teachers, policymakers, parents, and the media. Positions range from the view that ADHD is within the normal range of behavior to the hypothesis that ADHD is a genetic condition. Other areas of controversy include the use of stimulant medications in children, the method of diagnosis, and the possibility of overdiagnosis. In 2009, the , while acknowledging the controversy, states that the current treatments and methods of diagnosis are based on the dominant view of the academic literature. In 2014, , one of the early advocates for recognition of the disorder, spoke out against overdiagnosis in a article. In contrast, a 2014 peer-reviewed medical literature review indicated that ADHD is under diagnosed in adults. With widely differing rates of diagnosis across countries, states within countries, races, and ethnicities, some suspect factors other than the presence of the symptoms of ADHD are playing a role in diagnosis. Some sociologists consider ADHD to be an example of the of deviant behavior, that is, the turning of the previously issue of school performance into a medical one. Most healthcare providers accept ADHD as a genuine disorder, at least in the small number of people with severe symptoms. Among healthcare providers the debate mainly centers on diagnosis and treatment in the much greater number of people with mild symptoms. American Psychiatric Association (2013).

As most treatment guidelines and prescribing information for stimulant medications relate to experience in school-aged children, prescribed doses for older patients are lacking. Emerging evidence for both methylphenidate and Adderall indicate that when weight-corrected daily doses, equipotent with those used in the treatment of younger patients, are used to treat adults with ADHD, these patients show a very robust clinical response consistent with that observed in pediatric studies. These data suggest that older patients may require a more aggressive approach in terms of dosing, based on the same target dosage ranges that have already been established – for methylphenidate, 1–1.5–2 mg/kg/day, and for D,L-amphetamine, 0.5–0.75–1 mg/kg/day.... In particular, adolescents and adults are vulnerable to underdosing, and are thus at potential risk of failing to receive adequate dosage levels. As with all therapeutic agents, the efficacy and safety of stimulant medications should always guide prescribing behavior: careful dosage titration of the selected stimulant product should help to ensure that each patient with ADHD receives an adequate dose, so that the clinical benefits of therapy can be fully attained.

f501fb25-e070-43ce-b548-4b75d11d5077,"Living with Attention Deficit Disorder Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) is a neurobiological disorder. Recent research shows that the symptoms of ADD are caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. (Rebecca Chapman Booth) With ADD there is a flaw in the way the brain manages the neurotransmitter production, storage or flow, causing imbalances. It has been suggested that as many as 80 percent of ADD cases are the result of genetics with the remainder caused by toxins, trauma or illness introduced during pregnancy, delivery or the newborn period and not,from poor parenting, family problems, poor teachers or schools, to much TV, food allergies, or excess sugar. It is important for people to understand that ADD is a real disability that effects all aspects of a person's life, though it does not need to be handicapping. The difference in Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is mostly one of terminology, which can be confusing at times. The ""official"" clinical diagnosis is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD. In turn ADHD is broken down into different subtypes: "" Combined type; Predominantly Inattentive Type: and Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulse Type"". (Peter Jaksa, Ph.D.) Many people use the term ADD as a generic term for all types of ADHD. The term ADD has gained popularity among the general public, in the media, and is even commonly used among professionals. We are basically still talking about the same thing however, whether we call it ADD or ADHD. (Peter Jaksa, Ph.D.) Current research shows that there may be as many as 13 different genes that vary from the so-called normal genes that are involved in making up what we call the attention deficits. ... ... middle of paper ... ...ties.

Thank you, Mrs. Johnson October 20, 2000 This letter represents the type sent by teachers to many parents about children who are thought to have ADD/ADHD. Attention-deficit disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, most commonly known as ADD and ADHD, are disorders that are most common among children; however, they are not unheard of in adults. An internet article entitled “Understanding and Identifying Children with ADHD: First Steps to Effective Intervention” put out by the US Department of Education cites several different causes of ADHD “such as pregnancy and birth, illness, lead poisoning, injury and prenatal drug exposure.” Children who have been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD have trouble paying attention, are often hyperactive, and act on . Although drug treatment is the most common antidote to ADD/ADHD, a combination of diet, behavior intervention and medication is the best antidote for ADD/ADHD. Diet, although often overlooked, is extremely effective in combating or lessening the effects of ADD/ADHD. James B. Lavalle discussed the problem of a person having poor nutrition as a possible cause of ADD/ADHD in his article “Emotional, Nutritional Issues Offer Treatment Insight” that was published in Drug Store News. He writes, “It seems plausible that several nutrient depletions and food intake issues can be linked to possible causes of ADD and ADHD.” Because of a link between poor nutrition and ADD, there can be a reversal by integrating proper nutrition to a person with ADD/ADHD. This addition can, with a combination of behavior interventions and medication, help stop the signs of ADD/ADHD. The reviews all seem to share the same topic that ADHD must remain relevant. The medication may not be for every child, but the question of the safety of the children is. What is ADHD? Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder also known as “ADHD”, is a mental disorder which seems to be a very common childhood brain disorder and the disorder continues through adolescence and adulthood. Children with ADHD have a hard time focusing so paying attention becomes unbearable. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Adolescents ADHD use to be thought of as a childhood disorder, however, more research shows that ADHD continues into adolescence and also into adulthood. ADHD can have serious effects on a person’s quality of life; Socialization, school performance, and behavior are some of the areas in which children and adolescents have problems. Problems effecting adults can be seen in college, in the work force, and in social relationships. One person’s inability to perform as well as others can lead to complications with self-esteem, anxiety and depression. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), once called hyperkinesis or minimal brain dysfunction, affects about two trillion American teenagers. According to the Journal of Pediatric Pharmacology and Therapeutics, “ADHD is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders in childhood. ADHD can impact not only school performance, but also social interaction. If untreated, this could lead to delinquent behavior” (Briars, 2016, p.2). That being said, noticing this condition early in one’s The Dark Side Of A Wonder Drug-a Selected Collection Of Testimony On T ""In certain school systems there's been a teacher who has seen it work and they'll start suggesting it as an option for all children who are acting out,"" said Linda Budd, a St. Paul, Minn., psychologist who has written the book Living With the Active/Alert Child. ""We've got some teachers we call ""Ritalin bullies' - he's not paying attention to me so he needs Ritalin""(Ritalin Zone). Marcia Ruberg, a school psychologist in Cherry Hill (N.J.) School District, said the number of children taking Ritalin varies greatly from class to class, depending on ""the teacher's belief system""(Ritalin). At some schools, children as young as seven are asked to take their Ritalin themselves. The little blue pills have become so common in school yards that some kids are reportedly selling their spare Ritalin to friends, who take it in the hope of getting a buzz. The problem behaviors of students with ADHD can be temporarily controlled with prescriptive stimulants (Kirst-Ashman, Zastrow, 2004). For many other children with ADHD, a combination of medication, behavior management, effective teaching, and parental monitoring improves their behavior. However, not all children with ADHD respond positively to prescription stimulants, and some critics believe that physicians are too quick in prescribing stimulants for children with milder forms of ADHD. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder also known as ADHD is one of the most common childhood disorders that continue through adulthood. Although ADHD is not considered a learning disability, children diagnosed with ADHD can be impacted tremendously in areas such as sitting still, staying focused, being organized, and completing homework each of these things affect the learning of children with ADHD. Children who are diagnosed with ADHD have trouble focusing, controlling their behaviour and usually act without thinking. ADHD occurs in about 3 to 7 percent of the population and is more common in boys than girls (Kingsley, 2012). ADHD during middle childhood affects children’s behaviors at home and school. Figuring Out My World: Alison May Alison’s story is the perfect example of what many families must go through when faced with the possibility of having a child diagnosed with a learning disability. Alison was not diagnosed with visual and auditory dyslexia until the summer before entering college. However, while still a toddler, her symptoms had been brought to her mother’s attention by her sister’s teacher. Alison’s mother then noticed her habits in repeating words incorrectly and how Alison would need tactile clues to follow directions. At the recommendation of her kindergarten teacher, Alison was tested for learning disabilities and the results from the school psychologists were that she was acting stubborn or disobedient. Thinking that books are stupid, Mr. Wormwood calls her stupid and foolish for wasting her time on such things. Despite the verbal abuse from her parents, Matilda continues with her interests and does what she can to get back at her father for constantly denouncing her. For instance, she replaced his hair tonic with her mother’s hair dye, causing Mr. Wormwood’s hair to be turned a platinum blonde. On her first day of school, Matilda’s teacher Miss Honey becomes very interested in her abilities, wondering where the child picked up such an ability to solve complicated mathematical equations and read such great novels for a child her age. Miss Honey is a petite woman. Medications are a major part of treating bipolar disorder however, they can be dangerous especially in children. In the video Rebecca Riley died due to overdose of untested drugs. Many children who are diagnosed with bipolar disorder are put on multiple medications. This is because one medication may cause side effects that may need another medication to subdue that side effect. Many will need antipsychotics as well as antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications. Generally this disorder is diagnosed in children at early stages of development. The causes of this disorder may be related to gender, depression, emotions, environmental factors, and developmental factors. ADHD children are often mistaken with excessive maladaptive behavior, and the opposite goes for children who are merely active in daily living. Some children are misdiagnosed with ADHD and medicated thereafter. However the children diagnosed correctly with ADHD may not respond to medication.

214bd870-9c04-4985-a2fd-11e6a9932f2a,"Thesis: Today there is a great debate concerning the diagnosis and treatment of ADD/ADHD and who has the right to decide what happens. It is estimated that between 3 and 12 percent of the population has to deal with conditions known as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). This equals approximately 3 million children in the United States alone. Both of these disorders (ADD and ADHD) exhibit the same traits leading them to be lumped together. Children affected by ADD or ADHD have behavior and emotional problems. Trouble concentrating on simple tasks, a short attention span, failing to give attention to details, and disruptive behavior are a few of the problems resulting from these disorders. These disorders are also found more often in boys than girls by approximately a 3 to 1 ratio (About ADD/ADHD). Today there is a great debate concerning the diagnosis and treatment of ADD/ADHD and who has the right to decide what happens. One might ask, what causes ADD or ADHD? The symptoms of ADD and ADHD are thought to be caused by a neurological dysfunction within the brain. PET scans of the brain have confirmed a significant difference in brain function between those diagnosed with ADD and ADHD and an unaffected person. However, not many of these tests have been done because the PET test involves an of a material into the body (About ADD/ADHD). It is also hypothesized that one of the neurotransmitters is malfunctioning or lacking in people with ADD and ADHD. The specific one is not yet known.

The key behaviors of ADHD are impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity. Other symptoms of ADHD include difficulty staying focused on a specific task, paying attention to the task at hand, difficulty controlling behavior and impulses, and hyperactivity. These symptoms can make it very difficult for a child or adult with ADHD to succeed in school, get along with others, or finish tasks at home or in the workplace (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2012). It is normal for a child to be hyperactive, inattentive, and impulsive at times, but for children with ADHD, it is much more severe and it occurs more often than the average child. (Lambert) Children tend to be emotionally disturbed years after the abuse, many have IQ scores lower than average, and some have even been classified as mentally retarded. Children who have been abused also show signs of personality and neurological changes. (Oates 119) Sexual abuse has been linked to nightmares, bed wetting, sadness, clinging behavior, and anxiety. Children also showed more aggressive and anti-social behaviors. (Oates 127) Adults who were sexually abused are more prone to depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and drug or alcohol problems. Infotrac. NSTCC Lib., Blountville, TN. 2 Aug. 2000 . Price, Joyce. ""Dea Restless About Ritalin:Doctors Sounding The Alarm About A Popular Drug used to Combat Attention Disorders in Kids."" Instead of letting the feelings out, the aggression is suppressed internally. This aggressive behavior can also be understood as a buildup of negative energy and emotions. Another effect caused by emotional abuse is self-confidence (Jelic, 2013, p. 30). Children, who experience emotional abuse, have difficulties forming self-confidence in relation to other children who haven’t experienced abuse. The feeling of not feeling wanted in children, leads to problems in them developing self-confidence. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition that is characterized by a person's inability to focus attention. The condition is present at birth and is usually evident by early childhood (Nagel, 2002, p.237). It is the major cause of poor school performance of children, but is not a learning disability. The exact cause of ADHD is unknown. Some researchers believe that the mechanism, behind its symptoms, is the imbalance of certain neurotransmitters, chemicals in the brain that transmit messages between nerve cells (Lerner, 2008, p. 401).

Popular Science, 48-52. Attention Deficit Disorder Attention Deficit Disorder, or ADD, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD, are medical, not behavioral, disorders that are often associated together and thought of as ADD/ADHD. Attention Deficit Disorder causes people to be very inattentive and easily distracted. People who have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder generally have the same symptoms as those with ADD and are also very hyper and impulsive. There have been many speculations on the validity of this disorder. Many people believe that this disorder is an excuse or a cop-out for undisciplined children. The Root Cause of Depression: Biological, Cognitive-Behavioral, or Both? Whereas, those who support the biological perspective believe depression results from the genes a person inherits, chemical imbalances that change the functions of the brain, as well as damage to the anatomy of the brain. In addition to these two perspectives, some believe that neither the one nor the other perspective alone causes depression, but that a combination of both influences the onset of the debilitating disorder. This paper will address the biological issues that lead to depression. For example, does depression run in families? Do chemical imbalances cause depression?

Attention? Sitting still? If so, you or your child have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). People with ADHD have trouble with inattentiveness, distractibility, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Although it’s a common, lifelong disorder, ADHD symptoms can be managed with medicine and behavior treatments. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Menu What is Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)? Does your child fail to sustain attention, behave within appropriate limits at home and in public, or sit quietly when they’re expected to do so? Not being able to stay within limits or sit quietly is normal childhood behavior if it happens at different ages and from time to time, but if this behavior occurs frequently and interferes with your child’s daily life, they may have ADHD. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that can affect family life. The word “neurodevelopmental” refers to the nervous system which includes the brain as it develops across the lifespan. ADHD behavior usually appears by age seven though difficult behavior may show up before this, and ADHD is treatable. With ADHD, children can have trouble with impulsivity, hyperactivity, distractedness, following instructions and completing tasks. When symptoms of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder occur in childhood, they tend to persist into adulthood in about 49.9% of the cases (about half). Adults with ADHD often find it difficult to follow directions, to remember information and to concentrate on or organize tasks. Without proper acknowledgement and management of these behaviors, ADHD can result in behavioral, emotional, academic, vocational and social problems that decrease the quality of life. What is the difference between ADHD and ADD (Attention-Deficit Disorder)? ADHD is the only term assigned to this diagnosis but there are different presentations of ADHD — ADHD Inattentive Presentation, ADHD Hyperactive/Impulsive Presentation, ADHD Combined Presentation (both inattention and H/I behavior) and a fourth type called Unspecified ADHD, a diagnosis used when symptoms are unclear. About 11% of children between the ages of four and 17 have ADHD. Symptoms of ADHD typically first appear between the ages of three and six years old. The average age of ADHD diagnosis is seven years old. In children, it’s three times more common in young boys than girls. Males are almost three times more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than females. ADHD isn’t just a childhood disorder. About 4% of American adults over the age of 18 contend with ADHD behaviors on a daily basis. In adulthood, it’s diagnosed equally between males and females. During their lifetimes, 13% of men will be diagnosed with ADHD while just 4.2% of women will be diagnosed. By definition, ADHD is better referred to as a neurodevelopmental disorder, not a “mental illness.” The term “mental illness” is a very broad term for any type of condition that affects mood, behavior or thinking. ADHD is better described as a pattern of behavior — something different in the way a person does things — rather than describing it as something “wrong” with people. Evidence indicates that ADHD is associated with neural pathways in brain functioning (the default mode and the task positive mode). This functioning yields problematic behavioral at certain ages (stages of development) — thus the term neurodevelopmental disorder is a better broad category name for the problem of ADHD. No, although they are both neurodevelopmental disorders. Except, many children with autism have ADHD. But the two conditions are by expression and definition quite different. ADHD is not a learning disability, though it certainly can impair learning. About 30% to 40% of children with ADHD also have a learning disability. Like those with a learning disability, children with ADHD are eligible to receive special education services. Children, teenagers and adults with ADHD have an ongoing pattern of three types of core behaviors: Difficulty sustaining attention to tasks. : Doing things on sudden urges, without thinking such as talking out in class, throwing a toy, or interrupting someone in conversation. In adults, the impulses may be irresponsible such as spending too much money. Restlessness such as fidgeting, inability to stay seated when sitting is expected such as in church or school, moving or climbing when it’s inappropriate to do so. Children, teens and adults with ADHD are diagnosed by the behavior pattern that is most actively present. The three most common ADHD presentations are Predominantly Inattentive, Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive and the combination of these types. ADHD Predominantly Inattentive Presentation is defined by the following nine behaviors: Fails to pay close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work or during other activities. Has trouble paying attention during tasks or play. Appears to not listen even when spoken to directly. Has difficulty following through on instructions (for example, often fails to finish schoolwork, chores or other duties in the workplace). Often has difficulty organizing tasks or activities. Avoids or dislikes tasks that require continuous mental effort, such as schoolwork, homework or preparing reports, completing forms and reviewing lengthy papers. Frequently loses needed items, such as books, pencils, tools, wallets/purses, keys, paperwork, phone and eyeglasses. Can be easily distracted by actions or thoughts unrelated to the current task. Is often forgetful in daily activities (such as doing chores, running errands, returning phone calls, paying bills and keeping appointments). Behaviors of the ADHD Predominantly Hyperactivity/Impulsive type include: Fidgets with or taps hands or feet or squirms frequently. Leaves seat in the classroom or in the workplace when remaining seated is expected. Runs or climbs excessively when it's not appropriate; constantly feels restless (if an adolescent or adult). Has trouble playing or engaging in leisure activities quietly. Blurts out the answers before questions have been completely asked; older children may often finish sentences for others who are talking. Frequently has trouble waiting for his or her turn. Often interrupts or intrudes on others' conversations or games. ADHD is largely a hereditary condition. If one or both parents have been diagnosed with ADHD, their children are more likely to have it as well. Although the exact etiology (i.e., origins) of ADHD are ill-defined, healthcare providers report other associated risk factors: : ADHD is associated with the way certain neurotransmitters (chemicals in the brain that help control behavior) work, especially dopamine and norepinephrine, and this difference causes changes in two different attentional networks of the brain — the default network, associated with automatic attention and the task positive network, associated with directed or effortful attention. : Exposure to toxins (poisons) in the environment (lead, for example) has been linked to ADHD in children. : Smoking and/or drug and alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with ADHD in children. Certain behaviors are expected depending on the age of a person. Because the brain doesn’t develop at the same rate in everyone, cognitive functions may be poor in some people and not in others. A child 10 years old, for example, might only have the abilities of a younger child 8 years old rather than his or her same age peers. Therefore, as you or your child get older, the problem is not that ADHD gets worse, it’s that the child’s abilities are not developing synchronized with age. Although ADHD doesn’t get “worse,” the tasks expected of the person become more complicated with age and circumstances, such as increased demands in school, therefore, the problematic behaviors (such as completing things on time) become more problematic. For example, as the child may get a lower grade for turning in late work. Examples of other complications include: Undertaking new challenges without sufficient support: New and more complex challenges frequently arise in school. As a child advances in grade level, academic tasks become more complex, such as having to write lengthy reports or studying numerous chapters of a history book. Task complexity in reading, spelling, math and interacting with classmates pose problems to the child who has limited ability to meet demand. The student with ADHD may struggle even more without additional collateral support from parents and teachers. Often, children are punished for actions they cannot control: Children with ADHD may be criticized and punished by parents and teachers, they may be looked down on by peers because of their inability to finish tasks or remember their schoolwork, and some may not know how to play appropriately with their friends. Adults can be penalized by supervisors at their jobs for forgetting to do work and, at times, even by family members for failing to stay organized, or stay focused on tasks to completion. Additional problems with thinking, emotions and behaviors: Psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety are common in people with ADHD. Children are 62% more likely to have at least one disorder. Adults with ADHD are six times more likely to have a disorder. People with ADHD are also more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. : So many things can cause additional stress in the life of someone with ADHD. Examples include serious medical illnesses, domestic violence, divorce, loss of employment or the death of a friend or family member. According to recent data, 17.5% of children ages four to 17 in the United States received no treatment — behavioral or pharmacological — for ADHD Treatment is vital for managing ADHD symptoms.

Holmes, Mary Elyse Kaye, Mark A. Vargo, George E. Woody, Edward V. Nunes, David Liu Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of osmotic-release methylphenidate (OROSMPH) compared with placebo for attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and the impact on substance treatment outcomes in adolescents concurrently receiving cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT) for substance use disorders (SUD). Method: This was a 16-week, randomized, controlled, multi-site trial of OROS-MPH + CBT versus placebo + CBT in 303 adolescents (aged 13 through 18 years) meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for ADHD and SUD. Primary outcome measures included the following: for ADHD, clinician-administered ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS), adolescent informant; for substance use, adolescent-reported days of use in the past 28 days. Secondary outcome measures included parent ADHD-RS and weekly urine drug screens (UDS). Results: There were no group differences on reduction in ADHD-RS scores (OROS-MPH: -19.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], -17.1 to -21.2; placebo, -21.2, 95% CI, -19.1 to -23.2) or reduction in days of substance use (OROS-MPH: -5.7 days, 95% CI, 4.0-7.4; placebo: -5.2 days, 95% CI, 3.5-7.0). Some secondary outcomes favored OROS-MPH, including lower parent ADHD-RS scores at 8 (mean difference = 4.4, 95% CI, 0.8-7.9) and 16 weeks (mean difference =6.9; 95% CI, 2.9-10.9) and more negative UDS in OROS-MPH (mean = 3.8) compared with placebo (mean = 2.8; p =.04). Conclusions: OROS-MPH did not show greater efficacy than placebo for ADHD or on reduction in substance use in adolescents concurrently receiving individual CBT for co-occurring SUD. However, OROS-MPH was relatively well tolerated and was associated with modestly greater clinical improvement on some secondary ADHD and substance outcome measures.

d9f4080b-0814-4ff4-abf2-7befe288228c,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a condition that creates a great deal of discussions among professionals. There are numerous debates that surround this disorder. There are theory’s presented from each side about what causes it, how to asses it, and how to deal with it effectively. The first question needing answered is what is ADHD? ADHD is a set of behavioral problems revolving around three main symptoms. The chief symptom that a person exhibits is the incapacity to keep their attention focus. A second key symptom is impulsiveness. They may act or shout out inappropriately and have a short fuse leading to temper tantrums. A third core symptom is hyperactivity. Sufferers are unable to sit still seeming restless or fidgety. ADHD symptoms may also cause problems in educational settings for children and also problems at work for adults. ADHD is broken into three subtypes. The first is those who are impulsive and hyperactive. The second type is made up from those who are inattentive only. The third group is those who display all of these symptoms combined. In the United States, 3-5% of children show signs of this disorder. It has also been shown that the disorder is more dominant in boys. Many children with ADHD do not outgrow this disorder and carry it on into their adult lives. Various studies have shown that two-thirds of children with ADHD still have the disorder in their 20’s making it is a problem which affects children and adults alike. One critical debate surrounding this disorder is the assessment and diagnosis of ADHD. In the DSM IV, it states that in order to accurately diagnose ADHD, the patient must show at least six symptoms.

There are three basic types of ADHD. They are inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. (NIMH-ADHD) A child may have one, any combination of two or even all three of these types. If a child has a hard time keeping their mind on one thing or if they get bored easy they have a type of ADHD that is called inattention. If the child has hyperactivity ADHD, they are always moving, can’t sit still, and talk incessantly. “The main symptom, (among the three main symptoms) of ADHD is the inability to pay attention. Kids may have trouble listening to a speaker, following directions, finishing tasks, or keeping track of personal items. They may daydream often and make careless mistakes” (WebMD). These characteristics belong to all children which ask the question, emphatically, is childhood ADHD over diagnosed? Pertaining to children, the inability to pay attention is followed by hyperactivity and impulsiveness. The disorder occurs as much as four to nine times more in boys than in girls (Santrock, 2003). Some experts attribute the increase mainly to heightened awareness of the disorder. Others are concerned that many children are being diagnosed without undergoing extensive professional evaluation based on input from multiple sources. Signs of ADHD may be present in the preschool years. Pare... ... middle of paper ... ...n such as Ritalin to control their behavior (Kirst-Ashman, Zastrow, 2004). Academic Search Premier. EBSCO.

Characteristics of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a very common disorder among children, and it has only increased throughout the years. “It is estimated that 3-5% of children have ADHD, accounting for approximately 2 million children in the United States” (Mattox, 2007). Mattox (2007) also makes note that boys are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD because they display more aggressive behaviors than girls do, which results in girls being diagnosed at a later age. The current diagnostic criterion for ADHD primarily focuses on significant hyperactivity and inattention. Aside from those two, in order for a child to be diagnosed with ADHD the DSM-IV says symptoms must show begin to show before the age of seven, show impairment in two or more settings, the impairment must be clinically significant or affect academic functioning, and the symptoms cannot be explained by another mental disorder (Weis, 2008).

McCracken, Scott H. Kollins, Desiree W. Murray, Sharon Wigal, , James J. McGough, Susan Dosreis, Audrey Bauzó-Rosario, Annamarie Stehli, Kelly Posner Objective: To describe the clinical course of attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptom severity and diagnosis from ages 3 to 5 up to 9 to 12 years during a 6-year follow-up after the original Preschool ADHD Treatment Study (PATS). Method: A total of 207 participants (75% male) from the original PATS, assessed at baseline (mean age, 4.4 years, when all met criteria for ADHD) and 3 months later (before medication treatment), were re-evaluated in three follow-up assessment visits (year 3, mean age 7.4 years; year 4, 8.3 years; and year 6, 10.4 years). Parents and teachers rated symptom severity, and clinicians established psychiatric diagnoses. Analyses examined longitudinal changes in symptom severity and ADHD diagnosis. Results: Parent- and teacher-rated symptom severity decreased from baseline to year 3 but remained relatively stable and in the moderate-to-severe clinical range through year 6. Girls showed generally steeper decreases in symptom T-scores. At year 6, 89% (160/180) of remaining participants met ADHD symptom and impairment diagnostic criteria. Comorbidity of oppositional defiant disorder and/or conduct disorder was associated with a 30% higher risk of having an ADHD diagnosis at year 6 in the multiple logistic model. Medication status during follow-up, on versus off, did not predict symptom severity change from year 3 to year 6 after adjustment for other variables. Conclusions: ADHD in preschoolers is a relatively stable diagnosis over a 6-year period. The course is generally chronic, with high symptom severity and impairment, in very young children with moderate-to-severe ADHD, despite treatment with medication. Development of more effective ADHD intervention strategies is needed for this age group.

Even as early as 1863, the public's view of the disorder started to emerge in a poem by a German physicist which depicted 'Fidgety Phil's' classic sign's of ADHD (6). In 1902, experts classified children suffering form ADHD as mentally retarded, socially inept or even emotionally disturbed. It wasn?t until the 1940?s that experts classified it as a neurological disorder. Its discovery actually occurred in 1937(6). Dr. Bradley of Providence, Rhode Island discovered that while treating severely destructive children using amphetamines, a stimulant, the children would become more tranquil and could concentrate better. Since his discovery, many others in his field have continued his work; however, Attention Deficit Disorder wasn't known by the vast public until the last decade (6). Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a neurological syndrome rooted in the central nervous system which affects approximately three to five percent of the child population (second only to asthma in childhood problems) in the United States and makes up 50% of child psychiatry populations(4a). Shown both in clinical and epidemiological samples, the condition is much more prevalent in males, shown 9-1 clinically and 4-1 epidemiologically, then females (4a). This suggests selective basis of analysis due to the female prevalence to show primarily inattentive and cognitive problems rather than the aggressive/impulsive behavior classic to most male subjects (3).

It is also important to lose any environmental distractions, mainly noisy workplaces that could affect concentration (17). To combat possible impulsiveness, it is important to stop and think before acting (6). This works for those who are prone to make regretful statements and for those who are prone to bursts of temper. It only takes several trials to teach the body to think before reacting and can be helped along by health professionals. It is also to control hyperactivity by trying to fidget without distracting others by possibly keeping busy while still (taking notes or using that time to organize) (17). The last and most important is of course to seek education on web sites, from health professionals and from others suffering through the disorder as well (6). In 1917 and 1918 there was a worldwide outbreak of encephalitis. Many children showed ADD like symptoms afterwards, leading doctors to further speculate that the disorder was the result of brain damage, resulting in perhaps the first names for ADD, Post-Encephalitic Disorder and Minimal Brain Damage. When it was later learned that these children were not brain damaged after all, the name changed to Minimal Brain Dysfunction. In 1937 doctors first reported evidence that stimulant medication helped relieve the symptoms of hyperactive children. These reports were largely ignored until the 1950's, when there was a rapid increase in the use of drug therapy in psychiatry. ¡§ In the early 20th century, American doctors were discussing children who had problems similar to those described by George Fre*censored* Still, who was the first know researcher in Attention Deficit research. The one thing that many of these children had in common, other than their ADD type symptoms, was that they were survivors of the encephalitis epidemic in 1917-1918. Numerous papers described children with ¡§post encephalitic behavior disorder¡¨ as impaired in attention, regulation of activity, and impulse control. Like Still¡¦s patients, these children were also socially disruptive and many had memory problems.¡¨(About.com: 2) At this time, the disorder was not recognized as AD/HD, but was known as ¡§Brain Damaged¡¨ because of the encephalitis. As time passed, other researchers discovered that these children were not brain damaged but had a learning disability. The Causes Of Overcoming Panic And Anxiety Attacks Overcoming a panic and anxiety attack takes a lot of work but with the right practice of different exercises and knowing how to deal with it. It can be a little easier. Controlling the breathing and making sure that they do not hyperventilate because that will make it worse, distracting themselves from the situation that they were in, and taking it slow after words to make sure another one does not occur. Everyone needs a support system when it comes to these kind of attacks, with those they can get through it with hard work and COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY IN TREATMENT OF ADHD Medication alleviates but does not cure symptoms. CBT makes it easier for children to manage and control their symptoms. In a study led by Steven Safron director of behavioral medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospitals department of psychiatry conducted a study on CBT and ADHD. The study was twelve weekly one on one sessions with adults already on drugs like Ritalin. After CBT training two-thirds of the people in the study saw a thirty percent improvement in their symptoms. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), more commonly referred to as ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder), has only recently come to notice of scientists. It affects 3.5 million people under the age of 18 and 5 million people over the age of 18. Its current cause of existence is due to defects at neurotransmitter sites, rendering patients inattentive and impulsive. However, every year more progress is made in locating the cause and finding more effective treatments. ADHD's first diagnosis was made in 1902 by Dr. George Still. According to Schwarz and Cohen (2013), approximately 11% of children are under medication. Authors have pointed out that one boy in every five high school boys have received medical treatment for ADHD. The above mentioned prevalence rates of ADHD among children and increase in medication have raised concerns among physicians that over-diagnosis and overmedication has become common among American children. Prescription of certain stimulants such as Ritalin and Adderall for children for improvement of their lives downgraded by the disorder has led to anxiety, addiction and psychosis. Experts think that long term use of stimulants such as Ritalin leads to physical dependence. Characteristics of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a very common disorder among children, and it has only increased throughout the years. “It is estimated that 3-5% of children have ADHD, accounting for approximately 2 million children in the United States” (Mattox, 2007). Mattox (2007) also makes note that boys are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD because they display more aggressive behaviors than girls do, which results in girls being diagnosed at a later age. The current diagnostic criterion for ADHD primarily focuses on significant hyperactivity and inattention. Aside from those two, in order for a child to be diagnosed with ADHD the DSM-IV says symptoms must show begin to show before the age of seven, show impairment in two or more settings, the impairment must be clinically significant or affect academic functioning, and the symptoms cannot be explained by another mental disorder (Weis, 2008). Some experts believe the true number is closer to 20% of the general population. In a recent study of over 9000 children in the Midwest, the number of children who have been medically diagnosed as hyperactive was about 3%. The number of undiagnosed children, based on data from teachers and parents, was estimated at about... ... middle of paper ... ...D children also have sleeping problems, coordination problems, are self-centered, impatient, reckless, and have extreme emotional problems. Some indications that a child will be ADHD are, apparent hyperactivity in the womb, poor maternal health, mother under 20 years of age, first pregnancy, high blood pressure during pregnancy, maternal alcohol abuse, heavy maternal smoking, and drug abuse. Research now indicates that hyperactive children continue to have multiple problems as adolescents, though the hyperactivity has decreased. ADD may be caused by a abnormally from trauma, disease, fetal exposure to alcohol and tobacco, or high levels of Lead. In parts of the brain there is a diminished activity in the morphology and frontal region of the brain. Statistics of ADD Most of the diagnosis is at childhood. Experts say that over 2 million (3 to 5%) children have ADD. About 50% of these 2 million children who have ADD are believed to be underachievers. Full Exposure: The Sickening Treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder In other words, people carry out certain actions to try to reduce their obsessive thoughts when in reality, the habitual compulsions increase anxiety. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder cannot necessarily be stopped or fought by getting rid of the things that cause people anxiety, but it can be managed by directly confronting the thing that is feared. For example, it is impossible to get rid of all diseases so that someone may overcome their fear of becoming sick. However, that person may wash their hands constantly and not touch people to reassure themselves that they are doing anything they can to prevent themselves from getting sick.

However, every year more progress is made in locating the cause and finding more effective treatments. ADHD's first diagnosis was made in 1902 by Dr. George Still. According to Schwarz and Cohen (2013), approximately 11% of children are under medication. Authors have pointed out that one boy in every five high school boys have received medical treatment for ADHD. The above mentioned prevalence rates of ADHD among children and increase in medication have raised concerns among physicians that over-diagnosis and overmedication has become common among American children. Prescription of certain stimulants such as Ritalin and Adderall for children for improvement of their lives downgraded by the disorder has led to anxiety, addiction and psychosis. Experts think that long term use of stimulants such as Ritalin leads to physical dependence. Characteristics of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a very common disorder among children, and it has only increased throughout the years. “It is estimated that 3-5% of children have ADHD, accounting for approximately 2 million children in the United States” (Mattox, 2007). Mattox (2007) also makes note that boys are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD because they display more aggressive behaviors than girls do, which results in girls being diagnosed at a later age. The current diagnostic criterion for ADHD primarily focuses on significant hyperactivity and inattention. Aside from those two, in order for a child to be diagnosed with ADHD the DSM-IV says symptoms must show begin to show before the age of seven, show impairment in two or more settings, the impairment must be clinically significant or affect academic functioning, and the symptoms cannot be explained by another mental disorder (Weis, 2008). Some experts believe the true number is closer to 20% of the general population.

Research now indicates that hyperactive children continue to have multiple problems as adolescents, though the hyperactivity has decreased. ADD may be caused by a abnormally from trauma, disease, fetal exposure to alcohol and tobacco, or high levels of Lead. In parts of the brain there is a diminished activity in the morphology and frontal region of the brain. Statistics of ADD Most of the diagnosis is at childhood.

Even as early as 1863, the public's view of the disorder started to emerge in a poem by a German physicist which depicted 'Fidgety Phil's' classic sign's of ADHD (6). In 1902, experts classified children suffering form ADHD as mentally retarded, socially inept or even emotionally disturbed. It wasn?t until the 1940?s that experts classified it as a neurological disorder. Its discovery actually occurred in 1937(6). Dr. Bradley of Providence, Rhode Island discovered that while treating severely destructive children using amphetamines, a stimulant, the children would become more tranquil and could concentrate better. Since his discovery, many others in his field have continued his work; however, Attention Deficit Disorder wasn't known by the vast public until the last decade (6).

It only takes several trials to teach the body to think before reacting and can be helped along by health professionals. It is also to control hyperactivity by trying to fidget without distracting others by possibly keeping busy while still (taking notes or using that time to organize) (17).

In 1917 and 1918 there was a worldwide outbreak of encephalitis. Many children showed ADD like symptoms afterwards, leading doctors to further speculate that the disorder was the result of brain damage, resulting in perhaps the first names for ADD, Post-Encephalitic Disorder and Minimal Brain Damage. When it was later learned that these children were not brain damaged after all, the name changed to Minimal Brain Dysfunction.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (abbreviated as ADHD, and sometimes referred to as ADD in the past) is a developmental disorder that begins in early childhood. Children with ADHD may find it hard to concentrate and may become hyperactive, to the point where the condition can interfere with their schooling, friendships, or family life. Around 1 in every 20 Australians has ADHD. It is more common in boys. More than 3 in 4 children diagnosed with ADHD continue to experience the symptoms into adulthood. ADHD affects the brain’s executive functioning — the ability to self-regulate and control thoughts, words, actions and emotions. means a person is easily distractible or inattentive but isn’t hyperactive or impulsive. means a person has symptoms of impulsivity and hyperactivity. means a person has a mixture of symptoms including hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity. not paying attention to details, or making careless mistakes in schoolwork having difficulty remaining focused in class, conversations or reading avoiding tasks that take continuous mental effort (for example, homework) not following through on instructions, a tendency to start but not finish tasks having difficulty organising tasks, activities, belongings or time being forgetful with everyday tasks, such as chores and appointments running or climbing in situations where it is inappropriate, leaving their seat in class interrupting conversations, games or activities or using people’s things without permission blurting out an answer before a question has been finished leaving the seat in class or in other situations where sitting is expected being constantly in motion, as if 'driven by a motor' The exact causes of ADHD are not known, and there is no single cause. Studies have shown that ADHD symptoms are related to the biology of the brain. It is thought that genetic and environmental factors can interact to cause changes in brain development and function.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (abbreviated as ADHD, and sometimes referred to as ADD in the past) is a developmental disorder that begins in early childhood. Children with ADHD may find it hard to concentrate and may become hyperactive, to the point where the condition can interfere with their schooling, friendships, or family life. Around 1 in every 20 Australians has ADHD. It is more common in boys. More than 3 in 4 children diagnosed with ADHD continue to experience the symptoms into adulthood. ADHD affects the brain’s executive functioning — the ability to self-regulate and control thoughts, words, actions and emotions. means a person is easily distractible or inattentive but isn’t hyperactive or impulsive. means a person has symptoms of impulsivity and hyperactivity. means a person has a mixture of symptoms including hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity. not paying attention to details, or making careless mistakes in schoolwork having difficulty remaining focused in class, conversations or reading avoiding tasks that take continuous mental effort (for example, homework) not following through on instructions, a tendency to start but not finish tasks having difficulty organising tasks, activities, belongings or time being forgetful with everyday tasks, such as chores and appointments running or climbing in situations where it is inappropriate, leaving their seat in class interrupting conversations, games or activities or using people’s things without permission blurting out an answer before a question has been finished leaving the seat in class or in other situations where sitting is expected being constantly in motion, as if 'driven by a motor' The exact causes of ADHD are not known, and there is no single cause. Studies have shown that ADHD symptoms are related to the biology of the brain. It is thought that genetic and environmental factors can interact to cause changes in brain development and function. People with ADHD have differences in brain anatomy, electrical activity and metabolism. Research shows that ADHD often runs in families. Researchers are currently working on identifying which genes are involved. Research has linked ADHD to , and use during pregnancy. Some studies have shown that pre-schoolers who were exposed to lead (in certain types of paint or plumbing) had a higher risk of developing ADHD. Some children with brain injuries show behaviour that resembles ADHD; however, most children with ADHD have no history of brain injury. If a child did not bond with a parent or caregiver as a baby, they can develop inattention and hyperactivity. : Children who experience trauma in early childhood are more likely to show features consistent with ADHD, but most children with ADHD have not experienced early childhood trauma. Poor sleep during the night can cause trouble concentrating the following day. It is thought that 1 in 3 children with ADHD might have (a blocking of the airway during sleep), but it's not clear whether sleep apnoea is a cause of ADHD. If your child often snores, this might be a symptom of sleep apnoea and may be contributing to the problem. It is normal for children to get restless and distracted from time to time, and to be active and have lots of energy. But if a child has ADHD, their problems with attention and hyperactivity will be severe enough to interfere with learning and social relationships. There are many behavioural and developmental disorders that can cause symptoms of ADHD in young children, so it's important to have a proper assessment. Other reasons for children being inattentive, impulsive or hyperactive are health or emotional problems, learning difficulties or lack of sleep. If you are concerned that your child may have ADHD, the first step is to see a doctor. The diagnosis can only be made after a detailed assessment of the child’s behaviour, including interviews with parents or carers and the school. — Our can help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services. — Preparing for an appointment? Use our for general tips on what to ask your GP or specialist. There are clear criteria used to diagnose ADHD. If your child has 6 or more symptoms for at least 6 months to a degree that it interferes with their everyday life, they may be diagnosed with ADHD. The diagnosis is usually made by a specialist or child after referral from a doctor. In order to diagnose ADHD in adulthood, it needs to be established that the symptoms began in childhood. To make a diagnosis of , a specialist will need to follow strict criteria. These include that the ADHD symptoms: began before the age of 7 and have persisted for 6 months or more are present in more than one setting (for example, both school and home) have caused significant impairment, at school, home or socially are unusual for the child’s age and developmental level are not better explained by another mental or physical condition, family circumstances or There are several different options for the treatment of ADHD, depending on the specific needs of each child and family. Treatment may involve different health professionals, including a doctor, psychiatrist, paediatrician, or family therapist. Parents — and possibly schoolteachers too — need to be actively involved in the treatment plan. The first step is often to use positive parenting strategies. It can help to stick to a routine, help the child build their social skills and talk to the school to plan an environment where they are able to learn. If the ADHD is still having a big impact on the child’s life, it might be time to consider medication. Stimulant medicines can reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity. They help a child to focus and learn. Stimulant medicines have been thoroughly researched for many years and have been shown to be safe and to greatly improve concentration, impulse control and hyperactivity in about 4 in 5 children with ADHD. The doses used to treat ADHD are not addictive and do not cause withdrawal symptoms. However, they can cause side effects like loss of appetite and difficulty falling asleep. For children who may experience side effects from these medicines, non-stimulant medicines are also available. Psychological treatments, such as behavioural therapy, may help a child develop strategies and skills for learning and controlling their behaviour. Taking fish oil supplements to increase levels of omega-3 may improve some symptoms of ADHD in some children. However, there is not enough good quality evidence to show a definite benefit. For most people, taking fish oils is considered safe, however they should not be taken if you have a fish oil allergy or a bleeding disorder. Always check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking supplements to make sure they are right for you. If you are caring for a child with ADHD, below are some tips that can help. — try to ensure that rules and instructions are clear, brief and, where possible, presented in charts and lists. — this will assist with their self-esteem and help them to be more cooperative. — notice those things that will help in managing behaviours and put in place strategies to manage the situation. — this is important for all children, but particularly for children with ADHD. Children with ADHD often have other problems such as mild delays in language, motor skills or social development. Also, undiagnosed or untreated ADHD can lead to problems in itself, and this needs to be balanced against the decision to use treatments. In adolescence, ADHD can cause academic failure, driving problems, problems with friends, risky sexual behavior and substance abuse. People may develop other conditions including oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety, depression, tic disorders or Tourette syndrome, substance abuse, sleep disorders and learning disabilities. Adults with ADHD may experience depression or anxiety, and problems with family and work. For all of these reasons, it is important to get a proper assessment and to use strategies and treatments to best support a child or adult with ADHD. your local health district services, including or specialist child and other specialists who work with children and adolescents, such as paediatricians, child psychologists and school counsellors , , , , , (High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves attention and vigilance in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and low endogenous EPA levels) Learn more here about the development and quality assurance of healthdirect content.

When a child is hyperactive, fidgety, impulsive, and struggles with issues of attention, one cannot automatically assume that this child has or ADHD. There are a number of other conditions and factors that can cause symptoms and behaviors that may be mistaken for ADHD. Pinpointing the causes of a child's impairment is vital to that child's improvement. Accurate diagnosis of a problem leads to effective treatment. This is why it is so important for an assessment of ADHD to be extremely thorough and comprehensive, and why clinicians need to use an empirically validated approach. During the evaluation process, alternative explanations that might better account for the presence of ADHD-like behavior patterns must be ruled out before arriving . To complicate the diagnostic and treatment process further, 60-100% of children who have ADHD may have co-morbid conditions,﻿ such as anxiety, depression, disruptive behavior disorders, learning disabilities, sleep problems, and even substance abuse. All of this must be taken into account when developing treatment plans. Below is a listing of several conditions that can produce symptoms in both children and adults that may be mistaken for ADHD. There are a number of situational factors in one's environment that can result in problems that may look like ADHD. This may include when there is a lot of stress or a sudden life change, such as a move to a new home or a new school; a divorce or change in family configuration, such as remarriage; a death of someone close; financial difficulties; even the birth of a new baby. A chaotic or neglectful home environment, parental/marital conflict, inconsistent parental discipline, being bullied, witnessing or experiencing violence or abuse—all these stressors can impact a person's emotional and mental well-being and lead to problems with distraction, inattention, restlessness, hyperactivity, and ""acting out"" behaviors that can resemble, but have nothing to do with, ADHD.﻿ Additionally, sleep disturbances can have a profound effect on one's ability to focus. Lack of sleep can result in hyperactivity; irritability; slower visual, auditory, sensory and motor reaction times; mental slowness; impaired learning of information and decreased school performance.﻿ Insufficient sleep is also associated with increased frequency of risk-taking behaviors in teens, such as smoking, drinking alcohol, and taking drugs. The reasons for a child's or an adult's sleep disturbances can range from poor sleep hygiene (sleep habits) to medical conditions that disrupt the sleep cycle, such as sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and other sleep disorders. can result in restlessness, an inability to concentrate, impulsive reactions, and hyperactive behaviors.﻿ This anxiety can make it extremely difficult for a child or adult to sit still and control fidgeting. Sleep can be affected. It can be challenging to remain focused and complete tasks. These are all symptoms that can resemble ADHD but may be unrelated. Similarly, depression may result in difficulty with focus, forgetfulness, low motivation, problems in making decisions, trouble getting started on and completing tasks, lethargy and sluggishness, disorganization, and sleep difficulties.﻿ The and poor impulse control associated with and conduct disorder can also look like ADHD.﻿ Anxiety, depression, and (as well as many of the conditions listed here) commonly occur alongside ADHD. Each may be a separate disorder with distinct etiology and treatment needs, or each may be a secondary condition that develops as a result of the problems associated with ADHD. This is why assessments of ADHD must gather and integrate specific information about the emotional functioning of a person, rather than focusing exclusively on the more overt disruptive behavioral symptoms. , including high energy level, excessive talking, racing thoughts that make it difficult to concentrate, impulsive decision-making, risk-taking, and intrusive behaviors,﻿ can also be confused with . Attention and concentration problems associated with individuals who have may appear to be ADHD-related, but when delving deeper, a clearer picture emerges—attention problems may be related to ""overfocusing"" and problems in shifting attention may be due to obsessive thinking.﻿ A person with OCD may be slower to start and complete tasks because of the compulsive behaviors and rituals that must be completed before beginning. ADHD can be a risk factor for .﻿ is often considered a gateway to marijuana, as well as alcohol and other drug abuse. A person who is abusing drugs and/or alcohol can also have behavioral symptoms that mimic ADHD. Those symptoms can include difficulty concentrating, problems with memory, restlessness, irritability, talkativeness, sleep problems, moodiness, and academic or work failures. Children and adults on the autism spectrum can also display symptoms that resemble ADHD.﻿ They may become overexcited, hyperactive, and impulsive in stimulating environments, tend to focus on only those things that interest them, have trouble shifting focus, struggle to understand social cues and boundaries and experience social impairments. High motor activity and problems with inhibition are common characteristics of both and ADHD.﻿ The fidgeting, motor movements, and random noises may ""look"" similar to ADHD, but tics are defined by rapid, repeated, identical movements of the face or shoulders, or vocal sounds or phrases. Similar to a person with ADHD, someone with a learning disability may struggle with issues of attention and have difficulty processing, organizing, remembering and learning information.﻿ in reading, written language, and mathematics can all interfere with academic functioning, as can speech and language impairments and auditory and visual processing disorders. ADHD and specific learning disorders often occur together, but they are separate conditions. A child who is gifted academically and is not challenged within the classroom may even display behaviors that are similar to ADHD as he or she becomes bored with the curriculum—becoming inattentive, and/or impatient and disruptive.﻿ Along these same lines, a poor educational fit, or a classroom with a pervasive negative climate, a non-stimulating, un-motivating curriculum, or ineffective classroom management, all can lead to behaviors that look like but may be unrelated to, ADHD. Certain medical conditions, including seizures, thyroid disease, allergies, iron deficiency anemia, and chronic ear infections, as well as hearing and vision impairments, can cause a person to have problems with attention, appear ""day-dreamy,"" and become irritable, impulsive, or hyperactive.

While ADHD wasn't always recognized, , or treated as much as it is now, doctors have actually known about ADHD for some time. They didn't always call it , though, and used terms like: It has been known as ADHD since 1987 and is further divided into three subtypes: inattentive type, hyperactive/impulsive type, and the combined type. The earliest references to an ADHD-like disorder date back to the late-18th century and Sir Alexander Crichton.﻿ Some even try to say that many famous people and historical figures could have had ADHD, such as Mozart, Leonardo da Vinci, or Ben Franklin. Work on ADHD is more often thought to begin in the early 20th century, though: The first descriptions of children with are made as early as 1902 by Sir George Frederick Still and were thought to have a 'defect of moral control.'﻿ In 1908, Alfred F. Tredgold describes 'high-grade feeble-minded' children who likely had a form of mild brain damage that caused them to have ADHD-like anti-school behavior. A study is published describing the use of Benzedrine (racemic amphetamine) in children with behavior problems in 1937 by Dr. Charles Bradley, who accidentally learned about the benefits of benzedrine when giving the medication to help kids who had severe headaches, but noticed it instead helped their behavior and school performance.﻿ The first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is published by the in 1952 and includes no mention of an ADHD-like disorder. Herbert Freed and Charles Peifer study the use of Thorazine (chlorpromazine) on 'hyperkinetic emotionally disturbed children' in 1956.﻿ Hyperkinetic impulse disorder is first used to describe children with ADHD symptoms in 1957. C. Keith Conners publishes a study on the effects of (methylphenidate) in 'emotionally disturbed children' in 1963.﻿ In 1966, minimal brain dysfunction syndrome becomes a popular term to describe kids with 'various combinations of impairment in perception, conceptualization, language, memory, and control of attention, impulse, or motor function.' In 1967 and 1968, the gives a number of grants to researchers to study the effectiveness of stimulants for children with ADHD symptoms. The second edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-II) is published by the APA in 1968 and includes the disorders hyperkinetic reaction of childhood or adolescence and organic brain syndrome. The first Conner's Rating Scale is published by C. Keith Conners in 1969, which eventually leads to revised editions of the Conner's Rating Scales for parents and teachers In 1970, the published a story describing how 5 to 10 percent of all school children in Omaha, Nebraska were receiving stimulants, like Ritalin, to control their behavior, even though the statistics only referred to kids in special-ed programs. The story creates controversy around the diagnosis of ADHD and the use of stimulants, especially since it implies that many parents are coerced into medicating their kids. The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 make stimulants, such as Ritalin (methylphenidate), Schedule III medications and then Schedule II medications in 1971.﻿ Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 can allow students with ADHD who qualify to get additional help and services at school to help them succeed. An anti-Ritalin movement greatly expands in 1975 as several books are published to help reinforce the belief that ADHD isn't a real diagnosis, was created by drug companies to make money, or that hyperactivity is caused by food allergies and food additives, etc,. The AAP publishes their first statement about ADHD, , which says that in addition to 'consideration of nondrug therapy in situations where such an approach is appropriate,' that 'there is a place for stimulant drugs in the treatment of hyperkinetic children.' The third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) is published by the APA in 1980 and includes Attention Deficit Disorder for the first time, including the subtypes ADD with hyperactivity, ADD without hyperactivity, and ADD residual type. Dr. Russell A. Barkley writes his first of 17 books about ADHD in 1981 - Hyperactive Children: A Handbook for Diagnosis and Treatment. The DSM-III-R (revised edition), published in 1987, again changes the name, this time to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), but doesn't include any subtypes A 1987 report from the AAP, Medication for Children With an Attention Deficit Disorder, offers 'indications for drug therapy in the treatment of attention deficit disorder,' such as Ritalin, Dexedrine, Cylert, and 'other potentially useful drugs,' including tricyclic antidepressants. Dr. Barkley begins publishing newsletter in 1993. The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) is published by the APA in 2000 and describes three types of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including ADHD, Combined Type, ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Type, and ADHD, Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type. Joseph Biederman publishes one of the first of hundreds of medical studies about children with ADHD in 1995. An updated AAP report, , published in 1996, stresses that drug therapy should be combined 'with appropriate management of the child's environment and curriculum.' The 2000 Clinical Practice Guideline: Diagnosis and Evaluation of the Child With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder from the AAP offer clear guidance for pediatricians and parents on the assessment and treatment of kids with ADHD. , the first non-stimulant treatment for ADHD, is approved in 2002. Warning labels on ADHD medications are updated in 2007 to include warnings about the possibility of cardiovascular risks (sudden death in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems) and risks of adverse psychiatric symptoms (hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania). Dr. Bradley's studies on the use of Benzedrine was once thought of as heralding the modern era of ADHD treatment, but that role has likely now passed to the newer, once-a-day ADHD medications that most kids take. Although it seems like a lot of different  have been developed over the years, especially in the last ten years, most of them use same basic active ingredients (methylphenidate and amphetamine/dextroamphetamine) that have been used since the earliest days of ADHD research. 1955-1983: Biphetamine (mixed amphetamine/dextroamphetamine resin) 1960: Adderall (mixed amphetamine/dextroamphetamine salts) 2002: Methylin (methylphenidate) oral solution and chewable tablet 2016: Adzenys XR-ODT (amphetamine oral disintegrating tablet) 2017: Mydayis (Triple-Bead MixedAmphetamine Salts) 2017: Cotempla XR-ODT™ (methylphenidate extended-release orally disintegrating tablets) Many of these ADHD medications, even the extended-release versions, are now available as .

Retrieved Jan 22 2021 from https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Kids%27+attention+disorder+attracts+concern.-a053460607 It's a major public health problem, disrupting the lives of as many as 2 million children between ages 5 and 14. It's hard on parents and schools. Yet, no one knows why it occurs, how best to diagnose it, or what are the long-term effects of the stimulant drugs often used to treat it. That's much of what can be concluded about attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from available evidence, according to a panel convened by the National Institutes of Health. After hearing 2 days of presentations on ADHD from 31 investigators and clinicians, the 13 panel members released a consensus statement last week. ""There is no consistency in treatment, diagnosis, or follow-up for children with ADHD,"" says panel chair David J. Kupfer, a psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh. ""It's clear that we don't have sufficient evidence to define a diagnostic threshold for starting stimulant treatment or to develop strategies for ADHD prevention."" As set out in the current diagnostic manual of psychiatric disorders, ADHD consists of an inability to sustain attention or concentration, constant fidgeting and moving about as if ""driven by a motor,"" and a general tendency to act impulsively. These symptoms often contribute to peer rejection, family problems, and academic failure. By adolescence, children diagnosed with ADHD exhibit high rates of alcohol and illicit-drug abuse, criminal behavior, and accidents of all sorts. No diagnostic test exists for ADHD, the panel noted. As with most psychiatric conditions, ADHD represents a collection of symptoms that occur together consistently but prove difficult to pin on specific causes. One line of research presented to the NIH panel suggests that ADHD arises from genetically influenced brain disturbances. Other speakers argued that a number of different causal pathways probably lead to ADHD symptoms. For example, some healthy children may develop short attention spans and impulsive styles by adapting to certain home and neighborhood surroundings, leading to an ADHD diagnosis. In some cases, children who simply act more boisterously than their peers may be inappropriately tagged with ADHD, panel members acknowledged. Particular controversy surrounds the use of stimulants, such as methyl phenidate, or Ritalin, to treat ADHD. Studies find that these medications often improve core ADHD symptoms over several months, Kupfer says. Stimulants, however, do not erase behavior problems and typically do not produce marked gains in academic performance or social skills, he holds. It's not known whether years of stimulant use benefit children with ADHD or, perhaps, cause nervous-system damage. Several behavior-modification programs, including some that provide parent training, show promise and deserve more intensive study, the panel says. Researchers also need to examine treatments that combine stimulants and behavioral modification, it concludes. No convincing evidence supports the effectiveness of any other ADHD interventions, according to the panel. These include special diets, vitamin regimens, and biofeedback. ADHD symptoms vary from mild to severe, remarks psychologist Stephen P. Hinshaw of the University of California, Berkeley. He spoke about ADHD to the federal panel. Diagnosis of the condition by a physician or mental-health clinician requires a careful evaluation of reports by parents, teachers, and others who regularly observe a child, he asserts, but many health-care providers do not order such assessments. ""There's clearly not a single cause of all cases of well-diagnosed ADHD,"" Hinshaw contends. ""In 20 years, we may know whether there are two, or five, or even more causal pathways.""

(Dotdash) — All rights reserved CBD Oil for ADHD: Research, Considerations, and Side Effects Kendra Cherry, MS, is an author, educational consultant, and speaker focused on helping students learn about psychology. Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. is a compound found in cannabis that is purported to have a number of mental health effects. This has led many people to speculate that it might also have potential uses in the treatment of (ADHD).  Before you decide to try it, it is important to learn more about what CBD oil is, what the research says about what it can do, and what benefits and side effects it might have for alleviating symptoms of ADHD. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is most often diagnosed during childhood. It can cause symptoms including inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. CBD oil is derived from the marijuana plant. CBD is extracted from the cannabis plant and mixed with a carrier oil such as hemp seed oil, grapeseed oil, olive oil, or sunflower oil. Studies suggest that it appears to be relatively safe and well-tolerated, although further research is needed to look at the possible long-term effects. The cannabis plant contains hundreds of different compounds. The best known of these is (or THC) and it is the most abundant. It is also the substance responsible for marijuana's effects. In other words, THC is what causes people to experience the euphoric high associated with marijuana use. CBD, on the other hand, is the second most abundant cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant. Although it will not cause the high that TCH will, it does have an effect on the brain and is associated with some mental health benefits, including potential benefits for people who have ADHD. Some people who advocate for the use of CBD oil for ADHD suggest that: It might be more effective than some other treatments It might have fewer side effects than traditional medications Anecdotal evidence suggests it may help with ADHD symptoms Part of the appeal of using CBD oil may be to avoid some of the side effects that are associated with traditional ADHD treatments. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that between 70 and 80% of kids who have ADHD experience a reduction in symptoms after taking stimulant ADHD medication, they can cause side effects including sleep issues, decreased appetite, and mood changes.﻿ Before you decide to try CBD oil to treat ADHD, it is important to consider the available research. Most importantly, you should always talk to your doctor before you try any alternative remedies. So what do the experts have to say? Is CBD oil really effective for treating ADHD? Interest in the use of CBD has largely outpaced the research into its uses, safety, and effectiveness. While some proponents have made a number of claims, the truth is that research on the use of CBD as a treatment for ADHD is extremely limited. Most of what researchers already know stems from research on the use of smoked or ingested marijuana and not directly on the effects of CBD oil or other CBD products.  Even the available studies on the use of marijuana in the treatment of ADHD is very limited. Many of these studies also rely on self-reported data, which does not provide as much support as a randomized clinical trial. A 2013 study looked at cannabis use and ADHD subtypes. The data collected from more than 2,800 participants found that people were more likely to self-report hyperactive-impulsive symptoms when they were not self-medicating with cannabis.﻿ This suggests that people who use marijuana to self-treat may find relief for symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity. One small 2017 randomized controlled trial found that adults with ADHD treated with the cannabinoid medication Sativex (which contains THC and CBD) showed a minor reduction in ADHD symptoms with no cognitive impairments.﻿ However, it is important to note that these improvements were small and were not enough to demonstrate that cannabinoids were significantly more effective than treatment with a placebo. A 2020 study found that higher doses of medical cannabis were associated with a decreased use of ADHD medication in adults.﻿ The products containing a higher were associated with lower ADHD scores. While such results suggest that cannabis and cannabinoid compounds have promise as treatments for ADHD, they don’t indicate that CBD oil on its own might have an impact on the symptoms of the condition. Further research is also needed to determine the role that the endocannabinoid system plays in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  While the evidence that CBD oil might be useful as a treatment for ADHD remains scant, it may be useful for managing some of the symptoms that are sometimes associated with the condition. ADHD is often associated with a variety of co-occurring conditions including anxiety and . CBD has shown promise as a potential treatment for a number of mental health conditions, so it might be helpful for reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in people who also have ADHD. While further research is needed to explore CBD's effects, some studies have shown that it can be effective in reducing symptoms of a number of anxiety conditions including , , and .﻿ CBD has also been found to have an antidepressant-like effect, which may make it useful in the treatment of depression.﻿ It is important to be aware that much of this research is still in the early stages. More work needs to be done to explore the effects of CBD, what conditions it may treat, and what doses may be the most effective.  If you are thinking of taking CBD, you should also be aware that while it is usually well-tolerated, it may lead to some side effects. CBD oil may cause a number of side effects. Although many of these symptoms are mild, it's important to note some of the common complaints: Side effects may be more common at higher doses, although research suggests that CBD appears to be safe and well-tolerated at doses up to 1,500 mg per day.﻿ It is also important to note that CBD can impact the metabolism of certain medications. In addition to the most common side effects, there are also concerns about the potential worsening of some ADHD symptoms. Some of the effects associated with marijuana use are also common symptoms of ADHD. While CBD oil does not have psychoactive properties, it may also contain small amounts of THC, which could potentially exacerbate some ADHD symptoms. The memory and attention impairments that are associated with the use of cannabis are one potential concern. In an article published in the , Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), points out many of the potential negative side effects of marijuana use.﻿ Among these are impaired attention and memory, problems that can be long-term and become worse with chronic cannabis use. Another concern is that ADHD can be a risk factor for drug and alcohol misuse. Having impulsive symptoms may cause people to be more likely to misuse cannabis or develop a . This presents concerns when it comes to using cannabis or cannabis-related products in the treatment of ADHD symptoms.﻿ Whether the use of CBD oil might contribute to later marijuana use remains unknown. However, marijuana can potentially have negative effects on things like and . Young people who smoke marijuana can also experience lasting detriments to cognitive ability and . Some research suggests that very high doses may pose a risk of liver damage. In a study where mice were given very high doses of CBD, researchers observed that there was an increased risk for liver toxicity. Of course, more research is needed to determine if these same risks apply to humans.﻿ So should you try CBD oil for ADHD? Some important things to remember: . While there is evidence that CBD may have mental health uses, this does not mean that it is the best option for the treatment of ADHD. There are a number of effective treatments currently available to manage the symptoms of this condition. Until further evidence demonstrates the usefulness of CBD for this purpose, it is better to stick to known treatments that have a solid track record of effectiveness. Just because something is perceived as being more “natural” does not mean it is the best choice. CBD oil appeals to some people because it is seen as a natural product. But it is important to remember that “natural” does not necessarily mean that it will be safe. While CBD oil appears to have few or minor side effects in the short-term, researchers still are not sure about any long-term impacts it may have. . The jury is still out on whether CBD might be effective for treating ADHD and answers won’t become clear until further research is done.  . When you purchase these products, you have no way of knowing if you are getting what you think you are getting. There are no regulations or manufacturing oversight that allows consumers to feel secure about the purity of the products that they are purchasing.  There are different types of CBD oil to choose from and it is unclear which CBD products might be helpful in the treatment of ADHD. These types vary depending on what they contain. CBD oil isolate contains only CBD. Broad-spectrum products contain CBD as well as other cannabinoids, but not THC. Full-spectrum products, on the other hand, contain CBD, THC, and other cannabinoids. Some research has found that CBD may play a role in counteracting some of the negative side effects associated with THC.﻿ When it comes to ADHD, people who are thinking of trying CBD oil need to understand that there is a major lack of research on the topic. There are no randomized controlled trials that indicate whether it is effective or ineffective. There is also no research comparing CBD oil to other treatments for ADHD.  If you decide to try CBD oil for ADHD or other reasons, it is important to purchase it from reputable sources. Products containing CBD are frequently mislabeled, and since there is no federal regulation over these products, it is difficult to know exactly what you are getting. There is also no research comparing the effects of different forms of CBD. In addition to being available as an oil, CBD can also be purchased as capsules, gummies, sprays, tinctures, candies, beverages, and vaping oils. While CBD is growing in popularity, its legal status varies depending on where you live. All states permit CBD, but many have restrictions based on the THC levels found in the product. It is important to note that while many states have passed laws legalizing CBD and other cannabis products, any product containing more than 0.3% THC is illegal according to federal law. The FDA has also issued warnings about companies illegally selling unapproved CBD products boasting unsupported claims about their effectiveness in the treatment of ADHD and other conditions including Alzheimer's disease and autism. The Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits manufacturers from claiming that a product can prevent, treat, or cure a disease unless such claims are backed by reliable scientific studies. The FDA warns that consumers should be wary of such claims.﻿ “This is especially concerning when companies are peddling unproven CBD products for use in vulnerable populations like infants and children,” explained FDA Acting Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D. While CBD oil and other CBD products may show promise for relieving some symptoms of ADHD, there simply is not enough evidence to support using it as a treatment for ADHD.

1e57e732-1acd-4c81-9c05-c041fdc1cac2,"Attention Deficit Disorder Attention Deficit Disorder, or ADD, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD, are medical, not behavioral, disorders that are often associated together and thought of as ADD/ADHD. Attention Deficit Disorder causes people to be very inattentive and easily distracted. People who have Attention Deficit Disorder generally have the same symptoms as those with ADD and are also very hyper and impulsive. There have been many speculations on the validity of this disorder. Many people believe that this disorder is an excuse or a cop-out for undisciplined children. ADD/ADHD, however, has been studied for many years by professionals through observation and modern brain imaging technology, and is completely accepted by both the medical and legal fields. Attention Deficit Disorder is thought to be caused by a chemical problem in the brain. The front part of the brain, right behind the forehead, is said to be the part of the brain that helps you pay attention, organize things, and control impulsive behavior. Many scientists believe that people with ADD/ADHD, the front part of the brain is not able to use the brain signals, also called neurotransmitters, properly. The front part of the brain, however, has very little to do with intelligence, and therefore people with ADD/ADHD are not affected in this area. (Morrison, 1996) There are many symptoms that can be associated with ADD. Some of these are difficulty listening and paying attention, being easily distracted, avoidance of activities that require much effort, and a tendency to lose things, or forget things needed in daily activities. ... ... middle of paper ... ...atever they desire.

(NIMH-ADHD) A child may have one, any combination of two or even all three of these types. If a child has a hard time keeping their mind on one thing or if they get bored easy they have a type of ADHD that is called inattention. If the child has hyperactivity ADHD, they are always moving, can’t sit still, and talk incessantly. This makes it hard for them to understand how to interact with others because they have no interest in it. Other major characteristics of Schizoid are that they usually do not have strong emotions like anger, joy and sadness. This is because criticism and approval do not affect them since they do not care about how society views them. Which makes it hard for them to have strong emotions. Since there are levels of severity for this disorder, some diagnosed might not have as much isolation from society as others. Snider, V. E., Busch, T. & Arrowood, L. (2003).

The one thing that many of these children had in common, other than their ADD type symptoms, was that they were survivors of the encephalitis epidemic in 1917-1918. Numerous papers described children with ¡§post encephalitic behavior disorder¡¨ as impaired in attention, regulation of activity, and impulse control. Like Still¡¦s patients, these children were also socially disruptive and many had memory problems.¡¨(About.com: 2) At this time, the disorder was not recognized as AD/HD, but was known as ¡§Brain Damaged¡¨ because of the encephalitis. As time passed, other researchers discovered that these children were not brain damaged but had a learning disability. Is Medication Safe for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Children The section for side effects often comes in technical language and small print, and many people do not read this section at all. People tend to stop reading this section when they encounter difficult chemical names and descriptions. Furthermore, some of these drugs have been prescribed “off label”, which implies that they are being prescribed for age groups and conditions for which they were not officially tested. Aside from these problems, the majority of parents who signed for the informed consent for the medication of their children, were not fully informed about the effects of the medication to their children (O'Dell & Cook, 2004 ).

It is characterized by hyperactivity, impulsiveness and inattention. Despite being recognized as a by major medical and mental health institutions, as a disorder, its underlying causes and treatment.  tem from the belief that it involves medicalization of normal childhood behavior and that the symptoms of ADHD could be addressed by changing parenting styles or would resolve with age.  ADHD is a medical disorder with a strong biological basis rather than simply being a social construct.  The fact that ADHD is a brain disorder has been scientifically proven. Children affected by ADHD show differences in multiple brain structures, and also have different brain activity patterns. A strong hereditary component exists with ADHD, along with various environmental factors that affect normal biological development.  Consistent with these facts, ADHD is recognized as a neurodevelopmental disorder by all major medical and mental health institutions, including the National Institute of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorderspublished by the APA has outlined diagnostic criteria for ADHD, including the age of onset, the prevalence of symptoms and impairment caused by ADHD.   Individuals who have ADHD show signs of impulsivity, hyperactivity and inattention, often resulting in impairment in social, academic and work life. Furthermore, ADHD is frequently associated with and other mood disorders. These profoundly adverse consequences suggest that ADHD is a Fact: The precise causes of ADHD are unknown, but susceptibility to the disorder is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.  are not known, there is a strong genetic component to ADHD supporting the fact that symptoms of ADHD have a biological basis. As far as prevalence, the likelihood of ADHD ranges between in the first-degree relatives of individuals with ADHD. Other factors that are thought to contribute to ADHD include:  Among psychosocial factors, parental conflict or neglect may contribute to the development of the disorder, but genes and other biological factors play a larger role in determining causation. In other words, , although the latter may contribute to the development or severity of the disorder. 3. Myth: Children Who Are Given Special Accommodations Because of ADHD Are Getting an Unfair Advantage Children with ADHD face neurocognitive challenges not experienced by most other children. Special accommodations made for these children are no more unfair than the special accommodations made for children with physical disabilities. Due to their lack of concentration and difficulties in organizing information, children with ADHD tend to have poor grades, poor reading and math scores on standardized tests and a higher likelihood of repeating a grade.  Although behavioral therapy and use of medications are effective in ameliorating ADHD symptoms, their impact on academic performance is do improve scores on quizzes and worksheets, they do not normalize skills associated with learning new information and the application of the newly acquired knowledge. Behavioral and pharmacological treatments also do not result in improvement in standardized test scores, making provisions like Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires all public schools to provide special accommodations for individuals with disabilities, including ADHD. Special accommodations, including extended time during tests, more frequent breaks and modified instructions may be necessary to ensure the improvement and normalization of academic performance. Thus, special accommodations do not provide an unfair advantage to children with ADHD.   as frequently as girls. However, ADHD is often under-identified and in girls, due to the differences in symptoms presented by boys and girls.  Unlike boys, females with ADHD show fewer symptoms associated with hyperactivity and impulsivity and tend to show symptoms involving inattention. Young males also tend to be more frequently referred for relative to young females with a similar degree of impairment, resulting in under-identification.  and distress, whereas boys with ADHD show more overt symptoms related to hyperactivity and impulsivity, resulting in . This difference in symptoms, especially with regard to conduct problems that are likely to be reported, may be responsible for the discrepancy in the diagnosis of ADHD in females. 5. Myth: Children With ADHD Eventually Outgrow Their Condition One study reported that around 15% of children with ADHD for the disorder in adulthood, and over 65% partially meets the criteria. However, showed that 35% of adults who had ADHD in childhood, continued to fulfill the full DSM-5 criteria for the disorder. This indicates that many Persistence of ADHD is associated with comorbid psychiatric disorders and social and occupational impairment. Children suffering from ADHD who do not receive treatment are also at a of substance use disorders. This fact indicates that the effective Although critics claim that ADHD is overdiagnosed, there is little evidence to support this claim.  Although there are cases of misdiagnosis of ADHD stemming from the shared symptoms of ADHD with other psychiatric disorders, there is under-diagnosis of ADHD in girls. Furthermore, many families with individuals suffering from ADHD are reluctant to seek treatment or cannot afford treatment, resulting in under-diagnosis.  Thus, although there is evidence for misdiagnosis, there is little evidence to support over-diagnosis. The about overdiagnosis are likely informed by biases based on anecdotal evidence, mass media coverage, concerns about the safety of medications and the validity of ADHD as a disorder. Fact: Although the legitimacy of concerns about the must be acknowledged, the data from various studies does not support the case that children with ADHD are overdiagnosed and overmedicated.  conducted in 2003 showed that 4.4 million children between the ages of four and 17 years old had a history of ADHD diagnosis but only 56% were taking medication for the disorder. These data suggest that many children who have ADHD may not be receiving the necessary help. Not all cases of ADHD are characterized by hyperactivity. The DSM-5 identifies three different subtypes of ADHD, including: redominantly hyperactive-impulsive ADHD (ADHD-H): Individuals who have predominantly hyperactive-impulsive ADHD show impulsive behavior in social contexts with a tendency to talk constantly and interrupt others. They also have a tendency for constant motion involving fidgeting and squirming. The predominantly inattentive subtype (ADHD-I) is characterized by an inability to focus for a long time, difficulty following instructions as well as difficulty being organized. This subtype of The third combined subtype, ADHD-C, consists of individuals who show symptoms of both inattentiveness and hyperactivity-impulsivity. A recent meta-analysis found that ADHD-I, the subtype that does not involve maladaptive hyperactivity-impulsivity, was the in the population, but ADHD-C was the most common subtype referred for treatment. Fact: Many individuals with ADHD are intelligent, and only a small subset of ADHD individuals have impaired intellectual ability. due to their poor concentration and difficulty sustaining interest in a task. Besides being a biological condition that influences the attentional abilities of an individual, ADHD individuals also exhibit deficits in motivation. Individuals with ADHD are unable to delay gratification and show an impulsive preference for short-term rewards over long-term gains. These motivational deficits are accompanied by involving the neurotransmitter dopamine. Thus, individuals with ADHD may show an intrinsic inability to sustain interest, especially in activities that involve delayed gratification.  People who have ADHD are at a high risk of comorbid mood disorders and substance use disorders.

cd080ab4-c82d-4330-b3ae-3be7f605b7f1,"(ADHD) is a disorder that appears in early childhood. It makes it difficult for individuals to restrain their spontaneous responses—responses that can involve everything from movement to speech to attentiveness. The specific causes of are not known. But a number of factors like genetics, diet and social and physical environments may contribute to, or increase it. Environmental factors include alcohol and tobacco smoke exposure during pregnancy and exposure to lead in very early life. Complications during pregnancy and birth—including premature birth, infections during pregnancy, at birth, and in early childhood are also linked to an increased risk of developing ADHD. The signs and symptoms typically appear before the age of seven. There are basically three important symptoms – Poor concentration, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Only if a child shows all three symptoms in different environments like school and home, and are unable to control their behaviour are they considered for the diagnosis. . Adults with ADHD have difficulty following directions, remembering information, concentrating, organizing tasks or completing work within time limits. If these difficulties are not dealt with appropriately, they can cause associated behavioural, emotional, social, vocational and academic problems. Treatment usually involves both . Behavioural therapy involves adjusting the environment to promote more successful social interactions. Social skills training can help a child learn behaviours that will help them develop and maintain social relationships. Education and support for the parents can be an integral part of treating ADHD in children. Scientists and researchers are yet to ascertain the exact reason of what causes ADHD, though at the moment it is believed that it is an outcome of a combination of certain factors that leads to the existence of this disorder. There are a lot of studies underway trying to establish a cause and effect link for ADHD, some of the common causes that’s supposed to give rise to this disorder are: Research is indicative of the fact that ADHD can run in families and can be inherited from parents. Also a study published in in 2007 stated that children born with a particular type of gene had thinner brain tissues present in the areas related to attention. However, this wasn’t a permanent condition and as the child grew up the brain developed to a normal level of thickness thus reducing the ADHD symptoms too. Going by the evolutionary theories that propose the hunter VS farmer theory, states that hyperactivity may be an adaptive behaviour in pre-modern humans and that those with ADHD retain some of the older “hunter” characteristics associated with early pre-agricultural human society. According to this theory, individuals with ADHD may be more adept at searching and seeking and less adept at staying put and managing complex tasks over time. A study published in in 2011 pointed out that ADHD may or may not be inherited. Some mutations that may occur spontaneously might give rise to the condition. Studies have seen that alcohol and smoking during pregnancy can lead to ADHD in children. Also complications during pregnancy like premature birth, infections during pregnancy or at birth, brain injury during early childhood can lead to ADHD. Lead exposure during early infancy is also considered to be a probable cause. Though a direct link has not been established but there is enough indication that shows artificial colours used in food preparations can aggravate the symptoms of ADHD. A study published in in 2012 stated that avoiding artificial flavours, additive and colour in foods of children who suffer from ADHD experience fewer symptoms. On the onset the symptoms, ADHD appear to be very normal aspect of a child’s behaviour. Most of these behaviours disappear as the child grows. ‘A parent should be wary if the symptoms of attention deficit, hyperactivity and impulsiveness prolongs for at least six months at a stretch in every situation, like in the playground, home or the school. But if your notice that these symptoms are seen only suppose in the school and your baby is calm and composed at home or during play then it might not be a case of ADHD,’ says Dr Deshpande. The symptoms can range from mild, moderate to severe. Children suffering from ADHD often: Children who only have inattentive symptoms of ADHD are often overlooked, since they’re not disruptive. But, the symptoms of inattention have consequences: like unable to follow directions; underperforming in school; or clashing with other kids over not playing by the rules. Also remember some behaviours can appear to be ADHD-related, but are not. Some causes of ADHD-like behaviour are: Major life events or traumatic experiences (e.g. a recent move, death of a loved one, bullying, divorce). Medical disorders affecting brain function like neurological conditions, epilepsy, and sleep disorders. Psychological disorders including anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. Behavioural disorders such as conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder. Learning disabilities or problems with reading, writing, motor skills, or language. There is no single test to diagnose ADHD; however a series of assessments and other information gathering by the doctor can help one come to the conclusion and accurate diagnosis of the condition. The questions addressed during a counseling session with the pediatrician while diagnosing the condition are -   The symptoms must have a negative impact on the child’s life. How early the symptoms appeared? How long have the symptoms been bothering the child? Symptoms must have been going on for at least 6 months before ADHD can be diagnosed.  The symptoms of ADHD must be present in multiple settings, such as at home and school. If the symptoms only appear in one environment, it is unlikely that ADHD is to blame. Though it is imperative to seek treatment for ADHD but one should know that there aren’t any cures for the same. ADHD is treated with help of medications, various types of psychotherapy, education and training, or by using a combination of treatments. Stimulants such as methylphenidate and amphetamines are the most common type of medication used for treating ADHD. The main aim of prescribing medications  is to keep the symptoms like hyperactivity and impulsiveness under control. Medications can improve their ability to focus, work, and learn and also may improve physical coordination. ‘But remember there is no cure for the condition, while the medications are prescribed, it might keep the symptoms in check and improve concentration. There isn’t a cure for ADHD yet,’ says Dr Deshpande. But with medications there are also chances of developing certain side effects like decreased appetite, sleep problems, irritability, mild stomach aches and headaches. With a lower dose of the medications usually such minor side effects disappear. : Behavioural treatment for children with ADHD involves adjusting to the environment to promote more successful social interactions. Such adjustments include creating more structure, encouraging routines, and clearly stating expectations of the child with ADHD. While a child might have to live and deal with the condition there is a lot parents can do to help streamline the child’s behaviour pattern One common mistake that parents make with children suffering from ADHD is inconsistent parenting. ‘Behaviour as we see it is a combination of nature vs nurture. Some children are inherently overactive while others aren’t. Good parenting skills are required to deal with such children. However, it must be made clear that bad parenting can’t cause ADHD,’ says Dr Deshpande. But if a child with the condition isn’t handled carefully the symptoms might worsen. Parents need to set boundaries and limits for all children. Early and excessive exposure to electronic media like mobile phones, televisions and computers can be detrimental for your child. Many, many studies show that these devices have a negative impact on a child’s communication and socialisation skills.  Television and other electronic media provide passive stimulation which stifles creativity. ‘It’s believed that the brain of a young child gets used to this passive stimulation from an electronic device and they find that normal life doesn’t match up in the excitement stakes. This is when they start acting up to create a situation which is more exciting. This is why I tell all parents that TV shouldn’t be used as a substitute for a babysitter or a parent,’ says Dr Deshpande. To make sure your baby follows rules and is organized keep things at fixed places and encourage the habit of doing the same. Keep a fixed routine from waking up to getting back to bed constant to help your baby deal with everyday niggles. This has to include homework, outdoor play and indoor activities. Many therapists believe that parental involvement in a positive way can help correct a lot of behaviours in children including symptoms of ADHD. Practise an activity with your child that could help him cultivate the habit of focus and also relive stress to some extent. This can help to deal with the symptoms of ADHD effectively.

d4ebb688-2478-4972-ae28-7f7203477ccb,"Ⓒ 2021 About, Inc. (Dotdash) — All rights reserved Why abusing this stimulant drug used to treat ADHD can lead to addiction Elizabeth Hartney, BSc, MSc, MA, PhD is a psychologist, professor, and Director of the Centre for Health Leadership and Research at Royal Roads University, Canada. Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Ritalin is widely prescribed for both children and adults who have ADHD, but it also has the potential for abuse — begging the question, ""Is Ritalin addictive?""﻿ Unfortunately, the answer isn't a simple one. Here's why.  Ritalin, also known as , is a stimulant drug that's commonly used to treat attention problems in both adults and children, many of whom have described the effects of the drug positively. It works predominantly by increasing the norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain. Among other functions, dopamine is associated with pleasure, movement, and attention. When taken in larger doses than prescribed, Ritalin produces euphoria, increasing the potential for addiction in some individuals.﻿ Adderall, an amphetamine, is also often prescribed for ADHD and works similarly to Ritalin. Stimulant drugs are typically abused to enhance performance by speeding up mental processing and physical responses, to experience euphoria or to suppress appetite. They may appeal to people with eating disorders,  or problems with obesity, because of the appetite-suppressant and energy-releasing effects. Teens report that it helps their academic performance and some parents are even condoning it. People who take drugs for these reasons may have emotional vulnerabilities that could potentially contribute to . If taken according to the prescribed dosage, Ritalin is generally not considered to be addictive. As there is no set dose of Ritalin and the dosage usually starts low and is increased until ADHD symptoms are controlled, the prevalence of addiction to Ritalin is not known. A survey of 12th graders, however, indicated that more than 3% admitted taking Ritalin without a prescription in the past year.﻿ Some concerns include: Ritalin can be a gateway drug for some people, who go on to take other drugs. Taking Ritalin can also create early experiences of for some students. And if the drug is taken in higher doses, or through routes that intensify the effects — such as snorting the drug through the nose or injecting it — the risk of addiction increases. If you or a loved one are struggling with substance use or addiction, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our . Although Ritalin is generally considered safe, there are several unpleasant side effects as well as potential longer-term medical effects. These include:﻿  Abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal symptoms Cardiovascular side effects (tachycardia and palpitations) Some critics of the current medication approach to treating ADHD have argued that the risks of side effects are unacceptable, and that prescriptions of Ritalin, Adderall, and other drugs are inappropriate for children particularly in the widespread fashion in which they are prescribed in the USA — when the behavior being targeted may often simply reflect a lack of suitable outlets for childhood energy rather than pathology. Although medications are typically the first line of treatment offered to control the symptoms of ADHD, Ritalin and other drugs are not the only effective . And different medical groups have somewhat varying recommendations. In the U.K, for example, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines advise that medication be offered only if environmental and psychotherapeutic modifications have been ineffective. Stimulants can also be considered in less-severe cases for those who don't respond to psychotherapeutic approaches. Non-drug treatments for ADHD include a range of social, psychological and behavioral interventions. Most of these interventions involve working directly with the child, but some involve parents, guardians, and teachers. Dietary interventions may also be helpful when particular foods aggravate hyperactivity.﻿ For example,  has been shown in a few studies to be an effective, long-term, drug-free option for attentional disorders in some cases.﻿ Parents are often confused by the use of stimulants to calm down a child with ADHD. The exact mechanism of this is complex, but stimulants improve attention and functioning of the frontal cortex in the brain, allowing better regulation of behavior and impulsivity.

If you are a healthcare professional and you find any issue, please reach out to Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common adolescent , with estimates of its prevalence in children ranging from 5 to 11 percent. Though it is thought to be mainly in children, ADHD can also be diagnosed in adults. This condition affects children and adults differently. Most people, even those without ADHD, experience some degree of inattentive behavior from time to time. However, the inattention and impulsive behavior is more severe in people with ADHD. The behavior usually occurs more often and interferes with the individual’s daily function at home, school, work and in social situations. There is a common misconception that a person can’t have ADHD if they are not hyperactive. However, someone can have ADHD or attention-deficit disorder (ADD) even if they are not loud, impulsive or extremely active. ADD is a type of ADHD that doesn’t involve constant movement and fidgeting, but this is a blurry distinction. In the ’90s, medical practitioners generally agreed that all forms of attention-deficit disorder would be called attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, even if the person wasn’t hyperactive. When an individual has difficulty focusing on one task, cannot sit still, always stays busy or rarely finished tasks they begin, this may be a sign that they have ADHD. There are other outside factors that could cause a lack of attention, such as , or hyperactivity which can be caused by an energy drink. However, if the individual experiences symptoms that affect their daily lives, they should be tested for ADHD. There are many symptoms of ADHD, however, the type of symptoms depends on one of the three types of ADHD and individual could have. ADHD has three main categories which include inattention, hyperactive-impulsive and a combination of the two. Individuals who have inattentive type ADHD have difficulty paying attention or focusing on one task. They’re easily distracted but do not have much trouble with impulsivity or hyperactivity. This is sometimes, unofficially, referred to as ADD. Children with this type of ADHD may go undiagnosed because they may not be disruptive in class. They may seem shy and appear to be daydreaming most of the time. These individuals may not have significant behavior problems. But their problems with attention may still create many challenges. Children are usually diagnosed with hyperactive ADHD more than adults are. Kids who have this type of ADHD have symptoms of hyperactivity and feel a need for constant movement. The patient with hyperactive ADHD may struggle with impulse control. Typically, these individuals don’t have much trouble with inattention. It’s often easier to spot signs of this type of ADHD as the child may struggle to sit still in class and manage their behavior. Symptoms of hyperactive-impulsive behaviors include: If the individual is diagnosed with combination type ADHD, it means their symptoms don’t exclusively fall in the inattention or hyperactive-impulsive behavior categories. A combination of symptoms from both categories is exhibited in these individuals. The National Institute of Mental Health states that most children are diagnosed with a combination-type ADHD even though the most common symptom in preschool-age children is hyperactivity. A specific ADHD cause is not known, however, there have been several factors linked to the disorder. Researchers say some of these factors may lead to it, including genetics, a chemical imbalance in the brain, poor nutrition and brain injury. Even though it is rumored to be a factor, sugar does not cause ADHD. This condition is also not linked to a poor school environment, food allergies or watching too much television. Though ADHD cannot be prevented or cured, if it is spotted early, a good may be put into place for the patient to better manage their symptoms. People who have ADHD show a persistent pattern of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. The individual’s physician will complete physical ADHD tests to rule out any other physical possibilities before referring the patient to a mental health professional. The Diagnostic Statistical Manual states that there are different requirements for diagnosing each type of ADHD. The individual must contain six or more symptoms that are related to that specific type. This is a huge factor in the reason combination type ADHD is the most widely diagnosed. Because children are not finished growing mentally and do not have the coping mechanisms of an adult, they are affected differently by mental illnesses. Children with ADHD often find it difficult to concentrate on schoolwork or other tasks and may frequently daydream while they are supposed to be doing other activities. Some children with ADHD become disruptive, defiant and have trouble getting along with others. Children who struggle with hyperactivity and impulsivity have more behavioral challenges than adults. Overall, 5 to 11 percent of children and adolescents are diagnosed with ADHD every year. Children and teens with ADHD may benefit from accommodations at school to help adapt classroom environments and testing procedures to the students’ learning styles. Many adults who live with ADHD do not realize they have the disorder. To diagnose this disorder, it is important for medical professionals to conduct a comprehensive evaluation, including a review of past and current symptoms and a medical exam. ADHD adults are usually treated with medication, psychotherapy or a combination of the two. Behavior management strategies and involving can also be helpful. When a child has ADHD, the disorder often lasts into adulthood. Symptoms might look different at older ages. For example, in adults, hyperactivity may appear as extreme restlessness, always staying busy or wearing other people out with their activity. According to the American Psychological Association, approximately 5 percent of American adults have ADHD. That represents more than 11,000,000 people. This mental illness occurs in both men and women, but males are almost three times more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than females. During their lifetimes, 12.9 percent of men will be diagnosed with an attention disorder while only 4.9 percent of women will be diagnosed. Until recently, ADHD was considered a childhood disorder that individuals eventually grew out of. While evidence still suggests that up to 50 percent of children with ADHD do appear to see a decrease in symptoms as they age, many others do not. The average age of an ADHD diagnosis is seven years old with symptoms first appearing between the ages of three and six. Young adults with ADHD are more likely to . Researchers have also found links between ADHD and the and other recreational drugs, particularly in individuals who also have co-existing psychological disorders like anxiety or depression. People who struggle with ADHD typically start having problems with at an earlier age than people without the condition. Individuals with ADHD tend to display impulsive behavior, which may contribute to drug and . Both ADHD and alcoholism tend to be genetic.

The NIMH (The national institute of mental health) predicts that it affecting 3 to 5 percent of all children(AACAP), with an approximate amount of 30% to 65% of these children experiencing persistence of symptoms into adolescence and adulthood (AACAP).There are three types of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type, Predominantly Inattentive Type, and Combination Type(ehow.com). The symptoms of ADHD can be classified into three main categories; hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity. These behaviors can interfere with ADHD sufferers’ ability to focus deliberately on organizing and completing a specific task that they may not enjoy. A case of this kind of behavior is recognized in a report written by the National Institute of Mental Health where one of the subjects under study was unable to pass schooling examinations due to her inattentive behavior (clinicaltrials.gov) These kinds of behaviors can damage the person's relationships with others in addition to disrupting their daily life, consuming energy, and diminishing self-esteem, depending on severity of their symptoms (adhd.com).

Individuals who have ADHD and are left untreated can develop behavioral and emotional problems, difficulties within relationships and family problems. Children with this disorder never outgrow it, and adults often have difficulties keeping jobs and maintaining relationships with people. Research studies show that ADHD is genetic and may be environmentally induced. While there is no cure for ADHD, with proper education, psychological therapy, and medication people diagnosed with this disorder have had success in coping with their symptoms.   Signs and Symptoms of ADHD There are three main signs or symptoms of ADHD identified as; problems with paying attention, being very active, and acting before thinking. American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2007), found based on these symptoms three types of ADHD have been defined, which are: Inattentive type, where the person can’t stay focused on an activity; Hyperactive-impulsive type, where the person is very active and acts before thinking; and Combined type, where the person is inattentive, impulsive and overly active. Many children with ADHD who are the inattentive type have problems paying attention especially in school, and get distracted easily. Children who are the hyperactive-impulsive type are often very active and this is the most visible sign for ADHD. Hyperactivity and impulsivity go together which means the child is very active and acts before thinking. Children with this type often run around a lot, and have trouble being quite. Children with the combined type of ADHD often get depressed, tend to be insecure, and may have behavioral problems. While these are not symptoms of ADHD, they are problems that the child may have with coping with the disorder. Cause of ADHD The cause of ADHD is not known but studies have found it is often genetic and inherited. Researchers have not been able to diagnose the exact cause of ADHD but brain scan studies have shown a difference in the structure and brain activity of people afflicted with ADHD. These scans show that there is less activity in the area of the brain that controls activity and attention. Researchers also found that environmental factors could influence ADHD. Mothers, who smoked, drank alcohol or abused drugs during pregnancy increased the risk of having a child with ADHD (Biederman, J., Faraone, S. V., Keenan, K., Knee, E., et al. 1990). Scientists have found that preschool children exposed to lead paint have an increased risk of developmental and behavioral problems associated with ADHD. Exposure to PCBs in infancy may also increase the risk of developing ADHD. Treatment of ADHD American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Quality Improvement, Subcommittee on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. (2001), determined treatment for ADHD begins with a diagnosis and understanding of the person’s weaknesses and strengths. Knowing more about the disorder will help one understand how to help the person. The American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines recommend medicine and/or behavior therapy to treat the disorder. Research shows that school aged children who take medicine daily to help them often decreases their symptoms. The person’s doctor might recommend that the patient take a stimulant medication such as Dexedrine or Adderall or a methylphenidate medicine such as Ritalin or Concerta. Taking these medications improve symptoms about 70% for children and 58% for adults who have the disorder. Stimulants usually help to maintain focus and decrease hyperactivity and impulsivity. The medication side-effects are, loss of appetite, nervousness and problems sleeping. People are to be watched closely to be sure they are receiving the right dosage of the medicine. Behavioral therapy is recommended by the AAP guidelines which... References: American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. (2007).

Many children are being misdiagnosed because parents, teachers, and doctors are not taking into consideration that many other factors can lead to behavioral problems.

Carly Snyder, MD is a reproductive and perinatal psychiatrist who combines traditional psychiatry with integrative medicine-based treatments. Many women feel a huge sense of relief when they find out they have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). For years, they may have blamed themselves for their shortcomings and their has taken a hit. Constantly worrying about every detail of their lives may have led to emotional, mental, and physical exhaustion. After being diagnosed with ADHD, they finally know why they are the way they are. That it's not their fault. When they realize they have ADHD, feelings of inadequacy can begin to fade away, putting them in a better position to treat and manage their symptoms. Most people have a misperception that ADHD is a disorder for hyperactive schoolboys. Because of the way ADHD manifests in women does not fit this stereotype, women often don't get . A 2014 review of ADHD in women and girls found several obstacles to identifying ADHD in women, including:﻿ : Women tend to internalize symptoms much more than men. Specifically, girls' symptoms veer more toward inattentiveness and disorganization. Families and peers often overlook these symptoms and are therefore less likely to refer them for diagnosis. : Because ADHD symptoms are generally less disruptive in females, mood disorders (like anxiety or depression) are commonly diagnosed long before they get . : Women who develop better coping strategies than their male counterparts may be able to mask the negative effects of their ADHD symptoms. For example, many overcompensate with list-making to help them stay organized. Although doing this works, it also makes it very easy for doctors to miss the diagnosis. In general, it is often much easier for a teacher to notice a hyperactive young boy than an inattentive, daydreaming girl. Although hyperactivity tends to wane, symptoms such as inattention can continue into adulthood. For women, issues related to ADHD may worsen into adulthood. For example, after graduating from high school when the structure of school is no longer in place and the academic or workplace standard is higher, ADHD symptoms can start to cause more problems. Women can be diagnosed with hyperactivity-impulsivity ADHD, although less frequently than women with inattentive ADHD. Having hyperactivity poses its own challenges. You might find you have more physical energy than your peers and be accused of talking constantly. Because you seemed different, you might have memories of feeling rejected, judged, and excluded by your peers. This experience can continue into adulthood. There are many things that you can do to make it easier to cope with the symptoms of ADHD. If you think you may have ADHD but haven’t officially diagnosed yet, make this your priority. Getting diagnosed can have a positive effect on how you feel about yourself. One study found that women were able to forgive themselves for mistakes in the past and felt more in control of their current lives once they were diagnosed with ADHD. Knowing they weren’t crazy and that there was a name for what they were going through provided a huge sense of relief. Once you have been diagnosed by a psychiatrist, it's important to discuss treatment. , for example, are often highly effective for ADHD. ADHD rarely travels alone, which means you might have one or more other conditions in addition to your ADHD. Try not to feel alarmed. Knowing what other conditions you have, if any, allows you to treat each one directly, which in turn means you can be your healthiest. Sometimes symptoms of one condition can be masked by symptoms of ADHD or vice versa. The majority of adults with ADHD have at least one diagnosed or undiagnosed coexisting psychiatric disorder, including:﻿ This is why it's important to share all your symptoms and concerns with your doctor. Being honest about what you are experiencing doesn't mean that you are complaining. Your doctor needs to know how you feel and what you're struggling with so they can provide you with the most appropriate treatment. Inattention and distractibility are the most common reasons for transport accidents.﻿ They are also the most common symptoms experienced by women with ADHD. Drivers affected by ADHD can increase their safety on the road by doing the following: . Consider driving a car with a manual gearbox rather than automatic because it forces you to be more engaged in the moment and less likely to zone out. . Before you start to drive, switch your phone off so that you aren’t distracted by incoming calls or texts. Don’t talk on the phone—even with a headset. . Never drink and drive or take recreational drugs as these can further reduce your attention. Let go of the . Spending too much time on small things that don’t have a big impact on your life to the detriment of more important tasks creates undue stress and anxiety. For example, you might spend hours finding the perfect font for a report for work, while neglecting to start a presentation that is due tomorrow. Instead of putting pressure on yourself to meet impossibly high standards, work on . Since you have such high standards for yourself, the internal pressure to be perfect can also stop you from starting a task because it feels overwhelming. Difficulty with time management is common for adult women with ADHD. You may lose track of time, have difficulty following through on plans, or underestimate how much time is needed for a task. You may also spend so much time on a task—known as —that nothing else gets done. These difficulties can leave you feeling overwhelmed, frustrated, and exhausted. Below are some tips to help you manage your time better: . Whether you have to go to work, run errands, or tackle household chores, it can be helpful to write down your top priorities. Try the night before so that you can start your day strong. Having a ""game plan"" will help you feel calmer. .Many women with ADHD say that it takes them longer to do things that other people. Begin by recognizing what you seem to be able to do faster than other people and what takes you more time. When you can take a balanced look at your strengths and weaknesses, it will help your confidence and self-esteem.﻿ . Make sure you have plenty of time to finish a project by giving yourself some cushion. Get in the habit of giving yourself an extra 10 minutes for every 30 minutes you think it will take you to complete a task. . Allot yourself a limited amount of time for each task and use a timer to alert you when your time is up. The timer gives you an audible signal to stop what you are working on so you don't lose track of time. If you have hyperactivity, try incorporating into your daily routine.

1531d0ab-9c2f-401e-8ff5-4da92bdd927a,"Electroencephalographic Biofeedback in the Treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder , –() Historically, pharmacological treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been considered to be the only type of interventions effective for reducing the core symptoms of this condition. However, during the past three decades, a series of case and controlled group studies examining the effects of EEG biofeedback have reported improved attention and behavioral control, increased cortical activation on quantitative electroencephalographic examination, and gains on tests of intelligence and academic achievement in response to this type of treatment. This review paper critically examines the empirical evidence, applying the efficacy guidelines jointly established by the Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback (AAPB) and the International Society for Neuronal Regulation (ISNR). On the basis of these scientific principles, EEG biofeedback was determined to be “probably efficacious” for the treatment of ADHD. Although significant clinical improvement was reported in approximately 75% of the patients in each of the published research studies, additional randomized, controlled group studies are needed in order to provide a better estimate of the percentage of patients with ADHD who will demonstrate such gains in clinical practice.

66b790f9-7b40-4127-beb7-78c664e097c1,"Occupational issues of adults with ADHD , Article number:  () ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that persists into adulthood. Its symptoms cause impairments in a number of social domains, one of which is employment. We wish to produce a consensus statement on how ADHD affects employment. This consensus development conference statement was developed as a result of a joint international meeting held in July 2010. The consensus committee was international in scope (United Kingdom, mainland Europe, United Arab Emirates) and consisted of individuals from a broad range of backgrounds (Psychiatry, Occupational Medicine, Health Economists, Disability Advisors). The objectives of the conference were to discuss some of the occupational impairments adults with ADHD may face and how to address these problems from an inclusive perspective. Furthermore the conference looked at influencing policy and decision making at a political level to address impaired occupational functioning in adults with ADHD and fears around employing people with disabilities in general. The consensus was that there were clear weaknesses in the current arrangements in the UK and internationally to address occupational difficulties. More so, Occupational Health was not wholly integrated and used as a means of making positive changes to the workplace, but rather as a superfluous last resort that employers tried to avoid. Furthermore the lack of cross professional collaboration on occupational functioning in adults with ADHD was a significant problem. Future research needs to concentrate on further investigating occupational functioning in adults with ADHD and pilot exploratory initiatives and tools, leading to a better and more informed understanding of possible barriers to employment and potential schemes to put in place to address these problems. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterised by pervasive symptoms of hyperactivity, inattentiveness and impulsivity []. These symptoms surface relatively early in childhood and are fairly persistent over one’s lifespan []. ADHD is a condition that translates itself as overt behavioural disturbances in pre-school infants, school age children, adolescents and adults. Prevalence estimates are highly dependent on three main factors: the population sampled, the method of ascertainment, and the diagnostic criteria applied. The reported prevalence of ADHD in school age children varies from 1.7% to 17.8% depending on the criteria used []. Most estimates lie between 5% and 10% []. US estimates have historically been higher than UK estimates, due presumably to the application of narrower diagnostic criteria by UK authors []. Three studies of English populations have shown a prevalence rate of between 2% and 5%, depending on whether DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria were applied [, ]. ADHD has been found to not only be prevalent in the West but also in the Middle East, Africa and Asia []. Co-morbid Anxiety Disorders, Mood Disorders and Substance Misuse are commonly reported [, ]. Research on the aetiology of ADHD has concentrated on three distinct strands: morphological differences, hereditary factors and functional differences. has been reported in children with ADHD for some time and volumetric [, ] and cortical thickness [] studies, identified abnormalities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the frontoorbital cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and the corticostriatal system. The estimated of ADHD from simple genetic analyses ranges from 0.6 to 0.9 [] and an association between dopamine system genes and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder has also being shown []. in people with ADHD has also been documented in multiple domains; it is therefore suggested that ADHD is neuropsychologically heterogeneous [, ]. However, these deficits are closely linked with the ability to function at work [–]. Both children and adults experience motor co-ordination problems, which in adults could be detrimental to employment. Adults with ADHD also experience problems with working memory, planning and anticipation [, ]; they may also experience issues in verbal fluency, effort allocation, application of organisational strategies and self-regulation of emotional arousal. Despite this evidence, the general public associates ADHD with clear representations of a rampant child, rowdy and disobedient; brought on by the consumption of chemical additives. There is no doubt that ADHD has been under the spotlight of public scrutiny for a while, the majority of which has been negative. This publicity has resulted in defective and flawed representations of ADHD, and a disregard of Adult ADHD by some practitioners. It is our opinion that this neglect has resulted in policy makers, health professionals and businesses in general overlooking the occupational difficulties that can arise with ADHD. If we are to put in place the relevant framework and treatments to address these problems, Psychiatry, Occupational Medicine and Policy Makers must build bridges and focus on the needs of adults with ADHD and the barriers in employment that they face. The 'workplace' is a complex personal and social construct and indeed, occupation has been defined as “active process of living"" []. Models of human occupation have been studied using systems theory which refers to and was originally based on concepts of open systems and general systems theory [, ]. More recently, dynamical systems theory [], lead to the construction of the principle of “heterarchy” which suggests that aspects person’s environment are linked into a dynamic whole [, ] and that each component contributes something to a total dynamic. These aspects of a person's environment are affected by adult ADHD. In general, most employees in the second half of the 20th century, are paid for their “clock time” rather than specific outcomes with most of jobs designed as “mechanical” cogs in a larger production apparatus. It is in these “organisation ran by rules,” [] that adults with ADHD are requested to operate and this 'fit' is not always successful. ADHD is seldom diagnosed as a single disorder. In fact for patients with no diagnosis of ADHD, it is the co morbid that will lead the person present for help []. Co morbid disorders are common in adults with ADHD and include substance use disorders [], depression [], anxiety disorders [], personality disorders [] and of these specifically antisocial personality disorder [–]. In terms of the mood symptoms, these may be may be better understood as a core feature of the ADHD syndrome []. Furthermore, adults with ADHD may also present with ‘hidden impairments’ a term which includes ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Dyspraxia, Dyslexia and Dyscalculia [] so consideration should be given in diagnosing those disorders as well. The majority of research on adult ADHD has been conducted in the USA, and few studies have examined implications for social and occupational functioning. The fact that ADHD is associated with work-related problems in adulthood such as poor job performance, lower occupational status [], less job stability [] and increased absence days in comparison to adults without ADHD [] has been documented. With the current vogue for health economic arguments, one would have expected a stronger representation in the literature. It seems that this argument is just beginning to be studied and in the future further studies will emerge. In comparison to clinical experience about adult ADHD, empirical evidence about the expression of the disorder and the impairment it creates is relatively sparse. A few longitudinal studies following children with ADHD into adulthood have documented impairment in scholastic, occupational, relationship, and daily life functioning [, –] and this impairment is not different between genders []. As expected, outcomes from studies of adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood and followed to adulthood, differ somewhat from findings with samples of clinic-referred adults [] with clinic-referred adults reporting greater functional impairment than controls. Although studies of clinic-referred adults with ADHD indicate increased psychiatric comorbidity [], clinic-referred adults may report even higher rates of internalising symptoms than adults followed from childhood []. Additionally, clinic-referred adults with ADHD and adults reporting a prior ADHD diagnosis have more relationship and employment problems than controls [, ] and describe themselves as less socially competent []. The poor performance and work loss for adults with ADHD is likely to have profound economic implications. One study quantified this impact by estimating the excess costs (i.e. the difference between adult ADHD patients and matched controls) related to work loss []. Indirect work loss costs were calculated based on employer payments for disability claims and imputed wages for medically-related work absence days (e.g. days in the hospital, physician visits). Another study estimated that adult ADHD was associated with a 4-5% reduction in work performance (chi12=9.1, p=0.001), a 2.1 relative-odds of sickness absence (chi12=6.2, p=0.013), and a 2.0 relative-odds of workplace accidents-injuries (chi12=5.1, p=0.024) []. The excess costs were $1.20 billion for women with ADHD and $2.26 billion for men with ADHD in this US Study []. However, after controlling for substance abuse, history of depression or anxiety, it was stimulant therapy during childhood that was the strongest predictor for being in work as adults (odds ratio = 3.2, p = .014). In this study, 414 patients responded to questionnaires rating past and present symptoms of ADHD, co morbid conditions, treatment history, and work status [] it was suggested that treatment of ADHD in childhood created a pathway to employment. A recent survey undertaken by the World Health Organisation in 10 countries reported that 3.5% of the workers suffered from ADHD resulting in 143 million days of lost production. Workers with ADHD had an average 8.4 excess sickness absence days per year and even higher annualised average excess numbers of work days associated with reduced work quantity (21.7 days) and quality (13.6 days) Furthermore, a small minority of these workers are treated for ADHD despite evidence that such treatment can be quite effective in improving functioning []. The Consensus identified that ADHD adults experience impairment in all aspects related to employment, from the initial job search, to the interview and then in employment itself. When searching for a job they are disorganised and sporadic and find it difficult to interact with Employment Advisors at Job Centre. This difficulty in creating a working alliance with advisors most likely stems from the fact that adults with ADHD are disenfranchised and disengaged from the system in general. For example, their attentional problems and poor understanding of social conventions results in them avoiding ‘tedious’ tasks such as writing detailed application forms, completing them by missing out items and/or completing them without having read the question properly or reflected on their answer. At the interview the person may come across as very friendly and chatty. They may be a little inaccurate about their past history, and may overstate their ability to fulfil the requirements of the job. This is not the sole mandate of people with ADHD, nevertheless it is characteristic of many hopeful interviewees! An important problem however, is the decision of whether to disclose their ADHD status on application forms or in interviews. Most employers do not understand the implications of ADHD. They panic that it is a profound and prolonged condition and are not aware that it can be effectively treated and that reasonable adjustments can be easily made that will improve occupational functioning. Once employed and initially in post, ADHD adults may be highly motivated workers but, depending on the job, ADHD symptoms soon begin to hamper the person’s performance. Some people find functional employments that mask organisational problems (e.g. where they have secretarial or administrative support), or have employment that complements their symptoms (e.g. highly creative work or sports). Nevertheless, most skilled and unskilled occupations (e.g. administration posts) will be hampered by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Employees may have difficulties with time management, organising their schedule, keeping on top of their work load, following instructions and exhibit emotional liability. These are important symptoms to look out for when assessing the level of impairment above and beyond the norm. Individuals with ADHD may also be disadvantaged by poor social skills and procrastination, which make it hard for them to work effectively with colleagues, accept line management, and/or deal with the public. In trying to resolve the issue around lack of performance a line manager will most likely confront the employee, this critique will most likely be taken personally and from then on it will be difficult to re-motivate the person. Relationships with colleagues will become impulsive, abrasive and volatile. Information relayed in job appraisals will not be ensued and acted on as they are not in a position to adapt their behaviour. This most likely will result in another lost employment. Adults with ADHD can also become hyper-focused in activities especially if they are incentivised by it. Thus it is important to be aware of the potential for workaholism in adults with ADHD. An employer must harness the positives of ADHD and maintain the right balance, taking care to avoid burnout. Further research is required in order to fully understand the factors that influence occupational impairment and to develop specific and effective interventions. Identifying and treating ADHD in childhood is likely to improve long-term clinical and occupational outcome. Addressing co-morbidity is essential as this will further impair a patient’s functioning. It is vital that clinicians, when assessing occupational functioning of an adult, have a concise and detailed understanding of the situation they are in and to follow treatment outcome. This will facilitate the best treatment option, e.g. psychological or occupational therapy. The discussion above raises the question whether adult ADHD is a candidate for targeted work place screening and treatment programs. The argument is that ADHD among workers has non-trivial prevalence, high impairment and a low rate of treatment, whereas cost-effective therapies exist that are related to improvements in some objective aspects of role performance [, ]. In the first instance therefore, as part of the pre-employment screening, scales such as the adult ADHD self-report scale (ASRS) [] can be used routinely to identify potential employees with ADHD. are management and Human Resources must refer people with ADHD to Occupational Health Physicians need to be equipped and well-informed to be able to recognise these needs and suggest reasonable adjustments. There are several adjustments that could accommodate the needs of adults with ADHD. These need not be expensive or time-consuming to organise. Generally managers should implement systems that include regular meetings, reviews, and structured feedback for the individual. Verbal information should be supplemented in written format with clear, concise instructions. More specifically, to optimise attention and reduce distraction, employees could be provided with a private office, located in quieter rooms or positioned to reduce likelihood of distraction. They could also be offered flexi-time to work at quieter times of the day, or provided with headphones to reduce external noise. Impulsivity could be accommodated by a buddy system, as teaming up with a colleague will help the individual to remain focused. Hyperactivity can be dealt with by allowing productive movements at work, encouraging staff to remain active, and ensuring structured breaks are included in long meetings. Adults with ADHD suffer with organisation, time management and memory problems, and employers can tackle these problems by providing alarms or beepers, the use of structured notes and agendas, and providing regular supervision or mentoring, delegating more tedious tasks such as paperwork, and/or introducing incentives and rewards for task-completion. Best practice is one that identifies the problem and then successfully implements reasonable adjustments (Table ). Taking the view that vocational rehabilitation is whatever helps someone with a health problem to stay at, return to and remain in work [] the standard basic principles of healthcare and workplace management should apply for adults with ADHD. These are based on two functions: first, on , incorporating the idea of vocational rehabilitation, early intervention, and intervention tailored to individual needs and second, incorporating a proactive approach to supporting return–to-work, and the temporary provision of modified work and accommodations. Currently, this approach is not applied for adults with ADHD in the same manner as it is applied for people with common health problems such as anxiety, depression, stress, musculoskeletal pain and this places them at immediate disadvantage. The United Kingdom Government approach to employment in relation to mental ill health did not start from a medical perspective but from a sociological perspective. In 2004, the Social Exclusion Unit published a report [] which brought together analysis to show that people with mental health conditions were one of the most excluded groups in society. Having the opportunity to employment was seen as one of the routes to social inclusion and as a result, the Government commissioned more work to inform employment policy. Approximately 5 years later, almost concurrently, a number of reports were published which first, developed the framework for wellbeing at work for all and better employment results for people with mental health conditions in and out of work [], second, set out a series of actions [] on how there can better help more people with mental health conditions who are workless into sustained employment [] and third, recognised the importance of work to the journey of recovery from mental health condition []. Although these reports are laudable in their scope, they still missed the opportunity to include a number of disadvantaged individuals who do not always fall within the conversional mental illness definitions such as adult ADHD. A general review of the health of Britain’s working age population produced a document called ‘’ [] (Table ) which highlighted the need to swiftly change the widespread view that someone has to be 100% fit in order to be in work and made a number of recommendations which also apply for adults with ADHD. Currently employers are ill-informed and wary of recruiting disabled people, resulting in negative attitudes and defensive recruitment practices. Therefore it is important to encourage employers to think positively about the benefits of recruiting disabled people, who are reported to stay in employment longer and do a better job. More importantly employers are oblivious to disabilities such as ADHD and therefore fail to pick up on crucial symptoms or even differentiate between ADHD and non-ADHD. Partnership working will be essential to address occupational functioning in adults with ADHD. Input from occupational health professionals, employers, government, clinicians, voluntary sector and service-users will help create an all inclusive solution focused directive. In order to maximise the employment and retention of adults with ADHD, it is imperative that, with the support of the Government, local strategic partnerships and employers develop tools for employers to better understand ADHD as a disability. Raising awareness amongst small and large businesses will result in employers feeling more confident about the skills, limitations, and ‘employability’ of adults with ADHD. The provision of vocational rehabilitation for adults with ADHD may reduce occupational dysfunction and co-morbid conditions, such as depression, anxiety. In particular, specific interventions could be developed to address core problems such as inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity, distractibility, disorganisation, and time management problems in occupational settings. As the recommendations of the Black review [] become reality, there will be a need to educate policy makers and clinicians such as GP’s to the functional difficulties faced by adults with ADHD and how specific initiatives can be developed. There is an opportunity here for ADHD interest groups to develop guidance for GP’s in completing ‘Fit Notes’ for adults with ADHD. There is a lack of research on the topic of employment of adults with ADHD and in general, a lack of understanding on how to address these occupational issues still remains. Future research should focus in integrating findings using the Vocational Rehabilitation principles. As a first step, specialist occupational therapy interventions need to be developed [] specifically addressing the needs of adults with ADHD.

d507810b-371f-4b21-a073-4a9ff20a2691,"Medically reviewed by — ADHD is one of those pesky conditions that often gets brushed off as “life stuff” — especially for women. Women are more likely than men to have , and those who do receive a diagnosis typically get it later in life. ADHD symptoms also manifest differently in women. Throw in periods, hormones, and delightful female stereotypes and it’s no wonder women are more likely to confuse their ADHD symptoms for just another rough day. The only real way to get a diagnosis is from your doctor. But the following details can help you get a sense of if, when, and how to have that conversation. Before we get specific about ADHD’s effects on women, here’s an overview. ADHD typically starts showing up in early childhood, but depending on the severity of the symptoms, it may not be noticeable until adulthood. Many people go decades without realizing they have it. Typically, the disorder is characterized by a short attention span, difficulty focusing, restlessness, mood swings, and impulsiveness. For adults, the symptoms are a bit different and can even be similar to those of burnout. Symptoms may include: While all this might sound scary and pretty debilitating, most people can manage their symptoms and be as productive, focused, and centered as they need to be. Unfortunately, because women often shoulder a great deal of chronic stress, ADHD can show up for them in more persistent but less obvious ways. According to the nonprofit group Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD), a woman may not recognize ADHD in herself until one of her children gets a diagnosis. Rather than showing hyperactive characteristics, women with ADHD typically exhibit quieter inattentive qualities. They might forget to follow through with plans or have difficulty managing work and personal tasks at the same time. As a result, they may feel bad about themselves and struggle with stress or anxiety related to their overwhelming responsibilities. We live in a world that rewards productivity, often at the cost of emotional health. People don’t always seek help in managing stress due to stigma about how they’ll be perceived. Women have the extra burden of social expectations that require them to balance family and work, often more so than men. If left untreated, ADHD can significantly affect a woman’s health and happiness. Even if she learns to manage her symptoms, she may deal with constant stress. This could lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, digestive problems, and other physical ailments, putting her long-term health at risk. Let’s pause for a deep breath or two. All this is definitely a bit overwhelming — but that’s where a proper diagnosis comes in. Getting diagnosed will give you access to tools that can help you cope. So, how do you know if you have ADHD? If the symptoms sound familiar, you might want to talk to your doctor. ADHD symptoms are sometimes dismissed as typical behavior, especially in women, who are often perceived as overly emotional and anxious. Everyone goes through stressful times, but for people with ADHD, this stress goes deeper than just a difficult period at work — it’s a part of daily life. ADHD symptoms can also as hormone levels fluctuate. During the premenstrual period, when estrogen is low, mood swings and depression-like symptoms will typically be worse. This can make the disorder even harder to diagnose in women, since ADHD symptoms may be mistaken for typical PMS effects. If you feel like you’ve long had trouble accomplishing tasks without debilitating anxiety, it could be a result of ADHD or another mental health concern. According to the , about 50 percent of adults with ADHD also have an anxiety disorder. Because the symptoms of ADHD go hand in hand with chronic anxiety, it can be difficult to discern when a person has ADHD in addition to other conditions. Treatments for ADHD may conflict with treatments for anxiety and depression — and some . Work with a healthcare provider find the best treatment plan for your needs. Many forms of treatment can help women manage their ADHD symptoms. In some cases, may be helpful. Children can often , but for adults, medication may ultimately be the best option. Stimulants that contain methylphenidate or amphetamines (such as Adderall or Ritalin) are the most commonly used for treating ADHD. For many people, they can be lifesavers — but, like any medication, they may not be right for everyone. It’s important to with your doctor before deciding if this is the best course for you. Antidepressants could also help. Their effects vary from person to person and may take longer to notice. Your doctor might also suggest non-stimulant drugs, like Strattera, if stimulants aren’t right for you. It may take some experimentation to figure out what treatment works best for your body and your life. And it’s totally OK to speak up when something just doesn’t feel right. Although is most effective in children, counseling could also be a viable treatment option for adults. While you learn actionable skills for managing your ADHD, it can also help you identify the root of your anxiety and performance stress so you can start to address it internally. Look for a therapist who specializes in treating ADHD — yes, they exist! Though women may not always have the stereotypical symptoms of ADHD, the condition can significantly affect their lives. With an awareness of the expectations placed on women and a focus on the individual, doctors and patients can be better prepared to handle ADHD from the start, with less medical intervention.

ADHD stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. It is one of the most commonly diagnosed chronic psychiatric conditions among children and is based on such behavioral criteria as impulsivity, hyperactivity, inattention and or learning disabilities (Curbing Impulsivity). It is the single most common learning and behavioral problem in children, it is estimated that nearly 2 million children in the United States are affected by this disorder (U.S. Dept of Health). While the number of children diagnosed with ADHD increases dramatically every year, there is still much about the disorder that is not understood. Many parents and professionals use the terms ADD and ADHD interchangeably, however in 1994, the American Psychiatric Association renamed ADD to ADHD (Barkley 25). Understanding ADHD is extremely important, as it can contribute to problems at home and school, and affect a child’s ability to learn and get along with others socially. ADHD is the preferred term because it describes three primary aspects of the behavior; inattentive, hyperactive, and impulsive. The second most common type of ADHD is inattentive. A short attention span is the hallmark symptom of this disorder. “Unfortunately, many of these children never get diagnosed. Instead they are labeled slow, lazy, spacey,or unmotivated” (Amen 93). There is a list of symptoms of inattention in the DSM-IV, the diagnostic manual of the American Psychiatric Association. Personswho qualify for a diagnosis of ADHD have at least six of these symptoms and suffer significant impairment as a result: Often children with this type have severe problems paying close attention to details, or make careless mistakes in schoolwork, or other activities. They are usually distracted by an overstimulation environment or when a situation is low key or dull; their minds tend to wander and they frequently get distracted, thinking about or doing other things than the task at hand. Usually their attention is focused when they’re doing things they enjoy or hearing about topics of interest to them, but when the task is repetitive or boring, they quickly tune out. Children affected by this aspect of ADHD have a serious problem organizing their homework as they forget to write down their assignments, bring the wrong book home or leave their books at school. Kids with ADHD also have trouble concentrating if there are things going on around them; they usually need a calm, quiet environment in order to sustain attention (American Psychiatric Association). The third type of ADHD is impulsivity. Impulsivity is found in two areas: Behavioral Impulsivity, “the things that you do” and Cognitive Impulsivity, “the way that you think and make choices (Ferrari). The first area under this type to discuss is Behavioral Impulsivity. ADHD Childrenwho have symptoms of behavioral impulsivity do not stop and think before they act. No matter how many times they are told to “stop and think first” the next time the situation comes up, they may well do the same impulse thing again. They are often not able to learn from their past mistakes (Newideas.net). They will often blurt out inappropriate comments, display their emotions without restraint, and act without regard for the later consequences of their conduct (U.S. Dept of Health). Their learning threshold is very high, and if you don’t excite them or motivate them enough to get them above that learning threshold, they don’t learn, and they make the same mistake again. They act on the first impulse that occurs to them; they cut in line, blurt out answers in class, speak when they’re supposed to be quiet, maybe show aggressive behaviors and often have poor social skills (Ferrari). This can be quite exasperating to their parents, teachers, and other... Cited: American Psychiatric Association.

""Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder () is a neurobiological disorder that interferes with an individual's ability to attend to tasks (inattention), inhibits one's behavior (impulsivity), and may interfere with a person's ability to regulate one's activity level (hyper-activity) in developmentally appropriate ways (Barkley 19)"". The most important job for teachers and parents is to separate fact from fiction, to clarify what we know and don't know. Properly diagnosing , medication choices, and behavioral interventions are the key focal point. Is medication truly worth the side effects? Diagnosing As the name implies, is typically characterized by two distinct sets of symptoms: inattention and hyperactivity / impulsivity. Although these problems usually occur together, one may be present without the other and still qualify for an diagnosis. are diagnosed with when they have met specific guidelines within these two categories. A number of parents observe signs of inattentiveness, restlessness, and impulsivity in their child even before their child starts school.

DSM III-R Criteria for Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder 314.01 Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder () The essential features of this disorder are developmentally inappropriate degrees of inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity. People with the disorder generally display some disturbance in each of these areas, but to varying degrees. Manifestations of the disorder usually appear in most situations, including at home, in school, at work, and in social situations, but to varying degrees. Some people, however, show signs of the disorder in only one setting, such as at home or at school. Symptoms typically worsen in situations requiring sustained attention, such as listening to a teacher in a classroom, attending meetings, or doing class assignments or chores at home. Signs of the disorder may be minimal or absent when the person is receiving frequent reinforcement or very strict control, or is in a novel setting or a one-to-one situation (e.g., being examined in the clinician's office, or interacting with a videogame.)

However, are these few symptoms what doctors look at when diagnosing a child for AD(HD)? More and more research is leading doctors to believe that AD(H)D is being over diagnosed because of the lack of time doctors have to spend with their patients, doctors are not doing complete evaluations, and doctors who have the power of the prescription pad. Talking with a local doctor here in town, Dr. Patricia Depuy said, “We just don’t have time.” Like Dr. Depuy, many other doctors say the same thing. With a lack of time, it gives more room for error. Doctors do not have adequate enough time to do extensive evaluations on patients along with a background check of family history. As stated before and I will explain later in the paper, doctors that do not have adequate enough time also have the power of the prescription pad. Miami neurologist Sara Dorison says, “There’s no way you can screen for side effects in a 10-year-old in five minutes. You have to chat about their summer, their friends.” (www.time.com) Throughout all of my research I have repeatedly found doctors admitting that they simply do not have enough time to do extensive background checks and evaluations on the child and so they just diagnose them, give them a prescription and get them out of...

As a culture, we generally associate hyperactive, inattentive, or disruptive behavior with ADHD. But this mental health disorder is actually very complex. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, aka ADHD, does cause higher-than-usual levels of hyperactivity and impulsivity, but those are just a few of the symptoms. ADHD can present itself in a wide range of behaviors, depending on a person’s age and even gender. Unfortunately, this can make getting an accurate diagnosis difficult. Symptoms can appear as early as ages . About of children ages 2 to 17 have ADHD, and up to have symptoms into adulthood. A 2011 found that more than 1 in 10 school-age children were diagnosed with ADHD — and that number appeared to increase each year. Despite the prevalence of ADHD, doctors and researchers don’t know for sure what causes it. But research support the popular views that too much sugar, too much TV, or poverty can cause ADHD. It’s no surprise that identifying ADHD in babies and toddlers is extremely difficult. Many of the signs of ADHD — short attention span, impulsivity, tantrums, and high levels of activity — are also behaviors associated with the “terrible twos.” Before 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics’ diagnostic guidelines applied only to children ages 6 to 12. These guidelines have since expanded to include kids from . Many parents would agree that “active” and “energetic” describe a lot of young kids. Even the most spirited toddler can usually focus on a picture book or puzzle, but children with ADHD may not be able to complete these seemingly simple tasks. difficulty settling down, taking naps, or sitting for meals Diagnosing a young child with ADHD takes time — 6 months, in fact. Not only does their behavior have to be tracked, they must also display symptoms in more than one setting. Why? A developmental problem could be incorrectly diagnosed as ADHD, preventing the child from getting proper treatment. The National Survey of Children’s Health found that nearly 195,000 children ages 2 to 5 were diagnosed with ADHD between . As of , 388,000 children in that age range had received a diagnosis. Behavioral difficulties aren’t the only reason a doctor may suspect ADHD at a young age. central nervous system problems at critical moments in development a delay in motor development, speech, and language Just as there are no guidelines for diagnosing ADHD in toddlers, there are no protocols for treatment. Preschool-age children and infants who show signs of ADHD should see a specialist, such as a developmental pediatrician, speech pathologist, psychologist, or psychiatrist. After an evaluation, the specialist may be able to help your doctor determine the best course of treatment. The CDC behavioral therapy as a first step of treatment for toddlers. Parents will simultaneously receive training so they can better manage their child’s behavior. The child, meanwhile, will learn: Behavioral therapy appears to be as effective as stimulants in young children, but if symptoms don’t improve, medication may be necessary. In that case, your doctor will closely monitor the dosage to ensure your child gets the maximum benefit of the medication with the fewest possible side effects. When your child is old enough for kindergarten, consider asking their school for additional educational support. It’s common for children to daydream, fidget, and interrupt. But if these behaviors are so persistent that they’re affecting your child’s social life or academic performance, there may be an underlying issue. On , kids with ADHD are diagnosed at age 7, but they may show signs even earlier. One in 10 children between the ages of 5 and 17 are diagnosed with ADHD — it’s one of the neurodevelopmental disorders in the U.S. ADHD is commonly associated with trouble in the classroom, but there are usually other indications. an inability to recognize the needs and desires of others butting into conversations or games they’re not part of difficulty waiting during classroom activities or while playing with others angry outbursts at inappropriate times, temper tantrums, and trouble keeping emotions in check an inability to sit still, with frequent attempts to run around, fidget, or squirm in place when forced to sit difficulty playing quietly or doing leisure activities calmly showing interest in lots of things but having trouble finishing them once started difficulty paying attention, even when someone is speaking directly to them Avoidance of tasks needing extended mental effort: inability to focus on things requiring sustained mental effort (like homework) difficulty following instructions that require planning or executing a plan, which can lead to careless mistakes quieter and less involved than other kids — may include staring into space, daydreaming, and ignoring their surroundings difficulty keeping track of or prioritizing tasks and activities tendency to forget chores or homework or to lose things displaying signs in more than one setting, like showing lack of focus both in school and at home It’s easy to associate ADHD with loud, rambunctious behavior. But the disorder can actually present itself very differently in girls than in boys. Boys are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD, but that isn’t because girls are less susceptible to it. Symptoms in girls can be more subtle, making the disorder harder to pinpoint. from 2010 shows that boys display more externalized symptoms (like running around and acting impulsively), while girls’ behaviors are more internalized (like daydreaming). Since these signs are often overlooked, girls don’t get the evaluation or treatment they need. This can lead to physical and mental issues in the future. Girls with ADHD tend to show more inattentive symptoms. For example, they’re more likely to forget an assignment at school than to disrupt the class or act out. Because these signs aren’t as obvious as hyperactivity, teachers and parents may not realize the child is struggling. Instead, they may think she’s lazy, spacey, or immature or that she has a learning disability. Unfortunately, as many as of girls with ADHD go undiagnosed. And if they do finally get a diagnosis, it’s typically 5 years later than boys. talking excessively, even after parents or teachers ask them to stop crying frequently, even from a small disappointment constantly interrupting conversations or activities that include friends For young girls with undiagnosed ADHD, there’s more at risk than grades and social relationships. As they find it harder to function in everyday situations, they may begin to blame themselves and internalize their frustrations even more. has shown that this can lead to low self-esteem, which is linked to even bigger issues such as: Young women with ADHD are also three to four times to attempt suicide than girls undiagnosed with ADHD and two to three times more likely to self-harm. Girls with undiagnosed ADHD are also more likely to have issues at school, in social settings, and in personal relationships than girls without ADHD. Although boys are more commonly diagnosed with ADHD, the disorder is still sometimes overlooked. Since boys are perceived as more energetic, their hyperactivity may be written off as typical adolescent behavior. While has shown that boys with ADHD more often behave in impulsive and disruptive ways, they may also have inattentive symptoms, similar to those of girls. In those cases, it may be difficult for them to receive a correct diagnosis. running, hitting things, and other hyperactive behaviors frequent interruptions of conversations or activities If their ADHD goes undiagnosed, boys may begin to feel the impact of the disorder in other areas of their lives. In addition to struggling at school, at work, and in relationships, they’re also at risk for developing: ADHD symptoms tend to decrease with age, but the disorder doesn’t necessarily go away. Getting a prompt diagnosis can help lessen future effects and give your child a chance at getting better grades and maintaining a healthy mindset. If your child shows signs of ADHD at school, ask for a detailed list of concerns from their teacher and school counselor. This way you can provide their doctor with as much information as possible. Their doctor will perform an exam, provide a diagnosis, and develop a treatment plan (if necessary). The doctor may refer you to a child psychologist specializing in ADHD. For most children, a combination of medication and therapy is the best course of action. Since not all symptoms of ADHD can be controlled by medication alone, therapy can provide additional support and help fill in any gaps. More than half of children with ADHD will experience symptoms into adulthood. An estimated of adults have ADHD, but many don’t even realize it. When this disorder goes untreated, it can cause a number of issues that affect your everyday life. having trouble paying attention, being easily distracted, overlooking details, having difficulty following conversations, and being unable to complete tasks or projects the converse of being easily distracted — becoming so consumed in something that you lose awareness of what’s going on around you (which can lead to miscommunication and misunderstandings) regularly having a hectic or chaotic life experience, which leads to struggles with organizational skills, prioritizing, and keeping track of tasks procrastination, an inability to be on time or to use time efficiently, and trouble focusing on anything beyond the present forgetting dates, belongings, or commitments regularly, to the point where it may be confused with carelessness or a lack of intelligence acting inappropriately in social situations, rushing through tasks, interrupting conversations, and acting without considering the consequences (impulsive shopping is a common symptom of adult ADHD) feeling like you’re on an emotional roller coaster, with boredom suddenly being replaced by a need for excitement, or small frustrations leading to depression or mood swings being hypercritical of yourself, which can stem from an inability to concentrate (which may result in personal failures or underachievements) feeling open to doing everything while simultaneously feeling unmotivated to follow through a need to keep moving and doing things, which can lead to frustration and anxiety if you can’t do something immediately possibly due to hyperactivity, restlessness, or an ADHD medication side effect — fatigue can worsen attention issues symptoms like emotional problems, disorganization, and lack of motivation can cause you to neglect your health (think compulsive eating, neglecting exercise, or not taking important medication), and poor health can make ADHD symptoms even worse inattentiveness, talking over people, and feeling bored easily can come across as insensitive or uncaring, which may negatively affect professional, platonic, and romantic relationships though research behind the link isn’t conclusive, adults with ADHD are more likely to have issues with substance abuse (possibly because they attempt to self-medicate) Whether you notice signs of ADHD in your child or in yourself, it’s important to see a doctor as soon as possible. If your child regularly shows symptoms of ADHD or if their behavior is having a negative effect on their school performance or social life, you should contact their school and doctor immediately. A guidance counselor may be able to do a preliminary assessment, which can help with the doctor’s professional evaluation. You should also talk to your doctor if you have any ADHD symptoms. Changing jobs often, unhealthy patterns in relationships (like numerous divorces), and having few personal or professional achievements may be indicators of ADHD. Recognizing the different expressions of ADHD is key to properly diagnosing and treating it. Age and gender can have a major influence on how the disorder presents itself. Undiagnosed ADHD can have negative effects on many areas of your life, but seeking treatment can vastly improve the symptoms. In addition to medication, cognitive behavioral therapy, eating right, learning how to handle stress, and getting the right amount of sleep can help you manage your ADHD. Treating ADHD isn’t just about keeping your life in order. Children with ADHD are to have depression, and up to of adults with ADHD are also depressed. Though the cause of ADHD is unknown, researchers are looking for answers. Genetics, nutrition, and even neurotoxins may all play a role in the disorder’s development.

Is ADHD a Real Disorder or One End of a Normal Continuum? Rethinking ADHD as a common set of traits and an evolutionary mismatch. As a psychiatrist, I’ve been reflecting a lot lately on how, over a span of many years, I went from only occasionally diagnosing ADHD to seeing it frequently in patients referred to me for other reasons. Few disorders have stirred up as much controversy and as many strong opinions as (ADHD), with claims that it is overdiagnosed or does not exist at all, and that children are being drugged with potentially dangerous medications for normal naughtiness or fidgetiness, so as not to inconvenience teachers and parents. Factors that would seem to lend credence to the claim that ADHD is not a real disorder are the fact that (like almost all psychiatric disorders) the diagnosis is made purely by clinical impression, as there is no definitive biological test—or even a definitive cognitive test—for its diagnosis, and the can be interpreted quite broadly to apply to a large proportion of people. ADHD is defined by doctors as a neurodevelopmental disorder, but the specific causes are still debated. It is usually seen in early , though it is often only diagnosed later. It is thought to be a lifelong disorder, with over 50% of children and adolescents with the diagnosis continuing to have significant and impairing symptoms in adulthood. The prevalence of ADHD is estimated to be about 5-10% for children and adolescents and 2-5% for adults. When inattention and hyperactivity first came to be viewed as a disorder In 1798 the Scottish physician Sir Alexander Crichton described in detail a “disease of , if it can with propriety be called so” characterized by an “incapacity of attending with a necessary degree of constancy to any one object.” In 1902 the English pediatrician Sir George Frederic Still described a number of children in his clinical practice who had serious problems with sustained attention. Most of Still’s cases were reported to be quite overactive, and many were aggressive and resistant to discipline. All showed little “inhibitory volition” () over their behavior. From 1917 to 1928, the encephalitis lethargica epidemic spread around the world and affected approximately 20 million people. Many of the affected children who survived this brain infection subsequently displayed significantly abnormal behavior, which was referred to as “postencephalitic behavior disorder.” This quite often included hyperactivity and distractibility. These children were disruptive in their behavior in school. Postencephalitic behavior disorder aroused interest in hyperactivity in children and influenced the scientific development of the concept that became ADHD—especially the observation that hyperactivity and distractibility could be caused by brain damage. Stimulants found to be effective in treating hyperactivity and inattention In 1937, Charles Bradley, medical director of a hospital treating neurologically impaired children in Rhode Island, reported a positive effect of the stimulant medicine benzedrine on , learning, and behavior in children with various behavior disorders. Some of these children would possibly be diagnosed with ADHD today (others had definite neurological disorders or residual effects of encephalitis). Bradley later identified children who were most likely to benefit from benzedrine treatment as characterized among other things by short attention span, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness. Influenced by postencephalitic behavior disorder, in the 1940s through the 1960s the cluster of symptoms that we now think of as ADHD came to be referred to as minimal brain damage, a term later softened to minimal brain dysfunction. The assumption was that there was some form of subtle brain damage incurred either in childhood or during the birth process, even in the absence of neurological symptoms. Attempts were made in the 1950s to define the syndrome more specifically, and the name “hyperkinetic impulse disorder” was suggested. Hyperactivity was considered the most striking feature of the disorder. In 1960–1961, Ritalin, the trade name for , which had been synthesized in 1944, was approved for prescription by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Ritalin began to be marketed heavily for hyperactive children. A shift in emphasis from hyperactivity to inattention In the 1970s, further research in children with this disorder led to a shift in emphasis from hyperactivity to attention deficit, and toward the beneficial effects of stimulants on inattention. In 1980, with the publication of DSM-III, the disorder was renamed “Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) (with or without hyperactivity).” Hyperactivity was no longer considered an essential criterion for the disorder, which could be diagnosed “with or without hyperactivity.” In 1994. DSM-IV was published and kept the diagnostic category of ADHD but added three subtypes: Predominantly Inattentive, Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive, and Combined. In the 1990s, the disorder came to be regarded as not just a deficit of attention, but a more general weakness of or cognitive control (which includes, among other things, attentional control, inhibitory control, and working ). These cognitive functions are important for such things as goal-directedness, self-control, and organization. Motivational deficits and deficits in brain reward/reinforcement mechanisms also came to be seen as part of the disorder. It was also recognized in the 1990s that ADHD was not exclusively a childhood disorder that resolves with age, but rather a chronic, persistent disorder continuing into adulthood in many cases (though it does seem to improve in adulthood in some people). Research into the biological underpinnings of ADHD also increased in the 1990s and 2000s. Structural and functional brain imaging studies identified specific abnormalities in ADHD. Several genetic associations were identified for the disorder, which had been shown from family, twin, and studies to be strongly heritable. People with ADHD were found to have underactivity of in their brains, which fits with the theory that their brains are “understimulated” or underaroused, requiring higher levels of external stimulation and novelty to activate their attentional and reward systems. In 2013, the was published and kept the same symptoms as those in DSM-IV but slightly lowered the threshold for making the diagnosis, in both children and adults. In the 1990s there was an at least three-fold rise in stimulant prescriptions in the United States, primarily to treat children with ADHD. This was partly due to the disorder becoming better understood and more generally accepted within the medical and mental health communities. In the early 2000s, several long-acting forms of stimulants, such as Concerta, Adderall XR and Vyvanse, were introduced and heavily marketed. The National Survey of Children’s Health revealed that 9.5% of American youth aged 4–17 had received a diagnosis of ADHD as of 2007, with two-thirds of the diagnosed group receiving . As ADHD diagnoses and stimulant prescriptions increased, public doubt increased regarding the validity of the diagnosis and the justifications for treatment. Critics argued that ADHD is an unnecessary medicalization of children who are not ill but who simply display challenging behavior. Some argued that the diagnosis was invented or greatly expanded purely to serve the financial interests of drug companies. A big part of the problem in the debate is the binary view (reinforced by the categorical approach of the DSMs) that ADHD is a “thing” that you either have or do not have. It probably makes far more sense to conceptualize it as one end of a continuum of traits defining the general population: The trait on the X-axis of the graph would be attention span, or perhaps more broadly, executive function. Thus, the left end of the curve would represent people with ADHD. This model can be applied to other mental disorders, too; the trait on the X-axis could just as well be . There is in fact considerable evidence for ADHD being one end of a continuum rather than a discrete entity. Even the brain imaging and genetic findings associated with ADHD are consistent with a continuum model. This does not negate the distress and impairment of functioning associated with more severe symptoms, nor the need for and value of treatment. But it does inevitably mean that there will always be debate about what degree of symptoms (or perhaps we should say of ) warrants treatment. It also means that the “treatments” can legitimately be understood as performance enhancers, improving the functioning of individuals with a short attention span. A continuum model explains why the threshold for diagnosis is fluid. It becomes clear how the threshold might have decreased with time, as society changed in the direction of increasing demands in school and job performance. The structure of schools, and of many modern occupations, favors individuals who are more able to sustain effortful focus and attention to detail for low-stimulation tasks that require quiet patience, persistence, organization, self-discipline, and the ability to work towards very delayed or abstract rewards. created by modern societies bears little resemblance to the ancestral environment in which our species evolved for most of its history. Paleolithic hunter-gatherer groups probably benefited as much from quick-thinking exploratory risk-takers—adventurous novelty-seekers who swiftly got the gist of their surroundings, made snap decisions, had quicker responses to predators, and were eager to migrate, as they did from the tribesmen who noticed and were interested in the small details—such as the trackers who meticulously and patiently studied the prey’s hoof prints to deduce the animal’s type, size, age, health, and time of transit. It is unlikely that the ""disorder"" of ADHD would be as prevalent in the human species if it were not maintained by evolutionary selection pressures that conveyed certain advantages to some of its characteristics or associated traits. The traits that define ADHD—focus, cognitive control, inhibitory control (self-control), and sensitivity to reward (which drives motivation)—are traits that are fundamental to human functioning. ADHD can be understood as one end of a spectrum of normal, centrally important human traits. A large swath of the population find themselves disadvantaged by evolutionary mismatch in our highly structured society. Seen this way, ADHD is not just one among many specific kinds of psychiatric disorders (in the DSM, ADHD is listed as one of a large number of categorical mental disorders). Rather, it makes more sense to view it as one end of a continuum of a set of centrally important cognitive and behavioral traits that underlie and determine many aspects of human functioning. 1. See for example the National Institute of Mental Health's statistics on ADHD, or the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2018 ADHD guidelines or the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance (CADDRA)'s ADHD Practice Guidelines, 2018. Rates of diagnosis have been going up, especially in the U.S. The NIMH reports that the prevalence of children ever diagnosed with ADHD increased by 42% between 2003 (7.8%) and 2011 (11.0%). ADHD is diagnosed in more than twice as many boys as girls (15.1% vs. 6.7% in the U.S. in 2011), but it tends to be under-recognized in girls, who tend to be less disruptive than boys. It may also be under-recognized in adults. More conservative estimates put the overall prevalence of more strictly defined ADHD in children at 3-5%, and still lower (1-2%) when diagnosed with the WHO’s more restrictive ICD-10 criteria. Much of the controversy about diagnosis centers on the less severe cases and their overlap with what might be regarded as normal traits and behaviors. As one critical of the increasing rates of diagnosis and treatment (and the influence of pharmaceutical company marketing) in the U.S. put it: “Although proper A.D.H.D. diagnoses and medication have helped millions of children lead more productive lives, concerns remain that questionable diagnoses carry unappreciated costs."" 2. He added: “When people are affected in this manner, which they very frequently are, they have a particular name for the state of their nerves, which is expressive enough of their feelings. They say they have the fidgets.” [a reprint of his 1798 book chapter can be found in: Crichton A. (2008). An inquiry into the nature and origin of mental derangement: on attention and its diseases. , 12(3), 200–206. .] There was an even earlier description of an ADHD-like syndrome by a renowned German physician, Melchior Adam Weikard, in 1775 [Barkley, R. A., & Peters, H. (2012). The earliest reference to ADHD in the medical literature? Melchior Adam Weikard's description in 1775 of ""attention deficit"" (Mangel der Aufmerksamkeit, Attentio Volubilis). , 16(8), 623–630. ].   Also of interest in the history of ADHD, in 1844 the German physician Heinrich Hoffmann created an illustrated children’s story including “Fidgety Phil,” which described a naughty boy with what today might be considered ADHD. 3. He believed that these children displayed a major “defect in moral control.” He defined moral control as “the control of action in conformity with the idea of the good of all.” [Barkley, R. A., & Peters, H. (2012)]. He agreed with William James’s notion that failure of volitional control is fundamentally an attentional problem. Being unable to hold an idea for a particular course of action clearly in mind, the child is at the whim of stimuli promising immediate gratification. Still observed that both parents and teachers commonly noted inattention as a significant behavioral problem. Many of Still’s patients had either a history of retardation or physical disease affecting their brain, but a number of them did not have any such history. [Connors, K: From the Editor. . 2000; 3(4):173-191. ] 4. Lange, K. W., Reichl, S., Lange, K. M., Tucha, L., & Tucha, O. (2010). The history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. , 2(4), 241–255. 5. Modern pharmacological treatments for ADHD are mostly stimulants. At the risk of oversimplification, you could think of these stimulants as similar to caffeine, but stronger and more effective. 6. [Bradley, 1937, cited by Lange et al. (2010)] This was a chance finding—the stimulant was given to the children for other medical reasons but was noticed to lead to a striking improvement in behavior and school performance in many of them. In addition, some decrease in motor activity was usually noted in the children, who also “became emotionally subdued without, however, losing interest in their surroundings.” The seemingly paradoxical effect of a stimulant subduing hyperactive behavior was attributed to the drug stimulating the higher inhibitory regions of the brain, thereby increasing the inhibition of behavior. We now have a better understanding of the circuitry and mechanisms, but this was more or less a correct understanding. Stimulants also directly stimulate attention and reinforce motivation. 7. Despite Bradley’s finding, stimulant prescriptions for hyperactive / inattentive children did not really increase in the next 25 years or more, perhaps partly because the syndrome was not yet clearly defined and named, and perhaps also due to the influence of psychoanalysis at that time. 8. In 1968, the second edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-II) renamed it “hyperkinetic reaction of childhood” (The APA was at that time heavily influenced by psychoanalytic thinking, which tended to assume that mental disorders were to childhood psychological trauma or parent-child relational issues). Hyperkinetic reaction of childhood was defined as being characterized by overactivity, restlessness, distractibility, and short attention span, and was thought to be mostly a problem in young children. 9. Stephen Hinshaw and Richard Scheffler, The ADHD Explosion: Myths, Medication, Money, and Today's Push for Performance (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), Kindle Edition, p. 5.   The amphetamine stimulant dextroamphetamine (trade name: Dexedrine), which had been around since the 1930s, was also being marketed and prescribed for hyperactivity and inattention in the 1970s. There is a very interesting, revealing and concerning parallel from the 1930s through the 1960s of widespread non-medical use / misuse of stimulants in the (particularly in Nazi Germany, to power the blitzkrieg), in general culture (particularly in the U.K. and U.S., including among , to enhance creativity and productivity), as weight-loss medications and attempts to treat depression, in what in America has been called the . 10. In contrast to the criteria for ADD in the DSM-III (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition), the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases, ninth edition (ICD-9) continued to focus on hyperactivity as necessary for the diagnosis, calling it hyperkinetic disorder. This continued in ICD-10 but is changing in ICD-11. 11. Some studies suggested that not all children with ADHD had deficits of executive function—but it partly depended on how these were defined and measured. 12. The cerebral cortex, particularly the frontal cortex (and prefrontal-striatal circuitry), has been found to be thinner in individuals with ADHD. suggested that this is merely a developmental lag, whereas other studies in adults (e.g. and ) suggested persisting deficits. 13. In 2009, an important research paper was published by Nora Volkow and colleagues showing reduced dopamine receptors and dopamine transporters in the brain’s reward pathway in adults with ADHD. These research subjects had never been medicated for their ADHD, so medication effects could not have been the cause. This paper revived the idea that patients with ADHD may have reward and motivation deficits, not just inattention and low inhibitory control. [Volkow, N. D., Wang, G. J., Kollins, S. H., Wigal, T. L., Newcorn, J. H., Telang, F., Fowler, J. S., Zhu, W., Logan, J., Ma, Y., Pradhan, K., Wong, C., & Swanson, J. M. (2009). Evaluating dopamine reward pathway in ADHD: clinical implications. , 302(10), 1084–1091. ]. Nora Volkow is a research psychiatrist and Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 14. Stimulant medications increase the level of dopamine transmission and hence the brain’s sensitivity to external stimuli and reward, thereby having a focusing and motivating effect. They basically make otherwise uninteresting stimuli and boring tasks more engaging to the brain. Via these primary effects they have their secondary effects of reducing ADHD behaviors such as bored stimulus-seeking, novelty-seeking, impatience, restlessness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. 15. Hinshaw and Scheffler, , p. 7. 16. The effects of these medications last for up to 12 hours, compared with 3-4 hours for Ritalin and 5 hours for the other older short-acting stimulant, Dexedrine. 17. These new drugs were significantly more expensive than off-patent Ritalin and Dexedrine. Naturally, pharmaceutical companies aggressively marketed their new drugs, including encouraging doctors to recognize and diagnose ADHD more often. 18. Hinshaw and Scheffler, , p. 9.   In 2016, 9.4% had received the diagnosis according to this survey, suggesting that the increase might have plateaued ( and ) 19. Alternatively, it has been argued that ADHD is not a disease as such but rather a cluster of non-specific symptoms that are a final common behavioral pathway for a range of emotional, psychological, and/or learning problems. 20. Drug companies have also been criticized for downplaying the risks of stimulant medications. And there has been increasing concern about rising rates of inappropriate stimulant prescriptions in young adults who seek them as performance enhancers and who don’t necessarily need them. There have been alarming reports in the media of , of stimulants causing serious adverse effects with , and of the general trend toward . 21. On a bell-curve, just as when describing the population according to any other normally distributed trait, such as IQ, height or blood pressure. 22. The model implies that traits at the opposite end of the curve are also dysfunctional. And indeed, being excessively focused (and excessively self-controlled), or for that matter, being too low in anxiety, are very much associated with dysfunction and with psychiatric disorder. 23. McLennan J. D. (2016). Understanding attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as a continuum. , 62(12), 979–982. 24. Faraone, S. V., & Larsson, H. (2019). Genetics of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. , 24(4), 562–575. 25. As the continuum / bell-curve model implies, ADHD may simply be the statistical result of the way the genetic “cards” are “dealt.” While this may be the case for most individuals who meet criteria for ADHD, it is also possible that in some other cases—particularly those with more severe symptoms, ADHD may be the result of specific pathological causes. This is also what we see in intellectual disability: most people who score low on IQ simply got dealt a bad hand, and are quite likely to have inherited this trait from their parents, who may themselves score relatively low on IQ. But some individuals with low IQ, particularly the more severely affected, have specific causes for their disability, such as chromosomal disorders, metabolic disorders, or brain damage sustained at birth. To be clear, we are talking about IQ here simply as an analogy: to consider how ADHD, like low IQ, could represent one end of a normal continuum, described by a bell-curve, and yet might in addition sometimes be caused by specific diseases. It is noteworthy in this regard that certain non-genetic biological factors have been linked to an increased risk of ADHD: low birth weight, heavy maternal alcohol use during pregnancy, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and lead levels. It is also noteworthy that there is a significant comorbidity (co-occurrence) of specific learning disabilities (e.g. dyslexia, dysgraphia, auditory processing disorder) with ADHD—anywhere from 30 to 50 percent, according to some estimates. 26. There is in fact a very interesting finding showing an association between ancestral migration distance of different human populations across the globe and a genetic marker for a certain kind of dopamine receptor that is associated with novelty-seeking ADHD traits [Matthews, L. J., & Butler, P. M. (2011). Novelty-seeking DRD4 polymorphisms are associated with human migration distance out-of-Africa after controlling for neutral population gene structure. , 145(3), 382–389. ] 27. You might wonder why evolution would favor extreme traits—the tail ends of the bell curve. I addressed this in an : Statistically, some individuals in every generation will inherit more extreme versions of traits at either end of the spectrum. While extremes of a trait might seldom be advantageous, they are an inevitable statistical result of genetic diversity, and that diversity is certainly adaptive for the species as a whole. You can’t have a bell curve distribution of traits without the two extremes or “tails” of the curve. From an evolutionary point of view, it is possible that in certain situations ADHD traits may have been beneficial to society as a whole, by increasing reproductive fitness and adding diversity to the gene pool, despite being detrimental to the individual. 28. Jensen, P. S., Mrazek, D., Knapp, P. K., Steinberg, L., Pfeffer, C., Schowalter, J., & Shapiro, T. (1997). Evolution and revolution in child psychiatry: ADHD as a disorder of adaptation. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 36(12), 1672–1681. (Dr. Peter Jensen was at that time Chief of the Child and Adolescent Disorders Research Branch, National Institute of Mental Health).  See also and , for other examples of articles exploring evolutionary explanations for ADHD. 29. This way of understanding ADHD also fits with the National Institute of Mental Health’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), a long term project attempting to ultimately devise a framework for understanding mental disorders that will be fundamentally different from the current symptom-based DSM categories. The RDoC approach is based on underlying brain processes, and it conceptualizes mental disorders dimensionally (i.e. on continua) rather than categorically as discrete entities. As their explains: “RDoC is a research framework for investigating mental disorders. It integrates many levels of information (from genomics and circuits to behavior and self-report) to explore basic dimensions of functioning that span the full range of human behavior from normal to abnormal.” A look at the shows that ADHD traits include several central dimensions of brain functioning, including reward responsiveness, attention, and cognitive control (and often working memory too). Another fundamental way of understanding human behavior is the . According to this model, there are five fundamental factors / dimensions describing human personality (much of which is determined by inborn temperament). The general population is distributed on a bell-curve for each of these five factors / dimensions. Extreme traits at either end of a dimension, i.e. at the left or right hand tails of the bell curve, are maladaptive. ADHD maps onto the left-hand side of the curve for one of the five fundamental factors: the factor referred to as conscientiousness (which is further defined by a number of traits). For more explanation, see my blog post “What Makes Some People So Motivated and Self-Controlled?” Once again, we see according to this model that ADHD is not just one among a large number of very particular kinds of psychological difficulties that people can have, but rather can be better understood as one end of a continuum of an over-arching set of centrally important traits—among just a few fundamental sets of traits defining humans.

(Jaska, 1998). These occur on a daily bases. ADD is a broader topic; ADHD is a subtype with in this category. Children can be diagnosed with ADD with or with out hyperactivity. ADD/ADHD is genetically linked disorder. Some parents may want to blame it on their child, but in fact it runs within families. If a parent or a teacher sees some of these patterns forming, they should seek professional help. These professionals can identify the problem; they can see psychologist, psychiatrist, pediatrician, and neurologist or any other specialist in this area. Many of these professionals use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R), which is a clinical manual that describes systems of all the different disorders that are known to the association (Hocutt, et al, 1993). Many parents want to blame the educational system or the teacher for this disorder occurring to their child. There has been a notice of the increase in both private and public school that children are being diagnosed with ADD/ADHD disorder. Sometimes looked at as an easy escape , but this is not always true. As a teacher, one must be able to recognize and know how to provide accommodation for these students in the (Polloway, et al, 1998). Teachers can use “four fundamental intervention areas: environmental management which includes; psychosocial: teacher, family, peers and students, physical: assertive technology, seating and arrangement of classroom, instructional: transitions, grouping lesson planning, procedural: classroom rules. Instructional accommodations one must look at; curriculum, materials, involvement and the final products, student- regulated strategies you must increase attention/focus, modify impulsive responding, and provide help for peer relations. And lastly is there medical management treatment” (1998), this is a model for intervention. This can be overwhelming for one teacher. A classroom filled with children with all needing something different can in the long run be harmful for the students. That is why many teachers need teaching assistance to help them. This would provide more attention to each child. Parents must understand that everyone shows signs of ADHD at times, so the DMS (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) has a specific guideline for determining ADHD. (Aschenbrenner, Diane S.) Showing signs of ADHD could mean the child is suffering from chronic fear of mild seizures. If the child has problems in school it could mean one of three things. One is the child actually has ADHD. The child has trouble paying attention and may get frustrated with school. This same study showed that discipline varied greatly between schools. This report also revealed the urgent need for a more thoughtful technique in school discipline policies. In many cases teachers have exhausted their classroom management strategies without success. Behavior Modification is aimed at improving school and classroom behavior, and can give teachers additional tools to help them to deal proactively and effectively with behaviors that are disruptive to students and teachers in the classroom. When children are disruptive in the classroom it can cause a lot of problems for their classmates and their teacher. A few examples of hyperactivity are talking excessively, fidgeting with hands/feet and squirming in seat, and leaving seat when remaining in seat is expected. On the outside perspective you can tell if someone has ADHD because they have emotional instability, low self-esteem and get frequently frustrated with oneself. According to (Asherson, 2012), not only des ADHD express itself with the above features, it also causes neurological conditions such as: sleep disorders, Tourette’s syndrome, epilepsy and general learning difficulties. ADHD can have a developmental impact on one’s education. As a preschooler through school age students with ADHD will experience behavioral disturbance, poor social interaction with peers, and academic impairment.

Is ADHD a real diagnosis? “Some say that this explosion of childhood ADHD is indicative of what’s wrong with our society and education system. They blame parents and an educator for choosing quick fixes for what they say is a behavioral problem, not a brain-based disorder.” Regardless of all the research that supports that ADHD is a brain-based disorder, the dramatic rise that still keeps developing is causing people to doubt the reality of ADHD. According to Maria Basile, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is classified as a disruptive behavior disorder characterized by ongoing difficulty with attention span, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity. She points out that many children have challenged themselves to keep the disorder under control. She also shows that the children can be over-active or impulsive. Their development is not equal to an average child. Numerous of researches have been constructed in order to determine the percentage of children that posse ADHD. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children A diagnosis is based on the guidelines provided in the “American Psychiatric Associations Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) published in 1994 (Barkley 133)”. In general, children are diagnosed with ADHD if they show at least six symptoms from each category. Dr. Berkley lists the following symptoms for each category: Inattention: •     Often fails to pay close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork or other activities •     Often has trouble sustaining attention during tasks or play •     Often doesn't seem to listen when spoken ... ... middle of paper ... ...counseling the child and the family and facilitating them in the development of new skills, attitudes, and ways of relating to each other.

After examining the results of this study, it definitely appears that perception can potentially play an integral role in family relationships. Reflection and Conclusion The results of this study could be useful to share with parents of children affected by ADHD. Although the “Indigo parents” represent a unique sub-group, their positive perceptions did appear to have an impact on reported levels of stress and frustration within families. Perhaps families can utilize these results to rethink their own perceptions of children with ADHD in a positive, new light. ADHD is a life disability for many children affecting their families, friends, and health and is extremely difficult to diagnose and to treat without having a great number of side effects that can leave children with complications for the rest of their lives. ADHD has multiple causes. One cause that has been studied is heredity and genes. If a child has a close relative such as his/her father or mother that have had difficulties in school and academics, the same sort of actions will show in the child. There is good evidence to prove this genetic influence. ADHD is a genetic disorder and is highly heritable, this is also important to think of when diagnosing ADHD (Tannock, 2013).

Why Your Abusive Narcissistic Mate Claims to Be the Victim How to Build Happier Workplaces After the COVID Era What Is Your ""Style"" For Dealing With Conflict At Work? -deficit/hyperactivity disorder (previously known as attention deficit disorder or ADD) is a neurobehavioral disorder characterized by core symptoms of inattentiveness, distractibility, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. ADHD is thought to be the most common mental health disorder, with estimates of its prevalence in children ranging from 5 to 11 percent. ADHD in adulthood is thought to be less common, with approximately 2 to 5 percent of adults diagnosed. ADHD symptoms can interfere with work, school, household tasks, and relationships, and managing the disorder can be a challenge for both children and adults. Fortunately, there are treatments that have been shown to be effective, and anyone affected by ADHD can learn coping skills to work around struggles and harness their talents—as many successful individuals with ADHD have already done.

Some children and adults with ADHD find it difficult to concentrate on tasks at school or work and may daydream frequently. Children with ADHD may become disruptive, defiant, or have trouble getting along with parents, peers, or teachers. Children who struggle with hyperactivity and impulsivity, in particular, often have behavioral challenges that can be difficult for adults to manage. Adults, on the other hand, may be more likely to report feeling restless or fidgety; if they struggle with impulsivity, they may make rash decisions that adversely affect their life.

Many children and adults display either hyperactive or inattentive symptoms of ADHD, but it’s also possible for both sets of symptoms to exist together, in what is typically called combined type ADHD.

But whether the disorder is overdiagnosed and overtreated—or whether it reflects a set of evolved traits that have become less adaptive in today’s world—is widely debated. For more on the biology of ADHD, see Like many other mental health disorders, the causes of ADHD remain under investigation. are theorized to play a key role, as are environmental influences such as exposure to toxins in the womb and early experiences. Since ADHD is a behavioral disorder, expectations of appropriate behavior, particularly in children, likely influence diagnoses in some cases. For more on the causes of ADHD, see . Experts have debated whether treatment for ADHD should be primarily behavioral (, training, increased play, greater structure) or pharmacological. Several large studies have concluded that a combination of both may be most effective. For more on treatment options, see . Significant evidence suggests that ADHD has both genetic and environmental underpinnings. Twin studies, for instance, have found that identical twins are significantly more likely than fraternal twins to both be diagnosed with ADHD or display ADHD-like behaviors. There is no single gene that is considered “responsible” for ADHD; rather, like many conditions, it is thought to be linked to many genetic variants, only some of which have been uncovered. For more on genes and other factors that may lead to ADHD, see Is ADHD a disease of modernity? Some experts argue that what we call ADHD is actually a —that is, a disorder that arises because of a mismatch between humans’ evolutionary roots and our modern environment. High energy levels, for instance, may have been adaptive for a hunter-gatherer but are problematic in a modern classroom. Some prominent experts have noted that the recent rise in ADHD diagnoses has coincided with an increased focus (particularly in American schools) on rigorous standardized testing and reduced playtime—suggesting that at least some children diagnosed with ADHD have been placed in environments that worsen the evolutionary mismatch. For more on living with ADHD in the modern world, see It depends. Under both the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA), ADHD can be legally considered a disability in some cases. But a diagnosis alone isn’t enough to qualify for protection under the law. In addition to a formal diagnosis, the individual (and/or their parent, if in an academic setting) must also establish that . If such limitations can be adequately documented, reasonable accommodations must be provided by the employer or the school (if it is public). For more on accommodations, see or Is ADHD a learning disability? Though ADHD can and often does cause academic challenges, it is not considered a specific learning disability (such as dyslexia or dysgraphia). However, many children with ADHD—anywhere from 30 to 50 percent, according to some estimates—have a learning disability. The conditions can also display similar external symptoms, particularly in children. For more on distinguishing ADHD from learning disabilities and other disorders, see I feel fidgety all the time. Do I have ADHD? While fidgetiness is certainly an aspect of ADHD, the condition is more complex than physical restlessness. If, in addition to constant fidgetiness, you experience strong feelings of distractibility that persist in multiple settings, often behave impulsively, talk excessively, struggle to follow through on tasks or manage your time, and/or make careless mistakes on important projects, you may show symptoms of ADHD. Requesting an evaluation from a healthcare provider is the first step to receiving a diagnosis and initiating treatment. For more about symptoms and diagnosis, see . How can I best help my child manage his ADHD? All children benefit from love, structure, and consistency; children with ADHD need all three in droves. Since ADHD symptoms and their resulting academic and social challenges can be damaging to a child’s , parents should take steps to find a treatment that works, help the child identify his strengths, and advocate for his needs as he learns to navigate the world on his own. Parents should also help the child set up routines, identify academic strategies that address her specific needs, and learn the social skills necessary in order to form lasting friendships. For more about raising a happy and healthy ADHD child, see Is ADHD good or bad for romantic relationships? There is no single way that ADHD affects , and the condition often comes with both positives and negatives. Many couples, for instance, find that one partner’s ADHD (or both, in some cases) enhances the relationship by making it more spontaneous or sexually fulfilling. Others, however, find that symptoms of distraction, disorganization, or impulsivity can lead to frustrating miscommunications between partners or trigger arguments. Both partners—regardless of their own ADHD status—should be honest about any challenges that ADHD brings to the relationship, while also making an effort to appreciate its upsides whenever possible. Having compassion toward one’s partner is critical for making any ADHD relationship work. For more on causes, symptoms, and treatments of ADHD, see our Diagnosis Dictionary. How the Stigma of Mental Illness Has Evolved Over Time Anthropologist Roy Richard Grinker explores the roots of mental illness stigma in his new book.

Chaotic, frazzled, impulsive, unorganized, daydreamer, procrastinator, inattentive, goof off and lazy are just a few descriptions of an adult that has Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD/ADHD). At one time ADD/ADHD was thought of as just childhood complications that did not affect adults, but since there is no cure for ADD/ADHD, adults are affected also. Most adults that have ADD/ADHD were not diagnosed with it as children, because ADD/ADHD wasn’t recognized except by a very few people that were aware of it at the time (Smith and Segal, 2012). Instead as children they were labeled as lazy, trouble makers, day dreamers and other labels and they grew into adults with those same labels and tendencies. They may have learned to adjust during the teen years but as they became adults and responsibilities and demands on their time grew, the challenges of dealing with ADD/ADHD also grew. ADD/ADHD affects 4-5 percent of all adults, more than 11 million in the United States (Barkley). When not diagnosed and treated it can impact all areas of life including work, home and social relationships. With treatment adults, and children, with ADD/ADHD can learn to compensate and overcome the symptoms and challenges they face with ADD/ADHD on a daily basis to lead productive lives.

Much like Robert ADD/ADHD affects children in their everyday lives it can affect them socially and emotionally. ADD/ADHD has been around for many years and the symptoms haven’t changed if not treated the disorder can have a huge impact on a child's life and can make the teaching methods more difficult then they already are. History ADHD has been around for many years they began to recognize hyperactivity and inattentiveness in children in the early 1900s. Attention Deficit Disorder was listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical manual in 1980. Since 1994, this condition has been called “ADHD” (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) (Woodard 1). Children today are tomorrow’s adults so it is critical to make the right choices when dealing with the future. American children are being prescribed medication for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) more than ever before because this is a relatively new disease, which contributes to the lack of options available for treatment and creates a greater chance of not only being over diagnosed but also misdiagnosed. ADHD is a name that is becoming more relevant in households across America. The characteristics that define ADHD have been around as long as mankind. This disease is defined as: “a childhood mental disorder with onset before 7 years of age and involving impaired or diminished attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity” (Mosby’s Medical Dictionary 166). Because they are currently my patients, they are still struggling with the addiction--though it may be many years after taking their first sip. I feel it is important to target adolescents and educate and inform them of the implications that may occur if they bring substances into their lives. This topic should be discussed with adolescents in all areas of their lives: at home, in school, during extra curricular activities, and at youth groups. Reinforcement from multiple people/mentors may have a lasting effect on the child. (slide #4) The impact of alcohol on a growing child is profound. “Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a condition in which a person not only has a great difficulty concentrating for more than a few minutes but also is inattentive, impulsive, and overactive” (The Developing Person Through the Life Span, page 310). Both children and adults are diagnosed with ADHD, but children hold a higher percentage of this diagnosis because the disorder usually appears in early to middle childhood. “The average age of ADHD diagnosis was 7 years of age, but children reported by their parents as having more severe ADHD were diagnosed earlier” (Web, CDC). The symptoms of childhood ADHD, from a personal standpoint, seem to almost mirror what I have observed as normal (developmental) childhood behavior (angst). “The main symptom, (among the three main symptoms) of ADHD is the inability to pay attention. The Existence of ADD and ADHD Some of the most common words moving around in the psychiatric circle are attention Deficit; hyperactivity; Ritalin; ADD, ADHD. These words are being most commonly discussed by most educators, physicians, psychologists and young parents in the society today. In spite of extensive advancements in technology which has brought new insights into the brain and learning, there is still a lacuna in the field of problems faced by children who are unable to remain focused on the task given to them in the classroom owing to their inability to pay attention. While the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) of the American Psychiatric Association) put forth a list of behaviors which predominantly fall in the category of ADD and/or ADHD, many researchers still maintain that there is no set way to diagnosis or develop a treatment program to these disorders which will be guaranteed to work. At the same time there is another set of researchers who maintain that these disorders actually do not exist at all. Have you ever had difficulty staying focused, paying attention, controlling behavior, or even hyperactivity? If so, you just might have a disorder known as ADHD. ADHD, or even known as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is one of the most universal childhood disorders that can move ahead through adolescence and adulthood (National Institute of Mental Health). But, children around the world are being diagnosed every day. So, does the medication, that the doctors give them, really help these children? Children who have inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity could lead to a diagnosis of ADHD. Although it is normal for all children to exhibit these behaviors children with ADHD are more severe and occur more often. To receive a diagnosis of ADHD a child must have symptoms for 6 or more months and at a greater degree than other children the same age. The Number of adults taking taking ADHD medication increased by 53% from 2008 to 2012. Adults with ADHD symptoms may include difficulty following directions, remembering information, concentrating, organizing tasks or completing work on time. I am sure that everyone has heard of ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) and all of the theories that have plagued it throughout the years. Even today, there are children and even some adults that continue to struggle in life due to this disorder. Parents are to blame in most cases, not because they don’t want to help their child; it is more to do with not understanding the disorder or not having the awareness of how to help their child. I would like to give you a day at school through the eyes of a child. The first scenario reviews what a day in the classroom is like for an ADHD child not receiving any help and the second scenario is that same child that is now receiving some form of help. ADHD can be diagnosed in childhood and continue into adulthood, but adults have been known to be diagnosed later in their lives. Teachers are advocates for students who may qualify for special needs for ADHD. Teachers, administrators, and parents can complete an ADHD checklist and when completed it will be submitted to the district for review. ADHD is not curable, but is treatable according to (Fischer, Herberholz, 2016). There is multiple medication that can be used to help manage ADHD symptoms. Copyright © 2000-2020. 123Helpme.com.

ADHD is primarily accompanied by other disorders, including emotional, physical and mental impairment. Utilizing three peer-reviewed journal articles, in class powerpoints, as well as text from Laura E. Berk’s textbook, “Infants and Children; Prenatal Through Middle Childhood”, ADHD will be explained in a nondiscriminatory manner. Geraldine S. Pearson suggests that when a child has ADHD, 10% to 35% of first-degree relatives also have the disorder while Laura E. Berk states that many cases are over-diagnosed. However, she does not suggest that ADHD is not commonly found in families; in contrast, she also states that it is a very heritable ailment. Unfortunately, ADHD is a lifelong disorder and treatment is not available for every individual affected. Keywords: hereditary, disorder, environmental, behavior ADHD in Children Children who are diagnosed with ADHD are usually accompanied by another disorder; typically, children with ADHD have decreased attention spans, learning disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, and even Tourette disorder (Pearson). ADHD is a disorder that is highly obtainable due to hereditary, but genetic influence is not the only way a child may become afflicted with ADHD. Maternal smoking, or high amounts of stress while pregnant may also cause ADHD. Furthermore, there are other outside influences that can play a role in causing ADHD or contributing to the likelihood that a child will eventually be diagnosed as ADHD (Pearson; Berk).

In addition to a diagnosis of ADHD, children may also present with comorbidities such as learning deficits, mood disorders and antisocial characteristics (Ministry of Health, 2001). Goldstein (1995, as cited in Gol & Jarus, 2005) and Cantwell (1996, as cited in Gol & Jarus, 2005) explain referral to mental health services is prevalent for children with this chronic behavioural problem. For parents needing guidance in addressing concerns, a first point of contact may be a General Practitioner where symptoms can be discussed and referral to an appropriate service considered. As Laver-Bradbury (2013) states, clinicians within a children’s mental health service or paediatric setting are recommended, although McGonnell, Corkum, McKinnon, MacPherson, Williams, Davidson, Jones, and Stephenson (2007) suggest waiting lists for services can be detrimental. Child, Adolescent and Family Services (CAFS) is a mental health service specifically aimed at targeting the needs of children 0-19 years of age. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is often the center of ongoing debates in the medical field. Critics have described ADHD as a diagnosis used to label difficult children who are not ill, but whose behavior is at the extreme end of normal range ( (K. Lange, 2010). However, unbalanced chemicals in the brain cause ADHD. It is not something children can control and it is more than a behavioral problem. “ADHD is not a disease per se but rather a group of symptoms representing a final common behavioral pathway for a gamut of emotional, psychological, and/or learning problems” (Furman, 2005).

Analysis of over-diagnosing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder This paper will define the disorder, discuss the notion of over-diagnosing, and the potential risks of overprescribing medication for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. What is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Adolescence is often a time of bodily, societal, and mental evolution. Some will go through certain sequences or experiences that can be linked to specific choices concerning “family and peer relationships, sexual expression, vocational/educational development, and experimenting with drugs and alcohol” (Maag and Irvin, 2005). Having a consistent view of your life will help adolescents to effectively steer their life transitions in a positive direction. Steering these transitions can be difficult for some adolescents due to their specific personality structures. The reviews all seem to share the same topic that ADHD must remain relevant. The medication may not be for every child, but the question of the safety of the children is. What is ADHD? Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder also known as “ADHD”, is a mental disorder which seems to be a very common childhood brain disorder and the disorder continues through adolescence and adulthood. Children with ADHD have a hard time focusing so paying attention becomes unbearable. However, it could potentially arise as the result of a stroke, traumatic brain injury, genetic disorder, or syndrome. ASHA states that it is important for one to “note that while CAS may be referred to as ‘developmental apraxia,’ it is not a disorder that children simply ‘outgrow’” (“Causes and Numbers,” 2011). With most disorders related to speech development, the child learns everything in the same order as others, just slightly slower than their peers. If a child is experiencing CAS, on the other hand, they do not learn sounds in the usual patterns and cannot improve without therapy or treatment. Though there is no cure for CAS, much progress can be made with “appropriate, intensive intervention” (“Causes and Numbers,” 2011). Body of Paper If a child has autism their parents will usually know within the first 18-36 months. This is the time when a lot of growing of the child takes place and their disorder begins to come apparent (“Autism,” 2007). Some key signs of autism are the child tries to reject all types of social contact, act strangely, or lose their speech skills that they have previously learned (Kaale et. al, 2014). “A recent study of a U.S. metropolitan area estimated that 3.4 of every 1,000 children ages 3 to 10 had autism” (“Psychology Today,” 2009).

We Have Neanderthals to Thank for These Genetic Traits Why the Internet Broke for Bernie Sanders's Mittens 10 Tips for Turning Procrastination into Precrastination How to Find Empathy for People You Don’t Understand An Atheist Neuroscientist Finds Faith in Bipolar Mania  >   >  -Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder is a neurobehavioral disorder characterized by a combination of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsive behavior. Symptoms include difficulty sitting still, problems maintaining attention on school or homework, and responding before thinking. Hyperactivity symptoms can include being fidgety, restless, and talking or interrupting others excessively. appears early in life. It is estimated that 5 percent of school-age children and 2.5 percent of the adult population are diagnosed with ADHD, according to the . Boys are diagnosed twice as often as girls. Teens with ADHD have difficulty sitting still and paying attention in class and may not do well in school, even when they have normal or above average . More than half of children diagnosed with ADHD continue to have symptoms during and adulthood. Symptoms of ADHD can be treated effectively with a combination of and . When left untreated, however, ADHD can have long-term adverse effects on academic performance, vocational success, relationships, and social-emotional development. According to the , ADHD is diagnosed when a teen experiences six or more of the following symptoms. If they are 17 or older, they need to experience just just five symptoms. The symptoms must persist for six months and be severe enough to negatively impact academic or social functioning. They must also be inconsistent with the teen's developmental level, and not be attributable to other mental disorders such as an disorder, , or . The teen should have exhibited several of these symptoms prior to age 12. Difficulty remaining focused on tasks or conversations Difficulty following through on instructions or assignments Avoidance or refusal of activities that require sustained (reports, forms, papers) Being forgetful of daily activities (appointments, chores) Children with the inattentive type of ADHD, characterized by the symptoms above, are less disruptive and are often not diagnosed. Symptoms of and include: Often leaving seat when remaining seated is expected Difficulty being still for an extended period of time The combined inattentive/hyperactivity type of ADHD displays equal, predominant symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity. This is the most common type of ADHD among children and adolescents. The predominantly inattentive type displays symptoms of inattention but fewer than six hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms. The predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type displays criteria for hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms but fewer than six inattentive symptoms. Every teen suspected of having ADHD deserves a careful evaluation both to distinguish between ADHD and ADHD-like symptoms commonly seen in other and medical conditions and to determine if some situational or environmental stressors may be creating symptoms similar to those of ADHD. Psychiatrists, psychologists, pediatricians, neurologists, and clinical social workers most often are trained in providing an evaluation and diagnosis of mental disorders and ruling out other reasons for the teen's behavior. Possible causes of ADHD-like behavior include a sudden change in the teen's life, the death of a parent or grandparent, parents' , a parent's job loss, undetected seizures (such as petit mal or temporal lobe seizures), a middle-ear infection that causes intermittent hearing problems, medical disorders that may affect brain functioning, underachievement caused by learning disability, anxiety, and depression. A thorough evaluation should include a clinical assessment of the individual's performance in academic and social settings, emotional functioning, and developmental abilities. Additional tests may include tests, measures of attention span, and parent and teacher rating scales. A medical exam by a physician is also important. A doctor may look for allergies or problems like chronic caffeine highs that might make the teen seem overly active. The assessment may also include interviews with the teen's teachers, parents, and other people who know the teen well. Behavior during free play or while getting individual attention is given less importance in the evaluation. In such situations, most teens with ADHD are able to control their behavior and perform well. Do Stimulants Really Help Students? If ADHD Isn't ""Real,"" Why Do So Many Kids Struggle? ADHD: A Concise Review Co-Occurring Mental Health Diagnoses Health professionals are still unsure what causes ADHD. It may be a genetically determined disorder, as attention disorders often run in families. Studies indicate that 25 percent of close relatives in the families of children with ADHD also have the condition, whereas the rate is about 2.5 percent in the adult population. Many studies of now show that a strong genetic influence exists in the disorder. Recent studies show that ADHD is caused by neurobiological dysfunction. Scientists using neuroimaging and brain scanning tools have demonstrated a link between a person's ability to maintain attention and the level of activity in the brain. For example, scientists have found differences between the frontal lobes of individuals who have ADHD and those who do not. Current research is exploring the structure of the brain to determine if there are differences that might indicate a physical basis for ADHD. There is correlating evidence between the use of cigarettes and during and the risk for developing ADHD in the unborn child. These substances may endanger the fetus' developing brain. It is best to refrain from , alcohol, and other drugs during pregnancy, as they may distort developing nerve cells. Toxins in may also disrupt brain development or brain processes, which may lead to ADHD. Lead is one possible toxin. It is found in dust, soil, and flaking paint in areas where leaded gasoline or paint were once used. It is also present in some older water pipes. There is little evidence that ADHD stems from the home environment. Researchers report that not all teens from unstable or dysfunctional homes have ADHD, and not all teens with ADHD come from dysfunctional families. Scientists have also found no real evidence that , undetectable damage to the brain, early infection, or complications at birth cause ADHD. Researchers have found that refined sugar and food additives do not generally make children hyperactive and inattentive. In 1982, the National Institutes of Health concluded that diet restrictions seemed to help about 5 percent of children with ADHD, but these were mostly young children with food allergies. Every family wants to determine which treatment will be most effective for their teen. This question needs to be answered by each family in consultation with a health-care professional. To help families make this important decision, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has funded many studies of treatments for ADHD and conducted one of the most intensive studies evaluating the treatment of this disorder, the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with . The results of the study indicated that long-term combination treatments ( and behavioral therapy) and medication alone were superior to intensive behavioral treatment and routine community treatment. In some areas—anxiety, academic performance, oppositionality, parent-child relations, and social skills—the combined treatment was usually superior. Another advantage of combined treatment was that children and teens could be successfully treated with lower doses of medication. No single treatment is the answer for every teen with ADHD. A teen may sometimes have side effects from a medication that would make that particular treatment unacceptable. And if a teen with ADHD also has anxiety or depression, a treatment combining medication and behavioral therapy might be best. Each teen's needs and personal history must be carefully considered. For decades, medications have been used to treat the symptoms of ADHD. The medications that seem to be the most effective are a class of drugs known as stimulants. For many people, stimulants dramatically reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity and improve the ability to focus, work, and learn. The medications may also improve physical coordination, such as that needed in handwriting and in sports. Those commonly prescribed include Amphetamine/ Dextroamphetamine (Adderall), Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin), Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), (Concerta, Ritalin). It is important to work with the prescribing physician to find the right medication and the right dosage. Stimulant drugs, when used with medical supervision, are considered quite safe. Stimulants do not make the teen feel high, although some children and teens say they feel different or funny. Such changes are usually minor. Although some parents worry that their teen may become addicted to the medication, there is no convincing evidence that stimulant medications, when used to treat ADHD, cause drug abuse or dependence. A review of all long-term studies on stimulant medication and , conducted by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, found that with ADHD who remained on their medication as teens had a lower likelihood of substance use or abuse than did adolescents with ADHD who were not taking medications. The stimulant drugs come in long- and short-term forms. The newer sustained-release stimulants can be taken before school and are long-lasting. The doctor can discuss the teen's needs with the parents and decide which preparation to use and whether the teen needs to take the medicine during school hours only or in the evening and on weekends too. If the teen does not show symptom improvement after taking a medication for a week, the doctor may try adjusting the dosage. If there is still no improvement, the teen may be switched to another medication. About one out of 10 children is not helped by a stimulant medication. Other types of medication may be used if stimulants don't work or if the ADHD occurs with another disorder. and other medications can help control accompanying depression or anxiety. Most side effects of the stimulant medications are minor and are usually related to the dosage of the medication being taken. Higher doses produce more side effects. The most common side effects are decreased , , increased anxiety, and/or irritability. Some report mild stomachaches or headaches. Appetite seems to fluctuate, usually being low during the middle of the day and more normal by suppertime. Adequate amounts of nutritional food should be available for the teen, especially at peak appetite times. If the teen has difficulty falling asleep, there are several options to consider, such as a lower dosage of the stimulant, taking the stimulant earlier in the day, discontinuing the afternoon or evening dosage, or giving an adjunct medication, such as a low-dosage antidepressant or clonidine. A few develop tics during treatment. Changing the medication dosage can often lessen these. A very few cannot tolerate any stimulant, no matter how low the dosage. In such cases, the teen is often given an antidepressant instead of the stimulant. When a teen's schoolwork and behavior improve soon after starting medication, the teen, parents, and teachers tend to credit the drug for the sudden changes. Unfortunately, when people see such immediate improvement, they often think medication is all that's needed. But medications don't cure ADHD; they only control the symptoms on the day they are taken. Although the medications help the child pay better attention and complete schoolwork, they can't increase knowledge or improve academic skills. The medications help the teen use those skills he or she already possesses. Behavioral therapy, emotional counseling, and practical support will help ADHD teens cope with everyday problems and feel better about themselves. Medications for ADHD help many children and teens focus and be more successful at school, home, and play. Avoiding negative experiences now may actually help prevent addictions and other emotional problems later. About 80 percent of children who need medication for ADHD still need it as teenagers. Medication can help with ADHD in everyday life. Teens may be able to better control some of the behavior that has led to trouble with parents and siblings. But it takes time to undo the frustration, blame, and anger that may have gone on for so long. Both parents and children may need special help to develop techniques for managing the patterns of behavior, including the development of new skills, attitudes, and ways of relating to each other. In individual counseling, a therapist helps children and teens with ADHD learn to feel better about themselves, help them to identify and build on their strengths, cope with daily problems, and control their attention and . Sometimes only the teen with ADHD needs counseling support, but because the problem affects the family, in many cases, everyone may need help. The therapist assists the family in finding better ways to handle the disruptive behaviors, promote change, and teach parents techniques for coping with and improving their teen's behavior. helps people with ADHD to like and accept themselves. In psychotherapy, patients talk with the therapist about upsetting thoughts and feelings, explore self-defeating patterns of behavior, and learn alternative ways to handle their emotions. As they talk, the therapist tries to help them understand how they can change. therapy helps people work on immediate issues. Rather than helping people understand their feelings and actions, it supports them directly in changing their behavior. The support might be practical assistance, like helping a teen learn how to think through tasks and organize his or her schoolwork. Or the support might be to encourage new behaviors by giving praise or rewards each time the person acts in the desired way. Social-skills training can also help a teen learn new behaviors. In this training, the therapist discusses and models appropriate behaviors like waiting for a turn, asking for help, or responding to teasing, then gives the teen a chance to practice. For example, a teen might learn to read other people's facial expression and tone of voice to respond more appropriately. Social skills training can help teach how behavior affects others and develop new ways to respond when angry or upset. Support groups help parents connect with others who have similar problems and concerns with their ADHD children. Members share frustrations, successes, referrals to qualified specialists, and information about what has been effective, as well as their hopes for themselves and their children. There is strength in numbers, and sharing experiences with others who have similar concerns helps people know that they aren't alone. Ensuring the teen gets a healthy, varied diet, with plenty of fiber and basic nutrients Helping the teen divide a large task into small steps if the teen has trouble completing tasks, and then praising the teen as each step is completed It is beneficial for parents to use management methods, such as , relaxation techniques, and exercise to increase their own tolerance for frustration so that they can respond more calmly to their teen's behavior. has provided guidelines for treating children and teens with ADHD. Medication and/or behavior therapy should be started When treatment plan has not met target goal, re-evaluate the original diagnosis, the possibility of other conditions, and how well the treatment plan has been implemented Systematically follow up; regularly reassess target goals, results, and any side effects of medications. Information should be gathered from parents, teachers, and the child/teen. You are your teen's best advocate. To advocate for your teen, learn as much as you can about ADHD and how it affects your teen at home, in school, and in social situations. Teens with ADHD have a variety of needs. To assess these needs, the special-education teacher, along with the parents, the school psychologist, school administrators, and the classroom teacher, must assess the teen's strengths and weaknesses and design an Individualized Educational Program (IEP). The IEP outlines the specific skills the teen needs to develop as well as appropriate learning activities that build on the teen's strengths. Parents play an important role in the process. They must be included in meetings and given an opportunity to review and approve their teen's IEP. Some children may be placed in a special education class for all or part of the day. However, most children are able to stay in the regular classroom and learn along with their peers. Special accommodations may be used to assist the teen with ADHD to function in a regular classroom. In general, children with ADHD are fully capable of learning, but their hyperactivity and inattention make learning difficult. As a result, some students with ADHD repeat a grade or drop out of school. Fortunately, with the right combination of appropriate educational practices, medication, and counseling, these outcomes can be avoided. Individuals with ADHD or other disabilities are entitled to a free and appropriate public education (FAPE), including special education services that are guaranteed by two federal laws: The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504). IDEA requires that a student must first qualify for special education, according to the following criteria: The student must be diagnosed with ADHD by either the school district or a qualified professional The severity of ADHD must increase the student's sensitivity to his or her surroundings and impair alertness to academic tasks The effects of ADHD must have a significant impact and/or be a long-standing condition ADHD must impair educational achievement in a manner that requires special educational services The National Rehabilitation Act, Section 504, defines disabilities more broadly. Often called ""504 Eligibility,"" it qualifies children that have a diagnosed physical or mental impairment that substantially limits learning and requires special education or related services. Children who need assistance in certain areas may qualify even if they do not need special education. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Title II, requires that state and local governments give people with disabilities an equal opportunity to benefit from all of their programs, services, and activities (e.g., public education, employment, transportation, recreation, health care, social services, courts, voting, and town meetings). Title III has the same requirements for private, independent, and nonreligious schools. This act prohibits against otherwise qualified students who are limited by a disability such as ADHD, and it requires that educational institutions that receive federal funds to provide academic and other adjustments so that students can avail themselves of courses, examinations, and other activities. Private schools are required to facilitate participation in educational and other activities. However, they are not required to provide remedial services to improve skills in an area of disability.

(Dotdash) — All rights reserved How OCD and ADHD Similarities Can Cause Misdiagnosis LuAnn Pierce, LCSW, is a licensed clinical social worker who has worked in the field of mental health and human services for over 25 years. Akeem Marsh, MD, is a board-certified child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist who has dedicated his career to working with medically underserved communities. OCD is believed to affect 1 in 100 adults and 1 in 200 children, according to the International OCD Foundation (IOCDF).﻿ The Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) reports the median age of onset is 19, with one-fourth of cases present by age 14. One-third of adults with OCD had the disorder as a child.  is estimated to affect between 5-9% of the population, whereas OCD affects about 1-2%.﻿ It is pretty common knowledge that coexists with several other disorders, including other anxiety disorders and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Many also recognize there are crossover symptoms of OCD-like behavior and several other disorders. Autism Spectrum Disorders and ADHD are among those.﻿ Some research also suggests that there is an overlap of ADHD and OCD among people who engage in hoarding behaviors.﻿ OCD and ADHD are strange bedfellows. Both are caused by problems in the frontal lobe, but ADHD is caused by under-activity (not enough dopamine and norepinephrine) in the brain, and OCD is due to overactivity (too much serotonin). Although the different types of ADHD present very differently, all types are believed to be caused by low levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. The person with the hyperactive type of ADHD that is fidgety, restless, impulsive, and careless would appear to be the opposite of a person with OCD, generally more cautious, focused, and attentive. People with the inattentive type of ADHD are often distracted, disorganized, day-dreamy, and forgetful. Again, not your stereotypical OCD traits. Those who have the (about 70%) have symptoms of both.﻿ These two disorders often get confused when a (or adult in a work setting) with OCD has trouble in school. After all, ADHD, which causes problems with executive functioning (organization, planning, reasoning, prioritizing, executing projects, following through with work, etc.), wreaks havoc in the classroom.﻿ A child with OCD who spends a lot of time ordering, arranging, or checking their books, supplies, and handwriting may appear to be having problems with executive functions when in fact, they are simply trying to get or keep things on the desk in the proper place. Understanding what motivates the child’s (or adult’s) behavior is key to a proper diagnosis. ADHD can result in OCD-like coping skills. A child or adult who has trouble getting organized or who are easily distracted may spend an inordinate amount of time arranging, ordering, and cleaning things. Sometimes that is , a typical ADHD trait, but it may be an ADHD coping-skill. Many people with ADHD become over-stimulated by the clutter and disorganization in their environment. This often results in anxiety, or simply shutting down. As a result, they may learn strategies to prevent clutter and disorganization that look like OCD behaviors, ie. arranging, ordering, checking. With regard to proper diagnosis, it is important to remember that ADHD is present across all domains; OCD is generally very specific with regard to obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. It is also worth noting that not all people with OCD have the type related to fear of germs and cleaning. In fact, most do not have spotless homes or lockers. Although ADHD was once believed to affect only children, the research has finally caught up with reality; in 2013 the DSM-5 moved ADHD from the category of ""Disorders Usually Diagnosed in Infancy Childhood, or Adolescence"" to that of ""Neurodevelopmental Disorder,"" recognizing that many continue to have symptoms into adulthood.﻿ It was once believed to largely disappear after puberty. About 30% of people with ADHD have co-occurring anxiety disorders, including OCD.﻿ Those who have problems with low dopamine and/or norepinephrine and high levels of serotonin may indeed have both OCD and ADHD. In these cases, it is extremely important to treat both disorders. However, doing so requires skill and patience. Research also suggests that co-occurring OCD and ADHD is associated with an earlier onset of OCD symptoms.﻿ While the treatment for OCD with SSRI is not usually contraindicated in ADHD (some estimate up to 50% of people with ADHD also have depression),﻿ stimulant medications used to treat ADHD can exacerbate with very serious outcomes. Prescribers often treat the symptoms that are causing the most problems first. For those with both disorders, there are non-stimulant medications for ADHD that may have less impact on OCD symptoms.﻿ Treatment for both OCD and ADHD should include medication management, therapy, and self-help.

48ada92e-172a-48ad-95ba-ebcd0224c9ae,"Yoga, Mindfulness, and Meditation Interventions for Youth with ADHD: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis , –() Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic developmental disorder affecting 3–7% of children. In light of the growing utilization of yoga, mindfulness, and meditation in ADHD populations and potential benefits it has on ADHD symptoms, executive function deficits, and social functioning, we sought to evaluate these interventions for youth with ADHD. The primary aim of this review paper is to identify the efficacy of these programs for the treatment of youth with ADHD through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic literature search was conducted in the following electronic databases: PsychINFO, ERIC, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Studies were included in the meta-analytic review if participants were between 5–17 years old, had a diagnosis of ADHD or met symptom threshold on psychometrically-validated measure of ADHD symptoms, was a treatment outcome study, and was published in a peer-reviewed English-language journal. The effect sizes of eleven studies demonstrate that yoga, mindfulness-based interventions, and/or meditation had a statistically significant effect on the outcomes of ADHD symptoms, hyperactivity, and inattention (parent and teacher report), as well as parent-child relationship, executive functioning, on-task behavior, parent stress, and parent trait-mindfulness (p < 0.05). The effect sizes range from small to large effects across these outcomes. Considerable risk for bias was found across studies. Given significant methodological limitations of the literature, positive effect sizes found in studies should be interpreted with caution; these interventions should not be considered first-line interventions for ADHD. However, preliminary findings suggest yoga, mindfulness, and meditation may be beneficial for youth with ADHD, but extensive research is required to validate the efficacy of these interventions.

Retrieved Jan 23 2021 from https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Brief+educational+%22curbside+consultation%22%3a+impact+on...-a0465558425 Introduction: As behavioral health providers integrate into primary health care clinics, it is important to examine methods used to increase primary care providers' (PCPs) knowledge of behavioral health providers' areas of expertise and service provision. Attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been identified as one of the most common behavioral health disorders PCPs diagnose and treat in children. Method: This study examined whether 2 brief educational ""curbside consults,"" during which a psychologist provided information regarding the assessment and treatment of ADHD, had an impact on PCPs' referral practices. Information was collected via medical records review for the same 6-month period prior to and following provider education. Results: The results indicated that there was an increase in ADHD referrals to the behavioral health clinic (BHC) following educational consultation. In addition, there was some evidence to suggest that following PCP education, fewer children were diagnosed by the PCP with ADHD and fewer children were previously prescribed a psychotropic medication upon referral to the BHC. Treatment (e.g., behavioral therapy, pharmacotherapy, combined approach) also differed between families previously diagnosed and prescribed psychotropic medication. Discussion: The current study provides some preliminary evidence that brief educational consultation with PCPs may increase both referrals for ADHD concerns and may influence the way PCPs diagnose and address behavioral health concerns. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are discussed. Keywords: interdisciplinary consultation, ADHD, integrated primary care, ADHD evaluation, physician referral practices ********** Primary care providers (PCPs) are often the first providers parents contact when they have concerns regarding their children, encompassing both medical and behavioral health concerns. PCPs estimate that 15% to 18% of children who present to pediatric primary care have a behavioral health disorder (Williams, Klinepeter, Palmes, Pulley, & Foy, 2004), and behavioral health concerns are raised during approximately 25% of child primary care visits (Cooper, Valleley, Polaha, Begeny, & Evans, 2006). Furthermore, it is estimated that approximately 75% of all child behavioral health concerns are treated in pediatric primary care (Williams et al., 2004). Therefore, it is not surprising that pediatricians report behavior concerns as the most common and challenging problem seen during visits (Amdorfer, Allen, & Aljazireh, 1999). Attention-deficit/hyperactivty disorder (ADHD) has been reported as one of the most prevalent behavioral concerns in primary care (Williams et al., 2004), with approximately 4% to 12% of children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD in this setting (Brown et al., 2001). In fact, it is common for PCPs to have one to two new ADHD evaluations per month (Chan, Hopkins, Perrin, Herrerias, & Homer, 2005). Due to the impact of ADHD in the primary care setting, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP, 2011) provides clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation of ADHD in children and adolescents. Specifically, it is recommended that a comprehensive multimodal, multiinformant evaluation be conducted to determine symptomology and impairment across settings (i.e., home, school). Multiple barriers to adhering to AAP guidelines, however, exist in the primary care setting (Kelleher, Campo, & Gardner, 2006; Rushton, Bruckman, & Kelleher, 2002). PCPs have often not been trained in conducting behavioral health assessments nor are they allotted enough time to conduct a comprehensive evaluation during the primary care visit (i.e., typically 10 to 20 min). A comprehensive evaluation, which typically includes interviews with teachers and caregivers, behavior rating scales, and, at times, a school observation, can involve two to three hours of time. In contrast, PCPs report spending 15 to 45 min with patients over the span of several office visits to confirm the diagnosis of ADHD (Chan et al., 2005). PCPs are more comfortable and equipped to manage medication for ADHD than they are with the evaluation process (Searight & McLaren, 1998) and subsequent behavior therapy. In primary care settings, ADHD is often treated exclusively through the use of stimulant medication without the addition of behavioral interventions (Wolraich et al., 1990) and only half of PCPs recommended behavior therapy in addition to medication management when treating ADHD (Rushton, Fant, & Clark, 2004). Thus, many children with ADHD may not be receiving the benefits of a combined medication and behavior therapy approach. Research has demonstrated that the use of a combined medication management and behavioral therapy approach has positive effects on outcomes for children diagnosed with ADHD (Jensen et al., 2001; Molina et al., 2009; MTA Cooperative Group, 1999; Pelham & Gnagy, 1999). Specifically, the MTA study found that combined medication and behavior therapy resulted in a small significant reduction of ADHD symptoms on parent and teacher ratings of ADHD, greater improvements on academic and conduct measures when comorbidities existed, and higher ratings of parent and teacher satisfaction with the treatment plan. The use of a combined approach has also been shown to allow for the use of lower dosages of stimulant medications (Pelham & Gnagy, 1999). Finally, it has also been suggested that the use of a combined approach may assist parents who may also have ADHD in implementing treatment consistently (AAP, 2011). Given the chronic nature of ADHD, the PCP should adopt a medical home model of care to promote comprehensive and coordinated treatment. It has been suggested that an effective approach for PCPs working with patients with behavioral health concerns, including ADHD, is to develop close working relationships with behavioral health providers (Rosman, Perry, & Hepburn, 2005; Wildman & Langkamp, 2012; Williams, Shore, & Foy, 2006). Recently, there has been a move to integrate behavioral health services into primary care medical homes to better optimize patient care and increase the availability of behavioral health services to families. Having behavioral health integrated into primary care clinics increases the likelihood that PCPs will consult with or refer to behavioral health providers (Guevara, Greenbaum, Shera, Bauer, & Schwarz, 2009) and referred patients are more likely to follow through with recommended services (Valleley et al., 2007). This suggests that integrating behavioral health into primary care clinics may improve patient care in both the evaluation and treatment of mental health concerns such as ADHD. Study Purpose Although there has been much discussion in the field on the importance of increasing collaboration and consultation between medical and behavioral health providers, few studies have examined effective methods for increasing referrals for evidence-based evaluation and behavioral health treatment. This study examined whether two brief education sessions specific to the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD led to an increase in ADHD referrals from in-house pediatricians to the psychologist colocated at the clinic. It was hypothesized that the number of ADHD referrals to the behavioral health clinic (BHC) would increase following brief education. In addition, it was hypothesized that due to providing increased education on AAP recommendations for evaluation and treatment of ADHD, pediatricians would engage in greater diagnosis deferral to comply with evidence-based multimodal, multiinformant recommendations for assessment. Thus, of the children referred to the BHC for ADHD, researchers expected that fewer children would already have a diagnosis of ADHD and fewer would be taking medication for ADHD compared with children referred prior to the brief educational ""curbside consultations."" Method Participants and Setting The BHC where this study took place was colocated within an independently owned suburban pediatric primary care clinic in the Midwest. Behavioral health providers had been co-located in the practice for approximately five years providing treatment services two days per week. Behavioral health providers included a licensed psychologist, a postdoctoral fellow, and a predoctoral intern. The pediatric clinic employed seven pediatricians (5 full-time) with an average of 11 years of experience (range 3 to 17 years). Three of the physicians were female and four were males. BHC referrals were accepted from the PCPs (on-site referrals) as well as outside providers (outside referrals). Demographic data from outside referrals were not collected for the purposes of this study. Outside providers did not receive any education or have contact with the behavioral health providers. During the two 6-month periods in which data were collected, 147 children were scheduled for an appointment at the BHC, with 107 referred by the pediatricians at the primary care clinic. Of those referred from within the primary care clinic (on-site referrals), 89 children (83.2%) showed for their initial intake appointment. The sample consisted of 64 males (72%) and 34 (38.2%) were referred specifically for concerns related to ADHD. Mean age for participants was 8.34 years (SD = 4.28). Information on patient race and ethnicity was not collected at the time of this study. Of those referred for concerns related to ADHD, 29 (82.9%) were diagnosed with ADHD following evaluation at the BHC. Equal numbers of referrals by the PCPs occurred across the two time periods (i.e., 54 children prior to the consultation and 53 following the consultation). Of those referred by outside providers (n = 36), 35 (97.2%) showed for their initial appointment. The sample consisted of 20 males (57.1%). Thirteen children (37.1%) were referred specifically for concerns related to ADHD, and eight (22.9%) were diagnosed with ADHD following evaluation at the BHC. Procedures Prior to provision of brief education, the behavioral health provider had informed on-site PCPs that comprehensive evaluations and treatment services for ADHD were available. Additionally, behavioral health providers routinely shared assessment results on ADHD evaluations and progress notes for behavioral health visits and were available for ""curbside consultations"" regarding behavioral health concerns of patients within the practice. In an effort to increase the knowledge and evidence-based practice of on-site PCPs in the evaluation and treatment of ADHD, two minieducation sessions were conducted by the on-site behavioral health provider in the early fall of 2012. Brief education initiated by the behavioral health provider was conducted with each individual PCP in a ""curbside consultation"" format in order to meet the needs of clinic flow, circumvent barriers related to PCP availability and time, and maintain established personal consultative interactions with the on-site behavioral health provider. The first educational consultation involved a brief discussion of the AAP's, (2011) Guidelines for the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of ADHD, including provision of a printed copy of the guidelines. The behavioral health provider highlighted AAP recommendations for a comprehensive, multi-informant, multimodal approach to evaluation and informed PCPs of the behavioral health provider's current approach to ADHD assessment (e.g., comprehensive diagnostic interview, normative assessment through parent and teacher behavior rating scales [e.g., both broadband and narrowband; to compare symptoms to same-age, same-gender peers; to determine alternative explanations or comorbidities], and availability to conduct school observations and teacher interviews). Additionally, the behavioral health provider discussed evidence-based treatment for ADHD, including the benefits of a combined medication and behavioral therapy approach. Finally, the behavioral health provider outlined a behavioral therapy approach for children with ADHD. Specifically, it was discussed that the behavioral health provider trains parents and school professionals in specific techniques (e.g., use of rewards, discipline, differential attention) to shape child behavior and improve child self-regulation. During the second educational consultation, the behavioral health provider discussed relevant information learned during an all-day workshop given by an ADHD expert (workshop attended by behavioral health provider only). A two-page handout was utilized to guide this discussion and provided to each pediatrician. Specifically, the handout discussed the etiology of ADHD, common comorbid conditions, ADHD as a developmental disability of executive function, experimental, weak, and unproven treatments, and an overview of empirically supported treatments. A review of records was completed for intakes at the BHC conducted for the 6-month period following the educational consultations (October 2012-March 2013) and the same 6-month time period prior to the consultations (October 2011-March, 2012) of the previous year. In addition to demographic information, the following information was collected to determine differences in the PCPs' referral rates and treatment recommendations following the brief educational ""curbside consultations:"" number of PCP referrals, patient diagnosis status (ADHD vs. no diagnosis) prior to referral, medication status (e.g., prescribed medication to treat ADHD) upon referral, and treatment services (e.g., medication, behavioral therapy, combined approach) following referral. Data Analysis This study was a quasi-experimental design, as participants were assigned based upon referral to the BHC clinic before versus after the brief educational curbside consultation. A series of chi-square tests for independence were conducted. When the chi-square assumption of minimum expected cell frequency was violated and more than 20% of cells had expected frequencies less than or equal to 5, Fisher's exact test was utilized. When each variable had only two categories, the continuity correction was utilized. For all other cases, the Pearson chi-square was utilized. A t tests for independent means was also conducted. Significance level was set at p < .05. Seasonal variation was controlled by examination of the same months of the year pre- and post-intervention. Results On-Site Referrals Results for analyses are available in Table 1. A chi-square test for independence indicated a significant difference in ADHD referrals following consultation, [chi square](1, 101) = 4.08, p = .04, [phi] = -.22. There were significantly more ADHD referrals post-consultation. A marginally significant difference was found related to patient diagnostic status (i.e., ADHD vs. no diagnosis) upon referral, [chi square](1, 35) = 2.66, p = .059, [phi] = .343. Children referred following the educational consultation were less likely to have been diagnosed with ADHD prior to the initial session. Finally, a marginally significant difference was found for patient medication status upon referral, [chi square] (1, 34) = 2.73, p = .079, [phi] = .357. Children who were referred following the consultation were less likely to be prescribed medication prior to the initial behavioral health session. Outside Referrals Thirteen children were referred for ADHD from outside referral sources. A chi-square test for independence indicated no significant difference in ADHD referrals post-consultation for outside referrals, [chi square] (l, 36) = 0, [phi] = 1.0, 4> = - .007. Additionally, no significant differences were found for patient diagnostic or medication status following consultation. Total ADHD Referral Sample For patients and families specifically referred for ADHD concerns, a series of chi-square tests were conducted to examine differences in care prior to on-site provider education and interventions chosen by the family following provider education. A chi-square test indicated significant differences in treatment services based on pre-referral diagnostic status, [chi square] (3, 46) = 12. 97, p < .01, [phi] = .531. Refer to Tables 2 and 3 for information on treatment patterns prior to and following educational curbside consultations. A chi-square test for independence also indicated significant differences in treatment services based on patient medication status at the time of referral, [chi square] (3, 46) = 16.11, p < .01, [phi] = .592. For patients previously prescribed psychotropic medication to treat symptoms of ADHD (n = 13), zero received behavior therapy only, five received a combined approach, and two did not return for follow-up treatment prior to the brief educational consultation. Zero received behavioral therapy and six received a combination approach following educational curbside consultation. For patients not previously prescribed psychotropic medication (n = 34), two received behavior therapy only, three received a combined approach, three participated in behavioral therapy for a diagnosis other than ADHD, and one did not return to clinic prior to the brief consultation. Following the educational curbside consultation, 13 received behavior therapy only, five received a combined approach, four did not return for treatment, two received behavior therapy for a behavioral health concern unrelated to ADHD, and data were missing for one participant. In addition, a i-test for independent means was conducted to examine utilization of behavioral health services post-referral. Results indicated patients prescribed psychotropic medication upon referral attended significantly fewer behavioral health sessions (M = 2.43, SD = 1.13) than patients prescribed medication following behavioral health evaluation (M = 4.80, SD = 3.43), t(18.91) = 2.41, p < .05. Discussion Following two brief psychoeducational sessions regarding best practices for the evaluation and treatment of ADHD with on-site PCPs, results indicated an increase in on-site referrals to behavioral health providers for evaluation and/or treatment. In comparison, an increase in ADHD referrals for off-site PCPs was not observed. Results suggest that brief education provided to PCPs in a ""curbside consultation"" format may increase PCP adherence to AAP and best practice guidelines for ADHD. Although the exact mechanism for change in referral rates was not examined, components such as increasing PCP knowledge of AAP recommendations, empirically supported ADHD evaluation and treatment practices, and behavioral health services available on-site may have influenced PCPs in their decision to refer more patients for ADHD evaluation and/or treatment to behavioral health. There was some evidence to suggest that, following the educational curbside consultations, fewer children referred to the behavioral health provider had previously received a diagnosis of ADHD and/or pharmacological treatment for ADHD. This suggests that the consultations may have changed PCP attitude and behavior regarding the management of ADHD. It appears that the PCPs may have been utilizing the behavioral health provider to assist in the diagnosis of ADHD, thus delaying pharmacological intervention until a more comprehensive evaluation confirmed the diagnosis. Children treated pharmacologically following referral to the BHC attended significantly more behavioral health therapy sessions compared to children previously prescribed psychotropic medication. Limitations There were several limitations to this study. First, the brief education sessions were not uniform and different information or focus of information may have been shared with each PCP at the clinic. For example, PCPs may have asked varying follow-up questions or inquired about specific patients. Additionally, PCPs may have sought out the behavioral health provider outside of the educational consultations for additional follow-up. Second, the brief educational consults were conducted at a clinic where behavioral health providers had been available to the primary care clinic for several years. The impact of the consultations may have been different had they been conducted in a pediatric practice in which behavioral health providers were newly integrated. Specifically, familiarity with on-site behavioral health services, development of trusting, collaborative relationships, and receipt of potentially positive feedback from patients outside of this study regarding their behavioral health experience may have mediated the relationship between provider education and increased referral rates. Finally, due to a lack of access to the PCPs' medical files, the number of patients diagnosed with ADHD by a PCP and the number of patients who received medication management alone were unable to be determined. Future Directions As there continues to be a move to integrate behavioral health services into primary care, research should continue to examine methods to increase referrals and collaborations between behavioral health providers and PCPs. This study suggested that brief, informal education provided in a ""curbside consultation"" format may increase referrals for the assessment and behavioral treatment of ADHD. Educational ""curbside consultations"" may also be an effective way to establish the credibility of the behavioral health provider and the services they can provide in an integrated clinic. In addition, consults may allow behavioral health providers to provide PCPs with updates on the management of patients' behavioral health concerns, a collaborative effort PCPs identify as valuable (Williams et al., 2004). Future studies should employ experimental procedures to clarify what factors (e.g., length of relationship, receipt of positive feedback from patients regarding their behavioral health experience, discussion of cases, responsiveness to PCP questions, provision of education) in the consultation relationship are most important for increasing referrals and improving patient care. It will also be important to conduct additional research on treatment status (e.g., behavioral therapy, pharmacotherapy, combined approach) following a diagnosis of ADHD. The AAP (2011) has recommended that school-age children receive both medication management and behavioral health services for the treatment of ADHD. This study provided evidence that children who were not on psychotropic medication at the time of the initial behavioral health consultation attended more behavioral health sessions compared to children who had already been placed on medication by their PCP. It was inferred that the children already placed on medication used to treat ADHD by their PCP had been diagnosed with ADHD by their PCP prior to the initial behavioral health consultation. This suggests that the treatment options used by families may be impacted by whether they are diagnosed with ADHD by their PCP compared with a behavioral health provider, as families diagnosed by a behavioral health provider may be more open to behavioral management interventions for the treatment of ADHD. Future research should be conducted on how families choose treatment following their child's diagnosis of ADHD and whether choices are impacted by which professional provides the diagnosis. Future research should also examine PCPs' medication management of ADHD symptoms and whether or not this is impacted by collaboration with behavioral health providers (e.g., collaborative case management; use of data-based decision making to monitor symptoms and side effects). Future studies should also examine the impact of educational consultations across diverse clinics and behavioral health concerns. This study was limited to a private, suburban pediatrics clinic in the Midwest. It would be important to determine whether the same effects are able to be captured in clinics located in high need, underserved areas or clinics with diverse structure (e.g., frequent turnover due to resident training). Additionally, it will be important to examine the impact of consultations in clinics where behavioral health providers are newly integrated into the clinic. Conclusion One of the most common behavioral health concerns identified by pediatricians is the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD (Williams et al., 2004). The AAP (2011) has provided guidelines for pediatricians that emphasize the need for comprehensive evaluations and behavioral interventions for preschool and school-age children who are suspected of having ADHD. Due to time constraints and costs of treating behavioral health concerns for pediatricians (Cooper et al., 2006; Meadows, Valleley, Haack, Thorson, & Evans, 2011), integrating BHCs into primary care centers is one way to optimize patient care for children and adolescents with behavioral health concerns. As integration occurs, so does the necessity of researching methods to increase collaboration between behavioral health providers and PCPs and to inform PCPs on the many ways behavioral health providers can contribute to PCP practices. As a combination behavior therapy and medication management approach is the preferred and recommended treatment for ADHD, methods to evaluate and monitor this treatment modality are needed. The current study provides some preliminary evidence that two brief educational consultations with PCPs may increase both referrals for ADHD concerns and may influence the way PCPs diagnose and address behavioral health concerns. http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/fsh0000210 References American Academy of Pediatrics.

If your memory is not as sharp as you would hope it to be, ADHD may be the culprit. If you are physically inactive, this may harm your brain. There is some evidence that aerobic exercise may improve cognitive and behavioral function. Most experts recommend that adults get at least 30 minutes of physical activity on most days of the week (at least 5 days). This level of physical activity may help you learn, combat inattention, and boost your ability to make decisions. Are you new to exercise? Start by walking for a few minutes every day and gradually increase your activity levels until you are active for at least 30 minutes per day. Check with your doctor before beginning an exercise program for the first time. If you have a diagnosis of a heart condition or other another condition, your doctor may have specific exercise guidelines for you. Many people eat out for the sake of convenience, but it is not a good habit for anyone, especially for those who have ADHD. Most people who eat a Western type diet have an imbalance in omega-6 to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Both types of fats are necessary, but too many omega-6 fats may promote inflammation. Having the proper balance of fats improves the fluidity of nerve cell membranes and facilitates communication between neurons. Omega-6 fats are found in canola oil, soybean oil, corn oil, and other vegetable fats. Omega-6 fats are abundant in restaurant food. Cook healthy meals at home instead to limit your intake of unhealthy omega-6 fatty acids and load up on anti-inflammatory fruits and veggies instead. If your doctor has diagnosed you or your child with ADHD, stick to a healthy eating plan to minimize hyperactive behavior and other symptoms. Science has yet to prove definitively which foods may make symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder worse, but some evidence suggests that artificial food coloring may aggravate ADHD symptoms in some children. Researchers are not sure how artificial food coloring may provoke symptoms, but some other children and those with adult ADHD notice a difference after consuming foods with these additives. Junk foods containing artificial food coloring are also loaded with sugar and excess calories, so they are not good for anyone. If you or your child has ADHD, eliminate junk food from your diet and take note to see if your symptoms improve. Monitor for hyperactive behavior, impulsivity, interrupting, restlessness, inattention, and fidgeting after the consumption of junk food. You may notice your child squirm more or blurt out and interrupt others when speaking. If hyperactivity or other symptoms increase after your child consumes these foods, eliminate them. Studies suggest that skipping meals, especially breakfast, is associated with an increase in mental health problems. Eating breakfast can help you stay focused for longer as you start your day. ADHD medications may interfere with your appetite, but it is important to eat something in the morning. Try a protein shake, fruit with nut butter, or cup of yogurt sprinkled with granola. Hard-boiled eggs are portable and deliver a healthy dose of protein, too. Stick to regular meal times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Results of studies suggest people who eat meals according to a regular schedule enjoy better mental health compared to those who have irregular eating patterns. Breakfast will help your child do schoolwork more effectively and attentively. Some studies suggest that clutter is associated with increased creativity, but it may increase symptoms of ADHD in those who have the diagnosis. Keep your home and office tidy. Declutter and minimize paper piles, books, and mounds of laundry. All of these may remind you of your to do list and things you need to get done. Visual reminders like these may overwhelm you and remind you of long-term projects you have been avoiding. If you feel disorganized, eliminate clutter to free your mind. You will be more productive and worry less. Getting rid of clutter frees you up to do other activities. Many people who have ADHD may also have hoarding tendencies. If you accumulate objects and find it difficult to let them go, adopt a simple rule when shopping. Follow the ""one in, one out"" adage. If you bring a new pair of shoes home, give an old pair away. You can do the same with clothing items, books, household items, kitchen items, and many other things. If you have not used or worn an item in the prior 1 to 2 years, you likely never will, so it is time to donate it or give it to a friend. Approximately 50% of adults who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder also suffer from an anxiety disorder. ADHD with anxiety can be particularly debilitating and interfere with your ability to function. If you have both disorders, some medications your doctor prescribes to treat ADHD symptoms can make anxiety symptoms worse. Adults with ADHD are also more likely to suffer from other mental disorders like depression, bipolar disorder, or another comorbid mental disorder. Medications used to treat depression may also make symptoms of ADHD worse. Substance abuse problems are also more common in those who have ADHD. Evidence suggests that ADHD treatment works better when substance abuse problems have been addressed. Talk to your doctor about all of your symptoms. He or she may diagnose you with a comorbid condition in addition to ADHD. Symptoms like being forgetful, being inattentive, and low self-esteem may be features of both ADHD or another mental health condition like anxiety or depression. Your doctor can review your medical history and make sure you have not been misdiagnosed with any condition. A doctor uses criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to diagnose ADHD and other mental health conditions. People who have ADHD often suffer from sleep problems. There are a variety of reasons for this. Stimulant medications used to treat ADHD symptoms may make it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep. Sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, and alcohol and drug abuse also all occur more frequently in people who have ADHD, and all of these conditions can affect sleep. Lack of sleep can increase inattentiveness and other symptoms of ADHD. Sleep deprivation can make it more difficult to carry out daily activities. Sleep problems are treatable. Have a conversation with your physician if you are excessively sleepy during the day or if you have a hard time sleeping at night. It may be that ADHD medication side effects are contributing to sleep problems. The doctor may recommend that you have a sleep study to diagnose or rule out sleep disorders. Getting adequate sleep will help you avoid making careless mistakes. It is especially concerning if your sleep problems have persisted for a long period of time. Results of studies suggest a combination of medication and therapy works best to manage ADHD symptoms. You may feel like quitting therapy once ADHD symptoms are managed, but this may not be the best choice. Therapy requires a bit of investment in both time and money but a combination approach with both therapy and medication really does work best to keep ADHD under control. Quitting therapy may increase symptoms of ADHD. Studies show that childhood and adolescent ADHD often continues into adulthood, so it is important to stick to the treatment plan your doctor has designed for you. ADHD may cause different symptoms during different developmental stages. Hyperactivity and impulsivity are more common in children and may decrease in adulthood. Adult ADHD patients may be less likely to be hyperactive-impulsive but they still feel restless inside. People who have ADHD are at increased risk for internet addiction. Studies have shown that up to 25% of people who have ADHD suffer from internet addiction. Increased screen time can make ADHD symptoms worse in some people. It is not entirely known how the two disorders are connected and which problem comes first. Avoid screen time for several hours prior to bedtime. Nighttime exposure to screens increases the risk of sleep problems for everyone, so set your devices aside and do not use the computer beginning in the late afternoon and early evening. You will sleep better and you may help minimize ADHD symptoms. Many ADHD medications contain stimulants to combat the condition. Similarly, caffeine in coffee or tea may help, too. Caffeine may make you less inattentive and it may improve hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms. If you stop drinking coffee or tea, you may notice that your attention deficit disorder symptoms get worse. Caffeine helps most people focus and improves brain function and alertness. It also improves working memory. The difference is that caffeine may make people without ADHD jittery while it helps relieve hyperactive-impulsive and other symptoms in those with attention deficit disorder. Check with your doctor to see if caffeine consumption is safe for you. If so, indulge in caffeinated coffee or tea and reap the benefits!

Abstract Abstract Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic illness that can cause marked distress and disability. It is a complex disorder with a variety of manifestations and symptom dimensions, some of which are underrecognized. Early recognition and treatment with OCD-specific therapies may improve outcomes, but there is often a delay in diagnosis. Patients can experience significant improvement with treatment, and some may achieve remission. Recommended first-line therapies are cognitive behavior therapy, specifically exposure and response prevention, and/or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Patients with OCD require higher SSRI dosages than for other indications, and the treatment response time is typically longer. When effective, long-term treatment with an SSRI is a reasonable option to prevent relapse. Patients with severe symptoms or lack of response to first-line therapies should be referred to a psychiatrist. There are a variety of options for treatment-resistant OCD, including clomipramine or augmenting an SSRI with an atypical antipsychotic. Patients with OCD should be closely monitored for psychiatric comorbidities and suicidal ideation. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent distressing thoughts and repetitive behaviors or mental rituals performed to reduce anxiety. Symptoms are often accompanied by feelings of shame and secrecy. In addition, health care professionals do not always recognize the diverse manifestations of OCD. These factors often lead to a long delay in diagnosis. The average time it takes to receive treatment after meeting diagnostic criteria for OCD is 11 years. Primary care physicians can play a crucial role in reducing the burden of OCD through early detection and treatment.  Enlarge     Print Patients with OCD should be monitored for psychiatric comorbidities and suicide risk. Cognitive behavior therapy, specifically exposure and response prevention, is the most effective psychotherapy method for treating OCD. SSRIs are recommended as first-line pharmacologic therapy for OCD. A trial of SSRI therapy should continue for 8 to 12 weeks, with at least 4 to 6 weeks at the maximal tolerable dosage. Indefinite SSRI therapy should be considered to prevent OCD relapse. At a minimum, SSRIs should be continued for 1 to 2 years before attempting to discontinue. Augmenting SSRI therapy with an atypical antipsychotic is effective in some patients with OCD who have inadequate response to SSRI therapy. OCD = obsessive-compulsive disorder; SSRI = selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

Incorporating motivational interviewing may increase engagement with cognitive behavior therapy for OCD and improve its effectiveness. Abstract The lifetime prevalence of OCD is 2.3%, although this may be an underrepresentation because often only patients with moderate to severe symptoms seek help. The mean age of onset is 19.5 years, and it is rare for new cases of OCD to develop after the early 30s. A subset of patients, mostly males, have an early onset (before 10 years of age). The lifetime risk of developing OCD is higher in females, who typically develop the disorder in adolescence. Abstract OCD has a substantial effect on quality of life and level of functioning. It is often a chronic disorder (60% to 70% of cases) and is likely to persist if not treated effectively. Significant improvement or remission is possible when evidence-based therapies are applied. Patients with a later age of onset, shorter duration of symptoms, good insight, and response to initial treatment have an increased likelihood of remission. Early and aggressive treatment of OCD, with a goal of remission, is important for a positive outcome. Therefore, it is critical that primary care physicians are equipped to diagnose and treat patients with OCD appropriately. Insufficient treatment and a lack of OCD-specific resources are important problems in the management of this disorder. In one study population, only 30.9% of patients with severe symptoms and 2.9% of patients with moderately severe symptoms received treatment specific for OCD. Abstract The pathogenesis of OCD is a complex interplay between neurobiology, genetics, and environmental influences. Historically, dysfunction in the serotonin system was postulated to be the main factor in OCD pathogenesis, given the selective response to serotonergic medication. More recent research has also demonstrated the role of glutamate, dopamine, and possibly other neurochemicals. A proposed model for OCD suggests that genetic vulnerability to environmental stressors may result in modification of gene expression within neurotransmitter systems. This, in turn, results in changes to brain circuitry and function. Abstract Obsessions are recurrent intrusive thoughts or images that cause marked distress. The thoughts are unwanted and inconsistent with the individual's sense of self (egodystonic), and great effort is made to resist or suppress them. They can involve contamination; repeated doubts; or taboo thoughts of a sexual, religious, or aggressive nature. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental rituals performed to counteract the anxiety caused by obsessions. Individuals feel strongly compelled to complete these actions, and the behaviors become automatic over time. They can include handwashing, checking, ordering, praying, counting, and seeking reassurance. Common obsessions and compulsions are included in .  Enlarge     Print Common Symptoms in Patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Monitoring the news for reports of violent crimes, asking for reassurance about being a good person Fear of being contaminated or contaminating others; fear of being contaminated by germs, infections, or environmental factors; fear of being contaminated by bad or immoral persons Recurrent worries about doing things incorrectly or incompletely, thereby negatively affecting the patient or others Checking excessively, performing actions in a particular order Thoughts about being immoral and eternal damnation Recurrent thoughts about being a pedophile or sexually deviant; recurrent thoughts about acting sexually inappropriate toward others Avoiding situations that trigger the thoughts, performing mental rituals to counteract the thoughts Recurrent thoughts of needing to do things in a balanced or exact fashion Adapted with permission from Grant JE.

In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., OCD is recognized as a disorder distinct from anxiety and is now grouped with several other disorders with common features, often referred to as obsessive-compulsive–related disorders . OCD is a complex, heterogeneous disorder, and some presentations are underrecognized. For example, taboo thoughts may be attributed to other causes or may not appear to be associated with overt compulsions. Even when compulsions are not easily observable, patients with OCD usually have mental rituals. Patients are often reluctant to report symptoms of OCD for a variety of reasons, including embarrassment, stigma, and the fear of what the obsession might mean or the consequences of revealing it.  Enlarge     Print DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder 1.

Patients may offer clues by alluding to intrusive thoughts or repetitive behaviors. Avoidance of particular locations or objects, excessive concerns about illness or injury, and repetitive reassurance-seeking behavior are also common. It is important to note that obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is a separate diagnostic entity that is not characterized by intrusive thoughts or repetitive behaviors. Rather, it is a pervasive pattern of behaviors emphasizing organization, perfectionism, and a sense of control.  If true OCD is suspected, the use of a few simple screening questions can be helpful . Standardized diagnostic tools are available, but most are not practical for use in primary care. Two commonly used patient self-report inventories are the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory–Revised () and the Florida Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory ().  Enlarge     Print Initial Screening Questions for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Is there any thought that keeps bothering you that you would like to get rid of but cannot?

Are you concerned about putting things in a special order, or are you very upset by mess? : If a person answers “yes” to any of these questions and the symptom causes distress, a diagnostic interview or patient symptom inventory should be administered.

OCD is often misdiagnosed as other disorders , although OCD is a common comorbidity for many of these conditions, and the possibility of more than one diagnosis should be considered.

Abstract Patients with OCD should be monitored for psychiatric comorbidities and suicide risk. In their lifetime, 90% of patients with OCD meet criteria for at least one other psychiatric diagnosis. The most common comorbid diagnoses are anxiety disorders (75.8%), including panic disorder, social phobia, specific phobias, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other common comorbidities include mood disorders (63.3%), particularly major depressive disorder (40.7%); impulse control disorders (55.9%); and substance use disorders (38.6%). The risk of suicide in persons with OCD is high. In one community survey, 63% of persons with OCD had experienced suicidal thoughts, and 26% had attempted suicide. Comorbidity with depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or impulse control disorders increases the risk of suicidal behavior. Abstract Once OCD is diagnosed, it is important to provide the patient with information and support. Patients and family members should be educated about the chronic nature of OCD and the importance of self-management skills. Evidence-based medical and behavior therapies can reduce the severity and frequency of obsessions and compulsions, and can induce remission in some patients. Because it may take weeks to months for these therapies to become effective, physicians should inform patients about this delay in treatment response and encourage adherence during the early phase of treatment. It is helpful to quantify the severity of symptoms and impairment before and during treatment. This may be done using standardized rating scales, or by patient report of the time expended on obsessions or compulsions and the level of distress they cause. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale—second edition (Y-BOCS-II) is a reliable tool for measuring OCD symptom severity and is available at . Patients should be assessed for suicide risk and presence of comorbidities throughout the course of their illness. Treatment is indicated when OCD symptoms impair the patient's functioning or cause significant distress. Reasonable treatment goals are spending less than one hour per day on obsessive-compulsive behaviors and achieving minimal interference with daily tasks. Psychiatric consultation is recommended for patients with severe OCD, as measured by the Y-BOCS-II. is an algorithm for the treatment of OCD.       Algorithm for the treatment of OCD. (CBT= cognitive behavior therapy; OCD = obsessive-compulsive disorder; SNRI = serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; SSRI= selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.) . Algorithm for the treatment of OCD. (CBT= cognitive behavior therapy; OCD = obsessive-compulsive disorder; SNRI = serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; SSRI= selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.) . Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), specifically exposure and response prevention, is the most effective psychotherapy method for treating OCD. Patients are exposed to anxiety-provoking stimuli, and learn to not perform compulsive behaviors in response. Ideally, CBT should be administered by a trained health care professional in an individual or group format, although studies have suggested that self-directed exposure and response prevention combined with motivational interviewing may be effective. Incorporating motivational interviewing may increase engagement with therapy and improve its effectiveness. There is no evidence for the use of psychodynamic psychotherapy or “talk therapy” to treat OCD. OCD has a highly selective response to serotonergic medications. Clomipramine (Anafranil), a tricyclic antidepressant with a strong serotonergic effect, was previously the first-line pharmacologic treatment for OCD. However, because of concerns about its safety and adverse effects, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are now preferred for initial therapy. A Cochrane review confirmed the effectiveness of SSRIs for the treatment of OCD (absolute risk reduction = 8% to 17%; number needed to treat = 6 to 12). Fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine, paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft) have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of OCD. Citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro) are also commonly used, but in 2011, the FDA began recommending dose limitations for citalopram because of concerns about QT prolongation. There is insufficient evidence to show that one SSRI is superior, and the choice of SSRI should be individualized, taking into account potential drug interactions and tolerability. To achieve optimal response, patients with OCD require a higher dosage of an SSRI compared with other indications.  The dosage should be increased over four to six weeks until the maximal dosage is achieved . Higher-than-usual maximal dosages are sometimes used, with careful monitoring for adverse effects such as serotonin syndrome. The trial of therapy should continue for eight to 12 weeks, with at least four to six weeks at the maximal tolerable dosage. It usually takes at least four to six weeks for patients to note any significant improvement in symptoms; it may take 10 weeks or longer for some.  Enlarge     Print SSRIs Commonly Used to Treat Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder FDA = U.S. Food and Drug Administration; SSRI = selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. *—Estimated retail price of one month's supply (starting dosage) based on information obtained at (accessed August 26, 2015).

If medical therapy is successful, it should be continued for at least one to two years, if not indefinitely. Relapse prevention with continuous SSRI therapy is a reasonable treatment goal. If the patient chooses to discontinue pharmacotherapy, the dosage should be gradually tapered over several months, and the original dosage resumed if symptoms worsen. The response to psychological treatments may last longer than the response to medications. Periodic “booster” sessions of exposure and response prevention are recommended to lower the risk of relapse when psychological therapy is discontinued. If an adequate trial of SSRI or psychological therapy does not result in a satisfactory response, combined treatment is an option. If the patient prefers to continue with medical therapy alone, a trial of a different SSRI is warranted. If there is no response to trials of at least two SSRIs, the patient should be referred to a psychiatrist. Clomipramine is an option in these patients. Because clomipramine can cause anticholinergic adverse effects, and rarely arrhythmia or seizures, it should be started at a low dosage (25 mg per day) with gradual titration to minimize adverse reactions. Addition of an atypical antipsychotic is effective for some patients with inadequate response to SSRI therapy. There is conflicting evidence regarding which atypical antipsychotic agent is most effective, and the usefulness of these medications is offset by a higher risk of adverse effects than SSRI monotherapy. There are a variety of other options for patients with treatment-resistant OCD, but the evidence for most therapies is limited. Some studies support the effectiveness of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or mirtazapine (Remeron) for OCD. Other medications under investigation include glutamatergic agents, stimulants, pindolol, ondansetron (Zofran), acetylcysteine, and anticonvulsants. Deep brain stimulation has had promising results for severe treatment-resistant OCD, but it has been studied in only a small number of patients. This treatment is used as a last resort and has received limited FDA approval under the humanitarian device exemption. Abstract Women who are pregnant or in the postpartum period are 1.5 to 2 times more likely to experience OCD compared with the general female population. Women who had OCD before pregnancy may have worsening OCD symptoms and are at higher risk of postpartum depression. Postpartum OCD may manifest as intrusive thoughts of harming the infant; however, these women are not at increased risk of injuring their infants. CBT is recommended as first-line treatment for OCD during pregnancy and the postpartum period. An individual risk-benefit analysis should be discussed when considering SSRI therapy during pregnancy and lactation. The prevalence of childhood OCD is 1% to 2% in the United States, and 50% of these children have comorbid psychiatric conditions. CBT with exposure and response prevention is the preferred initial treatment for mild to moderate cases. Family involvement is important for successful outcomes. Treatment with SSRIs, in addition to CBT, is indicated for patients with severe symptoms or comorbid psychiatric conditions limiting CBT participation. CBT with or without medication is superior to medication alone for treatment of childhood OCD. Abrupt onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in children may raise concern for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS). The term PANDAS is falling out of favor because of controversy regarding the etiologic role of group A streptococcal infection. A proposed new label for this diagnosis is childhood acute neuropsychiatric symptoms (CANS). CANS has many proposed etiologic factors, including infectious, toxic, and metabolic causes. There are currently no standard guidelines for the management of CANS, but a comprehensive evaluation is recommended, and empiric antibiotics are not indicated. : A PubMed search was completed using the key term obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as individual components of the term.

Freeman, Guillermo Perez-Algorta, Thomas W. Frazier, Robert L. Findling, Eric A. Youngstrom Objective To use receiver-operating characteristics analysis to identify multilevel diagnostic likelihood ratios and provide a framework for the diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children (5–10 years old) and adolescents (11–18 years old) in an outpatient setting. Method Caregiver, teacher, and youth reports from the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) were obtained for 299 children and 321 adolescents with multiple imputation of missing data. The reference standard was diagnosis of ADHD based on case history and a semistructured diagnostic interview masked to the ASEBA measurements. Results In children, caregiver-reported Attention Problems (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.74) outperformed all other subscales of the caregiver and teacher measures (AUCs ≤ 0.72). In the older sample, caregiver- and teacher-reported Attention Problems (caregiver AUC = 0.73; teacher AUC = 0.61) were best at identifying ADHD. Inclusion of caregiver and teacher reports significantly (p < .001 for all comparisons) increased prediction of ADHD diagnosis, whereas youth self-report did not. Conclusion Caregiver-reported Attention Problems were more useful than teacher-reports and self-report in identifying ADHD. Combining caregiver and teacher reports improved identification. Multilevel likelihood ratios are provided to facilitate routine clinical use.

We aimed to explore the associations among ADHD, weight, and BE in pediatric mental health clinics. Method We retrospectively reviewed consecutive intakes in two pediatric mental health clinics (N=252). BE was assessed using the C-BEDS scale. Associations between ADHD, BE, and BMI-z score were assessed via regression. Results Mean age was 10.8 (3.7 SD) years. Twelve percent (n=31) had BE. The association between ADHD and BE was statistically significant (OR 16.1, p<.001), and persisted after adjusting for comorbid diagnoses, medications, demographic variables, and clinic. There was a statistically significant association between ADHD and BMI z-scores (β=0.54, p<.001). After adjusting for BE, the relationship between ADHD and BMI z-scores was attenuated (β=0.35, p=.025), and the coefficient for BE was decreased (β=0.75, p=.001). Although stimulant use was associated with a three-fold increase in odds of BE (OR 3.16, p=.006), stimulants were not associated with greater BMI-z scores (β=0.18, p=.32). Discussion There was a significant association between ADHD and BE in two pediatric mental health clinics. Although these data are cross-sectional, and cannot be used to make causal inferences, these findings are compatible with the hypothesis that BE partially mediates the association between ADHD and BMI z-scores.

Gilbert, Context: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder characterized by a deficit in behavioral inhibition. Recent evidence also suggests a deficit in cortical inhibition via the GABA (γ- aminobutyric acid)-ergic system. Objective: To investigate the GABAergic component of ADHD using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Participants were recruited through local schools, local pediatric and other community clinics, and through advertisement in regional publications. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed within the research institute. Participants: Children (age range, 8-12 years) in a typically developing control group vs a group with ADHD were compared. Main Outcome Measures: J-difference-edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3 T was used to measure GABA concentration in a volume that included primary somatosensory and motor cortices. Results: GABA concentration is reduced in children with ADHD compared with typically developing control subjects. Conclusion: Our finding of reduced GABA concentration in ADHD is concordant with recently reported deficits in short intracortical inhibition in ADHD and suggests a GABAergic deficit in ADHD. https://doi.org/10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.2280 Dive into the research topics of 'Reduced GABA concentration in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder'.

Objective: To investigate the GABAergic component of ADHD using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Participants were recruited through local schools, local pediatric and other community clinics, and through advertisement in regional publications. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed within the research institute. Participants: Children (age range, 8-12 years) in a typically developing control group vs a group with ADHD were compared. Main Outcome Measures: J-difference-edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3 T was used to measure GABA concentration in a volume that included primary somatosensory and motor cortices. Results: GABA concentration is reduced in children with ADHD compared with typically developing control subjects. Conclusion: Our finding of reduced GABA concentration in ADHD is concordant with recently reported deficits in short intracortical inhibition in ADHD and suggests a GABAergic deficit in ADHD.

As a child, teachers or parents will diagnose their child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, due to out of control purposeless and inappropriate movement. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a disability of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity behavior. Children who are inattention, attend to have difficulty in focusing on one task that may bore them within only a few minutes or even seconds. Inattention behavior could be not listening, not following instructions, and difficulty sustaining attention to tasks or activities. Children with a high level of hyperactivity are always constantly in motion. Hyperactivity behavior includes fidgeting, restlessness, talks excessively, runs or climb on furniture, and often “on-the-go.” Actions without thinking, is impulsivity behavior within children with ADHD. Before you can diagnose a child with ADHD, you have to know which characteristics are displayed. Depending on their characteristics there three types: ADHD with predominantly inattention behavior, ADHD with predominantly hyperactivity/impulsivity behavior, or ADHD with both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity behavior. No valid test have been discovered of where ADHD comes from, so most diagnosis information comes from teachers and parents. Teachers and parents diagnosis information is based off of behavioral problems that occur at home and in school. This disorder occurs more in boys than in girls; boys are more likely to have combined type of ADHD; girls are more likely to have predominantly inattentive type of ADHD. Researchers say that children as young a 4 years old and as old as 18 years can be diagnosed with ADHD.

Some problems will be surgery, prematurity, oxygen therapy, or even low birth weight. Low birth weight for an infant is less than 5 ½ pounds and could be born a preterm which is around 37 weeks old or the fetus can be small for date. Small for date can be born preterm or full term. Even though most preterm babies that are low weight are normal and healthy, infants with genetic development of ADHD will have more problems with health and development than a normal birth weight infant without genetic development of ADHD.

Is ADHD a real diagnosis? “Some say that this explosion of childhood ADHD is indicative of what’s wrong with our society and education system. They blame parents and an educator for choosing quick fixes for what they say is a behavioral problem, not a brain-based disorder.” Regardless of all the research that supports that ADHD is a brain-based disorder, the dramatic rise that still keeps developing is causing people to doubt the reality of ADHD. “The main symptom, (among the three main symptoms) of ADHD is the inability to pay attention. Kids may have trouble listening to a speaker, following directions, finishing tasks, or keeping track of personal items. They may daydream often and make careless mistakes” (WebMD). These characteristics belong to all children which ask the question, emphatically, is childhood ADHD over diagnosed? Pertaining to children, the inability to pay attention is followed by hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Difficulties with learning and impaired school performance are just some of the implications that result from child abuse. Multiple researches shows that child who is a victim of maltreatment of any kind, scores lower on tests that measures the cognitive abilities and display lower school achievement when compared with peers from normally functioning families. This differentiation can be caused by the altered relationship between abused child and caregiver. In families where abuse is absent, and caring relationships are formed, child can develop a sense of worth and confidence needed to perform successfully in a cognition task presented. On other hand, child who is maltreated is often overwhelmed with the negative emotions and is lacking any motivation to succeed at school. ADHD Research Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a disability in which children consistently show one or more of the following characteristics over a period of time. (1) Inattention, (2) hyperactivity, and (3) impulsivity (Kirst-Ashman, Zastrow 2004). Children who are inattentive have difficulty focusing on any one thing and may get bored with a task after only a few minutes. Children who are hyperactive show high levels of physical activity, almost always seeming to be in motion. Children who are impulsive have difficulty curbing their reactions and don’t do a good job of thinking before they act. Causes of Attention Deficit Disorder Basically ADD is what it looks like, and at time also pertains to hyperactivity disorder or ADHD. The disorder generally causes the subject to be inattentive to stimuli; the subjects would find themselves easily distracted from any particular activity and may cause a difficulty in learning. The disorder does not readily become apparent until a child enters challenging situations such as elementary schools. Often children affected by the disorder make careless mistakes and are rather disorganized. They often lose their schoolbooks and assignments as well as non responsive when spoken to. Marion (2011) defines challenging behavior as a stimulus that a child reacts poorly to, that in turn challenges the child’s parents or teachers to guide them in a positive manner. Current research indicates that children who have significant challenging behavior will have problems in school. They have issues with social skills, emotional control and language development. These insufficiencies contribute to the lack of skills to succeed in basic academic tasks such as reading (Coi, 1996). Traits that are often attributed to children who exhibit these traits are hyperactivity, inattentiveness and disruptive. Children are sometimes not diagnosed with FAS until they reach kindergarten and are in a real school setting. School-aged children with FAS still have most of the same physical and mental problems that were diagnosed when they were younger. The craniofa cial malformations is one of the only physical characteristic that diminishes during late childhood (Phelps, 1995). ""Several studies have evaluated specific areas of cognitive dysfunction in school-age children exposed prenatally to alcohol. Researchers have substantiated: (a) short term memory deficits in verbal and visual material; (b) inadequate processing of inf ormation, reflected b sparse integration of information and poor quality of responses; (c) “ ADHD, a disorder beginning in childhood, characterized by a persistent inability to sit still, focus attention on specific tasks, and control impulses,” contributed by Michael Woods to Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is one of the most common mental disorders of childhood. Many children grow out of ADHD by adolescent or adult years, but many do not. Studies show ADHD in adulthood is more severe and may cause long term effects. Diagnosing ADHD is very difficult, because most children are inattentive, hyperactive, and impulsive at least some of the time. There are three basic types of ADHD. They are inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. (NIMH-ADHD) A child may have one, any combination of two or even all three of these types. If a child has a hard time keeping their mind on one thing or if they get bored easy they have a type of ADHD that is called inattention. If the child has hyperactivity ADHD, they are always moving, can’t sit still, and talk incessantly. Kids of all ages around our country, have some difficulty to concentrate in school and get their task done. Some children start in an early age which develops a bad habit later on in life. Reason why this occurs in children and some adults is result of ADHD, a disorder that creates lack of concentration and lack of controlling energetic behavior. It can also mean that it’s hard for the person to be organized with their life and turns it into a habit. Children with poor concentration in school and educational work, can affect them later on in life if not treated or start to be organized in their own time. Copyright © 2000-2020. 123Helpme.com.

Since the mid-90s, the number of children treated for bipolar disorder has increased considerably. Although the need to avoid a confusing terminology regarding bipolar disorder was generally accepted, agreement on diagnosis for this population was difficult to conclude. In particular, the controversy concerned children with chronic irritability and high comorbidity with ADHD. The DSM-5 working group on mood disorders proposed a new diagnosis: Dysruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD). If the distinction with bipolar appears now clear, high comorbidity with ADHD is concerning and makes the nosological limits unclear. However, differences are present and these two diseases must be distinguished in order to recognize their particular problems. Investigation of overlaps between ADHD and DMDD should help clarify their etiology, course and outcome. ADHD; DMDD; Pedopsychiatry; Similarities; Comorbidities Since the mid-90s, the number of children and teenagers diagnosed and treated for bipolar disorder has increased considerably. Yet, only a few of them actually had a diagnosis that was considered to be a ""typical"" bipolar illness. Indeed, the younger the child, the rarer is the bipolar disorder. Although the need to avoid a confusing terminology regarding bipolar disorder was generally accepted, agreement on diagnosis for this population was difficult to conclude particularly due to the net difference between North American and European clinical practices. In particular, the controversy concerned children and adolescents with chronic irritability and high comorbidity with attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). In addition to having a clinical picture akin to , these children frequently suffered from ADHD. The DSM-5 working group on mood disorders in and adolescents proposed a new diagnosis: Dysruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD). This is a diagnosis still in evolution whose purpose is to avoid confusion between an emotional dysregulation and bipolar disorder. If the distinction with the latter appears clear, high comorbidity with ADHD is concerning and makes the nosological limits unclear. Thus, this new diagnosis, its meaning and its management are still studied and discussed. In this review, we shall first describe the DMDD and then its comorbidity with ADHD. Subsequently, we will discuss their similarities and their distinctions. Attribution of diagnosis of bipolarity has particularly increased in the last few years, but nevertheless the epidemiological data do not show any increase of prevalence of this pathology []. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) quoted an article of the Wall Street Journal where a typical case was described: an 11-year-old boy having received a diagnosis of bipolarity at the age of 4 was never able to be successfully treated for its severe recurrent temper outbursts []. Many children were never able to receive an adequate diagnosis because they had a disorder which had not been defined yet. Thus, the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) longs to give a name disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), to the suffering of these children and to ensure they receive the care they need. The first works dedicated to the developmental approach of mood disorders go back to the 1960s by the publication of retrospective and prospective studies with repeated evaluations [,]. These studies highlighted the early beginning of some mood disorders and their developmental continuity with certain emotional disorders but also with certain behavior disorders. For the child’s mania, the debate turned to the more or less “wide” definition of the notion of mania, which caused a major variation in the estimations of prevalence of bipolar disorder in pediatric population. Indeed, during the last ten years, diagnosis of bipolar disorders in children almost doubled []. According to Blader and Carlson [], the rate of children diagnosed as bipolar between 1996 and 2003 increased from 1.3 to 7.3 per 10,000. This increase corresponds to a period which follows one that was characterized by the under-diagnosis of bipolarity in children and to the necessity of answering the suffering that it had engendered. Today, the DSM-5 specifies and enriches the diagnosis spectrum in pedopsychiatry, knowing that the DSM-IV was mainly realized from observation of adult’s clinic. In the context of this increase of bipolarity’s diagnosis in children, the DSM-5 workgroup on mood disorders in pedopsychiatry revaluated the limits of bipolarity []. With the aim of deepening the distinctions in the disorders, the workgroup on disorders in children got closer to the workgroup on the mood disorders by having three precise purposes: (1) to learn to distinguish episodes of hypomania from episodes of mania, (2) to know if a severe chronic irritability corresponds to a mania state in process of in children, and (3) to define the nosologic status of episodes of hypomania with a duration superior to 4 days. At that time, the question concerning the link between this severe chronic irritability with a bipolar disorder in development remained a major point to be resolved. For its analysis, the workgroup used scientific data while taking into account the clinical necessity of specifying mood disorders in pedopsychiatry. They discovered that the “classic” phenotype of bipolarity was actually rare in young children. Indeed, many bipolar children showed unusual symptoms of bipolarity and were actually DMDD. Leibenluft [] first described the diagnostic criteria of Severe Mood Dysregulation (SMD) in order to study the relations between bipolarity and severe chronic irritability []. The DSM-5 workgroup then proposed another terminology, the Temper Dysregulation Disorder Dysphoria (TDDD). In the end, it was the expression Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) that was retained for the release of the DSM-5 in May 2013. The clinical picture given in the below section is very similar to the one described by Leibenluft except for hyperarousal. Diagnostic Criteria of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DSM-5; 2013) • Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally and/or behaviorally that is grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation. • The temper outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level. • The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times a week. • The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others. • Criteria A-D have to be present for 12 or more months. Throughout that time, the individual has not had a period lasting 3 or more consecutive months without all of the symptoms in Criteria A-D. • Criteria A and D are present in at least two or three settings and are severe in at least one of these. • The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 or after age 18 years. • By history or observation, the age of onset of criteria A-E is before 10 years. • There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or hypomanic episode have been met. • The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of major depressive disorder and are not better explained by another mental disorder. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effect of a substance or to another medical or . Data concerning DMDD correspond to a pathological concept that is still in evolution. The values presented below are based on current knowledge still in movement for this new diagnosis. Prevalence found for DMDD is 3.3% in subjects from 9 to 19 years-old, among which 1.8% have a severe form [] (American general population). This prevalence is higher than the depressive syndrome (2%) [,] or bipolarity (1.5%) [,] in children. According to Dickstein [14], average age is 11.04 and we find 78.1% of boys. There is thus a male ascendancy for DMDD [], while both sexes are represented in an equivalent way in young bipolar people [,]. Many children were diagnosed with bipolar disorder but also ADHD while actually being DMMD, pathology which itself causes severe psychiatric consequences. The creation of a different clinical entity seemed necessary and will contribute significantly to the understanding of developmental trajectories of mood disorders. If we examine the association of DMDD with Axis I diagnoses, a clinical trial by Dickstein [] showed that 93.8% of young people with DMDD presented criteria of ADHD, 84.4% the criteria Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and 46.9% the criteria of . We also find comorbidities in the American study entitled “The Great Smoky Mountains Study” [] , however with lower rates. In Leibenluft’s study [], 84.9% of young people with DMDD presented an oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and 86.9% an associated ADHD. We also find 58.2% of children with associated anxiety disorders and 16.4% having presented a depressive episode. Comparison of the prevalence of Axis I diagnoses in young people with DMDD and without DMDD in the GSMS study. Similarly, according to a study by Kessler [], comorbidities with DMDD amounted to more than 25% for ADHD and ODD. In these cases of , impairment for children with DMDD runs deeper. Furthermore, these children often have symptoms similar to a depressive syndrome or to anxiety disorders which cause an even more difficult classification. Indeed, this child DMDD presents more often depressive disorders than average. In front of prevalence and severity of symptomatology, it is important that we can make a precise diagnosis for the young carriers of these disorders. We find a significant difference for comorbidity in young persons between ADHD and DMDD on one hand, and ADHD and bipolar disorder on the other. Being frequently associated with bipolar disorder (60.6%), ADHD is found even more often with DMDD (86.7%). Besides, the comorbidity rate of ADHD/ODD will differ depending on whether the child is bipolar or DMDD. Only 26.7% of bipolar children present the toxic combination (ADHD/ODD/bipolar) against 80.8% in the case of those diagnosed DMDD (ADHD/ODD/DMDD). This latter very high rate of comorbidity may lead one to reconsider the limits of the diagnotic entity of DMDD []. High comorbidities are also found in a study by Leibenluft []. DMDD in general pediatric population is associated with the following disorders: 26.9% with ADHD, 25.9% with conduct disorders, 24.5% with ODD, 14.7% with anxiety disorders and 13.4% with depressive disorders []. In pedopsychiatric population, comorbid disorders with DMDD were particularly frequent: 93.8% of ADHD, 84.4% of ODD and 46.9% of anxiety disorders. Also, according to Brotman and al [], diagnoses of Axis I most associated with DMDD are ADHD (26.9%), ODD (24.5%), anxiety disorders (14.7%) and depressive disorders (13.7%) []. Finally, in Carlson’s study [] based on a series of 151 consecutive admissions in a department of pedopsychiatry of children from 4 to 12 years-old, 54.6% of these were admitted for behavioral disorders with aggressiveness and agitation crisis. A little more than a third of these children had a new crisis during their hospitalization. The diagnoses associated to these emotional states were mainly ADHD. The delay between the first agitation crisis and the admission was of 6 days on average. The fact of having at least one agitation crisis during the hospitalization appeared as being strongly connected to the comorbidity of ADHD with another typical behavior conducts disorder, ODD, or the existence of a learning’s disorder. In this prepubescent population, neither the mania nor the other disorders were significantly associated with the probability of agitation crisis because of the young age of the population. Other factors were found in the context of agitation crisis: low intellectual efficiency, exposure to violence and negative effects. This study evokes that these agitation crisis correspond to rage outbursts of DMDD, alone or comorbid of an ADHD. We see that in all these studies, comorbidity of DMDD with ADHD is extremely high and the question of overlapping between these pathologies is imperative. In Mulrany’s study [], 20% of children with ADHD met the criteria for DMDD and it was found that males were at a greater risk of developing ADHD with DMDD which is consistent with previous data. Those results also demonstrated that DMDD exacerbates social difficulties in children with ADHD and has a stronger impact on family functioning. Apart from the exacerbation of certain dysfunctions, there were an overlap in the context of the symptoms of ADHD and DMDD. Cardinal symptoms of DMDD, such as severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally and/or behaviorally possibly associated with aggressivity, frequently co-occurs with ADHD with or without ODD or CD. More specifically, DMDD comprises hyperreactivity to negative stimuli and a reactive aggressiveness with tantrums, both of which could be found and attributed to ADHD. Likewise, there are close similarities between ADHD and DMDD concerning patterns of poor adaptative functioning and increased psychopathology []. Many children with ADHD have difficulties to regulate their emotion. In their literature review, Shaw, Stringaris, Nigg and Leibenluft [] found emotion dysregulation is prevalent in ADHD throughout the lifespan and is a major contributor to impairment. Emotion dysregulation may arise from deficits in orienting toward; recognizing, and/or allocating attention to emotional stimuli and the ADHD treatment often ameliorate regulation of emotion. The authors considered 3 models to explain the links between ADHD and emotion dysregulation: they are correlated but distinct dimension; emotion dysregulation is a core diagnostic feature of ADHD or the combination constitutes a nosological entity distinct from both emotion dysregulation alone and ADHD. From a therapeutic perspective, ADHD and DMDD also have close similarities. According to Pappadopulos et al. [], psychostimulants were the most frequently used pharmacological agents in their review of the pharmacological treatment of aggression like severe temper outbursts, in children and []. Likewise, according to the review of Tourian et al. [], methylphenidate is efficient in decreasing aggression and irritability in youth with DMDD. More generally, in this review, it seems that the methylphenidate and the risperidone, but not the lithium, are effective to decrease the symptoms of the DMDD for patients under the age of 18. In the study of Waxmonsky [], similarities on the therapeutic aspects are also found between a group of children with ADHD and another group of children with ADHD and DMDD indeed, this study found that the DMDD children got closer to hyperactive children from the point of view of the therapeutic answer to the treatment, whether pharmacological (methylphenidate) or psychotherapeutic (cognitive and behavioral remediation, e.g. summer camp with behavioral sessions). To illustrate these differences, we shall begin with a study of Carlson showing the interest to consider the DMMD as a standalone entity. G. Carlson studied the concept of tantrum, a frequent cause of hospitalization which may be strongly associated to a diagnosis of mania []. Among 130 children aged five to 12 years and hospitalized in child psychiatry, 55% had severe tantrums averaging one hour. These children belong to a complex diagnostic group because they may be associated with many diagnoses such as learning disorders, ADHD, ODD and conduct disorder. Furthermore, compared to the pedopsychiatric population, these children are younger, they often received treatment before (mainly atypical neuroleptics) and the duration of hospitalization is longer. Anger outbursts were repeated for 50% of them without any clear improvement and those children pose serious diagnostic and therapeutic problems. However, the other half simply improved through hospitalization and no longer presented a tantrum during it. Finally, while more than a third of these children were diagnosed bipolar I early in the treatment, only five of them had finally received the diagnosis after a reliable expertise. The diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children seems to have been given by excess and confusion between ADHD and DMMD may persist if the symptoms are not clear or if there is comorbidity. Thus, in spite of visible similarities, DMDD and ADHD must be differentiated. Contrary to DMDD, the persistent dysphoria and chronic irritability are not found in ADHD. Finally, mood stabilizers are a part of therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of DMDD, contrary to ADHD. According to Biederman [], a strong family psychopathology is found in the case of ADHD children, contrary to the DMDD children. To differentiate the two diseases, the definition of DMMD in the DSM-5, very similar to the initial one by Leibenluft, no longer includes hyperactivity and puts greater emphasis on severe and recurrent temper outbursts in response to common stress situations [,]. The working group of the DSM-5 decided to rename the syndrome ""DMDD"" for a more descriptive name which includes a notion of severity of temper outbursts. Hyperactivity was eliminated as a diagnostic test in order to differentiate it from ADHD, and therefore, the presence of hyperactivity means that ADHD is associated with DMDD. Acute emotional crises of DMDD children have a structure that is similar to ""developmental"" anger, but their duration is longer []. An adult recalling a rule and provocations by other children are the main factors of these temper tantrums. The tantrum appears suddenly and disappears gradually. While anger quickly escalates and then disappears, distress is rather constant throughout the crisis. Emotional distress is expressed by crying, withdrawal of interactions and a need for reassurance. Temper outbursts are repeated and have an impact on social, school and family life. We find in DMDD children the difficulty to regulate negative emotions in response to social cues and the predominance of negative mood. This negative mood may include sadness and anger, but chronic dysphoria and chronic irritability are the central dimensions and are not found in ADHD []. Finally, in Uran’s study [], it appears that children with DMMD have a higher comorbidity rate than those with ADHD. Results showed that DMDD children's average scores were higher than ADHD children in Conners and in “Communication”, “Affective Responsiveness"", “Affective Involvement” and “General Functioning” subscales of Family Assessment Device (FAD). In conclusion, children with DMDD were distinguished from children with ADHD by their higher comorbidity rate, greater family dysfunctioning and impaired behavioral patterns. Pathophysiologycally, the study of amygdala activation during emotion processing of neutral faces in children with DMDD versus ADHD suggested the role of unique neural correlates in face emotion processing []. It showed a double dissociation in amygdala activity in youths with DMMD and ADHD when completing fear (emotional) versus non emotional ratings of neural faces. Patients with DMDD manifested hypoactivation while patients ADHD manifested hyperactivation. The DSM-5 consequently added the DMDD diagnostic to characterize a mood disorder in children and adolescents which differs from that ADHD, a neurodevelopmental disorder []. This child symptomatology would be more related to the environmental context and learning disorders. Some people have almost permanently a negative mood. These individuals tend to express negative emotions in the face of everyday life events. The models of personality describe this as a negative emotional style temperament trait, a reactivity style with some stability during development and linked to biological characteristics. We refer to emotional lability, neuroticism or hazard avoidance to describe this mode of emotional reactivity. In pedopsychiatry, the ""difficult temperament"" is a set of temperamental traits where high emotionality is central and a risk factor for the development of anxiety, disorders and externalizing problems. These features, bringing together persistent negative mood and a high reactivity to events of everyday life, recall the semiology of ADHD. For opponents of the DSM-5, the DMDD may diagnose ""trivial infantile anger"" as a pathology. However, for this diagnosis, we do not refer to “simple” anger but to frequent and violent anger outbursts associated with severe and persistent irritability. Indeed, the criteria are not common (chronic dysphoria with a minimum of three severe anger outbursts per week over a period of at least one year). Comorbidity between ADHD and DMDD are frequently found. Most studies have found an high comorbidity of at least 20% to 80% while Dickstein goes as high as more than 90% [,]. In addition, common features are hyperreactivity to negative stimuli and reactive aggression and similarities on the therapeutical aspect with the effectiveness of methylphenidate to some extent. This data can lead us to question ourselves about the nosological limits and the possibility of a sub-type. Similarities aside, the diagnosis of DMDD aims to avoid mistakenly assigning a diagnosis of ADHD. Indeed, we have seen that the differences between ADHD and DMDD are present. Chronic impact on mood with dysphoria or chronic irritability are among the central criteria of this differentiation. Similarly, the issue of awareness of the existence of DMDD is key for the therapeutic management, with mood stabilizers being a possible treatment differentiating it from ADHD []. In summary, it would be necessary for those children to develop effective treatments and have the means to act preventively. This requires the prior identification of the particularities of this pathology without being limited to nosographic categories previously developed. Indeed, knowing that psychiatric nosographies evolve based on new knowledge and cultural influences, the description of DMDD gives to number of children a recognition of their suffering. This diagnosis also changes the image they have, allowing them to evolve in a more peaceful environment. Furthermore, this diagnostic debate reminds how it is necessary in the field of and adolescent psychopathology to keep a developmental perspective. The DSM-5 added a new diagnostic disorder, the DMDD, a diagnosis related to mood disorders. For opponents of the DSM-5, the DMDD risks to diagnose ""trivial infantile anger"" as pathological. But for this diagnosis, we just do not speak 'simple' anger but to frequent and violent tantrums associated with severe and persistent irritability. Indeed, the criteria are not ordinary (chronic dysphoria plus a minimum of three severe tantrums per week over a period of at least one year). DMDD is frequently comorbid with ADHD and its clinical picture may cause it to be mistaken for ADHD. However, differences are present and these two diseases must be distinguished in order to recognize the particular problems of these children. Possible explanations proposed for such a high association between ADHD and DMDD are that both disorders show similar risk factors (genetic and psychosocial vulnerability) or DMDD may be a subtype of ADHD. Besides in this review, we have not discussed the high comorbidity with ODD, a disease also to be distinguished from DMDD. It is often associated with DMDD which makes its nosological distinction harder. Goldstein B, Birmaher (2012) Does bipolar disorder exist in children?

Typical symptoms include prominent dreaminess, , , sluggishness, staring frequently, inconsistent and a slow working speed. SCT has been a subject of controversy for decades and debate about its nature still continues. But it is clear now that this set of symptoms is important because it independently has a negative impact on functioning (such as a diminished , increased stress and suicidal behaviour, as well as lower educational attainment and socioeconomic status). The SCT symptoms are clinically relevant as they seem linked to a poor treatment response to . Originally, SCT was thought to occur only in about one in three persons with the , and to be incompatible with hyperactivity. But new studies found it also in some people with the other two ADHD subtypes – and in individuals without ADHD as well. Therefore, some psychologists and psychiatrists view it as a separate . Others dismiss it altogether or believe it is a distinct symptom group within ADHD (like Hyperactivity, Impulsivity or Inattention). It even may be useful as an overarching concept that cuts across different psychiatric disorders (much like , for example). If SCT and ADHD occur together, the problems add up: Compared to those with ADHD alone, adults with the combination of both were more likely to be unmarried, out of work or on disability. But SCT alone is also present in the population and can be quite impairing in educational and occupational settings, even if it is not as pervasively impairing as ADHD. Some have encouraged the use of the term () for SCT because it may be more appropriate and less derogatory. is the only disorder of attention currently defined by the or . Formal diagnosis is made by a qualified professional. It includes demonstrating six or more of the following symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity (or both). occur often and be present in at least two settings, clearly interfere with social, school, or work functioning, and not be better explained by another mental disorder. Based on the above symptoms, three types of ADHD are defined: a predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation (ADHD-HI) SCT is proposed to be similar to the (ADHD-I), but can be distinguished from it by the following symptoms: Apathetic or withdrawn, less engaged in activities Processes information not as quickly or accurately As a comparison of both tables shows, there is no overlap between the official ADHD inattention symptoms and the SCT symptoms. That means that both symptom clusters do not refer to the same attention problems. They may exist in parallel within the same person but do also occur alone. However, one problem is still that some individuals who actually have SCT are currently misdiagnosed with the inattentive presentation. In many ways, those who have an SCT profile have some of the opposite symptoms of those with classic ADHD: instead of being , , obtrusive, excessively energetic and risk takers, those with SCT are drifting, , listless, and daydreamy. They feel like they are ""in the fog"" and seem ""out of it"". The psychiatric problems often associated with SCT are more often of the , such as , unhappiness or . Most consistent across studies was a pattern of reticence and in interactions with peers. Their typically shy nature and slow response time has often been misinterpreted as aloofness or disinterest by others. In social group interactions, those with SCT may be ignored. People with classic ADHD are more likely to be rejected in these situations, because of their social or aggressive behavior. Compared to children with SCT, they are also much more likely to show like , or (frequent lying, stealing, fighting etc.). Fittingly, in terms of personality, ADHD seems to be associated with sensitivity to reward and fun seeking while SCT may be associated with . Individuals with SCT symptoms may show a qualitatively different kind of attention deficit that is more typical of a true information processing problem; such as poor on details or the capacity to distinguish important from unimportant information rapidly. In contrast, people with ADHD have more difficulties with and action toward goals coupled with impaired resistance to responding to distractions. Unlike SCT, those with classic ADHD have problems with but have no difficulty selecting and filtering sensory input. Some think that SCT and ADHD produce different kinds of inattention: While those with ADHD can engage their attention but fail to sustain it over time, people with SCT seem to have difficulty with engaging their attention to a specific task. Accordingly, the ability to orient attention has been found to be abnormal in SCT. Both disorders interfere significantly with academic performance but may do so by different means. SCT may be more problematic with the accuracy of the work a child does in school and lead to making more errors. Conversely, ADHD may more adversely affect productivity which represents the amount of work done in a particular time interval. Children with SCT seem to have more difficulty with consistently remembering things that were previously learned and make more mistakes on tests than do children with ADHD. They have been found to perform much worse on psychological tests involving perceptual-motor speed or and speed. They also have a more disorganized thought process, a greater degree of sloppiness, and lose things more easily. The risk for additional seems equal in both ADHD and SCT (23–50%) but math disorders may be more frequent in the SCT-group. A key behavioral characteristic of those with SCT symptoms is that they are more likely to appear to be lacking motivation and may even have an unusually higher frequency of daytime sleepiness. They seem to lack energy to deal with mundane tasks and will consequently seek to concentrate on things that are mentally stimulating perhaps because of their . Alternatively, SCT may involve a pathological form of excessive . The of the human brain provides for the cross-temporal organization of behavior towards goals and the future and coordinates actions and strategies for everyday goal-directed tasks. Essentially, this system permits humans to self-regulate their behavior so as to sustain action and problem solving toward goals specifically and the future more generally. is defined as a ""cluster of impairments generally associated with damage to the frontal lobes of the brain"" which includes ""difficulties with high-level tasks such as planning, organising, initiating, monitoring and adapting behaviour"". Such executive deficits pose serious problems for a person's ability to engage in self-regulation over time to attain their goals and anticipate and prepare for the future. postulated that the core cognitive deficit of those with ADHD-I is , or, as she coined in her recent paper on the subject, ""childhood-onset dysexecutive syndrome"". However, two more recent studies by Barkley found that while children and adults with SCT had some deficits in (EF) in everyday life activities, they were primarily of far less magnitude and largely centered around problems with self-organization and problem-solving. Even then, analyses showed that most of the difficulties with EF deficits were the result of overlapping ADHD symptoms that may co-exist with SCT rather than being attributable to SCT itself. More research on the link of SCT to EF deficits is clearly indicated—but, as of this time, SCT does not seem to be as strongly associated with EF deficits as is ADHD. Unlike ADHD, the general causes of SCT symptoms are almost unknown, though one recent study of twins suggested that the condition appears to be nearly as heritable or genetically influenced in nature as ADHD. That is to say that the majority of differences among individuals in these traits in the population may be due mostly to variation in their genes. The heritability of SCT symptoms in that study was only slightly lower than that for ADHD symptoms with a somewhat greater share of trait variation being due to unique environmental events. For instance, in ADHD, the genetic contribution to individual differences in ADHD traits typically averages between 75 and 80% and may even be as high as 90%+ in some studies. That for SCT may be 50–60%. Little is known about the neurobiology of SCT. But the SCT symptoms seem to indicate that the posterior attention networks may be more involved here than the region of the brain and difficulties with working memory so prominent in ADHD. This hypothesis gained greater support following a 2015 neuroimaging study comparing ADHD inattentive symptoms and SCT symptoms in adolescents: It found that SCT was associated with a decreased activity in the left (SPL), whereas inattentive symptoms were associated with other differences in activation. A 2018 study showed an association between SCT and specific parts of the frontal lobes, differing from classical ADHD neuroanatomy. Recently a study showed a small link between thyroid functioning and SCT symptoms suggesting that thyroid dysfunction is not the cause of SCT. High rates of SCT were observed in children who had suffered and in survivors of , where they were associated with . SCT is currently not an official diagnosis in and no universally accepted set of symptoms exists yet. But there are that can be used to screen for SCT symptoms such as the (for children and adults) or the Barkley Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Scale-Children and Adolescents (BSCTS-CA). The (CBRSC), an older scale, can also be used for SCT as this case study shows. Additional requirements for a proposed SCT diagnosis (such as the number and duration of symptoms or the impact on functioning) are continuing to be investigated. Although having no diagnostic code either, mentions the SCT group as a reason for why it did not replace the term "" with Other mental disorders may produce similar symptoms to SCT (e.g. excessive daydreaming or ""staring blankly"") and should not be confused with it. Examples might be conditions like , , , , , , forms of or . However, the prevalence of SCT in these clinical populations has yet to be empirically and systematically investigated. Treatment of SCT has not been well investigated. Initial drug studies were done only with the ADHD medication (e.g. Ritalin), and even then only with children who were diagnosed as ADD without hyperactivity (using criteria) and not specifically for SCT. The research seems to have found that most children with ADD () with Hyperactivity (currently ADHD combined type) responded well at medium-to-high doses. However, a sizable percentage of children with ADD without hyperactivity (currently ADHD inattentive type, therefore the results may apply to SCT) did not gain much benefit from , and when they did benefit, it was at a much lower dose. However, one study and a retrospective analysis of medical histories found that the presence or absence of SCT symptoms made no difference in response to methylphenidate in children with ADHD-I. But these studies did not specifically and explicitly examine the effect of the drug on SCT symptoms in children. The medication studies who did this found (Strattera) to have significant beneficial effects that were independent of ADHD symptoms and a poor response for methylphenidate. Only one study has investigated the use of methods at home and school for children with predominantly SCT symptoms and it found good success. In April 2014, reported that sluggish cognitive tempo is the subject of pharmaceutical company clinical drug trials, including ones by that proposed that one of its biggest-selling drugs, , could be prescribed to treat proposed symptoms of sluggish cognitive tempo. Other researchers believe that there is no effective treatment for SCT. The of SCT is unknown. In contrast, much is known about the adolescent and adult outcomes of children having ADHD. Those with SCT symptoms typically show a later onset of their symptoms than do those with ADHD, perhaps by as much as a year or two later on average. They have as much or more difficulty with academic tasks and far fewer social difficulties than do people having ADHD. They do not have the same risks for oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, or social aggression and thus may have different life course outcomes compared to children with ADHD-HI and Combined subtypes who have far higher risks for these other """" disorders. However, unlike ADHD, there are no longitudinal studies of children with SCT that can shed light on the developmental course and adolescent or adult outcomes of these individuals. Recent studies indicate that the symptoms of SCT in children form two dimensions: daydreamy-spacey and sluggish-lethargic, and that the former are more distinctive of the disorder from ADHD than the latter. This same pattern was recently found in the first study of adults with SCT by Barkley and also in more recent studies of college students. These studies indicated that SCT is probably not a subtype of ADHD but a distinct disorder from it. Yet it is one that overlaps with ADHD in 30–50% of cases of each disorder, suggesting a pattern of comorbidity between two related disorders rather than subtypes of the same disorder. Nevertheless, SCT is strongly correlated with ADHD inattentive and combined subtypes. According to a Norwegian study, ""SCT correlated significantly with inattentiveness, regardless of the subtype of ADHD."" See also: History of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Johnny Head-in-Air is an absent-minded boy who seems unaware of his surroundings. There have been descriptions in literature for centuries of children who are very inattentive and prone to foggy thought. Symptoms similar to were first systematically described in 1775 by and in 1798 by in their medical textbooks. Although Weikard mainly described a single disorder of attention resembling the hyperactive-impulsive subtype of ADHD, Crichton postulates an additional attention disorder, described as a ""morbid diminution of its power or energy"", and further explores possible ""corporeal"" and ""mental"" causes for the disorder (including ""irregularities in diet, excessive evacuations, and the abuse of corporeal desires""). However, he does not further describe any symptoms of the disorder, making this an early but certainly non-specific reference to an SCT-like syndrome. One example from fictional literature is 's character of ""Johnny Head-in-Air"" (), in (1845). (Some researchers see several characters in this book as showing signs of child psychiatric disorders). The Canadian pediatrician Guy Falardeau, besides working with hyperactive children, also wrote about very dreamy, quiet and well-behaved children that he encountered in his practice. In more modern times, research surrounding attention disorders has traditionally focused on hyperactive symptoms, but began to newly address inattentive symptoms in the 1970s. Influenced by this research, the (1980) allowed for the first time a diagnosis of an ADD subtype that presented without hyperactivity. Researchers exploring this subtype created rating scales for children which included questions regarding symptoms such as short attention span, distractibility, drowsiness, and passivity. In the mid 1980s, it was proposed that as opposed to the then accepted dichotomy of ADD with or without hyperactivity (ADD/H, ADD/noH), instead a three factor model of ADD was more appropriate, consisting of hyperactivity-impulsivity, inattention-disorganization, and slow tempo subtypes. In the 1990s, Weinberg and Brumback proposed a new disorder: ""primary disorder of vigilance"" (PVD). Characteristic symptoms of it were difficulty sustaining and , daydreaming, difficulty focusing attention, losing one's place in activities and conversation, slow completion of tasks and a kind personality. The most detailed case report in their article looks like a prototypical representation of SCT. The authors acknowledged an overlap of PVD and ADHD but argued in favor of considering PVD to be distinct in its unique cognitive impairments. Problematic with the paper is that it dismissed ADHD as a nonexistent disorder (despite it having several thousand research studies by then) and preferred the term PVD for this SCT-like symptom complex. A further difficulty with the PVD diagnosis is that not only is it based merely on 6 cases instead of the far larger samples of SCT children used in other studies but the very term implies that science has established the underlying cognitive deficits giving rise to SCT symptoms, and this is hardly the case. With the publication of in 1994, the disorder was labeled as , and was divided into three subtypes: predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. Of the proposed SCT specific symptoms discussed while developing the DSM-IV, only ""forgetfulness"" was included in the symptom list for ADHD-I, and no others were mentioned. However, several of the proposed SCT symptoms were included in the diagnosis of ""ADHD, not otherwise specified"". Prior to 2001, there were a total of four scientific journal articles specifically addressing symptoms of SCT. But then a researcher suggested that sluggish tempo symptoms (such as inconsistent alertness and orientation) were, in fact, adequate for the diagnosis of ADHD-I. Thus, he argued, their exclusion from DSM-IV was inappropriate. The research article and its accompanying commentary urging the undertaking of more research on SCT spurred the publication of over 30 scientific journal articles to date which specifically address symptoms of SCT. However, with the publication of in 2013, ADHD continues to be classified as predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined type and there continues to be no mention of SCT as a diagnosis or a diagnosis subtype anywhere in the manual. The diagnosis of ""ADHD, not otherwise specified"" also no longer includes any mention of SCT symptoms. Similarly, , the medical diagnostic manual, has no diagnosis code for SCT. Although SCT is not recognized as a disorder at this point, researchers continue to debate its usefulness as a construct and its implications for further attention disorder research. Significant skepticism has been raised within the medical and scientific communities as to whether SCT, currently considered a ""symptom cluster,"" actually exists as a distinct disorder. Dr. , an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Duke University, has commented ""We're seeing a fad in evolution: Just as ADHD has been the diagnosis du jour for 15 years or so, this is the beginning of another. This is a public health experiment on millions of kids...I have no doubt there are kids who meet the criteria for this thing, but nothing is more irrelevant. The enthusiasts here are thinking of missed patients. What about the mislabeled kids who are called patients when there’s nothing wrong with them? They are not considering what is happening in the real world."" researcher and editorial board member Steve S. Lee has also expressed concern based on SCT's close relationship to ADHD, cautioning that a pattern of over-diagnosis of the latter has ""already grown to encompass too many children with common youthful behavior, or whose problems are derived not from a neurological disorder but from inadequate sleep, a different learning disability or other sources."" Lee states, ""The scientist part of me says we need to pursue knowledge, but we know that people will start saying their kids have [sluggish cognitive tempo], and doctors will start diagnosing it and prescribing for it long before we know whether it’s real...ADHD has become a public health, societal question, and it’s a fair question to ask of SCT."" Adding to the controversy are potential conflicts of interest among the condition's proponents, including the funding of prominent SCT researchers' work by the global pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and, in the case of , a leader in the burgeoning SCT research field, direct financial ties to that company (Dr. Barkley has received $118,000 from 2009 to 2012 for consulting and speaking engagements from Eli Lilly). When referring to the ""increasing clinical referrals occurring now and more rapidly in the near future driven by increased awareness of the general public in SCT"", Dr. Barkley writes ""The fact that SCT is not recognized as yet in any official taxonomy of psychiatric disorders will not alter this circumstance given the growing presence of information on SCT at various widely visited internet sites such as YouTube and Wikipedia, among others.""

The classic presentation of ADHD involves features of high distractibility and poor attention vigilance, which can be considered as examples of attention and sustained concentration being engaged but then punctuated or interrupted. In contrast, SCT/CDD is characterized by difficulties orienting and engaging attention, effort, and alertness in the first place. Mary V. Solanto (2007). ""Neurocognitive Functioning in AD/HD, Predominantly Inattentive and Combined Subtypes"". . (5): 729–44. :.  .  . Differences between subtypes in cognitive tempo point to potentially important differences in the qualitative features of inattention, which suggest differences in etiology. Thus, whereas children with predominantly inattentive type (PI) appear to be slow to orient and slow to respond to cognitive and social stimuli in their immediate surroundings, children with combined type (CB) rapidly orient to novel external stimuli regardless of relevance. A series of studies in children who would now be classified as CB failed to identify deficits in the stimulus input stages of information-processing (Sergeant, 2005). The observably more sluggish orientation and response style of the child with PI by contrast, does suggest deficits in these early attentional processes. Kim, Kiho (2020).

Miller, Objective: Volumetric abnormalities of basal ganglia have been associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), especially in boys. To specify localization of these abnormalities, large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) was used to examine the effects of ADHD, sex, and their interaction on basal ganglia shapes. Method: The basal ganglia (caudate, putamen, globus pallidus) were manually delineated on magnetic resonance imaging from 66 typically developing children (35 boys) and 47 children (27 boys) with ADHD. LDDMM mappings from 35 typically developing children were used to generate basal ganglia templates. Shape variations of each structure relative to the template were modeled for each subject as a random field using Laplace-Beltrami basis functions in the template coordinates. Linear regression was used to examine group differences in volumes and shapes of the basal ganglia. Results: Boys with ADHD showed significantly smaller basal ganglia volumes compared with typically developing boys, and LDDMM revealed the groups remarkably differed in basal ganglia shapes. Volume compression was seen bilaterally in the caudate head and body and anterior putamen as well as in the left anterior globus pallidus and right ventral putamen. Volume expansion was most pronounced in the posterior putamen. No volume or shape differences were revealed in girls with ADHD. Conclusions: The shape compression pattern of basal ganglia in boys with ADHD suggests that ADHD-associated deviations from typical brain development involve multiple frontal-subcortical control loops, including circuits with premotor, oculomotor, and prefrontal cortices. Further investigations employing brain-behavior analyses will help to discern the task-dependent contributions of these circuits to impaired response control that is characteristic of ADHD.

Results: The affected twins had significantly smaller caudate volumes (mean difference=-0.56 ml, CI=-0.92 to -0.21) than their unaffected co-twins. Conclusions: These results provide further support for striatal models of ADHD pathophysiology.

(abbreviated as Tourette's or TS) is an that begins in childhood or adolescence, characterized by the presence of motor and phonic . The has the goal of managing symptoms to achieve optimum functioning, rather than eliminating symptoms; not all persons with Tourette's require treatment, and there is no cure or universally effective medication. Explanation and reassurance alone are often sufficient treatment; education is an important part of any treatment plan. Tourette syndrome patients may exhibit symptoms of other conditions along with their motor and phonic tics. Associated conditions include (ADHD), (OCD), and . Patients who have ADHD along with Tourette's may also have problems with disruptive behaviors, overall functioning, and function. Co-occurring can also be a source of impairment, necessitating treatment. Not all persons with tics will also have other conditions and not all persons with tics require treatment, but when comorbid disorders are present, they often require treatment. Treatment of ADHD in the presence of tic disorders Management of Tourette syndrome can be divided into treatment of tics, and treatment of conditions, which, when present, are often a larger source of functional impairment than the tics themselves. There is no cure for Tourette's. No one medication effectively treats all symptoms, most medications prescribed for tics have not been approved for that use, and no medication is without the risk of significant . Treatment is focused on identifying the most troubling or impairing symptoms and helping the individual manage them. Because comorbid conditions are often a larger source of impairment than tics, they are a priority in treatment. The management of Tourette's is individualized and involves between the clinician, patient, family and caregivers. Education, reassurance and psychobehavioral therapy are often sufficient for the majority of cases. In particular, targeting the patient and their family and surrounding community is a key management strategy. ""is an acceptable approach"" for those who are not functionally impaired. Symptom management may include , psychological and therapies. Pharmacological intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms, while psychotherapy or (CBT) may ameliorate and , and improve family support. The decision to use behavioral or pharmacological treatment is ""usually made after the educational and supportive interventions have been in place for a period of months, and it is clear that the tic symptoms are persistently severe and are themselves a source of impairment in terms of self-esteem, relationships with the family or peers, or school performance"". Knowledge, education and understanding are uppermost in management plans for tic disorders, and is the first step. A child's parents are typically the first to notice their tics; they may feel worried, imagine that they are somehow responsible, or feel burdened by misinformation about Tourette's. Before seeing a doctor, many parents research TS on the internet, or have seen media portrayals of severe cases. Parents may be overly concerned, and not realize that they, too, have tics, while the child may not be bothered by the tics. In some cases, neither the parents nor their child know they are ticcing; pointing out tics in this case will unnecessarily draw attention to them. In such a case, informing a parent who is unaware of their own tics can be disturbing, and they have a ""right not to be informed"". When their child receives a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome, both parent and child usually feel relieved, although the diagnosis can also cause distress for the parents as they confront a chronic condition that can be difficult to treat. They may also react with disbelief, denial, anger or resentment, or be exhausted and discouraged by previous encounters with medical professionals and the daily challenges faced by their child and family. Effectively educating parents about the diagnosis and providing can ease their anxiety. This support can also lower the chance that their child will be unnecessarily medicated or experience an exacerbation of tics due to their parents' emotional state. Psychoeducation that encourages a ""matter-of-fact"" attitude, and helps dispel misconceptions and stigma, is most effective when provided to parents. People with Tourette's may suffer socially if their tics are viewed as ""bizarre"". If a child has disabling tics, or tics that interfere with social or academic functioning, supportive or school accommodations can be helpful. Even children with milder tics may be angry, depressed or have low self-esteem as a result of increased teasing, bullying, rejection by peers or social stigmatization, and this can lead to social withdrawal. Some children feel empowered by presenting a peer awareness program to their classmates. It can be helpful to educate teachers and school staff about typical tics, how they fluctuate during the day, how they impact the child, and how to distinguish tics from naughty behavior. By learning to identify tics, adults can refrain from asking or expecting a child to stop ticcing, because ""tic suppression can be exhausting, unpleasant, and attention-demanding and can result in a subsequent rebound bout of tics"". The presence of ADHD is associated with functional impairment, disruptive behavior, and tic severity. Strategies to help the child at school can be established; these include allowing the child to chew gum to help reduce vocal tics, to use a laptop instead of writing by hand, and to take breaks from the classroom when tics are high. Providing additional test time can also be helpful, as can using oral tests when needed. Adults with TS may withdraw socially to avoid stigmatization and discrimination because of their tics. Depending on their country's healthcare system, they may receive social services or help from support groups. Behavioral therapies using (HRT) and (ERP) are first-line interventions, and have been shown to be effective. Because tics are somewhat suppressible, when people with TS are aware of the premonitory urge that precedes a tic, they can be trained to develop a response to the urge that competes with the tic. (CBIT) is based on HRT, the best researched behavioral therapy for tics. CBIT has been shown with a high level of confidence to be more likely to lead to a reduction in tics than other behavioral therapies or psychoeducation. CBIT has some limitations. Children under ten may not understand the treatment, and people with severe tics or ADHD may not be able to suppress their tics or sustain the focus required to benefit from behavioral treatments. There is a lack of therapists trained in behavioral interventions, and finding practitioners outside of specialty clinics can be difficult. Costs may also limit accessibility. TS experts debate whether increasing a child's awareness of tics with HRT/CBIT (as opposed to ignoring tics) can lead to more tics later in life. When disruptive behaviors related to comorbid conditions exist, anger control training and can be effective. CBT is a useful treatment when OCD is present. , such as exercise, yoga and meditation may be useful in relieving the stress that can aggravate tics. Beyond HRT, the majority of behavioral interventions for Tourette's (for example, relaxation training and ) have not been systematically evaluated and are not empirically supported. of a molecule. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication sometimes used to treat severe cases of Tourette's. Children with tics typically present when their tics are most severe, but because the condition , medication is not started immediately or changed often. Tics may subside with education, reassurance and a supportive environment. When medication is used, the goal is not to eliminate symptoms. Instead, the lowest dose that manages symptoms without adverse effects is used, because adverse effects may be more disturbing than the symptoms being treated with medication. There are no medications specifically designed to target tics, although some (for example, ) have been -approved for treating Tourette's. Medications which are used as primary treatment in other conditions are used with some success in treating tics. Neuroleptic medications (), such as (brand name ) or (brand name ), have historically been and continue to be the medications with the most proven efficacy in controlling tics. These medications work by blocking , and are associated with a high side effect profile. The traditional antipsychotic drugs are associated with when used long-term; and , , , and when used short-term. Additional side effects can be (a form of ), , weight gain, and (dulling of ability). Another traditional antipsychotic used in treating Tourette's is (brand name Prolixin), although the evidence supporting its use is less than that of and . The classes of medication with proven efficacy in treating tics— and —can have long-term and short-term . The agents are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. There is moderate evidence that the antihypertensive , along with , , , and , reduce tics more than placebo. Aripiprazole and risperidone are likely to lead to weight gain and sedation or fatigue; haloperidol may increase levels; tiapride may produce sleep disturbances and tiredness; and clonidine may produce sedation. Risperidone and haloperidol may produce . (or the clonidine patch) is one of the medications typically tried first when medication is needed for Tourette's. The agonists ( agents) show some efficacy in reducing tics, as well as other features of some people with Tourette's. Originally developed to treat high blood pressure, these medications are a safer alternative to neuroleptic medications for the people with TS that respond to them. This class of medication is often the first tried for tics, as the have a lower side effect profile than some of the medications with more proven efficacy. The evidence for their safety and efficacy is not as strong as the evidence for some of the standard and atypical neuroleptics, but there is fair supportive evidence for their use, nonetheless. This class of medication takes about six weeks to begin to work on tics, so sustained trials are warranted. Because of the blood pressure effects, antihypertensive agents should not be discontinued suddenly. (brand name ) works on tics for about half of people with TS. Maximal benefit may not be achieved for 4–6 months. A small number of patients may worsen on clonidine. (brand name Tenex) is another antihypertensive that is used in treating TS. Side effects can include sedation, dry mouth, fatigue, headaches and dizziness. can be problematic when treatment is first initiated, but may wear off as the patient adjusts to the medication. Other medications that can be used to treat tics include (brand name Permax), and with less empirical support for efficacy, and . There is low to very low confidence that tics are reduced with , , , , , , , , , , , , or . There is insufficient evidence for other cannabis-based medications in the treatment of Tourette's. , a tricyclic, and —a class of including , , and —may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. The benefits and harms of for treating tics have not been established as of 2018. Treatment of ADHD in the presence of tic disorders (such as and ) are underused in the treatment of ADHD when tics are also present. Patients with Tourette's who are referred to specialty clinics have a high rate of (ADHD), so the treatment of ADHD co-occurring with tics is often part of the clinical treatment of Tourette's. Patients who have ADHD along with Tourette's may also have problems with disruptive behaviors, overall functioning, and function, accounted for by the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating other conditions when present. Stimulants and other medications may be useful in treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders. Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulants fail. There is moderate evidence supporting that clonidine combined with , , and alone reduce tics more than placebo when ADHD is also present; desipramine is rarely used following reports of sudden death in children. does not increase tics, but may lead to weight loss and an increased heart rate. The treatment of ADHD in the presence of tic disorders has long been a controversial topic. Past medical practice held that (such as ) could not be used in the presence of tics, due to concern that their use might worsen tics; however, multiple lines of research have shown that stimulants can be cautiously used in the presence of tic disorders. Several studies have shown that stimulants do not exacerbate tics any more than placebo does, and suggest that stimulants may even reduce tic severity. Controversy remains, and the continues to carry a warning that stimulants should not be used in the presence of tic disorders, so physicians may be reluctant to use them. Others are comfortable using them and even advocate for a stimulant trial when ADHD co-occurs with tics, because the symptoms of ADHD can be more impairing than tics. The stimulants are the first line of treatment for ADHD, with proven efficacy, but they do fail in up to 20% of cases, even in patients without tic disorders. Current prescribed stimulant medications include: (brand names Ritalin, Metadate, Concerta), (Dexedrine), and mixed amphetamine salts (). Other medications can be used when stimulants are not an option. These include the alpha-2 agonists ( and ). There is good empirical support for the use of , bupropion and (brand name Strattera). is the only non-controlled (FDA) approved drug for the treatment of ADHD, but is less effective than stimulants for ADHD, is associated with individual cases of liver damage, carries an FDA regarding suicidal ideation, and controlled studies show increases in heart rate, decreases of body weight, decreased appetite and treatment-emergent nausea. approaches, such as dietary modification, and and control have popular appeal, but they have no proven benefit in the management of Tourette syndrome. Despite this lack of evidence, up to two-thirds of parents, caregivers and individuals with TS use dietary approaches and alternative treatments and do not always inform their physicians. According to Müller-Vahl (2013), medical professionals ""should feel obliged to inform their patients about not only effective but also ineffective treatments"". There is low confidence that tics are reduced with , and insufficient evidence for other -based medications in the treatment of Tourette's. While a balanced diet may aid in overall health, and avoidance of caffeine may help minimize tics for some children, no particular diet or alternative therapy (vitamin or diet) is supported by scientific evidence. Regular exercise can help reduce stress and improve a child's sense of accomplishment and self-esteem, but the effect of exercise on symptoms remains unstudied. There is no good evidence supporting the use of or ; neither is there evidence supporting , , or antibiotics for the treatment of . (DBS) has become a valid option for individuals with severe symptoms that do not respond to conventional therapy and management. There is low-quality, limited evidence that DBS is safe, well tolerated, and yields a reduction of symptoms ranging from no change to complete remission. Selecting candidates who may benefit from DBS is challenging, and the appropriate lower age range for surgery is unclear. The ideal brain location to target has not been identified as of 2019. DBS has been used to treat adults with severe Tourette's that does not respond to conventional treatment. Viswanathan A (2012) say that DBS should be used in patients with ""severe functional impairment that can not be managed medically"". A quarter of women report that their tics increase before , however studies have not shown consistent evidence of a change in frequency or severity of tics related to pregnancy. Overall, symptoms in women respond better to haloperidol than they do for men, and one report found that haloperidol was the preferred medication during pregnancy, to minimize the side effects in the mother, including , and effects. Most women find they can withdraw from medication during pregnancy without much trouble. In 2019, the (AAN) published , ""Treatment of tics in people with Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders"", including 46 recommendations based on a systematic review by nine physicians, two psychologists, and two patient representatives. The panel assigned three levels of recommendations corresponding to the strength of the evidence supporting the recommendation: A: ""rare because they are based on high confidence in the evidence and require both a high magnitude of benefit and low risk"". B: ""common because the requirements are less stringent but still based on the evidence and benefit–risk profile"". C: ""lowest allowable recommendation level that the AAN considers useful within the scope of clinical practice and accommodates the highest degree of practice variation"". The panel attached a helping verb to each level of recommendation: A = must; B = should, and C = may. Recommendation per American Academy of Neurology 2019 practice guidelines Inform individuals and caregivers about the natural course of tic disorders Inform about for those who do not experience impairment Initially prescribe Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) for those who are motivated and without functional impairment Periodically re-evaluate need for any prescribed medications for tics Refer teachers and peers to resources for education about TS Ensure ADHD is treated when it is causing impairment Screen for comorbid anxiety, mood, and disruptive behavior disorders Inquire about and recommend resources if present Measure severity of tics using a validated assessment scale Inform that treating tics rarely leads to complete cessation of tics For those who have access to it, prescribe CBIT initially relative to other behavioral interventions If face-to-face CBIT is not available, prescribe CBIT via Internet, or prescribe other behavioral interventions Inform individuals with comorbid ADHD that α2 agonists may treat both tics and ADHD Prescribe α2 agonists when benefits outweigh risks Inform individuals treated about side effects of α2 agonists In those treated with α2 agonists, monitor heart rate and blood pressure For those taking extended release , monitor QTc interval as indicated Gradually taper α2 agonists when discontinuing them Prescribe antipsychotics when benefit outweighs risks Inform patients about adverse effects (extrapyramidal, hormonal, and metabolic) of antipsychotics Prescribe lowest effective dosage of antipsychotics when using them When using antipsychotics, use evidence-based monitoring for drug-induced movement disorders and adverse effects When prescribing certain antipsychotics, monitor QTc interval and perform elecrocardiography Gradually taper (over weeks to months) antipsychotics when discontinuing Prescribe botulinum toxin injections for localized simple motor tics to adolescents and adults when benefits outweigh risks Prescribe botulinum toxin injections for aggressive or disabling vocal tics to adolescents and adults when benefits outweigh risks Inform individuals that temporary effects of botulinum toxin injections of and weakness may occur Prescribe topiramate when benefits outweigh risks Inform individuals when prescribing topiramate of adverse effects When individuals are using cannabis as self-medication for tics, direct them to appropriate medical supervision For ""treatment-resistant adults with clinically relevant tics"", consider cannabis-based products where legislation permits it. For adults who already self-medicate tics with cannabis-based products, consider cannabis-based medication where legislation permits it. When prescribing cannabis-products where legislation permits it, use lowest effective dose When prescribing, inform individuals that cannabis-based products can affect driving When prescribing, provide ongoing re-evaluation of need Employ multidisciplinary evaluation of benefits versus risks Exclude secondary causes of tic-like movements and confirm TS diagnosis when considering deep brain stimulation Screen for psychiatric disorders and follow deep brain stimulation subjects post-operatively Before prescribing, assure that multiple classes of medications have been tried Consider deep brain stimulation for ""severe, self-injurious tics"" Morand-Beaulieu S, Leclerc JB (January 2020).

0ea93ffd-c54e-49d4-a5f3-ce78e2054fb9,"Enhancements to the Behavioral Parent Training Paradigm for Families of Children with ADHD: Review and Future Directions , –() Behavioral parent training (BPT) is one of the empirically supported psychosocial treatments for ADHD. Over many years and in many studies, BPT has been documented to improve both child ADHD behavior and maladaptive parenting behavior. In some studies, BPT has also been found to result in benefits in additional domains, such as parenting stress and child classroom behavior. However, the BPT literature on children selected as having ADHD lags behind research conducted on BPT for children selected as having oppositional defiant and conduct disorders (ODD and CD, respectively) with regard to examination of factors that may limit treatment attainment, compliance, and outcomes, such as single parenthood, parental psychopathology, and child comorbidity. Because of the high degree of comorbidity between ADHD and ODD/CD, it is difficult to separate the two BPT literatures. The parameters of BPT (e.g., format and setting), parent factors, and child factors that may contribute to treatment outcomes for families of children with ADHD are reviewed here and recommendations for future BPT research in the area of ADHD are made.

However, for someone with incredibly low standards, it is one of the simplest tasks. The best solution to not being able to find a job is to be a janitor. Janitors are very important to society as their work is helpful to the environment and it keeps schools and other work places clean. It is also very easy to find a job as a janitor because janitors are needed everywhere. Finally, the one part of being a janitor that should appeal to the whole American population is that it requires no intelligence and virtually no effort. Janitors are helpful to the environment and to society by cleaning, sanitizing, and picking up after the other members of that society. They clean walls, windows, floors, and just about anything else that could need to be cleaned. This helps the environment by reducing pollution. Janitors also sanitize public facilities, such as restrooms. This keeps people healthy so they can continue to contribute to society in their own ways. Janitors are there to pick up trash discarded by other people. This is necessary because clearly people are so lazy that someone needs to be paid to make sure trash ends up in the right place. All these services make janitors very useful and therefore necessary in many places. Due to the need for a custodial staff in so many work environments, it is very easy to find work as a janitor. Many places, such as schools, are in need of janitors to clean for them. Because of this, there is a relatively high demand for janitors. Janitors also work for little pay. This means that many people can afford to hire them. Also, employers will hire just about anyone to be a janitor. This makes it even easier to find work, because janitors do not have to worry about living up to very high expectations. Certainly this is one of the easiest possible jobs to find. Finally, a career as a janitor requires little effort and no intelligence, which is ideal for American...

As a result of this, ADHD can hinder the person's relationships and interactions with others in addition to disrupting their daily life and lowering self-esteem.

When either parent tried to stop him from doing something dangerous, such as playing with an expensive vase or turning the stove off and on, he would often have a temper tantrum that included throwing things, breaking toys, and screaming. His relationship with his sister was poor. He bit her on several occasions and seemed to take delight in trying to get her into trouble. His parents described a similar pattern of aggressiveness in Ken’s behaviour with the neighborhood children. Many of the parents no longer allowed their children to play with Ken. They also reported that he had low frustration tolerance and a short span. He could not stay with puzzles and games for more than a few minutes and often reacted angrily when his brief efforts did not produce success. Going out for dinner had become impossible because of his misbehavior in restaurants. Even mealtimes at home had become unpleasant. Ken’s parents had begun to argue frequently about how to deal with him. School records generally corroborated his parents’ description of Ken’s behaviour in kindergarten. His teacher described him as being “distractible, moody, aggressive,” and a “discipline problem.” Toward the end of kindergarten, his intelligence and academic achievement were tested. Although his IQ was placed at 120, he did not perform very well on reading and...

Lee-Winn, , , , , Objective Despite data linking Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and adult binge eating, there are limited data in children with loss of control (LOC) eating. We examined inhibitory control in children with LOC eating syndrome (LOC-ES) and its association with ADHD. Method 79 children (8-14 years) over the fifth weight percentile were recruited, irrespective of LOC eating or ADHD status. The Eating Disorder Examination for Children and the Standard Pediatric Eating Episode Interview assessed LOC-ES. ADHD diagnosis was determined by the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for children and Conners-3 (Parent Report) DSM-IV Scales of Inattention and/or Hyperactivity (T score>65). The Go/No-Go (GNG) Task and the Behavior Regulation Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) assessed impulse control. Results Odds of LOC-ES were increased 12 times for children with ADHD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 12.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.11, 51.64, p < 0.001), after adjusting for BMI z scores and relevant covariates. Children had 1.17 times higher odds of reporting LOC-ES with every 5% increase in GNG Commission Rate (aOR = 1.17, CI = 1.01, 1.36, p < 0.05) and 1.25 times higher odds of reporting LOC-ES with every 5 unit T-score increase in BRIEF Inhibit Scale (aOR = 1.25, CI = 1.04, 1.50, p < 0.05). Discussion Children with ADHD had significantly greater odds of LOC-ES compared to children without ADHD. Children with LOC-ES had significantly greater impulse control deficits on performance-based neuropsychological assessments and on parent reports than children without LOC-ES. These findings suggest a need to investigate possible shared mechanisms such as impulse control deficits, among children with LOC-ES and ADHD.

Children had 1.17 times higher odds of reporting LOC-ES with every 5% increase in GNG Commission Rate (aOR = 1.17, CI = 1.01, 1.36, p < 0.05) and 1.25 times higher odds of reporting LOC-ES with every 5 unit T-score increase in BRIEF Inhibit Scale (aOR = 1.25, CI = 1.04, 1.50, p < 0.05). Discussion Children with ADHD had significantly greater odds of LOC-ES compared to children without ADHD. Children with LOC-ES had significantly greater impulse control deficits on performance-based neuropsychological assessments and on parent reports than children without LOC-ES. These findings suggest a need to investigate possible shared mechanisms such as impulse control deficits, among children with LOC-ES and ADHD.

If you are a healthcare professional and you find any issue, please reach out to Can bipolar disorder be cured? Unfortunately, like most other chronic mental health disorders, bipolar disorder can’t be completely eradicated or fixed. It is based on inborn differences in brain chemistry and function that can’t be permanently changed. However, can be successfully managed to the point that people are mostly or completely symptom-free for long periods of time. The key factor that determines whether a person experiences worsening mood episodes over time or has only minor symptoms is whether they receive proper treatment. Treating Bipolar Disorder and Co-Occurring Disorders Therapy for bipolar disorder is an important part of any treatment plan. In therapy, people can process trauma, learn how to recognize the signs of impending mood episodes and gain insight into behavior patterns that either worsen or improve bipolar symptoms. People with bipolar disorder can benefit from different therapeutic styles, but successful bipolar disorder therapy to help people learn: How to recognize the warning signs of oncoming mood episodes The effects of certain behaviors on bipolar symptoms Consequences of discontinuing medication or treatment Techniques for managing stress and regulating emotions Supportive psychotherapy, which focuses on the relationship between a therapist and a client, might be a better option for some. In this style of therapy, clients receive emotional support and are encouraged to continue using successful strategies or behaviors. Supportive psychotherapy promotes acceptance of treatment and increases adherence to medication and treatment plans. (CBT) helps people identify distorted or irrational thoughts or beliefs that trigger negative emotions and behaviors. They then learn how to challenge and change these ways of thinking. For people with bipolar disorder, CBT functions in a similar way as supportive psychotherapy. Instead of focusing on the origins of their disorder, this therapy tactic helps people manage symptoms and follow through on important behavioral strategies. Cognitive behavioral therapy for bipolar disorder focuses on the following outcomes: Identifying and addressing thoughts that affect mood Encouraging early and consistent intervention when mood symptoms arise that people who receive CBT for bipolar disorder have a better quality of life, fewer and less intense mood episodes, improved treatment compliance and fewer hospitalizations. Group and family therapy can be important components of treatment for people with bipolar disorder. or support groups can help people with bipolar disorder learn effective symptom-management strategies from their peers and reduce feelings of stigma, shame and loneliness. Treatment groups might be the first places that people with bipolar disorder feel understood and not alone. Both group and family therapy can help people with bipolar disorder improve communication deficits caused by the disorder’s common symptoms. People think and act differently when they are depressed or manic and can alienate others without realizing they are doing so. In joint therapy sessions, people can learn how others perceive them and how they can be more effective in conversing or interacting with others. can help people with bipolar disorder and their loved ones understand one another and practice different communication strategies in real-time. Medication is an important component of treatment for bipolar disorder. Because it is rooted in biological factors, bipolar disorder nearly always requires medication to treat, even when people participate in other therapies. Many different types of medication can be used, but mood stabilizers are the most common. Scientists and mental health professionals do not fully understand how for bipolar disorder work, but these medications are effective in reducing the frequency of mood episodes. was one of the first mood stabilizers used to treat bipolar disorder and is still a common option, though it requires more monitoring and management than other bipolar medications. Other commonly prescribed mood stabilizers include drugs that were originally formulated to treat epilepsy or control seizures. These drugs are generally known as . The most commonly prescribed anticonvulsant medications for bipolar disorder are: Researchers believe that these medications work by controlling levels of neurotransmitters in the brain. There are significant differences in how they are formulated that can make some more useful than others for treating certain aspects of bipolar disorder. Sometimes people with bipolar disorder experience psychotic symptoms and need medication to control them. However, have many uses aside from managing psychotic symptoms. They are frequently prescribed to help people control aggression or anger. Antipsychotics can also be prescribed instead of anticonvulsants to stabilize mood or reduce manic symptoms. Second-generation or atypical antipsychotic medications have been found to work as antidepressants for bipolar disorder. These medications include: that Abilify for bipolar disorder is effective in treating and preventing manic and mixed episodes but not as effective in treating bipolar depression. the use of Seroquel for bipolar depression, though it may not be the best option for people with diabetes or other medical conditions. Using Latuda for bipolar depression is as effective as using Seroquel and also comes with fewer risks and side effects. Clinicians frequently prescribe antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as bipolar depression medication, though they are usually prescribed in addition to mood stabilizers to avoid triggering manic or hypomanic episodes. Many professionals are not comfortable with the risks and prefer to try anticonvulsant or antipsychotic medications with antidepressant properties first, especially for people with histories of severe mania. In place of traditional SSRIs, physicians may prescribe Symbyax, a newer drug that combines fluoxetine (Prozac) with olanzapine. Using this medication can prevent some of the negative outcomes that occur when SSRIs are used to treat bipolar depression. that using SSRIs like Lexapro for bipolar disorder can help with severe depression but frequently causes adverse effects like mania, psychosis and suicidal ideation. like benzodiazepines are sometimes prescribed to people who have bipolar disorder and comorbid anxiety disorders or to address bipolar agitation or insomnia. However, using this type of medication comes with many risks, including triggering depressive symptoms. These medications also have addictive properties and are not recommended for people with substance use disorders. For these reasons, clinicians often try to treat anxiety in people with bipolar disorder in other ways. People who experience severe manic or depressive symptoms may require brief inpatient hospitalization for their safety and stabilization before they are able to continue treatment in an outpatient setting. Some people receive treatment in specialized bipolar treatment centers but most inpatient or residential mental health treatment facilities are able to provide tailored treatment for people with bipolar disorder. People usually enter for bipolar disorder for one of three reasons: They are in an environment that is triggering their symptoms They have symptoms too severe to be treated in an outpatient setting People with severe bipolar symptoms may have enough awareness of their condition to seek inpatient treatment voluntarily or may need to be admitted involuntarily through a process of civil commitment. When friends, family members or professionals are concerned, they can reach out to local authorities to have the person with the disorder evaluated for involuntary admission. Regardless of whether treatment is voluntary or involuntary, inpatient treatment for bipolar disorder has the same goals: Starting or resuming medication for bipolar disorder to stabilize brain chemistry Participating in individual and group therapy to address immediate symptoms Identifying and addressing psychological factors that led to the admission Developing a discharge plan with referrals to outpatient treatment providers For some people with bipolar disorder, hospitalization can become a regular part of their lives. However, following a consistent outpatient treatment plan can help people reduce the number of times they are admitted for inpatient treatment. Treating Bipolar Disorder and Co-Occurring Disorders People with bipolar disorder frequently have co-occurring disorders.  that they may be especially prone to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders. The reason PTSD and bipolar disorder commonly occur together is that people with each disorder often have histories of childhood trauma. shows that comorbid adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is also common, with up to 21 percent of people with bipolar disorder having comorbid ADHD and almost half of the people with adult ADHD having comorbid bipolar disorder. Autism and bipolar disorder are common co-occurring disorders for children who have . As many as of children with bipolar disorder also meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder. These comorbid disorders are associated with more severe symptoms and more intensive treatment like assertive community outreach programs. Regardless of the type of co-occurring disorder a person with bipolar disorder experiences, the approach to treatment is similar. People with co-occurring conditions require separate services that target different aspects of each condition. The best outcomes occur in integrated treatment programs in which mental health professionals closely coordinate services and communicate regularly with one another. This prevents advancements in treating one condition from causing regression in another. People with bipolar disorder often use substances to try to change or enhance their moods. Due to the severity and persistence of bipolar symptoms, this can frequently lead to addiction. These co-occurring disorders come with many risks. Having increases the risk of suicide and reckless behavior with severe legal, financial and social consequences. can be overwhelming on its own and even more so when it is combined with a substance use disorder. The key to breaking the cycle of crisis and hospitalization associated with addiction and bipolar disorder is receiving the appropriate type of care. to learn about how targeted intensive treatment can change the lives of people with these comorbid disorders.

Goepp, MD, discusses nutritional supplements that have been shown to be beneficial in managing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on January 2021. Q: My granddaughter is six years old and has been diagnosed with ADHD. Are there any alternative options using supplementation that may help improve her condition? A: Your question is important and timely, considering that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has become one of the most frequently diagnosed behavioral disorders in children today.1 To answer your specific question about nutritional alternatives to medication, it is important to understand ADHD. An estimated 3-6% of American children carry this diagnosis, with up to 15% being affected in some cities.1,2 Rapidly growing numbers of children given this diagnosis are prescribed stimulant medications such as methylphenidate (Ritalin®) for treatment. These commonly used medications are relatively safe and effective, but they can have undesirable side effects that increase with higher doses.3 Because they also have substantial potential as drugs of abuse among young people,4,5 it is critical that the diagnosis be correct. ADHD is classified as a mental disorder in which children (and some adults) demonstrate persistent lack of attention to tasks (attention deficit) and/or an inability to control impulses and an increase in physical activity (hyperactivity) that is not typical for people at a similar stage of development.6 I stress these two points because all children have periods of inattention, episodes of impulsive behavior, and sometimes incredible levels of energy; these are part of normal development. For all these reasons, my first recommendation is to be certain that your granddaughter has had a thorough developmental and behavioral evaluation by a pediatrician or a specialist in development and behavior. The important thing is having someone conduct the examination and document the findings. Children should always be observed for six months and then re-evaluated before being placed on pharmaceutical treatment—there is no way to be sure of the diagnosis based on a single exam.7 Meanwhile, families can do many things to help reduce the likelihood that the child will ever require medication. ADHD is actually a spectrum of disorders. In a 2003 study, scientists listed eight general categories of possible contributors to ADHD: food and additive allergies, environmental toxicity, dietary deficiencies in proteins or excesses in simple sugars, mineral imbalances, deficiencies in cell membrane components (essential fatty acids and phospholipids), deficiencies in certain amino acids, thyroid disorders, and deficiencies in B vitamins.7 Children with ADHD have changes in brain function that may arise from abnormalities in cell membranes, blood flow, and levels of signaling chemicals (neurotransmitters) such as dopamine and norepinephrine.8-10 Stimulant drugs such as Ritalin® promote the release of such chemicals in brain tissue. Nutritional supplementation offers a much broader and safer approach. The growing brain requires a tremendous amount of nutrition to support its structure and function. Supplements can provide components that are used in brain cell membranes and as building blocks or co-factors for neurotransmitter production. Nutritional supplementation and avoidance or elimination of toxins can produce improvements in behavior and performance in those suffering from ADHD.1,7,11 Parents should work with their children’s health care providers to ensure that any supplement or medication is provided at safe and effective doses. Many conventional physicians may not ask specifically about diet or supplements, so it is important to let them know about nutritional interventions. The following supplements have shown promise in helping children with ADHD. Vitamins and Minerals Multivitamin supplementation may help kids do better in school generally. One study showed that a multivitamin-mineral supplement helped reduce antisocial behavior in healthy children.12 These results suggest that multivitamins with minerals could help children with ADHD.1 High doses of vitamin A should be avoided, since excess accumulation of this fat-soluble vitamin can be dangerous.13 If a child has a known deficiency of B vitamins, supplementation may be helpful. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is essential in the manufacture of many neurotransmitters that are important for healthy brain function, with potential applications for fighting ADHD. One study found that vitamin B6 supplements were as effective as Ritalin® in decreasing hyperactivity, and that the vitamin’s effects persisted even after supplementation was stopped.14 ADHD has been associated with iron deficiency,15,16 and some evidence suggests that iron supplements may reduce the severity of ADHD symptoms.17 Magnesium deficiency is found in many children with ADHD; significant decreases in hyperactivity and disruptive behavior have been found in children who received dietary magnesium supplementation.18 Some individuals with ADHD have low zinc levels, and it has been suggested that zinc supplementation may improve behavior.19 Zinc may also improve the effectiveness of drugs such as Ritalin®.20 Essential Fatty Acids Unsaturated fatty acids, such as the omega-3 essential fatty acids, may have a useful role in the management of ADHD.1 They are critical components of cell membranes and function as the biochemical messengers that help nerve and other cells communicate. Children with ADHD appear to break down essential fatty acids faster than other children,21,22 and almost always have lower-than-normal blood levels of these important substances. Unfortunately, most children have an excess of omega-6 fatty acids in their diet, but suffer from a severe deficiency of beneficial omega-3 fatty acids. In two recent trials, supplementation with essential fatty acids improved conduct problems as rated by parents and attention problems as rated by teachers.23,24 Essential fatty acids have been found to enhance the effect of zinc,20,25 and were found to be effective in helping control attention and movement problems.26 Because it can be difficult to obtain optimal levels of essential fatty acids—particularly omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA—through dietary sources alone, your granddaughter might benefit from supplementation with a product that provides omega-3 fatty acids. Phosphatidylserine and Related Nutrients Phosphatidylserine is a critical component of cell membranes and plays a role in nerve cell signaling. Phosphatidylserine has been found to improve memory and concentration in adults,27 and one report found that it significantly improved attention and learning in children with ADHD.1 In a small, controlled study, dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE), which cells convert to cell membrane constituents, was shown to reduce hyperactivity.28 Be sure to check with the child’s doctor, since DMAE can have adverse effects when used at high doses.29 Amino Acids Most brain neurotransmitters are manufactured from amino acids, which are protein building blocks found in the blood. Levels of the amino acids phenylalanine, glutamine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and isoleucine are often low in the blood of adults and children with ADHD.30,31 In separate trials, supplementation with tyrosine or S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) produced improvement in adult attention,32,33 though the results may be short-lived.34 According to one study, the amino acid L-theanine, found in green tea, is more effective than a common prescription drug in promoting relaxation.35 Nutrient Dosing for ADHD Patients It is important to use the proper dose of any nutrient, especially in children. The following list provides the best-known dosages for many of the nutrients listed in this article. Always consult a child’s primary care physician before beginning any supplement, and be sure to list any supplements (along with medications) in the child’s medical record. Multivitamins: All children with ADHD should take a standard children’s or teen’s multivitamin once daily.1,12 Check the manufacturer’s label for the correct number of tablets (or teaspoons, if liquid). Use a multivitamin with iron if recommended by the child’s physician. Vitamin B6 and magnesium: Both of these nutrients are essential for neurotransmitter production14 and may benefit both adults and children.16 The best dosing data are for products that provide a daily dose of 250 mg of vitamin B6 and 125 mg of magnesium.42,43 Iron: Daily iron supplements of 5 mg per kilogram of body weight (about 2 mg per pound) have been found to be effective in reducing some symptoms of ADHD.17 Because iron supplements (such as ferrous sulfate and ferrous gluconate) can vary greatly in the amount of elemental iron (pure iron) that they provide, check the label to determine the correct amount needed to provide the recommended dose of elemental iron. Zinc: Supplementation with zinc sulfate alone at a dose of 150 mg per day44 or in combination with prescription stimulant drugs at a dose of 55 mg per day45 has been shown to improve symptoms of ADHD. Essential fatty acids: The omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may be helpful for individuals with ADHD.46,47 Doses that have been effective in treating ADHD are 80-500 mg of EPA and 175-500 mg of DHA.24,48 L-theanine: At a dose of 200 mg, this amino acid has been found to be effective in promoting relaxation.35 Ginkgo: A study in children using a combination of 50 mg per day of ginkgo extract and 200 mg per day of ginseng (Panax quinquefolium) produced improvement in symptoms of ADHD after two weeks of treatment.49 Pycnogenol: Children given a daily dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight (about 0.5 mg per pound) of this pine bark extract for four weeks showed significant improvements in multiple standard measures of ADHD.50 Melatonin: In combination with lifestyle modifications, a daily dose of 5 mg of melatonin produced marked improvement in insomnia in children with ADHD who were taking stimulant medications.41 Phytotherapies A number of plant-derived antioxidants hold potential in the treatment of ADHD. Extracts of ginkgo biloba improve brain blood flow and can improve cognitive ability,36 though there have been no controlled trials of its use in children with ADHD. In Europe, individual reports suggest that an extract of pine bark called pycnogenol, which has antioxidant and cell-protective properties, improves cognitive function in those with ADHD.37 Grape seed extract contains many of the same compounds (proanthocyanidins) that are known to improve memory and cognition with age,38,39 suggesting that it may have applications in treating ADHD. Melatonin Sleep disorders are common in children with ADHD, especially in those taking stimulant medications.40 Melatonin, an antioxidant hormone produced in the human pineal gland, has powerful effects on sleep-wake cycles, sleep variation, and many other biological rhythms. In combination with a good “sleep hygiene” program (careful attention to bedtime, place of sleep, and bedtime rituals), melatonin may help improve insomnia in children with ADHD who are using stimulant medications.41 Summary ADHD is a puzzling condition that has frustrated medical researchers for years. Dietary supplements clearly have a role in managing ADHD. They could reduce and may even eliminate a child’s need for pharmaceutical drugs. It is critical that a diagnosis of ADHD be made correctly. Physicians and experts in child nutrition and child development and behavior all have an important role to play in the integrative management of ADHD. Ongoing research in all of these areas is likely to provide additional insights into nutritional supplements that improve brain function and behavior. References 1. Kidd PM.

Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on January 2021. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common type of behavioral disorder, affecting approximately 3-10% of children and adolescents aged 18 and younger.1-3 Prevalence usually declines with age, but up to 65% of hyperactive children are still symptomatic as adults. ADHD’s frequency in adults is estimated to be 2-7% of the population.4 The ADHD male:female ratio ranges from 2:1 to 9:1, according to different studies.5 In the last few years, scientists have noted an increasing rate of ADHD among girls.6 ADHD is a complex psychiatric disorder characterized by limited attention span, impulsivity, and overactivity.7 The three types of ADHD are characterized as predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined.4 Hyperactivity usually subsides in adolescence, but inattention and impulsivity often increase with age. In short, ADHD can be a serious disability with long-term consequences. Despite the large number of ADHD studies, the precise causes of the disorder remain unknown. Genetic and environmental factors can play a significant role in ADHD’s development.8,9 Most studies on environmental factors have found an association with ADHD, but no clear evidence that these influences cause the disorder.10 Many questions remain regarding the best treatment practices for ADHD. Treatment usually includes parental education, appropriate school placement, and pharmaceutical agents. Psychostimulants are a general treatment option, and drugs such as antidepressants and alpha-adrenergic agonists can also be used. These medications, however, demonstrate limited effectiveness and may have undesirable side effects. Many children and adults with ADHD also experience other psychiatric conditions. Comorbidity (having two or more diagnoses at the same time) between ADHD and social anxiety disorder is not unusual, occurring in about 25% of cases.4,11 Social anxiety disorder is the third most common mental health disorder, affecting approximately 10 million Americans.12 Patients with social anxiety disorder usually fear social situations and experience serious emotional stress in circumstances such as being the center of attention, meeting with important people, and romantic relationships. Lack of normal self-esteem can lead to feelings of inadequacy, poor quality of life, and depression. To date, no specific cause of this condition has been found. Two types of treatment are available for social anxiety disorder: medications such as antidepressants and beta-blockers, and “talk therapy” (psychotherapy). Currently available therapies for both conditions are of limited effectiveness, and innovative therapies for these mental disorders are sorely needed. In this case report, we describe a young man with ADHD and social anxiety disorder. The patient was assessed using blood testing and was successfully treated using hormonorestoration therapy. Background A 24-year-old white male presented with a combination of ADHD and social anxiety disorder during his initial visit in December 2002. At the time, he complained of severe fatigue, very low energy level, “major” depression, severe anxiety, decreased appetite, poor libido, bad short-term memory, sleeping problems, frequent sinus infections, and sore throat. The patient said he lacked motivation and could not control his emotions. Any social situation usually sent his heart “racing,” increased sweating, and made his face red. He did not exercise due to his low energy level. The patient had been diagnosed with ADHD around the age of seven and with social anxiety disorder at the age of 14. He was taking the antidepressant Paxil® daily and also had been using the stimulant drug Ritalin® for several years. In the previous decade, he had used numerous antidepressants. His vital signs were as follows: height, 5’8”; weight, 178 pounds; body fat percentage, 23% (normal range: 14-20%); blood pressure, 110/74 mmHg; pulse, 60 beats/minute. Diagnosis and Treatment Our clinical experience suggested that his conditions and related clinical symptoms might be related to neuroendocrine perturbations. Initial blood testing yielded the following results: The patient’s levels of the basic hormones pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) were low, with a significantly diminished DHEA-S level. Hormone (Reference range) Patient’s result DHEA-S (280-640 ug/dL) 79 Pregnenolone (10-200 ng/dL) 56 Total testosterone (241-827 ng/dL) 678 Total cholesterol (<200 mg/dL) 195 We initiated a program focused on correcting hormone imbalances and related symptoms, with the following recommendations: pregnenolone: 100 mg in the morning DHEA: 100 mg in the morning 7-keto DHEA: 70 mg in the morning androstenedione: 50 mg, 30 minutes before exercise for two months Tribulus terrestris: two tablets chewed in the morning vitamin E: 800 IU in the morning Nutribiotic® MetaRest® (containing 3 mg of melatonin, 250 mg of kava root extract, and 10 mg of vitamin B6 per capsule): one capsule at bedtime zinc: 60 mg at bedtime Alacer CMA™ Calcium-Magnesium Ascorbate (containing 1860 mg of vitamin C as mineral ascorbates, 100 mg of calcium, 40 mg of magnesium, 10 mg of vitamin B6, and 72 mg of magnesium citrate per two tablets): two tablets at bedtime. After two months of treatment, the patient returned to the clinic with no medical complaints. His energy level was greatly improved, and he had started to exercise four or five days a week. He discontinued use of Paxil® during his first two weeks on the program. He said that his ADHD and social anxiety disorder were no longer a factor. Additionally, he experienced no problems with restlessness, inconsistent performance, inability to focus, or memory. We suggested that the patient discontinue use of androstenedione, Tribulus terrestris, MetaRest®, and CMA™, and decrease the daily dosages of DHEA to 50 mg, zinc to 30 mg, and vitamin E to 400 IU. At this time, we recommended Longevity Science® MagnaCalm (containing 420 mg of magnesium citrate per scoop): one-half scoop before bedtime. The patient requested that we design a similar therapeutic program for his girlfriend who was using oral contraceptives, noting that “she is crazy like I was.” One year later, the patient intermittently was using daily doses of 50 mg of pregnenolone and 25 mg of DHEA. He had experienced no reoccurrence of his previous disorders, was continuing to exercise, and was enjoying life with his girlfriend, who had discontinued use of oral contraceptives and had begun a similar program. Commentary Only limited objective diagnostic criteria and assessment instruments exist for most mental disorders, though physicians often perform blood tests to assess complete blood count and levels of thyroid hormones, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lead. Brain MRIs, electroencephalograms, and electrocardiograms are sometimes used as well. Unfortunately, these assessments are not always helpful in obtaining a diagnosis and preparing a treatment plan. Because the causes of ADHD and social anxiety disorder are not definitively known, achieving effective solutions can be challenging. The goal of all current ADHD management programs is to correct the most prominent symptoms that interfere with daily activities. Most ADHD medications such as Ritalin® have common, far-reaching, and adverse side effects such as fatigue, emotional instability, depression, high blood pressure, headaches, altered sex drive, impotence, insomnia, frequent infections, poor appetite, and constipation. Moreover, children who take such medications are at risk of poor physical development.13 Unfortunately, these psychoactive drugs have been prescribed in unprecedented numbers since the early 1990s.14,15 Sadly, many parents believe that these medications are all their children need. Several psychiatric conditions commonly accompany ADHD in adults and children. In this case report, our patient suffered from a long-time comorbidity of ADHD and social anxiety disorder. We believe that using specific blood tests to reveal critical hormone imbalances may provide a novel method by which physicians can evaluate psychiatric problems such as ADHD, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, suicidal ideations, and other behavioral disorders. These problems could be approached as imbalances of hormones, especially neuroactive steroid hormones such as pregnenolone, DHEA, and progesterone. Neurosteroids are very important for normal brain function because they affect several neurophysiological and behavioral processes.16 It is within the power of physicians, and particularly pediatricians, to change the outlook on a whole group of behavioral disorders and their current treatment protocols. Just as an endocrinologist assesses type I diabetes (insufficient production of insulin) and hypothyroid (the poor function of thyroid gland with low production of hormones) as conditions of hormone imbalance, physicians might also approach behavioral and psychiatric conditions as manifestations of hormone imbalances. Unfortunately, this has yet to occur. Deficiencies of insulin or thyroid hormones can be life threatening. If an individual suffers from an imbalance of hormones such as DHEA, pregnenolone, and testosterone, however, the patient will not die right away, but instead may experience a gradual decline in health from a collection of chronic illnesses. The patient might suffer throughout life from psychiatric disorders, allergies, infections, and various chronic diseases. In addition, evidence suggests that hormone imbalances may increase the risk of cancer, coronary heart disease, or suicide. Hormone imbalances may also adversely affect cognitive and immune function, while suppressing the reconstructive ability of different cells. When using blood testing to evaluate hormone levels, we must remember that all hormones are important, as they control and regulate different aspects of life. I believe we can use hormone levels to evaluate mental status, just as blood glucose level serves as a marker for diabetes or thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) serve as markers for thyroid conditions. An imbalance or deficiency of hormones serves as a warning signal that corrective action is necessary. The medical approach to correcting hormone imbalances should be similar, regardless of whether the hormone is insulin or pregnenolone, thyroid hormones or DHEA. When a patient has a deficiency of insulin, doctors restore the needed insulin; yet when a patient has diminished levels of DHEA, pregnenolone, or other hormones, doctors often recommend Ritalin®, Zoloft®, Prozac®, or similar drugs. Because the human body does not produce these drugs, it has no deficiency of them. Several observations led to our hypothesis that correcting hormone imbalances might alleviate behavioral and psychiatric conditions. Children with ADHD often demonstrate a general impairment of sympathetic nervous system activation.17 Because hormones help modulate the sympathetic nervous system, we speculated that restoring optimal hormone balance might help improve ADHD.18 Additionally, studies show significant correlations between clinical symptoms and low levels of pregnenolone and DHEA, further supporting our theory that behavioral disorders could be corrected using neuroactive steroids.16 In these cases, we always stress the importance of examining total cholesterol. Because cholesterol is a precursor, or building block, for many hormones, cholesterol deficiency may lead to diminished production of basic hormones. Many studies have clearly correlated low total cholesterol with mental illnesses.19-22 It is time to reevaluate the use of conventional pharmaceutical approaches to different behavioral disorders. Hormone tests may become unique biomarkers in assessing behavioral and psychiatric disorders in children, adolescents, and adults. Doctors, parents, and patients can often find safer solutions to these conditions using natural supplements. By employing these methods as a first step, many are able to avoid prescription drugs. Hormonorestoration is thus a possible treatment option for children and adults with psychiatric conditions that occur alone or in combination. Omega-3 fatty acids, ginkgo biloba, and valerian root may be additional therapeutic tools for such conditions. In this article, we described a possible new tool for assessing and treating behavioral and psychiatric disorders. The use of hormonorestoration and nutritional supplements provides a novel way to influence the body’s balance of neuroactive steroids, thus offering promise for the millions of Americans affected by conditions such as ADHD and social anxiety disorder.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), ADHD is a neuropsychiatric disorder that includes inattentiveness, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Upon reading this protocol you will acquire a basic understanding of ADHD. Several innovative and emerging ADHD management strategies and scientifically studied integrative interventions will be presented. The good news is that several integrative interventions have been shown to help maintain focus and attention. For example, supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B6 and magnesium, as well as undergoing neurofeedback therapy, have benefited those affected by ADHD in studies.

The good news is that several integrative interventions have been shown to help maintain focus and attention. For example, supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B6 and magnesium, as well as undergoing neurofeedback therapy, have benefited those affected by ADHD in studies. Causes and Risk Factors No single factor has been identified as a definitive cause of ADHD, instead it is more likely due to several variables: Genetics Environmental factors Brain injury Diet Sleep disorders, which may also be a cause of ADHD-like symptoms Signs and Symptoms ADHD is defined primarily by persistent impulsivity, hyperactivity, and inattention. Symptoms of impulsivity include: blurting out an answer before a question is finished difficulty waiting one’s turn interrupting or intruding on others during conversations Symptoms of hyperactivity include: fidgeting with hands or feet leaving one’s seat inappropriately, like during a meeting difficulty working quietly Symptoms of inattention include: making careless mistakes during work difficulty staying focused during work difficulty organizing tasks and activities Diagnosis There is no single diagnostic test for ADHD; instead, diagnosis is a process that rules out factors such as learning disabilities and anxiety, which may cause similar symptoms. Conventional Treatment The most widely used drugs to treat ADHD are brain stimulants, including methylphenidate (available in many forms, including Ritalin). Amphetamine-based drugs including Dexedr Novel and Emerging Strategies Neuropsychiatric EEG-Based Assessment Aid monitors brain waves to aid ADHD diagnosis. Dietary and Lifestyle Considerations A growing body of research indicates dietary changes can substantially improve ADHD symptoms: Avoid foods high in sugar as it may help limit reactive low blood sugar symptoms, which may mimic ADHD symptoms Eat a nutritious breakfast In one study on children and adolescents, neurofeedback was as effective as methylphenidate in treating attention and hyperactivity symptoms. Exercise may have a positive impact on ADHD symptoms in both adults and children. Integrative Interventions Omega-3 fatty acids: A UK-based study on school children found that omega-3 fatty acid insufficiency was very common and associated with ADHD-related symptoms. Phosphatidylserine: Phosphatidylserine supplementation in children diagnosed with ADHD resulted in significant improvement in ADHD symptoms including inattention, impulsivity, and short-term memory. Acetyl L-carnitine: In a randomized double-blind trial, acetyl L-carnitine had a beneficial effect on hyperactivity and social behavior in individuals with ADHD. Vitamin B6 and magnesium: A study on children with ADHD found that supplementation with magnesium and vitamin B6 led to improvements in hyperactivity and school attention. Zinc: Children with ADHD treated with Ritalin for six weeks received better behavioral ratings from teachers and parents when they also took zinc sulfate compared with children who received Ritalin and a placebo. 2 Introduction The diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is fraught with controversy involving passionate debate between healthcare professionals, policy makers, educators, and parents. Using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) diagnostic criteria, ADHD is characterized as a neuropsychiatric disorder that includes inattentiveness, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Based upon DSM diagnostic criteria, estimates suggest that anywhere from 5–10% of school-aged children may have ADHD; however, adults can also exhibit signs and symptoms consistent with DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (Scahill 2000). Changes introduced in DSM-5 include broadening the definition of ADHD by including more examples of diagnostic behaviors and increasing the maximum age of symptom onset from 7 to 12 years, leading to concerns that normal developmental processes such as pubertal restlessness and distractibility could be misdiagnosed as ADHD. In addition, diagnostic criteria for adults with ADHD are present for the first time (Thomas 2013). These along with other changes incorporated into DSM-5 are predicted to increase the prevalence of ADHD in the years to come, mostly in adults and adolescents, but possibly also in children (Dalsgaard 2013). ADHD is a complex and controversial condition that likely involves both biological and environmental factors (De La Fuente 2013). Genetics are thought to play an important role as children born to parents with ADHD have an increased risk of developing the condition (Franke 2012; Thapar 2013). There is also some evidence that brain structure and/or function is perturbed in ADHD (Hale 2000; Schneider 2006; Emond 2009; Kasparek 2013; del Campo 2013). For instance, alterations in brain networks that govern attention and emotion have been observed in patients with ADHD (De La Fuente 2013; Konrad 2010; Edel 2010; Gow, Sumich 2013). Up to 60% of school-age children with ADHD may continue to experience symptoms into adulthood (Burbach 2010; O'Neill 2013; Sims 2012; Pearson 2012; Parker 2013; Akinbami 2011). Mainstream medicine relies heavily upon powerful stimulant drugs from the amphetamine drug class (eg, Adderall®) and methylphenidate (eg, Ritalin®) to treat ADHD symptoms. This is not ideal for several reasons, including the fact that methylphenidate may induce lipid damage in certain brain regions (Schmitz, Scherer, Machado 2012; Comim 2013) and may cause abnormalities in the developing brain (Urban 2013). Stimulant ADHD drugs may cause other side effects as well, such as growth suppression, sleep problems, loss of appetite, and increased blood pressure and heart rate (Parker 2013). The good news is that several integrative interventions have been evaluated and show promise in helping maintain focus and attention. For example, supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and magnesium as well as undergoing neurofeedback therapy have been shown to offer considerable benefit to those affected by ADHD (Hariprasad 2013; Rutledge 2012; Arns 2009; Arnold 2013; Mousain-Bosc 2006). Upon reading this protocol you will acquire a basic understanding of ADHD. You will also learn how conventional medications work to treat ADHD and about their troublesome side effects. In addition, several novel and emerging ADHD management strategies and scientifically-studied integrative interventions will be presented. 3 Background The concept of treating aberrant childhood behavior as a medical disorder dates as far back as the 1700s and has always been fraught with controversy regarding what constitutes a “disease” as opposed to typical, albeit difficult, childhood behavior (Taylor 2011). The diagnosis and treatment of ADHD, especially among children, continues to remain a hotly debated topic today as many aspects of the condition are subjective and different systems to classify the disease are often used by physicians from different countries (Parens 2009). Technological advances in neuroimaging techniques have allowed scientists to observe the brains of children diagnosed with ADHD and compare them to those of adolescents without the condition. Several studies have identified subtle differences in brain structure or function among ADHD children. For example, a study employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) showed that the brain networks in children with ADHD activate in different patterns compared to healthy children’s brains (Massat 2012). Other studies suggest that brains of ADHD children display variations in the volume or density of various brain regions compared with non-ADHD kids (De La Fuente 2013; Pastura 2011; Tomasi 2012). Evidence suggests that several aspects of the variation in brain function observed in ADHD are attenuated by psychostimulant drugs such as methylphenidate. This has led some researchers to speculate that reversion of brain network structure and activity to normal may underlie the therapeutic benefits of psychostimulant drugs (Spencer 2013; Kasparek 2013). 4 Causes and Risk Factors No single factor has been identified as a definitive cause of ADHD. Instead, most scientists believe that several variables influence ADHD risk. For example, genetics, exposure to stressors during pregnancy or infancy, early social interactions, and environmental toxins all appear to affect ADHD risk (Thapar 2013). Genetics A considerable portion of ADHD cases are thought to be attributable to genetics and heritability (Neale 2010). A number of specific genetic variations are associated with ADHD. These are predominantly related to the regulation of dopamine (ie, a chemical messenger used by brain cells) (Faraone 2006; Thapar 2013; Franke 2012). The importance of dopamine in ADHD is highlighted by the fact that methylphenidate is thought to treat ADHD symptoms in part by increasing dopamine signaling in the brain (Volkow 2005). Environmental Factors Environmental toxins such as polychlorinated biphenyls, some pesticides, and lead have been linked to ADHD development, but no studies have proven that they directly cause the condition (Thapar 2013).Other external factors, such as negative child-parent interactions and poor or lacking early social contact, have been found to have a contributory effect in ADHD onset (McLaughlin 2010; Thapar 2013). Some variables in utero (in the womb) are seen as risk factors, but not causative links to ADHD. These include maternal smoking during pregnancy, premature birth and/or low birth weight, and/or maternal stress (Thapar 2013). Brain Injuries Traumatic brain injury has been linked to behaviors similar to those observed in ADHD (Eme 2012; NIH 2013a). Approximately 20–50% of children who suffer a traumatic brain injury develop a form of clinically relevant attention disorder termed secondary ADHD (Senior 2013; Ornstein 2013; Sinopoli 2011). Diet There is some evidence that deficiencies in certain nutrients, such as zinc, magnesium, and polyunsaturated fatty acids may be linked to ADHD (Thapar 2013). As will be discussed later in this protocol, studies have found evidence for insufficiency or imbalance of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in people with ADHD (Colter 2008). Zinc and magnesium intake have also been found to be reduced in those with ADHD (Dura Trave 2013). Additionally, there is some evidence that high levels of ingested food additives such as artificial coloring (eg, tartrazine (E103), quinolone yellow (E104), sunset yellow (E110), carmoisine (E122), ponceau 4R (E124) and allura red (E129)) correlate with increased activity in children and therefore may exacerbate this symptom in those with ADHD (Stevens 2013). Excessive sugar intake has often been linked to ADHD as well, although the majority of research has largely debunked this as unsubstantiated; definitive evidence for a causal relationship is currently lacking (Johnson 2011). Nevertheless, it is generally advisable to limit sugar intake, as high sugar consumption may contribute to numerous other health detriments. Sleep Disorders and ADHD Several lines of evidence suggest a relationship between ADHD and sleep disorders such as sleep apnea. It has been reported that up to 95% of obstructive sleep apnea sufferers experience attentional deficits, and obstructive sleep apnea has been observed in up to 30% of individuals with ADHD. Moreover, successfully treating obstructive sleep apnea appears to relieve ADHD symptoms in some individuals (Youssef 2011). Overall, sleep disorders have been observed in up to 30% of children and 80% of adults with ADHD (Yoon 2012). It is important for physicians to realize that symptoms of sleep disorders such as sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome can resemble those of ADHD in both children and adults. Otherwise, a person may be misdiagnosed with ADHD when their symptoms are actually the consequence of a sleep disorder (Philipsen 2006; Owens 2005). Despite intensive study and an active body of research, it is not entirely clear whether sleep disorders directly cause ADHD or vise-versa, or if the conditions have a high rate of concurrence yet remain distinct entities (Stein 2012; Yoon 2012). Sleep and ADHD must also be contemporaneously considered since stimulant medications like methylphenidate, which are used to treat ADHD, may contribute to impaired sleep patterns. In a study on 93 children with ADHD, methylphenidate treatment was shown to considerably delay bedtimes and lead to reduced total sleep duration (Lee 2012). On the other hand, some studies have found that methylphenidate treatment does not disrupt sleep habits and may lead to better sleep quality in certain populations (Tomas Vila 2010; Faraone 2009). Since the impact of methylphenidate on sleep patterns appears not to be uniform in all individuals, a reasonable approach is to carefully monitor sleep habits following treatment initiation. If signs of diminished sleep duration or quality emerge, consult with a healthcare provider about dose-adjustment or pursuing a different treatment option. 5 Signs and Symptoms ADHD is defined primarily by persistent symptoms of impulsivity, hyperactivity, and inattention that can severely affect a person’s quality of life. Some people present mostly with symptoms related to inattention, others present mostly symptoms related to hyperactivity and impulsivity, while others have all three types of symptoms in combination (A.D.A.M. 2013). Symptoms of inattention include (A.D.A.M 2013): making careless mistakes during school work difficulty staying focused during work or play difficulty in paying attention/listening when spoken to difficulty organizing tasks and activities often losing toys, books, or tools used for activities being easily distracted forgetfulness during daily activities and tasks Symptoms of hyperactivity include (A.D.A.M. 2013): fidgeting with hands or feet leaving one’s seat when it is expected to remain seated running/climbing in inappropriate situations difficulty working/playing quietly often being ""on the go"" talking excessively Symptoms of impulsiveness include (A.D.A.M. 2013): blurting out an answer before a question is finished difficulty awaiting one’s turn interrupting or intruding on others during conversations/play Many children with ADHD struggle academically and in social situations. Also, symptoms are frequently accompanied by other problems, including depression, anxiety, and substance abuse (Hodgkins 2013; Wilens 2004). 6 Diagnosis There is no single diagnostic test for ADHD; instead, diagnosis is a stepwise process that also has to take into consideration several other conditions, such as anxiety, learning disabilities, and anxiety, which may cause similar symptoms (CDC 2013a). The first national survey that asked parents about ADHD was completed in 1997. Since then, there has been an increase in the number of parentally-reported ADHD diagnoses as well as in prescribing rates. However, it is difficult to tell whether this represents an increase in the number of children diagnosed or an increased number of children who developed this condition (Thomas 2013; CDC 2013a). It is thought that some important contributors to the increasing rate of diagnosis are the lack of consistent criteria to objectively assess the severity of symptoms and the shift observed over the years in ADHD diagnostic criteria (Thomas 2013). Diagnostic criteria describe three types of ADHD. Previously, the predominantly inattentive type included individuals with six or more symptoms of inattention and less than six symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsivity. The predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type included individuals with six or more symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity and less than six symptoms of inattention. The combined type included individuals with symptoms across both these dimensions (Willcutt 2012). One of the changes incorporated in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (adopted in 2013) is that for people over 17, five instead of six symptoms are sufficient for diagnosis (Prosser 2013; Thomas 2013). 7 Conventional Treatment The traditional treatment strategy for ADHD is two-pronged, involving both medication and psychological support (Antshel 2011). Stimulants The most widely used drugs to treat ADHD are brain stimulants, of which there are several available (Chavez 2009).  Although these drugs have long been used in clinical medicine, their mechanisms of action have only recently started to be better understood. These drugs change the levels and signaling by neurotransmitters (eg, norepinephrine and dopamine) in the brain (Berridge 2011). Methylphenidate. Methylphenidate is the most common stimulant medication used to treat ADHD. Many different forms of methylphenidate are available, including Ritalin®, Methylin®, Metadate®, Concerta®, and Daytrana®, which vary in dosage, delivery system (capsule, tablet, or patch), and rate of drug delivery. Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin®) consists of a specific structural form of methylphenidate thought to be better absorbed and more chemically active in the brain (Greydanus 2009; Liu 2006). Daytrana®, the methylphenidate patch first released in the United States in 2006, is a relatively new development in ADHD treatment. It releases the drug through the skin, giving it the advantage of once-daily administration, flexibility in its removal, and suitability for children who cannot swallow pills; however, it can cause skin reactions where applied (Elia 2011). Methylphenidate Drugs Induce Oxidative Stress Aside from known side effects such as heart problems and growth suppression, methylphenidate also causes oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is the metabolic process by which reactive molecules damage cells and tissues. Oxidative stress is implicated as a contributing factor in several diseases and the aging process (Wang 2013; Kim 2013). Animal studies have shown that methylphenidate treatment leads to an increase in the production of tissue-damaging reactive oxygen species in certain brain regions (Schmitz, Scherer, Machado 2012). Alarmingly, one animal experiment showed that brains of young animals were especially prone to the increased oxidative stress caused by methylphenidate, suggesting children may be more susceptible to this phenomenon than adults (Martins 2006). Ironically, although methylphenidate is used as a treatment for ADHD, some evidence suggests that oxidative stress actually contributes to the development and progression of several psychiatric disorders, including ADHD (Ceylan 2012; Ng 2008; Kawatani 2011). This is concerning, especially considering that evidence shows methylphenidate exposure during development likely has lasting neurological consequences that may impact brain health in later life. Conventional physicians are often quick to prescribe methylphenidate to children with ADHD despite a lack of thorough understanding of its long-term developmental effects (Urban 2013). Amphetamines. Amphetamine drugs including dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine®) and Adderall® (a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) are also popular, and some people with ADHD may respond better to these alternatives (Chavez 2009). Another amphetamine, lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse®), is a relatively recent addition to the arsenal of stimulant drugs for ADHD. It was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ADHD in children in 2007 and is currently also approved for adolescents and adults. Unlike other stimulants prescribed for ADHD, lisdexamfetamine is a ""prodrug,"" an inactive precursor converted to the active form of the drug after ingestion. This property is claimed to give the drug a smoother effect throughout the day with fewer rebound symptoms. It may also help prevent addiction or abuse (Madaan 2013). Side Effects of Stimulant ADHD Medications Up to 30% of children with ADHD either do not respond to stimulants or cannot tolerate their side effects (CDC 2013b; Akhondzadeh 2003). The side effects of stimulant use can range from mild to severe. Adverse effects include headache, insomnia, decreased appetite, rapid heart rate, abdominal pain and growth suppression (long-term use) (Medscape 2013; ePOCRATES 2013). They should not be used in people with hypertension, heart or vascular disease, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, psychosis, or those taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which are sometimes prescribed for depression. Because of their potential for abuse and effects on addiction-related pathways in the brain (through dopamine), they are also not suitable for people with substance abuse disorders. Stimulants can worsen tics in people with Tourette’s syndrome (three-fourths of whom also have ADHD), and some of them induce tics in people who did not have them previously. They can also induce mania or psychosis in people who have not previously shown signs of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia (Greydanus 2009). In rare cases, sudden death has been reported after the use of methylphenidate and amphetamines. Especially before taking stimulants, individuals should be screened for a history of cardiovascular risks. In light of incidents of sudden death after taking ADHD medication, in 2008 the American Heart Association went so far as to recommend that all children have an electrocardiogram to rule out any undetected developmental defects to the heart before beginning stimulant medication for ADHD (Perrin 2008). Non-Stimulant Medications Non-stimulant ADHD medications are an effective alternative for some individuals. There are only a few non-stimulant ADHD drugs approved by the FDA. The first is atomoxetine (Strattera®), which inhibits reuptake of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Others include clonidine (Catapres®, Kapvay®) and guanfacine (Tenex®, Intuniv®), which counter the effects of the sympathetic nervous system (Cruz 2010; Antshel 2011; Christman 2004). Use of atomoxetine avoids some of the complications associated with stimulants, notably tics and sleep disturbances, but there is an increased risk of suicidal thinking in children and adolescents given the drug, so people in these age groups should be carefully monitored for the first few months after beginning treatment or changing dosage (Purper-Ouakil 2005; FDA 2005). Antidepressants. Although not FDA-approved for the treatment of ADHD, antidepressants, including venlafaxine (Effexor®) and the tricyclic antidepressant bupropion (Wellbutrin®), have also shown some promise in treating ADHD (Greydanus 2009; NIH 2013b). In one double-blind randomized trial, bupropion was found to be comparable in effect to methylphenidate (Jafarinia 2012). Other agents. Modafinil (Provigil®), a wakefulness- and cognition-promoting drug, has also been used to treat ADHD and has shown promise in clinical trials on both children and adults with ADHD (Greydanus 2009; Kumar 2008). It is not FDA-approved for ADHD treatment as of the time of this writing (Spiller 2013). 8 Novel and Emerging Strategies Monitoring Brain Waves to Aid ADHD Diagnosis In July of 2013, the FDA approved the use of a new brain-wave-monitoring system to assist physicians in diagnosing ADHD in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17. The system is called the Neuropsychiatric EEG-Based Assessment Aid (NEBA). The non-invasive test takes about 15 to 20 minutes and involves placement of sensors on the scalp of the individual to monitor their brainwaves. Individuals with ADHD typically have a significantly higher theta/beta brainwave ratio, and the NEBA system can identify this phenomenon (Brauser 2013; FDA 2013). However, not all physicians agree on the value of this new test. Some feel it could add value and improve ADHD diagnosis accuracy and possibly reduce unnecessary referrals, but others believe that current standards for ADHD diagnosis are sufficient. More evidence is needed before the value of the NEBA system can be stated unequivocally (Brauser 2013). Dasotraline Dasotraline, a novel compound being investigated for use in patients with ADHD, is believed to strongly inhibit the reuptake of both dopamine and norepinephrine, as well as weakly inhibit serotonin reuptake. Dasotraline is distinguished from stimulants used to treat ADHD by its slow absorption and long elimination time. Dasotraline is meant to be taken once per day and a steady blood concentration is achieved after 10‒14 days of daily use. These characteristics suggest dasotraline may have a sustained effect over 24 hours and likely has a low risk of being abused as a stimulant (Koblan 2015; Hopkins 2016; Sunovion 2014). In a randomized controlled trial, 341 adults with ADHD received either 4 mg or 8 mg of dasotraline or placebo daily for four weeks. Those in the 8 mg group had significant improvement in an ADHD rating scale compared with placebo, while a trend towards improvement was observed in the 4 mg group. Mild-to-moderate side effects were frequent with both doses, with a greater prevalence in the high-dose group. The most common side effects were insomnia, decreased appetite, dry mouth, anxiety, and nausea. The most common severe side effects were insomnia, anxiety, and panic attack, all of which were more common in the higher dosage group. In a randomized controlled trial of 48 individuals who had used cocaine and other recreational stimulants, dasotraline showed a low potential for abuse compared with methylphenidate (Koblan 2016; Sunovion 2014). 9 Dietary and Lifestyle Considerations Dietary Considerations A growing body of research indicates that dietary changes can substantially improve ADHD symptoms, either alone or as a complement to medical therapies (Millichap 2012). Some children have a high sensitivity to some food additives and preservatives, particularly food colorings. A 2007 trial from Southampton University called into question the safety of certain food dyes. The randomized controlled trial assessed the effects of certain food colorings (ie, tartrazine (E103), quinolone yellow (E104), sunset yellow (E110), carmoisine (E122), ponceau 4R (E124) and allura red (E129)) on 153 three-year-old and 144 eight-to-nine-year-old children. The researchers found these artificial colorings resulted in increased hyperactivity in this population when added to their diet. Although artificial food coloring has not been established as a primary causative factor for ADHD, a subgroup of children have shown significant improvement when provided food lacking these additives. Similarly, they developed symptoms reminiscent of ADHD when exposed to artificial food coloring. Children with sensitivity to food coloring are often also sensitive to foods such as milk, eggs, wheat, and soy (Stevens 2011). Although the majority of research does not support a causative role for sugar intake and ADHD, many parents anecdotally report that foods high in sugar can make their child’s ADHD hyperactivity symptoms more pronounced. However, children are more vulnerable to the effects of reactive hypoglycemia (ie, low blood sugar following the rise in blood sugar from a high carbohydrate meal) on cognitive function. Avoiding foods high in sugar may help limit reactive hypoglycemia symptoms, which may mimic some aspects of ADHD symptoms, in sensitive children (Millichap 2012). Studies indicate that children who eat a balanced breakfast containing proteins, vitamins, and minerals, such as found in whole grains, have less deterioration in attention levels during morning hours at school (Arnold 2013). Lifestyle Considerations Neurofeedback. Neurofeedback is a technique introduced in the 1960s that helps people regulate their own mental states by viewing an EEG (electroencephalogram) recording of their brain activity in real time. It utilizes sensors placed on the scalp that detect brainwaves and then graphs them on a computer screen that the test subject can visualize. This allows the subject to recognize ways of thinking that favorably alter their neurological function and can help them gain better control over their brain activity (Moriyama 2012). This therapy aims to change the threshold that triggers brain activity in the cortex, which appears to be impaired in ADHD. The great majority of studies have been conducted on school-age boys, so it is still unclear whether its results are as promising in adults, younger children, and girls. Nevertheless, the majority of clinical studies conducted to date have reported promising, long-lasting results (Moriyama 2012). For example, in one study on children and adolescents aged 6–18 years, neurofeedback was as effective as methylphenidate in treating attentional and hyperactivity symptoms (Duric 2012). A comprehensive review of several studies examining the efficacy of neurofeedback for ADHD management concluded that it confers robust benefits for inattention and impulsivity and modest benefits for hyperactivity (Arns 2009). Cognitive behavioral therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) uses behavioral skill training and interventions that target dysfunctional patterns of thought to improve functional performance (Knouse 2010). Many cognitive training programs for ADHD are commercially available, and the practice is growing in popularity. This method seems to be particularly effective during adolescence and has the advantage that it can be adapted to technologies like cell phones and tablets and is designed to be engaging to users (Rutledge 2012). For children with ADHD, training of parents and educators can also be very effective at improving symptoms (Anastopoulos 1993). In a 2013 analysis of published studies on interventions for preschoolers with disruptive behavior including ADHD, parent behavior training had more evidence of effectiveness than methylphenidate and combined home/school interventions, with consistently good results and no adverse effects (Charach 2013). One trial involving canine assistance in addition to CBT achieved greater reduction of ADHD symptoms compared to cognitive therapy alone (Schuck 2013). A program for children aged 4 to 5, which involved games designed to reduce impulsivity, inattention, and improve memory achieved significant improvements in ADHD symptoms in a pilot study of 29 children. The positive effects were still present three months after treatment (Halperin 2012). Physical activity. Exercise may have a positive impact on ADHD symptoms in both adults and children (Berwid 2012). Thirty adults with ADHD were enrolled in a study comparing frequent aerobic exercise with infrequent activity. The 'exercise' group showed a significant decrease in impulsive symptoms and anxiety (Abramovitch 2013). Another study showed that cognitive symptoms in children with ADHD were improved after just twenty minutes of moderate exercise (Pontifex 2013). Yoga may also be helpful in reducing ADHD symptoms (Jensen 2004). A small-scale study in nine children demonstrated a significant improvement in ADHD symptoms as a result of learning and practicing yoga (Hariprasad 2013). ​ 10 Integrative Interventions Fatty Acids An analysis of several published studies of “non-pharmacological” (ie, dietary and psychological) interventions for ADHD found that supplementation with free fatty acids and exclusion of artificial food coloring from the diet had statistically significant effects on reducing ADHD symptoms (Sonuga-Barke 2013). Considering that dopamine-producing nerve endings contain up to 80% omega-3 fatty acids (Rucklidge 2009), these molecules appear to have a role in the central nervous system and its functions. Children with ADHD may have lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids in their blood (Colter 2008). While the typical Western diet often contains excessive levels of certain omega-6 fatty acids, it is lacking in omega-3 fats, which include eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (Patterson 2012; Carlson 2013). In children, the severity of ADHD symptoms are linked to lower levels of omega-3 and higher levels of omega-6 fatty acids. Hyperactivity and inattention in general are also linked to omega-3 deficiency, thus indicating that this may be a risk factor for ADHD (Arnold 2013). A UK-based study on 493 school children aged 7-9 years found that omega-3 fatty acid insufficiency was very common and associated with ADHD-related symptoms such as oppositional behavior and emotional instability (Montgomery 2013). Research from another group found that low blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids correlated with callous-unemotional behavior, antisocial traits, and impaired emotional processing (Gow, Sumich 2013; Gow, Vallee-Tourangeau 2013). Swedish scientists studied the effects of combined omega-3 (558 mg EPA, 174 mg DHA daily) and the beneficial omega-6 fatty acid gamma linolenic acid (GLA) (60 mg daily) supplementation in 75 children and adolescents with ADHD over a 6-month period. They found that after 6 months, nearly half of subjects responded to omega-3/6 treatment with a reduction in ADHD symptoms (Johnson 2009). In a subsequent analysis of these study data, the same researchers found that subjects with at least a 25% reduction in symptoms exhibited a significantly greater decrease in the ratio of omega-6’s to omega-3’s in their blood at 3 and 6 months (Johnson 2012). A comprehensive review conducted by researchers at Yale University examined evidence from 10 trials involving 699 children with ADHD. It was found that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids modestly improved ADHD symptoms among study participants. In their concluding remarks, the researchers noted “…it may be reasonable to use omega-3 fatty supplementation to augment traditional pharmacologic interventions…” (Bloch 2011). Blood fatty acid levels can be measured with blood tests, and people taking fatty acid supplements can have repeat blood tests to measure their effect. Phosphatidylserine Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a major component of cell membranes and is considered one of the most important brain nutrients. PS has a variety of functions within the brain including supporting cell membrane fluidity and beneficially influencing neurotransmitter systems (eg, acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin). Several clinical trials have examined the role of PS on improving ADHD symptoms (Hirayama 2013). In a 2013 randomized controlled trial, 36 children diagnosed with ADHD were given either 200 mg per day of PS or placebo for 2 months. PS supplementation resulted in significant improvement in ADHD symptoms including inattention, impulsivity, and short-term memory. No adverse effects were reported and the supplement was well tolerated (Hirayama 2013). Another randomized controlled trial of 15 weeks duration studied the effects of PS combined with omega-3 fatty acids. In this study, 200 ADHD children were given either 300 mg of PS plus 120 mg EPA and DHA or placebo. The treatment resulted in significant improvement in ADHD symptoms. A subgroup analysis revealed this treatment may be especially effective in ADHD children with more pronounced hyperactive and impulsive behavior (Manor 2012). Acetyl-L-carnitine Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) is a natural derivative of L-carnitine. It serves a key role in the metabolism of fatty acids and cellular energy production (Torrioli 2008). Evidence from both animal and human studies suggests it may help alleviate ADHD symptoms. In an animal model of ADHD, long-term administration of ALC to rats consistently decreased impulsivity. This study also found that impulsive animals had altered levels of certain neurotransmitter metabolites, and ALC helped improve this imbalance (Adriani 2004). In a placebo-controlled trial on 112 subjects, ALC was found to improve symptoms in children with the inattentive ADHD subtype (Arnold 2007). In a separate randomized, double-blind trial, ALC was found to have a beneficial effect on hyperactivity and social behavior in 51 subjects with ADHD (Torrioli 2008). Vitamins and Minerals Vitamin B6 and magnesium. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is involved in the production of serotonin, and B6 supplementation increases serotonin levels and may improve hyperactivity in ADHD (Pellow 2011). In a nutritional survey comparing 100 people with ADHD to 150 healthy individuals, vitamin B6 intake levels were significantly lower in those with ADHD (Dura Trave 2013). An 8-week study on 40 children with ADHD found that supplementation with magnesium and vitamin B6 led to improvements in hyperactivity and school attention. Interestingly, when the treatment regimen was discontinued, the children’s symptoms reappeared in a few weeks (Mousain-Bosc 2006). A similar regimen of vitamin B6 and magnesium therapy improved hyperexcitability symptoms in a previous study by the same researchers. In this study, the magnesium-B6 combination was given to 52 hyperexcitable children for 6 months, and symptoms such as physical aggressiveness and attention in school improved in all subjects during treatment (Mousain-Bosc 2004). Studies have shown that magnesium deficiency is common among individuals with ADHD (Ghanizadeh 2013; Kozielec 1997). In a placebo-controlled trial, 200 mg magnesium per day for six months showed a significant decrease of hyperactivity in 7-12 year old children with ADHD (Starobrat-Hermelin 1997). Zinc and iron. Zinc and iron are both involved in dopamine production, so deficiencies in these minerals could have effects on dopamine neurotransmission in ADHD (Patrick 2007). Children with ADHD treated with Ritalin® for six weeks received better behavioral ratings from teachers and parents when they also took zinc sulfate (55 mg/day) compared to children who received Ritalin® and a placebo (Akhondzadeh 2004). Iron deficiency is present in a significant percentage of children with ADHD, and the severity of the iron deficiency is related to the severity of symptoms (Konofal 2004). Children who have ADHD in conjunction with sleep disorders such as restless leg syndrome have also been observed to have low iron levels (Cortese, Angriman 2012). A randomized, placebo-controlled study in 23 subjects aged 5–8 years showed that 80 mg iron daily for twelve weeks resulted in a significant decrease in symptoms (Konofal 2008). Another trial with fourteen subjects (7–11 years old) showed that 5mg/kg iron per day for 30 days significantly reduced parent ratings of ADHD symptoms (Sever 1997).  Higher doses of iron (such as those used in these trials) should only be used under medical supervision for iron deficiency. Plant-Based Interventions Ginkgo biloba and ginseng. Among plant-based supplements tested for ADHD, a combination of ginseng extract and Ginkgo biloba improved a range of symptoms from social problems to impulsivity (Lyon 2001). Ginkgo alone was shown to be effective in another trial. In this study, ginkgo (80-120 mg daily in 25 children with ADHD for 6 weeks) produced a significant improvement in subjective teacher and parent ratings; however, it did not outperform methylphenidate (20-30 mg daily under the same parameters) (Salehi 2010). In another trial, eighteen children (6–14 years old) received a 1000 mg dose of Korean red ginseng twice daily. At the end of the eight-week trial, a significant reduction in attentional symptoms and level of anxiety was observed (Lee 2011). Pycnogenol. Pycnogenol is an extract from the French maritime pine, Pinus pinaster. It is often used in ADHD for its antioxidant and vasodilatory properties (ie, it may increase cerebral blood flow, a measure of brain activity, to affected regions). A double-blind, randomized trial on 61 children receiving 1 mg/kg Pycnogenol or placebo per day for 4 weeks showed a significant decrease in hyperactivity, improvement in attention, and increase in visual and motor coordination in the Pycnogenol group (Trebaticka 2006). Another double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial showed that Pycnogenol decreased hyperactivity and oxidative stress in children with ADHD (Dvorakova 2007). Study: Multinutrient Formula as Effective as Methylphenidate for ADHD Management The multifactorial origins of ADHD suggest that an intervention targeting multiple specific underlying contributing factors might be beneficial. To test this hypothesis, researchers at McLean hospital in Massachusetts divided 20 children with ADHD into 2 groups. One group of 10 children received 5–15 mg of Ritalin® 2-3 times daily and the other received a comprehensive multi-nutrient formula designed to target several factors that possibly play a role in ADHD development (Harding 2003). The multi-nutrient formula used in this study included gastrointestinal support (eg, lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidus), amino acids (eg, tyrosine, histidine, glutamine, glycine, methionine and cysteine), essential fatty acids and phospholipids (eg, EPA, DHA, and phosphatidylcholine), and vitamins and minerals. A standardized assessment of visual and auditory attention was administered to the children at the beginning of the study to quantify their ADHD symptoms. Then, the children took either Ritalin® or the multi-nutrient formula for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4-week period, the researcher administered the same ADHD symptom assessment again. Impressively, ADHD symptoms among children who took the multi-nutrient formula improved just as much as among those who received Ritalin®. Upon concluding their study, the researchers noted “Improvements … were … found to be significant and essentially identical in both groups…” Disclaimer and Safety Information This information (and any accompanying material) is not intended to replace the attention or advice of a physician or other qualified health care professional.
