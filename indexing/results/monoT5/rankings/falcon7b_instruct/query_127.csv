Manufacturers of computer glasses claim that too much exposure to blue light can lead to dry eyes, blurred vision, eye fatigue, headache and other symptoms of digital eyestrain. While it's true that hours spent staring at your screens can cause all those problems, the blue light isn't to blame, says Anne L. Coleman, M.D., president of the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and professor of ophthalmology at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""The literature shows there is no evidence of any harm from blue light to the eyes,” Coleman says, “and there's no evidence that shows blue-blocking lenses or filters make any difference at all."" Indeed, a 2019 study published in found that blue-blocking filters were no more effective in reducing digital eyestrain than neutral light filters that don't block out blue light. So what is to blame for your tired, bleary eyes? Blinking. Or more specifically, blinking when you're staring at your screens, Coleman says. ""When you're at the computer, you're focusing, and research shows that your blinking frequency decreases,” she says. “Under normal circumstances, we blink about 15 times a minute, but we blink half of that to one-third of that amount when using digital devices. That's hard on your eyes.” So instead of buying a special you don't need, follow these steps: You can avoid digital eyestrain by simply giving your eyes a break at regular intervals, Coleman says. “In ophthalmology, we have a rule for computer time that every 20 minutes you should look at something about 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Now it can be hard to remember to do that, but even if you give your eyes a break once or twice an hour, it can really help,” she says. As we get older, our tear production declines and increases our risk for . Blinking less frequently while on the computer exacerbates the problem, says Timothy G.

You can avoid this by using to lubricate your eyes.” If you find yourself needing to use drops more than four times a day, the AAO recommends buying preservative-free drops, as many people find the preservatives can irritate their eyes. Another underlying cause of computer-related eyestrain is that your eyes are working hard to focus on words or images at a somewhat odd distance: A is farther away than you'd hold a book and closer than you'd be from your TV. “You can buy computer glasses for the exact distance you need,” Murray says. “So if you sit 21.5 inches from your screen, you can get glasses that are focused exactly at that distance. But I haven't really found that helpful for my patients."" The problem with that approach is most people are using laptops, tablets and/or auxiliary monitors, so the distances from their screens vary. The easiest solution in such cases is to simply increase the font size to a comfortable reading size on all of your screens, Coleman says. “That way you're not fiddling with glasses every time you want to see what you're working on."" Boosting the contrast on your monitors also can take the strain off your eyes, Coleman says. “More contrast is always good, especially for older adults.

Google Glass Lead: How Wearing Tech on Our Bodies Actually Helps It Get of Our Way Each time computing has become more mobile, faster to access, and more interactive, there’s been a revolution in new services and ecosystems. This time, by bringing the technology closer to us, it will, in effect, get more out of the way. That’s the true promise of wearables … and it may finally be here for everyone. To revist this article, visit My Profile, then . To revist this article, visit My Profile, then . rallying cries for Google Glass is to make technology that’s there when you need it, gone when you don't. It is intended to help people get on with their lives, without focusing on the technology. , in general, play supporting roles in what the user is doing—as opposed to the computer use being the primary focus itself. Vannevar Bush, one of the earliest computing pioneers, understood this idea and described wearable computers and cameras in the 1945 magazine version of his famous essay “As We May Think.” Unfortunately, only early mainframes existed then, and mainframes require that we bring to the computer. Slowly, though, the technology came : from computers on our desktops to laptops to mobile phones. Bringing technology and computing closer to the body can actually allow technology to get further out of the way. While these technologies lowered the barrier to communicating and accessing information, they created other barriers. We are now often greeted in meetings with a of screens that get in the way of face-to-face communication. Can we instead make devices that encourage in-person, face-to-face communication—while still delivering the data people need, only when they need it? I’ve been making and using wearable computers in my daily life since 1993 and have been a technical lead and manager on Google Glass since its first year in 2010. It may seem like a paradox, but I argue that bringing technology and computing to the body can actually improve communication and attention—allowing technology to get out of the way. All wearable computing designs make trade-offs between battery life and weight, size and fashion, simplicity of use and type of task supported. Glass is different both in its significantly different engineering choices and its interactions that exploit wearable computing's main advantages (as opposed to replicating the interfaces of the PC or smartphone). Wearable computers reduce the time between a user's intentions to do a task and her first action to perform it; this reduction in time between intention and action is one of the main advantages. Wearable computers can also be very social devices in the interactions they enable and the contexts in which they are used. (For example, Glass is designed to allow easy sharing of the user's experiences through 10-second video clips, photographs, and hangouts, and it also provides explicit social cues to conversational partners as to when it is being used). Finally, wearable computers can be designed to take a secondary, supporting role in the user's life as opposed to being the main focus of the user's attention. When I started the MIT Wearable Computing Project in 1995, the group of us who wore computers on a daily basis soon discovered that our conversational partners did not understand the computers' purpose. They mistakenly thought that we were constantly “living in VR.” In response, making the interface more socially transparent became a goal. I'll use Glass, which has been my most recent experience, to illustrate. Take the display. We decided to mount the display high so that there would be no barrier to eye contact. Even if the user bends her head down and looks through the display, her eyes can still be seen. When the display is on, both the user her conversational partners can see it. This design makes clear when the device is in use. Wearable computing pioneer is a Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Technical Lead on Google Glass, which was named a Time Magazine Invention of the Year. He was perhaps the first to integrate a head-up display-based wearable computer into his everyday life as an intelligent agent, and is a founder of the annual ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers. Starner coined the term ""augmented reality"" in 1990 to describe the types of interfaces he envisioned at the time; has authored over 150 peer-reviewed scientific publications; and is an inventor on over 80 U.S. patents. Going further, using Glass involves actions. When I am asked a question, I might reply “I don't know, let me look that up,” and I physically look up at Glass's display as I trigger a Google search. Similarly, “OK Glass, take a picture” notifies my conversational group that a picture is being taken. Alternatively, the camera can be triggered by a button press at the corner of the frames. The gesture, which includes looking at my subject, maneuvering my head to the best angle, and clicking the “shutter,” is familiar. It resembles the actions I would perform on a normal pocket camera. By making the use of Glass apparent, it becomes a shared social experience. To the user, the position of the display is similar to that of a rearview mirror in a car: up and out of the way from the user's normal eye-line. Interactions are designed to be brief. Like a rearview mirror, a person can glance up briefly at the display to get the information she needs before quickly returning to look forward. The 640x360 pixel display appears focused some distance away from the body. That way, a person can see the display without changing the physical focus of her eyes from what she is interacting with in the world. This design focus on keeping the user’s head up is key to keeping them “in the flow” and aware of the world around them, whether it be in conversation or while walking down the street. Parents capturing their child's recital keep their heads up using Glass instead of living the experience looking down through their camcorder's viewfinder. As much as possible, Glass takes the technology out of the way so that the user can focus on what matters. Being able to access web search with a glance is surprisingly powerful during face-to-face conversation. Turning our heads to the physical barrier of a laptop or smartphone display means we are no longer focusing on what our colleagues or friends or family are saying. By the time we return with whatever information we are seeking, the conversation has moved on. That last point is key. The biggest barrier to using a smartphone during conversation is the amount of time required to use it. My studies of scheduling appointments during conversation revealed that people often balk at using their mobile devices. Retrieving a device, unlocking it, and then navigating the interface to the appropriate place to start the search removes the user from the conversation . Let me pause on that for a moment. In fact, count out twenty seconds before reading the next sentence. 1........ 2…….. 3…….. 4…….. 5…….. 6…….. 7…….. 8…….. 9…….. 10…….. 11…….. 12…….. 13…….. 14…….. 15…….. 16…….. 17…….. 18…….. 19…….. 20. Done? Did you actually wait the 20 seconds? Probably not, because it soon seems awkward and disrupts the flow of your reading. Imagine that delay, plus more to actually use the application, during a conversation. The worse part is that people stall and put in filler speech to cover up the awkward waiting or silence. For example, in response to a colleague asking “Can we meet at 4 p.m.?” the script I’ve observed is: Person reaches in pocket or purse for his or her phone. Guesses while finding information: “I know I'm busy today...” Confirms information and talks aloud: “4 p.m., right? ... Let me scroll down...” Meanwhile, the person on the other end is stuck filling the delay with small talk, empty wait time, or going down their own rabbit-hole on their device, escalating the interruptive nature of the interaction. The goal of technology should be to assist with the flow of human interaction, not misdirect the user's attention to itself unnecessarily. The design focus on keeping the user’s head up is key to keeping them 'in the flow' and aware of the world around them. Wearables empower the user by reducing the time between their intention to do a task and their ability to perform that task. Glass wearers can perform useful tasks in two seconds: checking the time, taking a picture, checking the next appointment, reading the first line of an email to see if it’s important, doing a quick search, checking the weather, glancing at a text, starting a video. Such are the social equivalent of checking time on a wristwatch: noticeable, yet fast enough to be minimally disruptive and not really affect the conversation. Designing for such microinteractions is particularly powerful for people whose jobs (knowledge workers, for instance) or lifestyles (single parents) require constant monitoring of their communications. Microinteractions are another way to keep people “in the flow” of what they are doing. The conflicted social etiquette of being in a meeting with one’s cellphone—something many working parents experience—can be addressed by wearables like Glass. With laptops and smartphones, the desire is to monitor email and SMS but, in reality, the device's interface draws the user into the device. To address this reality, we intentionally limited the interaction on Glass to be quick and shallow through the design of the hardware and the software. For anything that requires more than a few seconds of interaction, the user moves to her laptop or mobile phone. This dichotomy requires the user to decide actively to engage the technology for a deeper interaction where their attention is dedicated to the device. Glass is also designed for “ignorability”. By default, the display is off. With notifications, a small auditory “bing” indicates an incoming text or important email (in Gmail, a “starred” message as determined by the user's filters). Users can ignore it or tilt their head up to display the notification. A nod then dismisses the message. The entire interaction is a shift in focus of two seconds instead of more than 20 just to begin. Reducing the time between intention and action isn’t just a nice-to-have, it's a must have. Yet it’s especially significant for those who have low vision or are blind and are confronted with mundane tasks that the sighted take for granted, like finding matching socks or determining if a can of food contains gluten or nuts. Designing for microinteractions is particularly powerful for people whose jobs or lifestyles (single parents) require constant monitoring of their communications. There are six million adults who are blind in the United States. To help address their needs, Google Glass Explorer Professor created "","" an app that anonymously outsources answers to such questions to remote workers, and his collaborators Brandyn White and Andrew Miller brought the idea to Glass using . The idea is to reduce the time and social barriers to getting help with everyday questions. “In the real world,” Dr. Bigham observes, “users aren't asking their questions in isolation. They're trying to get something done—making dinner, taking a walk, caring for a loved one. Pulling out a phone to take a picture temporarily removes them from these activities.” For him, Glass is a way to “get people the information they need without disrupting them from what they actually care about.” Meanwhile, my Georgia Tech group just released a prototype Android app and Glassware called “Captioning on Glass” for people who are hard-of-hearing. During a face-to-face conversation, one person speaks into a mobile phone that transcribes what she is saying and transmits the text to Glass's head-up display for the person who is hard-of-hearing to read. Many times a person who is hard-of-hearing can understand what their conversational partner is saying by the audio they do hear, the context, the facial gestures, and looking at the lips; the transcription fills in details when necessary. Thus, by having a head-up display, the wearer can stay “in the flow” of the conversation, attending the other person's face to get as much information as possible while speeding the natural conversation. In general, we can switch our focus of attention in split seconds, and we do such “multiplexing” all the time—while walking, eating, and conversing. In fact, our eyes start becoming uncomfortable if we try to hold them steady for more than 0.6 seconds. The problem occurs when two tasks overlap (especially language-based tasks) that require too much attention for too long, forcing an attempt at multitasking. Keeping interactions brief allows the user to remain in control. Such microinteractions can also lead to . In another example that applies to people who are disabled, my team at Georgia Tech is trying to help hearing parents of deaf children learn American Sign Language. Over 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents, and parents have difficulty learning enough sign language to teach their children. We do 'multiplexing' all the time. The problem occurs when two tasks overlap, forcing an attempt at .Sometimes a deaf child's first exposure to language is in grade school. Even when a parent manages to learn the basics of sign, learning new vocabulary is difficult. provides micro sign language lessons designed to teach the vocabulary parents need to learn to communicate with their infant. Dr. Kim Xu, who has studied the significant benefits of delivering sign language lessons on a mobile phone, has already SMARTSign to Glass. Throughout the day, the user gets notifications of available micro lessons. When users have a spare minute they can find a video of a sign in their timeline on Glass. After the short video plays, the user is asked to select the equivalent concept in English from a multiple-choice test. Depending on how the user performs, that sign will be replayed more or less often in the future rotation of videos, until the user demonstrates familiarity with the sign. If they have more time, users can ask for more sign videos. I recently learned 10 new signs while waiting in line to board an airplane. By using Glass to lower the barrier for parents learning sign, we hope to help deaf children acquire language skills by having their language more accessible to them in their homes. These are only a few of the examples where Glass—and I’m sure other wearables—could lower barriers for people in their daily lives. Each time computing has become more mobile, faster to access, and more interactive, there’s been a revolution in new services and ecosystems. However, this time I hope that by bringing the technology closer to us, it will, in effect, get more out of the way. That’s the true promise of wearables … and it may finally be here for everyone.

Using computer reading glasses can help eliminate the effects in addition to protecting your eyes from blue light and improving sleep if you use screens late at night. The aim of this guide is to aid you in finding the best computer reading glasses for you. are our favorites. They are available in a range of prescription strengths from +0.0 to +3.0 with a simple, modern design. Considerations when choosing computer reading glasses Blue light is part of the visible light spectrum and is emitted by computer screens. Although experts are still debating the negative effects of blue light, one thing we do know is that it increases attention, which can make you feel more wakeful at night, making it hard to sleep. Many have blue light–blocking properties, which is great for anyone who uses computers for more than a few hours before bed. Some people need computer reading glasses because they're farsighted — they have trouble reading things close up. While many glasses can be bought with no magnification, there are also plenty of magnified options as well, up to around 2x magnification. If you're not sure what degree of magnification you require, you should visit an optometrist for an eye test. One of the annoying factors about wearing glasses while using the computer is the increased glare, which can contribute to eyestrain. Computer reading glasses should have anti-glare coating on both sides of the lens. Some computer reading glasses have an orange or yellow tint. Although you can find blue light blocking glasses with clear lenses, tinted options do a far more effective job, with some tinted computer glasses blocking close to 100% of blue light. What's more, some wearers find that the tint helps to reduce eyestrain in general, reducing headaches and other unwanted symptoms. The issue with tinted lenses is that not everyone likes the way they look. You can find computer reading glasses that fit over the top of standard glasses. They might not be the most stylish option, but they're great for anyone who requires glasses because they're nearsighted. Choose a style of computer reading glasses you like, whether large thick-framed glasses, horn-rimmed glasses, or any other style you prefer.  Computer reading glasses often include either a soft or hard case to protect your glasses when you're not wearing them. You can find some basic computer reading glasses for as little as $10 to $20, but you find better mid-range choices in the $20 to $40 range. The most expensive options can cost as much as $60 to $80. As yet, there's no proof that computer use can damage eyes long-term, but it's only been a few decades that people have been using computers and other similar devices all day for work. There is a chance that so much exposure to blue light could cause some degree of eye damage over time. But even if there's no long-term damage, people do suffer from headaches, blurred vision, and trouble sleeping from excessive computer use. Q. Can I use my computer reading glasses as regular reading glasses? If you choose computer reading glasses with a degree of magnification, there's no reason why you can't use them as standard reading glasses, too. These thick-rimmed glasses prove you can still be stylish while protecting your eyes from blue light. These glasses block blue light without a yellow tint. Also, have anti-glare properties and are UV-protective. Available in gray, black, and red. Case and cleaning cloth included. Anti-glare coating makes it trickier to remove smudges. Not only are they affordable, but these glasses have a vintage round-framed design that's extremely on trend. Anti-glare and blue light–blocking properties. Choose from unmagnified options up to 3x magnification. Slight yellow tint but not especially obvious. Not the most durable — hinges bend out of shape easily. Although somewhat pricey, few computer glasses are better at blocking blue light — a popular choice with gamers and people who work at computers all day. Choice of two frame colors and three size options. Stylish design. Soft case and cleaning cloth included. Some buyers don't like the visible orange tint. Lauren Corona is a writer for .

If you spend hours each day working at a computer screen or other devices with screens, you may suffer from symptoms of eye strain. Eye strain is a common problem, but you can take steps to reduce your discomfort.  Eye strain is a set of symptoms caused by overworked eyes. The most common symptoms of eye strain include: You can make changes to your computer screen to help reduce your eye discomfort and fatigue.  Position your workstation to reduce strain. Make sure to: Place the screen straight in front of you, not off to the side. Put the screen slightly farther away from where you normally hold a book. Position the top of the screen at or slightly below eye level. Use a document holder to keep reference material at the same height and distance from you as the computer screen. This prevents the need to change eye focus when looking from one to the other.  Tilt the screen angle to reduce reflections from overhead lights or desk lamps. Use drapes, shades, or blinds to control window lighting and glare. Keep the screen brightness the same as or brighter than other bright objects in the room. Set your computer to show black characters on a white background. Use a screen filter that reduces glare to enhance screen contrast and increase character legibility. Use a 3-sided computer hood if glare continues to be a problem. Keep the screen clean and dust-free. Wipe it daily often with an anti-static cloth. Use artificial tear eye drops to relieve dryness and irritation. Give your eyes rest breaks from the computer screen. Every 15 minutes, look up and focus on a distant object for about 2 minutes.   One of the easiest ways to prevent eye strain is to see a vision specialist. You may need prescription eyeglasses for computer use. Prescription lenses correct vision problems and can increase your comfort while at the computer. The type of lenses that work best for you will depend on your needs. Choices include: These lenses are used just for computer work. You would remove the eyeglasses when not on the computer. These are lenses with different correction on the top and bottom. You can have the top of the lens for computer use and the bottom for close-up reading. Or, you can have the top for distance vision and the bottom for computer use. This is another type of lens with multiple-use correction. A progressive lens may have a large middle section for computer use.  Talk with your eye healthcare provider about your daily computer use and vision needs. He or she can help figure out which type of lens will work best for you. ",127,glasses for computer,-0.4090358018875122,6

Pictures of Eyeglasses and Frames: Glasses for Presbyopia, Sunglasses, Eye Problems Screen time can be a key factor in choosing eyewear today, with 70% of daily computer users reporting eye strain. Computer glasses may ease the blur. Manufacturers say they help your eyes adapt to electronic words and images, typically viewed farther away than a book. Look for anti-reflective coating and consider a tint to reduce glare from harsh overhead lighting. Fine print seems to shrink as we age. What really happens is presbyopia -- the eye loses its ability to change focus. Reading glasses can help bring blurry print into sharp focus. You can buy ""readers"" at many stores. But if you need different strengths for each eye, require bifocals, or have an oddly-shaped eye -- called astigmatism -- see an eye care professional. If it seems like more people wear glasses at younger ages, you're right. Myopia, blurry distance vision, has been on the rise since the '70s. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is less common. Both require corrective lenses. It's a myth that getting glasses will make your eyes weak. People may need stronger vision correction as they age. But that happens whether or not you wear glasses. Do you avoid a new prescription for fear of thick glasses and a ""bug-eye"" look? Ask your eye care provider about high-index lenses, which are thinner and lighter than traditional lenses. You also may consider aspheric lenses, which are thinned out on the sides. Lenses can be both aspheric and high index. Both can help you avoid a thick, unflattering shape. Do you need different glasses to watch TV and to read? You may be a candidate for multifocal lenses. Bifocals have an area at the bottom for reading. The rest is for distance. Trifocals add a middle zone for vision 18 to 24 inches away, handy for computers. Progressive lenses, or ""no-line bifocals,"" offer a gradual shift in strength -- invisible to your younger co-workers. A racquetball travels between 100 and 150 mph. Imagine the force of that ball hitting you in the eye! Your best protection is sports frames with polycarbonate plastic lenses. They're 10 times stronger than other materials and polycarbonate material has the benefit of built-in UV protection as well. Sports with the most eye injuries include all racket sports, baseball/softball, ice hockey, basketball, and lacrosse. Protective eyewear could prevent 90% of sports-related eye injuries so it is strongly recommended. If you're wearing sunglasses for sports, consider colored lenses that may enhance vision for your particular sport. Yellow lenses may help in low light or haze to provide a sharper image. They're popular with skiers and snowboarders, cyclists, and indoor athletes like basketball players and racquetball players. Green lenses may heighten contrast while still keeping the balance of colors. They're popular for golf and baseball. Golfers say the green lenses make the ball stand out on the green (simulated in our picture). It's not yet clear that one lens color has the edge over another, so try before you buy. Many stores have samples to try with simulated light to see what color might work for you. Getting the newest lens technology starts with an eye test. You should have an exam at least every two years -- to be sure your glasses are the right prescription and to look for medical issues. An exam can find cataracts and glaucoma, as well as illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, aneurysms, HIV, and cancer. Signs of disease may be visible in, on, or around the eyes long before symptoms appear. Call your eye doctor right away for any of the following symptoms: Little cobwebs or specks that move in your vision may be harmless floaters. But it's best to see a doctor with any concerns. Start with practical considerations when choosing eyewear. If you tend to crush things in your purse, remember that metal frames bend (and can be repaired), but plastics break. You should never leave glasses in a hot car, but could it happen to you? Plastic frames warp and can't be fixed. Metal frames just get really hot. If you don't like glasses or need peripheral vision for sports, contacts are a great alternative. When picking glasses, have your prescription in hand and consider these guidelines: Contrast flatters the face shape. For example, squarish frames on a round face. Strong, dark frames draw attention away from features you don't like (a chubby chin). Cat's-eye frames that point up at the corners can give the appearance of a mini facelift. Color can blend with your hair and eyes, or contrast for a bigger statement. If you work in a traditional field, think about titanium, stainless steel, or rimless frames for a professional look. For men, consider frames in brown, black, silver, or gunmetal. They're conservative colors and easy to match with professional clothes. For women, consider black, brown, silver, burgundy, and golden tones for the same reason. Tortoise-shell tones also are a classic. Show off your creative fashion sense with interesting metal or plastic frames in unusual colors and unique designs. Look for geometric shapes, contemporary larger frames, multi-color laminates, prints (animal and flower), or lasered details. Retro and vintage styling -- ranging from cat's-eyes to aviators to mod fashions -- also are back in style. If you want your personality to shine, look for trendy frame materials. You can find frames in wood, bone, and even buffalo horn. Show flair with gold (yes, real gold) frames or frames decked out in crystals or semi-precious or precious stones. Some frames are leather or wrapped in velvet. You may even find frames adorned in feathers, for an airy statement of your personal style. Harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays can pass through clouds, so sunglasses are a must -- sunny and cloudy day alike. Sand, snow, water, and your car's windshield all reflect extra light and call for eye protection. Look for sunglasses with 99% or 100% UVA and UVB blocking. As an added benefit, sunglasses help protect the tender skin around your eyes and may help prevent cataracts. Bonus fact: driving exposes you to a lot of UV too, so consider a clear UV film for your car‘s side windows (front shields all have good protection). Sunglasses with polarized lenses are popular with people who spend time on the water or in the snow because they cut glare from reflected surfaces. And they've been adopted by many others who like a glare-free view. Anti-reflective coatings fight glare, too. Mirror-coated lenses have a purpose beyond their style: They limit light coming into the eye, great for very bright conditions. Blue blockers usually have amber-colored lenses. They block blue light, which has been linked to eye damage. Because they also heighten contrast, they're popular with hunters, pilots, boaters, and skiers. Blue light also suppresses melatonin, the sleep hormone. At least one study showed that people who wore blue blockers in the morning slept better at night. When you need glasses but don't want to also buy prescription sunglasses, photochromic lenses are an option. They're clear indoors and darken automatically in bright sunlight. They block 100% of harmful UV rays and are handy for kids, who play outdoors a lot. One downside: They don't darken in a car; most windshields filter out the UV rays that trigger the color change. As we age, the odds of developing cataracts -- cloudiness of the eye's lens -- increase. Wearing sunglasses may delay cataracts. Sunglasses also may protect against macular degeneration (a disease of aging that harms central vision) and growths on the eye, both benign and cancerous. After cataract surgery, polarized glasses -- even indoors -- may reduce discomfort from glare. Children need sunglasses just as much as adults do, maybe more -- because they're outside more often than adults are and their eyes are more sensitive. Make sure kids' sunglasses offer the same UV protection that you'd look for in an adult pair. Although 2/3 of adults buy sunglasses for their children, only 13% check to make sure they protect against UV rays. Think of sunglasses like “sun screen for your child’s eyes” Do your kids have their noses glued to the computer or video game system? Get them outside. Some studies show that children who spend a lot of time on the computer or doing other up-close work, even reading, have a higher rate of myopia than other kids. And kids who spend a lot of time outside have lower rates of myopia. Pediatricians recommend no more than two hours a day of screen time for kids. Research shows 2,000 people each year have eye-related injuries on the job. About 90% of them might been prevented by wearing eye protection. Eye injuries are caused by chemicals, foreign objects in the eye, steam burns, radiation exposure, and contagious diseases. Nonprescription safety eyewear offers good protection. It must have nonremovable lenses and be permanently marked with ""Z87."" When swimming, snorkeling, or scuba diving with beautiful undersea creatures, using prescription glasses or contact lenses can be tricky. One option: goggles or scuba masks custom-made for your vision. You may need a slightly different prescription for underwater use, because goggles can sit a little closer to your eyes than regular lenses, and a mask sits further away.

a2bbf2bb-da4c-48c6-adc2-b10a6f69c85d,"A clear eyed look at computer vision syndrome Recognize the symptoms and learn about ways to prevent it In the dark about computer vision syndrome (CVS)? You're not alone. Even though the symptoms of CVS are more prevalent among computer users than repetitive strain injuries (RSI), most people haven't heard of it. Fortunately, that's not a cause for concern, since doctors typically check for symptoms of CVS during routine eye exams. Symptoms include blurred vision or eyestrain; dry, itchy, red or burning eyes; and neck or back pain, among others. According to Dr. Robert Gross, chief of the Eye Service at MIT Medical, ""If you have any of these symptoms and are more symptomatic when you're on the computer, then you have CVS."" The good news is that CVS doesn't cause long-term damage to your eyes, nor are there strict dos and don'ts to follow. That said, you can benefit from knowing what causes CVS and steps you can take to prevent or treat it. According to Gross, if you are symptomatic, there are four things to consider: Do you have the right prescription for the distance between your eyes and the computer screen? Does your office setup — the placement of your chair, monitor and light source — minimize the likelihood of eyestrain? Do you work on a computer for long stretches of time or read difficult material on your display, such as articles from technical journals? Here's the lowdown on each of these. Getting the correct prescription for computer work depends on the distance between your eyes and the screen (see below) and also depends on your age. The divider occurs around age 40 to 45, when presbyopia — the inability of the eye to focus sharply on nearby objects — becomes an issue. This age-related loss of focus stems from reduced elasticity in the crystalline lens behind the iris. For a younger person who wears glasses or contact lenses and has CVS, an accurate prescription is usually all that's needed to correct the problem. Some in this group who are nearsighted find it more relaxing to use a second pair of glasses with a weaker prescription for work on the computer. For older people, the solution is more complicated. Lined bifocals are usually inappropriate because the top half is for long distance and the bottom half, which would be the right strength for computer work, puts your neck in a bad posture. Progressive glasses may address this issue. If you're over 50, though, even with progressive glasses you may still have to tilt your head to a degree that causes a stiff neck. If this is the case, you may want a dedicated pair of glasses that's optimal for the distance between your eyes and the computer. The American Optometric Association provides guidelines for the angle and distance between your eyes and your monitor: ""Optimally, the computer screen should be 15 to 20 degrees below eye level (about 4 or 5 inches) as measured from the center of the screen and 20 to 28 inches from the eyes."" You should also try to avoid glare or reflections on your screen. Position your screen and light sources to minimize these, using window shades or a desk lamp as needed. You can also adjust your screen brightness to a level you find comfortable. Gross doesn't recommend glare filters for computer screens unless you can't get rid of glare in any other way. In general, a glare filter's muting and loss of contrast makes reading more difficult. While some find an anti-reflective coating on their glasses helpful, there's no scientific evidence that coatings or tints are effective. Studies show that people blink less — a lot less — when they work at a computer. Blinking less leads to more evaporation, which can be especially problematic for people who wear soft contact lenses. A soft contact is essentially 50% water, so if there's a lot of evaporation, the lenses will often feel less comfortable as the day goes on. Gross suggests wearing glasses if you're uncomfortable when working long hours on the computer. Your office environment may also be dry, contributing to eye discomfort. Using over-the-counter artificial tears can be very helpful. If you wear contact lenses, be sure to get drops that are approved for use with them. Bottom line: blink more often, wear contact lenses judiciously, and use eye drops as needed. Close focus on work over long periods of time can strain your eyes. Gross also notes this interesting fact: If your reading material is difficult, your eyes will overfocus. ""You'll get more tired reading a technical journal than the sports page, even if the font is exactly the same, at the same exact distance, for the same amount of time,"" he notes. Stress also produces more physical strain on the eyes, making them focus harder. To remedy this type of eyestrain, Gross recommends the 20:20:20 rule: every 20 minutes take a 20-second break and look 20 feet away. The eye is at rest when it looks in the distance. ""That's why people's eyes tend to get tired when they read, not so much when walking around,"" he says. The game plan? Build in time to relax. Take a break and move around. Drink some water or other hydrating beverage. Change your focus: look out the window or across the room. If you're experiencing symptoms of CVS, make an appointment with an eye care professional. Getting the right prescription for the eyewear you use at the computer relieves CVS symptoms more than any other measure. Community members can see optometrists in MIT Medical's while , in the Stratton Student Center, offers discounts on eyewear to MIT students and patients of the Eye Service. You may also want to read up on CVS at the or websites. And remember to adopt the suggestions in this article: optimize your office setup, blink more, and observe the 20:20:20 rule.

Reviewed By: Vision problems may result when you stare at computer screens, smartphones, tablets, and e-readers for too long. Excessive screen time may result in headaches, dry eyes, eyestrain, blurred vision, and shoulder and neck pain. These symptoms are temporary and resolve when you limit or take a break from screen time. To minimize computer eyestrain, position the monitor so that is approximately 2 feet in front of you. Make sure you have adequate lighting to reduce glare. Experts recommend following the 20-20-20 rule to minimize the risk of eyestrain and other symptoms associated with looking at screens. The rule is to look at an object that is 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds for every 20 minutes that you are on the computer or looking at another device screen. Eyes are vulnerable to damage from ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun, chemicals, and accidents. Protect your peepers by wearing sunglasses that have UV protection while outdoors. Wear protective goggles when you are working with machinery, tools, or caustic chemicals. Approximately 2,000 people every day in the U.S. suffer eye injuries while on the job that require medical treatment. An injury to the eye or chemical exposure could even lead to blindness. It is estimated that 90% of these eye injuries could be prevented or minimized if people wore adequate eye protection. Wear protective eye goggles or even a face shield when working with tools or chemicals at home or on the job. Wear sunglasses while outside to protect yourself against UV sun exposure. Most people need to use reading glasses to see things up close once they reach a certain age, usually by age 40 or older. The inability to see things clearly up close is called presbyopia. Eyeglasses called ""readers"" improve your ability to see things that are close up more clearly. You can purchase readers over the counter at pharmacies and other venues. They are available in various strengths, but unlike prescription eyeglasses, they will not be tailored to your vision. Usually people need different prescriptions for each eye, so standard readers may not be appropriate for you. You can also correct your vision by wearing contact lenses or getting laser surgery. The rates of both myopia (nearsightedness) and hyperopia (farsightedness) increase with age. About 25 percent of adults between the ages of 40 and over are nearsighted and about 10 percent of adults over the age of 40 are farsighted. Nearsightedness and farsightedness are common eye problems. You can correct your vision by wearing prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses. See your optometrist to test your vision and discuss whether eyeglasses, contact lenses, or a combination of the two are right for you. Presbyopia is a normal process associated with aging of the eyes. The lens of the eye is very flexible before the age of 40. This flexibility makes it easy for the eyes to focus on objects that are far away or close up. The lens becomes less flexible as we age. This makes it more difficult to focus on objects that are close up. Inadequate or poor lighting makes the problem worse. People with the condition often hold books or menus at a restaurant farther away to be able to read from them more easily. Some diseases that you would not necessarily associate with the eyes can negatively impact vision. Diabetes and high blood pressure can lead to eye conditions and visual impairment. Diabetes is a top potential cause of blindness in adults. Diabetic retinopathy is a condition that leads to damage to blood vessels that are located in the retina. Symptoms of diabetic retinopathy may include blurriness, trouble perceiving colors, dark areas of vision, and floaters. Diabetes may cause retinal artery occlusion. This condition causes a blockage in a small artery that delivers blood to the retina. High blood pressure can potentially cause permanent loss of vision by damaging nerves and blood vessels in the eyes. If you experience any problems including eye pain, floaters, lazy eye (amblyopia), uveitis, astigmatism, conjunctivitis (pink eye), red eyes, nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), retinal detachment, blepharitis, corneal disease, strabismus, pinguecula, retinal disorders, keratoconus, retinitis pigmentosa, sudden loss of vision or blindness, vision problems, chalazion, or droopy eyelids, see your eye doctor right away. Everyone should have regular eye exams to screen for eye diseases and eye problems, but it's especially important to see the ophthalmologist when you are experiencing eye symptoms. Conjunctivitis caused by viruses or bacteria is highly contagious! Wash your hands frequently and do not touch your eyes to avoid spreading it to others. An eye doctor can examine the corneal tissue, retinal tissue, macular tissue, eyelids, conjunctiva, subconjunctival tissue, and other tissues of the eyes during an eye exam. It is possible to develop glaucoma and cataracts at any age, but these common eye diseases happen most often in people who are over the age of 60 years old. Cataracts are cloudy growths that occur on the lens of the eyes. They can cause vision loss and interfere with daily activities like driving, watching TV, and reading. Cataracts can be removed surgically. Glaucoma is a condition where the optic nerve that connects the eye to the brain is damaged. High eye pressure in the eye (intraocular pressure) is the most common cause of this condition. Doctors treat glaucoma with medicated eyedrops. Sometimes, a doctor may perform surgery to decrease pressure in the eye. The most common form of glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma. The vast majority of glaucoma cases, at least 90%, are this type. Open-angle glaucoma occurs when the drainage canals in the eyes become clogged. This increases intraocular pressure. Symptoms of this type of glaucoma may include blind spots in the peripheral or central vision and tunnel vision as the disease progresses. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common condition in people who are 50 years old and older. It is a leading cause of vision loss, but the eye disease does not lead to complete blindness. It damages the macula which is an area of tissue in the center of the retina. That part of the eye is critical to central vision, the vision that is necessary to see fine details and objects that are straight ahead. There are two types of age-related macular degeneration. ""Wet"" AMD is the type that is caused by blood vessels that leak blood or fluid into the macula. The condition is treatable with medication. ""Dry"" AMD is a slower disease process. In this form, small yellow deposits called drusen appear under the macula. There is no specific treatment for dry AMD. Your eye doctor may recommend certain vitamin and mineral supplements to slow down or stop the disease process. The doctor may prescribe a program of vision rehabilitation to help you adjust to living with AMD. The eyes are particularly vulnerable to harm from free radicals, unstable molecules that can potentially harm tissues. Certain foods are rich in nutrients that help protect the eyes against free radicals and reduce the risk of age-related eye conditions like cataracts and AMD. Nutrients good for eye health include vitamin C, vitamin E, omega-3 fatty acids, lutein, and zeaxanthin. Foods rich in these nutrients include leafy greens, oranges, tangerines, fatty fish, and nuts. Eat a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables daily to help protect your eye health. Dry eye syndrome is a condition that is more likely to occur as we age. It results in the eyes producing fewer tears or tears that do not have sufficient lubricating quality to keep eyes moisturized. People with dry eyes may experience pain, discharge, redness, and alternating periods of tearing and dryness. The condition may cause heavy eyelids and blurry vision. Women are more likely than men to develop dry eyes, likely due to hormonal changes and increased risk of autoimmunity. People who have autoimmune conditions are more likely to suffer from dry eyes. So are those who have rosacea and blepharitis. Taking decongestants, birth control pills, antidepressants, antihistamines, hormone replacement, anti-anxiety medications, and blood pressure medications all increase the risk of dry eyes. Over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications are available for the treatment of dry eyes. Detached retina is an eye problem where the retina, the part of the eye that is sensitive to light, detaches from the back of the inside of the eye. Retinal detachment is a serious eye problem and a medical emergency that needs immediate treatment to minimize the risk of permanent vision loss. Anyone at any age can suffer from a detached retina, but it is more likely to occur in those age 40 years and older. People who are very nearsighted or who have had cataract surgery or another eye condition are at increased risk of suffering retinal detachment. Have you ever noticed a light-colored ring around the iris of someone's eyes? It may be corneal arcus, or arcus senilis. The ring is made from calcium and cholesterol and is usually a gray-white color. Corneal arcus is common eye problem in people over the age of 60. This ring around the cornea does not affect vision, but it may be associated with changes in lipid metabolism. In one study, more than 70 percent of people who had corneal arcus had high fasting triglyceride levels, which is a marker of lipid metabolism abnormalities. Muscles in the eyelid lose strength as we age. Tissues that that make up the eyelids also become looser. Gravity takes a toll as well. All of these factors may cause the lower eyelids to turn outward. The condition is called ectropion. The lower eyelids may turn inward. This condition is called entropion. It can be very uncomfortable because the eyelashes may rub against the eyeball. If the upper eyelid becomes droopy, this condition is called ptosis. All of these conditions may be treated surgically. Normal age-related changes to the eyes may cause vision trouble. Many people notice they need more light to read or do other close-up activities as they age. This is because the muscles that control the pupils are weaker and less responsive to light than they were in youth. Turn on bright lights when you read or are doing needlework or some other activity that requires you to see fine details. The lenses of the eyes change with aging, too. This may make light scatter on the back of the retina instead of come in more focused. This may lead to more glare, especially when you are driving. Wear sunglasses when you are outside or driving to guard against glare from the sun reflecting off of pavement or windshields. Investing in a good pair of sunglasses is important to protect your eyes, especially if you have become more light-sensitive. The lenses of the eyes are normally clear. As people age, the lenses may become discolored. This may impair vision and make it hard to see colors as they really are. Colors may appear less bright. It may also be harder to distinguish different colors from each other. Aging may affect blue-yellow vision most so people have trouble distinguishing blue from purple. Color perception changes may also make it more difficult to distinguish yellow from green.

77678877-6aa7-473d-838f-75566de69ba8,"Steps for Computer Eyestrain Relief for People with Chronic Dry Eye — — The amount of time you spend staring at a computer screen can affect your eyes and worsen dry eye symptoms. But work obligations may often prohibit you from limiting the time you need to spend in front of a computer. Activities that demand intense concentration can result in eyestrain and dryness. According to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, a person blinks up to less frequently while using a computer. Blinking is important because it helps spread hydrating substances like tears and mucus across your eyes. If you’re blinking less, the tears on your eyes have more time to evaporate, resulting in red and dry eyes. The brightness of the monitor reflecting onto your eyes can also contribute to dry and tired eyes. By the end of your workday, you may find you’re squinting to see what you could previously see more easily. Signs that you may have computer vision syndrome, which is also known as digital eyestrain, include: Here are 12 steps you can take to reduce eye dryness and strain. If you wear glasses, talk to your eye doctor about antireflective coatings or special lenses. These can help to minimize glare on your computer screen and keep your eyes feeling comfortable. Also, make sure you have the correct prescription glasses. Otherwise, your eyes will strain to see the screen. Eye drops can ensure your eyes stay lubricated while using a computer. You can purchase over-the-counter (OTC) artificial tears that you can use when your eyes feel dry. If OTC eye drops and adjustments to your environment don’t seem to help, talk to your eye doctor. They may recommend prescription eye drops for chronic dry eye. Proper placement of the monitor on your desk can help reduce glare and promote a more ergonomic and comfortable experience. If possible, switch to a larger monitor. This will usually make words and images easier to see. Also, enlarge the font whenever possible to make reading easier. Position your computer monitor about 20 to 26 inches away from your head. The monitor should be placed at such a height that you’re looking at the middle of the screen. You shouldn’t have to hunch over or sit up excessively straight to see the computer screen well. It can also be helpful to set your monitor just below eye level to reduce the surface area of your eyes that are exposed to air. This can help reduce tear evaporation that can lead to dry eyes. Use a glare filter over your computer to reduce any unwanted light that can make it difficult to see. Also note that flatter screens tend to have less glare. Adjust your computer’s refresh rate to between 70 and 85 Hz. Most computer screens will refresh at a rate of 60 Hz. However, this speed can cause a flickering or rolling of the screen. Adjust the brightness of your computer monitor as well. If a website with a white background is so bright that it looks like a light source, it’s too bright. But if the monitor appears gray or dull, this is a sign that your monitor should be brighter. The layout of the location where you use a computer can contribute to eyestrain. It’s best if your computer monitor is away from the window (meaning, not in front of a window or behind one). This reduces the glare from outside light sources that can further irritate and dry your eyes. If your desk must be up against a window, get blinds or curtains to help reduce glare. Switching out overhead fluorescent lights in favor of lamps can help to reduce overhead glare that can make it difficult for your eyes to focus. Adjusting light to a lower wattage or even a softer filter can help to relax the eyes. If you do use a lamp on your desk, ensure it isn’t pointed directly at your face. Instead, the light should be pointed downward, toward papers on your desk. While you can make some changes to your computer workstation and monitor, there are other things you can do to ensure you’re protecting your eyes as best you can while working. Look away from your computer screen at least every 20 minutes for 20 seconds. Focusing on an item that is about 20 feet away from you can help to reduce strain and fatigue on the eye muscles. This practice is known as the 20-20-20 rule. You can also adjust your eyes’ focusing ability and “relax” your eyes by looking at a faraway object for 10 to 15 seconds. Then, look at an object that is closer to you. The air quality in the environment that you use a computer in can play a role in eyestrain and dryness. Use a humidifier to increase the amount of moisture in the air. If necessary, move away from fans and vents that blow air toward your eyes and face. Also, avoid smoking or being exposed to secondhand smoke that can irritate your eyes. Some supplements may help improve your dry eye and eyestrain symptoms. For example, omega-3 fatty acids and bilberry extract with dry eye, but research is limited. Always talk to your optometrist or ophthalmologist before taking any supplements. If you work at a computer all day, it’s important to take frequent breaks. These breaks don’t have to be for long periods of time. Every hour or two, take a few minutes to get up, go for a short walk, and stretch your arms and legs. Not only can getting away from your computer reduce eyestrain and dryness, but it can also help reduce any neck or back pain you may experience from sitting at a computer. There are several apps you can download on your computer that remind you to take breaks or automatically adjust your screen settings to protect your eyes. One example is , which changes the color and brightness of your computer screen based on the time of the day so you aren’t straining your eyes. Another example is , where you can set up alerts that remind you to take short breaks. Dehydration can make chronic dry eye symptoms worse. And if you’re staring at a computer screen for an extended period of time on top of that, not drinking enough water can make your eyes feel even worse. Stay hydrated by drinking at least eight glasses of water throughout each day. If you’ve tried all of the above and still can’t seem to get relief, it might be time to get your eyes evaluated. Make an appointment with an ophthalmologist or optometrist to see if you need a new prescription for glasses or contacts. Your doctor may also recommend an OTC or prescription treatment, such as eye drops or ointments, to help relieve your symptoms. Many of the steps described above don’t take a tremendous amount of time or money to be effective. By increasing your efforts to protect your eyes, you’ll likely experience less dry eye discomfort. — — Switching Dry Eye Treatment: What You Need to Know Millions of Americans are diagnosed with dry eyes each year.

1f95a923-7535-4da6-b489-f60bec5ed1e4,"— Blue light, also called blue-ray light, is a specific kind of light with a short wavelength. This type of light is emitted from your computer screen, your , your flat-screen television, and many other devices that have screens. The average person’s blue light exposure has increased exponentially in recent years as smartphones and laptops become more prevalent in daily life. But physicians are observing that blue light exposure may actually damage our eyes, according to a . To help reduce damage from blue light, and lenses have been introduced. These may help limit the amount of blue light exposure your eyes get every day. Researchers are still working to understand what blue light can do to your eyes over time. In the meantime, evidence suggests that these types of lenses, along with certain lifestyle choices, can help treat blue-light-related symptoms like and . Read on to learn what we know about blue light glasses, as well as what you can do to help prevent negative side effects from this type of light. Blue light is a type of visible light on the light spectrum. It has a relatively short wavelength of 415 to 455 nanometers. Because of this, blue light rays contain more energy than many other light types. Blue light isn’t produced by artificial sources only. We see blue light naturally every time we look up at a blue sky. For thousands of years, humans were exposed to blue light only during the hours that the sun was up. So, our brains are trained to interpret blue light as a cue to be alert, energetic, and keep our bodies ready for action. That’s why blue light exposure from a device can confuse your body. Your waking and can be by high levels of blue light exposure — for example, from an artificial source (like your smartphone) in an otherwise dark environment. And if you’re exposed to too much blue light during the day, your eyes can grow fatigued. Dry eye is also a side effect of too much blue light exposure. You may be on your devices for more than 10 hours each day, both at home and at work — so you might be all too familiar with these symptoms. Enter blue light glasses. These types of glasses are meant to filter blue light as light waves pass into your eyes. The idea is that this would allow you to use sources of blue light, like smartphones and laptops, with minimal side effects. The doesn’t currently recommend special blue-light-filtering glasses for use when you work with computers. This may change in the future. A intends to more comprehensively examine whether blue light glasses have definitive benefits. But in general, the evidence for blue light glasses as a preventive measure for reducing blue light exposure is mixed. A of three clinical trials found “poor” evidence to support the use of blue-light-blocking glasses to preserve eye health and prevent dry eye. And another found that only one-third of study participants said they benefited from using glasses with a blue-light-blocking coating on the lens. These participants claimed that the glasses reduced glare and improved vision during the time they were looking at their screens. It’s also worth noting that this latter study was funded by blue-light-blocking lens retailer Swiss Lens Laboratory Ltd. This can indicate some bias in study results, due to private funding with a vested interest in outcomes that may drive company profit. Are there any lifestyle tips for reducing blue light exposure? You don’t have to purchase blue light glasses to reduce your exposure to blue-ray light. Protect your eyes from eyestrain and fatigue by adopting some eye-health-friendly habits, including: You can do this by going on during the day. Avoid checking your phone during these breaks. You can also get during time outside and connect with the , which can both decrease stress. Consider using red light as opposed to an LED bulb as a nightlight in your bedroom. Red light is less likely to disrupt your because red wavelengths are shorter. . Screen-free time — perhaps spent reading, crocheting, or baking — can help decrease your blue light exposure. You can set these up in your home, and they’ll emit lower levels of blue light. Make an effort to avoid screens for the 2 to 3 hours before you turn in for the night. You can retreat to these spots for a momentary break from blue light exposure. You can do this by using . Consider setting up an email signature or text “away message.” This can let people know you are trying to avoid screen time. Advise them to call instead if they need you immediately. This can reduce the stress of feeling the constant need to look at your phone later at night. Some phones have options for “wind down” or “night” modes that change light emissions to a warmer tone for less blue light exposure. You can get these for your phone and laptop. According to a , research suggests that over time blue light exposure can result in more than just eyestrain and fatigue. Computer vision syndrome, a set of symptoms related to screen time, is experienced by up to 90 percent of computer users, according to . The signals that blue light sends to your brain can also disrupt your body’s production of the sleep hormone . This can make it hard to fall asleep and stay asleep after using your devices at night. And beyond sleep quality, melatonin disruption throws off the entire in your body. Poor sleep quality can also change the way that your body feels stress. When you aren’t getting REM sleep, your mind isn’t able to fully relax. Blue light exposure may already be causing you to have symptoms like eyestrain and dry eye. If these symptoms don’t resolve with lifestyle changes and self-care strategies, speak with an eye doctor about them. You should also make an appointment with an eye doctor if you experience the following: As far as blue light glasses go, the definitive verdict is still out in their ability to substantively reduce your exposure to blue light and the associated symptoms of exposure. But limiting blue-light exposure, adopting habits to take better care of your eyes, and taking breaks from your screens can all help you avoid dry eye and eyestrain caused by blue light exposure. — By blocking blue light in the evening, you can prevent the disruption in the natural sleep-wake cycle caused by artificial lighting and electronics.

Glass also uses many existing Google applications, such as , , , and . Many developers and companies built applications for Glass, including news apps, , exercise, photo manipulation, translation, and sharing to social networks, such as and . Third-party applications announced at (SXSW) include , , , and . On March 23, 2013, Google released the Mirror API, allowing developers to start making apps for Glass. In the terms of service, it was stated that developers may not put ads in their apps or charge fees; a Google representative told The Verge that this might change in the future. On May 16, 2013, Google announced the release of seven new programs, including reminders from Evernote, fashion news from , and news alerts from . Following Google's XE7 Glass Explorer Edition update in early July 2013, evidence of a ""Glass Boutique"", a store that will allow synchronization to Glass of and , was noted. Version XE8 made a debut for Google Glass on August 12, 2013. It brings an integrated video player with playback controls, the ability to post an update to Path, and lets users save notes to Evernote. Several other minute improvements include volume controls, improved voice recognition, and several new Google Now cards. On November 19, 2013, Google unveiled its Glass Development Kit, showcasing the translation tool , the cooking program AllTheCooks, and the exercise program among others as successful examples. Google announced three news programs in May 2014—TripIt, FourSquare and OpenTable—in order to entice travelers. On June 25, 2014, Google announced that notifications from would be sent to Glass. The published the first book to be read with Google Glass on October 8, 2014, as introduced at the . The book can be read as a normal paper book or—enriched with multimedia elements—with Google Glass, Kindle, on Smartphone and Pads on the platforms iOS and Android. Google offered a companion Android and iOS app called MyGlass, which allowed the user to configure and manage the device. It was removed on February 22, 2020 from the Play Store. Other than the touchpad, Google Glass can be controlled using just ""voice actions"". To activate Glass, wearers tilt their heads 30° upward (which can be altered for preference) or simply tap the touchpad, and say ""O.K., Glass."" Once Glass is activated, wearers can say an action, such as ""Take a picture"", ""Record a video"", ""Hangout with [person/Google+ circle]"", ""Google 'What year was Wikipedia founded?'"", ""Give me directions to the Eiffel Tower"", and ""Send a message to John"" (many of these commands can be seen in a product video released in February 2013). For search results that are read back to the user, the voice response is relayed using through a transducer that sits beside the ear, thereby rendering the sound almost inaudible to other people. developed an app for the wearable device that allows physicians to live-stream the patient visit and claims it will eliminate problems, possibly saving them up to 15 hours a week and improving record quality. The video stream is passed to remote in secure rooms where the doctor-patient interaction is transcribed. Ultimately, allowing physicians to focus on the patient. Hundreds of users were evaluating the app as of mid-2015. In July 2013, commenced research on the usability and impact of Google Glass in the field. As of August 2013, Engelen, based at and in Europe at , was the first healthcare professional in Europe to participate in the Glass Explorer program. His research on Google Glass (starting August 9, 2013) was conducted in operating rooms, ambulances, a trauma helicopter, general practice, and home care as well as the use in public transportation for visually or physically impaired. Research included taking pictures, videos streaming to other locations, dictating operative log, having students watch the procedures and tele-consultation through . Engelen documented his findings in blogs, videos, pictures, on , and on , with research ongoing as of that date. In June 2014, Google Glass' ability to acquire images of a patient's retina (""Glass "") was publicly demonstrated for the first time at the Wilmer Clinical Meeting at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine by Dr. Aaron Wang and Dr. Allen Eghrari. This technique was featured on the cover of the Journal for Mobile Technology in Medicine for January 2015. Doctors Phil Haslam and Sebastian Mafeld demonstrated the first application of Google Glass in the field of interventional radiology. They demonstrated how Google Glass could assist a liver biopsy and , and the pair stated that Google Glass has the potential to improve patient safety, operator comfort, and procedure efficiency in the field of interventional radiology. In 2015, IOS Press published ""Clinical and Surgical Applications of Smart Glasses"" a research article written by a team at the Columbia University Medical Center Department of Neurosurgery's Cerebrovascular Laboratory. Under Neurosurgeon Dr. Sander E. Connolly, Stefan Mitrasinovic, Elvis Camacho, Nirali Trivedi, and others analyzed Google Glass's useful applications including hands-free photo and video documentation, telemedicine, Electronic Health Record retrieval and input, rapid diagnostic test analysis, education, and live broadcasting. In 2017, Swiss researchers assessed in a randomized controlled trial the adherence of emergency team leaders to the American Heart Association's (AHA) Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) guidelines by adapting and displaying them in Google Glasses during simulation-based pediatric cardiac arrest scenarios. On June 20, 2013, Rafael J. Grossmann, a Venezuelan doctor practicing in the U.S., was the first surgeon to demonstrate the use of Google Glass during a live surgical procedure. In August 2013, Google Glass was used at . Surgeon Dr. Christopher Kaeding used Google Glass to consult with a distant colleague in . A group of students at The Ohio State University College of Medicine also observed the operation on their laptop computers. Following the procedure, Kaeding stated, ""To be honest, once we got into the surgery, I often forgot the device was there. It just seemed very intuitive and fit seamlessly."" On June 21, 2013, Spanish doctor Pedro Guillen, chief of trauma service of Clínica CEMTRO of Madrid, also broadcast a surgery using Google Glass. In July 2014, the Surgery Academy, in , Italy, launched a remote training platform for medical students. The platform is a that allows students to join any thanks to Google Glass worn by surgeon. Also in July 2014, This Place released an app, , to connect Glass to a monitor to allow people to take photos and share them to or using brain signals. It is hoped this will allow people with severe physical disabilities to engage with social media. Two participants in the Google Glass Breastfeeding app trial. In Australia, during January 2014, tech startup collaborated with the to create the first hands-free breastfeeding Google Glass application for new mothers. The application, named Google Glass Breastfeeding app trial, allows mothers to nurse their baby while viewing instructions about common breastfeeding issues (latching on, posture etc.) or call a lactation consultant via a secure Google Hangout, who can view the issue through the mother's Google Glass camera. The trial lasted 7 weeks, commencing on March 1 and ending on April 13, 2014. There were five mothers and their newborn babies in the trial, fifteen volunteer counselors from ABA, and seven project team members from . The counselors were located in five States across Australia. The counselors were certified in lactation consultation, and located as far from the mothers as , Western Australia, 3,500 kilometres away. While physically distant from the mothers, the counselors provided support using video calls with Google Glass, live on demand. According to media commentary, the breastfeeding project demonstrated the potential of wearable devices to provide ways for communities to deliver health and family support services across vast distances. The demonstrated positive uses of such devices contrasted widespread criticism over privacy concerns which such devices. An article in the motherboard magazine stated, ""Google Glass, whether warranted or not, endures its fair share of criticism, largely because a lot of initial use cases have been, well, kinda creepy. So it's great to instead see Glass being used for uniquely positive ends, as it is with the Australian Breastfeeding Association's Breastfeeding Support Project."" Other journalists and commentators also called the trial beneficial and an innovative application wearable technologies. journalist/presenter Penny Johnston of the Babytalk radio program remarked, ""The Google Glass if you think about it, is perfect to coach someone in breast feeding: if you are holding or feeding a baby, imagine a camera mounted on your glasses and look down. There you have the world's best view for checking the baby's latch and your breastfeeding technique!"" In May 2014, and ABA won the Gold Questar Award in the Emerging Media: App section, for the Breastfeeding with Google Glass App. In June 2014, Small World Social's Breastfeeding Support Project was awarded the Questar Best of Category Grand Prize For Emerging Media, which is given to the top 5% of entries. ABA is optimistic about the future of wearable technologies supporting their work. is planning to commence a trial in the US in June 2014. This article needs to be . The reason given is: No results are reported, after more than a year. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. Brain Power, LLC, is a neuroscience technology company located in Cambridge, MA. It is software that transformed Google Glass into the world's first wearable AI system for autism. Brain Power was founded by Dr. Ned T. Sahin. After years of research and clinical trials, Brain Power's Empowered Brain system was created to allow people with autism to teach themselves life skills crucial to self-sufficiency, e.g. emotion decoding, eye contact, language, social engagement, conversation skills, control of behaviors, etc. Orders for the Empowered Brain system were placed in 2018, during a crowdfunding campaign. In July 2019, a article featured 12-year-old Esaïe Prickett, a child with autism. The article describes Esaïe as the only one wearing Google glass as he sits in the living room with his mother, father and four older brothers. Esaïe's father Jeffrey Prickett said that Esaïe enjoys using apps and watching and that it could help autistic children such as Esaïe understand emotions and engage in more direct ways with those around them. In 2014, Television Correspondent Carolyn Presutti and VOA Electronics Engineer Jose Vega began a web project called VOA & Google Glass, which explored the technology's potential uses in journalism. This series of news stories examined the technology's live reporting applications, including conducting interviews and covering stories from the reporter's point of view. On March 29, 2014, American group partnered with Voice of America when lead singer Scott Hoying wore Glass in the band's performance at in , during the band's worldwide tour—the first use of Glass by a lead singer in a professional concert. In the fall of 2014, The conducted a course called Glass Journalism, which explored the device's application in journalism. The as of mid-2014 used Google Glass and to track various animals and birds in the jungle, which may be the first use of the device by a non-profit, non-governmental organization (NGO). In 2014, the International Olympic Committee Young Reporters program took Google Glass to the Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games and put them on a number of athletes from different disciplines to explore novel point of view filmmaking. A visually impaired dancer, Benjamin Yonattan, used Google Glass to overcome his chronic vision condition. In 2015, Yonattan performed on the reality television program . Concerns have been raised by various sources regarding the intrusion on privacy, and the and of using the device in public and recording people without their permission. Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, claims that Glass could be seen as a way to become even more isolated in public, but the intent was quite the opposite: Brin views checking social media as a constant ""nervous tic"", which is why Glass can notify the user of important notifications and updates and does not obstruct the line of sight. Additionally, there is controversy that Google Glass would cause problems and violate rights. Organizations like the work to uphold privacy rights through Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPS), which are guidelines representing concepts that concern fair information practice in an electronic marketplace. Privacy advocates are concerned that people wearing such eyewear may be able to identify strangers in public using facial recognition, or surreptitiously record and broadcast private conversations. The ""Find my Face"" feature on Google+ functions to create a model of your face, and of people you know, in order to simplify tagging photos. However, the only current app that can identify strangers is called MORIS (Mobile Offender Recognition and Identification System), and is a $3,000 iPhone app used by police officers. Some companies in the US have posted anti-Google Glass signs in their establishments. In July 2013, prior to the official release of the product, Stephen Balaban, co-founder of software company Lambda Labs, circumvented Google's facial recognition app block by building his own, non-Google-approved operating system. Balaban then installed face-scanning Glassware that creates a summary of commonalities shared by the scanned person and the Glass wearer, such as mutual friends and interests. Also created was , a program that allows a Google Glass user to take a photo with a wink of an eye, while Marc Rogers, a principal security researcher at Lookout, discovered that Glass can be hijacked if a user could be tricked into taking a picture of a malicious QR code, demonstrating the potential to be used as a weapon in . In February 2013, a Google+ user noticed legal issues with Glass and posted in the Glass Explorers community about the issues, stating that the device may be illegal to use according to the current legislation in Russia and Ukraine, which prohibits use of spy gadgets that can record video, audio or take photographs in an inconspicuous manner. Concerns were also raised in regard to the privacy and security of Glass users in the event that the device is stolen or lost, an issue that was raised by a US congressional committee. As part of its response to the committee, Google stated that a locking system for the device is in development. Google also reminded users that Glass can be remotely reset. Police in various states have also warned Glass wearers to watch out for muggers and street robbers. Lisa A. Goldstein, a freelance journalist who was born deaf, tested the product on behalf of people with disabilities and published a review on August 6, 2013. In her review, Goldstein states that Google Glass does not accommodate hearing aids and is not suitable for people who cannot understand speech. Goldstein also explained the limited options for customer support, as telephone contact was her only means of communication. Several facilities have banned the use of Google Glass before its release to the general public, citing concerns over potential privacy-violating capabilities. Other facilities, such as casinos, banned Google Glass, citing their desire to comply with Nevada state law and common gaming regulations that ban the use of recording devices near gambling areas. On October 29, 2014, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO) announced a ban on wearable technology including Google Glass, placing it under the same rules as mobile phones and video cameras. There have also been concerns over potential eye pain caused by users new to Glass. These concerns were validated by Google's optometry advisor Dr. Eli Peli of , though he later partly backtracked due to the controversy that ensued from his remarks. Concerns have been raised by cyber forensics experts at the who have developed a way to steal smartphone and tablet passwords using Google Glass. The specialists developed a software program that uses Google Glass to track finger shadows as someone types in their password. Their program then converts the touchpoints into the keys they were touching, allowing them to catch the passcodes. Another concern regarding the camera application raises controversy to privacy. Some people are concerned about how the product has the capability of recording during events such as conversations. The device sets off a light to indicate that it is recording but many speculate that there will be an app to disable this. Users have been derisively referred to as ""Glassholes"". Concerns have also been raised on operating motor vehicles while wearing the device. On July 31, 2013 it was reported that driving while wearing Google Glass was likely to be banned in the UK, being deemed careless driving, therefore a fixed penalty offense, following a decision by the . In the US, state representative introduced an amendment in March 2013 to the state's law against texting while driving that would include bans against ""using a wearable computer with head mounted display"". In an interview, Howell stated, ""The primary thing is a safety concern, it [the glass headset] could project text or video into your field of vision. I think there's a lot of potential for distraction."" In October 2013, a driver in was ticketed for ""driving with monitor visible to driver (Google Glass)"" after being pulled over for speeding by a officer. The driver was reportedly the first to be fined for driving while wearing a Google Glass. While the judge noted that ""Google Glass fell under 'the purview and intent' of the ban on driving with a monitor"", the case was thrown out of court due to lack of proof the device was on at the time. In November 2014, Sawyer et al., from the and the US , published the results of comparative study in a . Subjects were asked to use either Google Glass or a smartphone-based messaging interface and were then interrupted with an emergency event. The Glass-delivered messages served to moderate but did not eliminate distracting . A potential passive cost to drivers merely wearing the Glass was also observed. Messaging using either device impaired driving as compared to driving without multi-tasking. In February 2014, a woman wearing Google Glass claimed she was verbally and physically assaulted at a bar in San Francisco after a patron confronted her while she was showing off the device, allegedly leading a man accompanying her to physically retaliate. Witnesses suggested that patrons were upset over the possibility of being recorded. Under the Google Glass terms of service for the Glass Explorer pre-public release program, it specifically states, ""You may not resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person. If you resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person without Google's authorization, Google reserves the right to deactivate the device, and neither you nor the unauthorized person using the device will be entitled to any refund, product support, or product warranty."" commented on this policy of a company claiming ownership of its product after it had been sold, saying: ""Welcome to the New World, one in which companies are retaining control of their products even after consumers purchase them."" Others pointed out that Glass was not for public sale at all, but rather in private testing for selected developers, and that not allowing developers in a closed beta to sell to the public is not the same as banning consumers from reselling a publicly released device.

Eyestrain can be annoying. But it usually isn't serious and goes away once you rest your eyes or take other steps to reduce your eye discomfort. In some cases, signs and symptoms of eyestrain can indicate an underlying eye condition that needs treatment. See your doctor if self-care steps don't relieve your eyestrain. Driving long distances and doing other activities involving extended focus Having an underlying eye problem, such as dry eyes or uncorrected vision (refractive error) Exposure to dry moving air from a fan, heating or air-conditioning system Extended use of computers and other digital devices is one of the most common causes of eyestrain. The American Optometric Association calls this computer vision syndrome, or digital eyestrain. People who look at screens two or more hours in a row every day are at greatest risk of this condition. Computer use strains eyes more than reading print material because people tend to: Blink less while using computers (blinking is key to moistening the eyes) View digital screens at less-than-ideal distances or angles Use devices with poor contrast between the text and the background In some cases, an underlying eye problem, such as eye muscle imbalance or uncorrected vision, can cause or worsen computer eyestrain. Some other factors that can make the condition worse include: Circulating air, such as from air conditioning or a nearby fan Eyestrain doesn't have serious or long-term consequences, but it can be aggravating and unpleasant. It can make you tired and reduce your ability to concentrate. If you have eye discomfort, headache, or vision changes that don't improve with self-care, make an appointment with your doctor. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment. and for how long. including any other medical conditions and any medications, vitamins, and supplements you're taking. Keep a daily log of the time you spend on activities that strain your eyes, such as looking at digital devices, reading, and being exposed to glare. your doctor. Creating a list of questions can help you make the most of your time with your doctor. For eyestrain, some basic questions to ask your doctor include: What changes could I make to my work or home environment, including my computer desk, to help reduce symptoms? Your doctor may ask a number of questions, such as: Do you work in an air-conditioned environment or does a fan or vent blow air around your face? How much time do you spend on digital devices each day? Does anything in particular seem to trigger your symptoms? Your eye doctor will ask you questions about factors that might be causing your symptoms. He or she will perform an eye exam, including testing your vision. Generally, treatment for eyestrain consists of making changes in your daily habits or environment. Some people may need treatment for an underlying eye condition. For some people, wearing glasses that are prescribed for specific activities, such as using a computer or reading, helps reduce eyestrain. Your doctor may suggest that you do regular eye exercises to help your eyes focus at different distances. Consider these tips to reduce or prevent eyestrain. When watching television, it may be easier on your eyes if you keep the room softly lit. When reading printed materials or doing close work, try to position the light source behind you and direct the light onto your page or task. If you're reading at a desk, use a shaded light positioned in front of you. The shade will keep light from shining directly into your eyes. When doing close work, take occasional breaks and ease muscle tension with relaxation exercises. Place your elbows on your desk, palms facing up. Let your weight fall forward and your head fall into your hands. Position your head so that your hands cover your eyes, with your fingers extended toward your forehead. Close your eyes and take a deep breath through your nose; hold it for four seconds, then exhale. Continue this deep breathing for 15 to 30 seconds. Perform this simple exercise several times a day. This is especially important for children, who may not make the connection between extended viewing, eyestrain, and the need to rest their eyes regularly. Over-the-counter artificial tears can help prevent and relieve dry eyes. Use them even when your eyes feel fine to keep them well-lubricated and prevent a recurrence of symptoms. Your doctor can suggest which drops might be best for you. Lubricating drops that don't contain preservatives can be used as often as you need. If the drops you're using contain preservatives, don't use them more than four times a day. Avoid eyedrops with a redness remover, as these may worsen dry eye symptoms. Some changes that may help prevent dry eyes include using a humidifier, adjusting the thermostat to reduce blowing air, and avoiding smoke. If you smoke, consider quitting. Moving your chair to a different area may help reduce the amount of dry moving air on your eyes and face. If you need glasses or contacts and work at a computer, consider investing in glasses or contact lenses designed specifically for computer work. Ask your optometrist about lens coatings and tints that might help too. If you drive long distances, consider wearing sunglasses with polarized lenses and UV protection. Computer use is a common cause of eyestrain. If you work at a desk and use a computer, these self-care steps can help take some of the strain off your eyes. Many people blink less than usual when working at a computer, which can contribute to dry eyes. Blinking produces tears that moisten and refresh your eyes. Try to make it a habit to blink more often when looking at a monitor. Throughout the day, give your eyes a break by looking away from your monitor. Try the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. Bright lighting and too much glare can strain your eyes and make it difficult to see objects on your monitor. The worst problems are generally from sources above or behind you, including fluorescent lighting and sunlight. Consider turning off some or all of the overhead lights. If you need light for writing or reading, use an adjustable desk lamp. And close blinds or shades and avoid placing your monitor directly in front of a window or white wall. Place an anti-glare cover over the screen. Position your monitor directly in front of you about an arm's length away so that the top of the screen is at or just below eye level. It helps to have a chair you can adjust too. If you need to refer to print material while you work on your computer, place them on a document holder. Some holders are designed to be placed between the keyboard and monitor; others are placed to the side. Find one that works for you. The goal is to reduce how much your eyes need to readjust and how often you turn your neck and head. Enlarge the type for easier reading. And adjust the contrast and brightness to a level that's comfortable for you. Wipe the dust from your computer screen regularly. Dust lowers contrast and contributes to glare and reflection problems. Some eyestrain symptoms may be relieved by natural products, such as fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids) and bilberry, but further study is needed. Talk with your doctor if you're considering supplements to help relieve your signs and symptoms. ©1998-2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). All rights reserved.

Next to your smartphone, you probably spend more time with your computer than anything else in your life—especially if you regularly use it for work. But research has found that can seriously in the form of a condition known as Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS). A report on the condition published in the journal estimates that 70 million people are at risk for CVS. But what is it, exactly? Researchers define CVS as “an association between computer use and .” The most common symptoms include headaches, eye strain, double vision, dry eyes, and eye fatigue, although neck and back pain can occur as well. And research has shown that 70 to 90 percent of people who use computers a lot have at least one symptom of CVS. “It is concluded that, as computer users are increasing rapidly, they are at risk of CVS,” the report’s authors wrote. A lot of us have to regularly use a computer for work or school. Is this something we should be worried about? Unfortunately, yes. David Tanzer, M.D., chief medical officer and divisional vice president of medical affairs for Abbott’s vision business, tells SELF that CVS cases are “growing at an alarming rate.” “Viewing a computer or digital device makes the eyes work harder,” he explains. “Letters on a screen are generally not as sharp and don’t have as much contrast with their background as on printed material. Further, screens have the added complications of glare and reflection affecting readability.” People also blink less often when staring at a computer screen, he says, which can lead to dry eyes. Normally, people blink about 18 times a minute, but only blink half as often when viewing a computer or phone screen, he says. Robert J. Noecker, M.D., an ophthalmologist with , tells SELF that a lowered blink rate can spell trouble for your eyes. “This extra time means that the surface of our eye has more time to dry out,” he says. “Drying out means cells fall off the surface of the eye faster than they can be replaced.” And when that happens, the surface of your eye can get inflamed, causing blurred vision and discomfort. It’s not just your eyes that feel the burn. Aaron Zimmerman, O.D., an associate professor of clinical optometry at The Ohio State University, tells SELF that the eyestrain usually leads to , typically around the eyes, that will go away or diminish when you step away from your computer. You can also get tension headaches (i.e. headaches in the back of your head) from poor posture in front of your computer. Luckily, you’re not SOL if you have to sit in front of a computer for work. Zimmerman recommends taking short, regular breaks from your screen and using artificial tears if you tend to get dry eyes while you work. If that still doesn’t help, see your doctor. “There may be an underlying binocular vision problem or improper correction,” Zimmerman says. “An eye care professional can easily identify those issues.” Think CVS can’t happen to you? Experts say that's just not the case. CVS “probably happens to everyone who uses a screen to some extent,” Noecker says—it’s just that some people are more symptomatic than others. He adds, “In some ways, it is a rising epidemic.” This Optical Illusion Can Actually Tell You About How Good Your Vision Is Korin is a former New Yorker who now lives at the beach.

Will your beloved time with your computer, smartphone, and tablets come back to bite you in blurred vision? Learn how to preserve your eyesight in an increasingly digital world If you find yourself looking in the mirror at the end of a long day only to see the bloodshot eyes of a crackhead staring back at you, it may be because you are addicted to something—your digital devices. A new problem that some eye experts are calling computer vision syndrome (CVS) is sweeping the country; it can affect up to 90 percent of people who spend two or more continuous hours a day with their eyes glued to a screen, whether it's that of a computer, an e-reader, or a smartphone. The symptoms, which can include , headaches, dry eyes, or even long-term nearsightedness, may accrue over a period of days or months—but don't wait until you sense something is wrong. Start preventing the problem today. ""Our eyes have evolved for three-dimensional viewing,"" says New York City–based optometrist Andrea Thau, O.D., of the American Optometric Association, ""so we wind up overfocusing as we strain to find a 3-D image on a close-up 2-D screen."" What's more, the eye's natural focal point lies about 20 feet in front of the face. Most people, however, sit less than two feet from their computer screen, forcing a ring of eye muscles to continuously contract in order to redirect focus. If you stare at any sort of digital monitor for hours, those eye muscles can become so overwrought that they can't relax, even after you look away. The resulting blurred vision, a main CVS symptom, often clears up in as little as a few seconds, but if you hit this hazy point a lot—as in several times a day, most days of the week—then the short-term nearsightedness might become permanent. (It's still up for debate whether or not the problem is reversible. The American Optometric Association warns that it might not be, while the American Academy of Ophthalmology, an M.D. association, considers CVS to be a temporary, day-to-day annoyance that improves as soon as you take some time away from staring at a screen.) One thing that's, er, crystal clear is CVS's other big troubling symptom: dry eyes. Parched, itchy peepers may sound trivial compared with lost vision, but frequent dryness can lead to infection. The thing is, your eyes can't differentiate between a mind-numbing spreadsheet and a flirty e-mail from the hot guy you've just started dating. To them, any on-screen activity is so captivating that blinking typically becomes an afterthought. Case in point: A recent study found that most people blink an average of 16 times per minute, regularly whisking away debris and keeping their eyeballs well-oiled for optimal function. However, when settled in front of digital screens, those same people blinked fewer than six times per minute, leaving the door open for seriously dry, irritated eyes. Chucking your computer, iPad, or smartphone and taking up an Amish-like 19th-century lifestyle isn't necessary; most CVS symptoms can be controlled. The first step: Start living by a simple 20-20-20 rule, says Thau. Look away from your screen every 20 minutes for 20 seconds and focus on a fixed point 20 feet away. Set an alarm via to remind yourself to get into the habit. Like any exercise, this eye movement works best when practiced regularly, but every little bit will help. Next, make sure your workstation—at the office or at home—is set up so that your eyes are level with the very top of your monitor, says Louise Sclafani, O.D., director of optometric services at the University of Chicago Medical Center. Your eyes focus best when they're looking downward, she notes, and partially closed lids can combat dry eyes by preventing tears from evaporating. Cutting down on any annoying glare helps too. If you're holding a smartphone or e-reader and have to cup one hand over the screen to read the words on it, you could be straining your eyes and risking CVS, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Close the blinds, adjust your device's contrast or brightness levels, or buy an inexpensive antiglare cover. Still holding on to your 20/20? Even if your eyesight is top-notch, you may want to consider getting fitted for computer glasses, says Thau. Unlike corrective lenses for near- or farsightedness, these reduce eyestrain by helping your midrange vision. Your doctor can even prescribe an all-in-one pair of lenses that will correct CVS and any other sight issue. (That said, always make sure the prescription you have is up to date; even a slight uncorrected flaw in your vision can exacerbate the symptoms of CVS.) Above all, when in doubt, blink it out. Whenever you sit in front of a screen for hours at a time (and for most people that's practically every day), try to remember to combat overly dry eyes by blinking very slowly—as if you're fading off to sleep—every so often. Small breaks and a healthy perspective are the keys to beating CVS. ""Yes, computers can be a visual challenge for our eyes,"" says Thau, ""but when used with caution, they won't do permanent damage.""

As we spend more time in front of our devices, users everywhere have experienced eye strain from increased usage of screens. Digital eye strain is caused by looking at screens for an extended period of time. And while the immediate discomfort of digital eye strain — including headaches, blurred vision, dry eyes, and neck and shoulder pain — is easily apparent to most sufferers, overexposure to blue light (especially from our devices) can have long term negative consequences on our vision. promises that their blue-light-filtering glasses can alleviate the symptoms of digital eye strain. The brand manufactures stylish glasses that are primarily designed to filter out the blue light that leads to eye strain, headaches, dry eyes. Additionally, the lenses on these glasses have an anti-reflective coating meant to reduce glare and provide better contrast when you're looking at any screen — be it a phone, a tablet, or a computer. We were interested to see if Baxter Blue could keep our eyes feeling fresh even after long days of work, so we got a pair and put them to the test among people who work at a computer. Here’s what we found. There are days when we do not step away from the computer for more than a few minutes at a time for nearly nine hours. After that, we’re typically unwinding with video games, movies, TV, or our Kindle. By the time we go to bed, we’ve put our eyes through a full day’s worth of exposure to blue light from our devices. The result of all that screen time? As we wind down in the evening we notice a little pressure behind the eyes and sometimes, a headache develops as well. It can also be difficult to fall asleep. Picking out glasses on the website was a fairly simple process. We started by reviewing the sizing guide, located near the bottom of the ""Shop"" dropdown menu. Once you're on the sizing guide page, you can read tips about how to choose the best pair of glasses for your face shape and skin tone. After perusing the sizing guide to learn about various types of frames, we started shopping. The glasses are categorized by adult and kids styles. After narrowing our picks down to a few favorites, we took advantage of the “Virtual Try-On” feature, which used our computer’s camera to digitally place the glasses on our faces so we could see exactly what we’d look like wearing the pairs we selected. While this may sound time-consuming, it’s actually very quick and easy. The entire process only took about 10 minutes. The delivery of our went as expected — we placed the order, waited a few days, then received the glasses in the mail. Our glasses didn't come with any instructions or tools to make fit adjustments, but luckily they fit straight out of the box. The glasses had a nice heft to them, which we took to mean they were made of quality materials. The lenses arrived clean and unmarred, and the delivery came with a complimentary lens. We liked the smooth operation of the hinges, and we thought the earpieces provided a comfortable wearing experience. The overall size of the lenses is dependent on the style of frame that you purchase. While trying on various frames in the virtual try-on sessions, it was fairly obvious which lenses seemed too large and which seemed too small. Since there’s such a wide variety of styles to choose from, we think everyone (even kids) should be able to find a pair that fits their face. The most important test we performed was finding out if could actually alleviate digital eye strain. We were diligent about keeping the glasses on any time we looked at a screen, including a phone. After wearing the Baxter Blue glasses for just a week, we noticed no pressure behind our eyes or headaches at the end of the day. This was a marked improvement. From our experience, the glasses performed as advertised. are $89. If your eye strain symptoms are a daily occurrence or they interfere with your ability to get work done, we think this cost is easy to justify considering the glasses' effectiveness. If you only have mild or occasional symptoms that you can easily tolerate, you may want to consider whether you'll wear them enough to justify the cost. In our experience, we found the Baxter Blues to be fairly priced for their performance. While the Virtual Try-On feature is handy, it’s important to remember that it is just a digital approximation of how these glasses will fit. After trying the glasses on at home, we realized that the pair we purchased wouldn’t have been comfortable for someone with a narrow nose bridge, for instance. However, if you use the Virtual Try-On in conjunction with the measurements provided on the sizing page — where they detail the bridge width — then you should be able to make a near-perfect selection. These are not bargain-brand blue light blocking glasses. They're higher quality than many other options available, including other blue light glasses we've tried. We found that are durable, comfortable, and they seem to do what they're designed to do: relieve digital eye strain. They are lightweight and stylish too. The only downside we discovered to these otherwise impressive glasses is that the lenses may be positioned a little too close to the eye — eyelashes can brush the lenses when the glasses are tucked tightly on the nose. However, if you adjust where the glasses sit on your nose, you can make suitable accommodations. offers a quality product that provides a comfortable fit.

It's best to use a warmer (yellowish) color temperature in dark rooms and a colder (bluer) color temperature in bright rooms. The easiest way to optimize your monitor's color temperature is to use . This app uses your computer's location to determine whether the sun is up or down, then it automatically adjust your display to pre-determined color temperatures that best match the natural lighting environment. Color temps are measured in degrees of Kelvin, with the scale ranging from 1,000 to 10,000. During the daylight hours, it's best to keep your monitor relatively cool with a default color temperature of 6,500K. At night, the color temperature should be warmer, and around 3,400K. You can adjust your monitor's settings manually, or you can let f.lux make the changes for you. The app also has some presets with specific color temperatures that you can select from. F.lux is free and available on Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, and some Android devices. If your Android phone can't run the F.lux app, you can check out . The app performs a similar function by reducing the blue light of your phone and warming the color temperature during evening hours.

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development Your eye doctor will ask you questions about factors that might be causing your symptoms. He or she will perform an eye exam, including testing your vision. Generally, treatment for eyestrain consists of making changes in your daily habits or environment. Some people may need treatment for an underlying eye condition. For some people, wearing glasses that are prescribed for specific activities, such as for computer use or for reading, helps reduce eyestrain. Your doctor may suggest that you take regular eye breaks to help your eyes focus at different distances. Consider these tips to reduce or prevent eyestrain. When watching television, it may be easier on your eyes if you keep the room softly lit. When reading printed materials or doing close work, try to position the light source behind you and direct the light onto your page or task. If you're reading at a desk, use a shaded light positioned in front of you. The shade will keep light from shining directly into your eyes. When doing close work, take occasional breaks and rest your eyes by looking away from the digital screen. This is especially important for children, who may not make the connection between extended viewing, eyestrain and the need to rest their eyes regularly. Over-the-counter artificial tears can help prevent and relieve dry eyes. Use them even when your eyes feel fine to keep them well-lubricated and prevent a recurrence of symptoms. Your doctor can suggest which eyedrops might be best for you. Lubricating drops that don't contain preservatives can be used as often as you need. If the drops you're using contain preservatives, don't use them more than four times a day. Avoid eyedrops with a redness remover, as these may worsen dry eye symptoms. Some changes that may help prevent dry eyes include using a humidifier, adjusting the thermostat to reduce blowing air and avoiding smoke. If you smoke, consider quitting. Moving your chair to a different area may help reduce the amount of dry moving air on your eyes and face. If you need glasses or contacts and work at a computer, consider investing in glasses or contact lenses designed specifically for computer work. Ask your optometrist about lens coatings and tints that might help too. Computer use is a common cause of eyestrain. If you work at a desk and use a computer, these self-care steps can help take some of the strain off your eyes. Many people blink less than usual when working at a computer, which can contribute to dry eyes. Blinking produces tears that moisten and refresh your eyes. Try to make it a habit to blink more often when looking at a monitor. Throughout the day, give your eyes a break by looking away from your monitor. Try the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. Bright lighting and too much glare can strain your eyes and make it difficult to see objects on your monitor. The worst problems are generally from sources above or behind you, including fluorescent lighting and sunlight. Consider turning off some or all of the overhead lights. If you need light for writing or reading, use an adjustable desk lamp. Close blinds or shades, and avoid placing your monitor directly in front of a window or white wall. Place an anti-glare cover over the screen. Position your monitor directly in front of you about an arm's length away so that the top of the screen is at or just below eye level. It helps to have a chair you can adjust too. If you need to refer to print material while you work on your computer, place it on a document holder. Some holders are designed to be placed between the keyboard and monitor; others are placed to the side. Find one that works for you. The goal is to reduce how much your eyes need to readjust and how often you turn your neck and head. Enlarge the type for easier reading. And adjust the contrast and brightness to a level that's comfortable for you. Some eyestrain symptoms may be relieved by natural products, such as bilberry extract and omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil, but further study is needed. Talk with your doctor if you're considering supplements to help relieve your signs and symptoms. If you have eye discomfort, headache or vision changes that don't improve with self-care, make an appointment with your doctor. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment. and for how long. including any other medical conditions and any medications, vitamins and supplements you're taking. Keep a daily log of the time you spend on activities that strain your eyes, such as looking at digital devices, reading and being exposed to glare. your doctor. Creating a list of questions can help you make the most of your time with your doctor. For eyestrain, some basic questions to ask your doctor include: What changes could I make to my work or home environment, including my computer desk, to help reduce symptoms? Your doctor may ask a number of questions, such as: Do you work in an air-conditioned environment, or does a fan or vent blow air around your face? How much time do you spend on digital devices each day? Does anything in particular seem to trigger your symptoms? Digital devices and your eyes.

5286251a-7087-4891-9dcb-7dcdd3759e1e,"— The time children spend on tablets, phones, and computers can seriously strain their eyes, but it’s also hard on their backs and necks. It seems like children know how to operate tablets, smartphones, and computers almost from birth. But those mesmerizing screens expose them to a number of long-term health threats. The American Optometric Association’s (AOA) 2015 American Eye-Q survey found that 41 percent of parents say their kids spend three or more hours per day on digital devices. It also found that 66 percent of kids have their own smartphone or tablet. Too much screen time can result in digital eyestrain, which can include burning, itchy, or tired eyes. Headaches, fatigue, blurred or double vision, loss of focus, and head and neck pain are other threats for children using screens too often and too long. “The short-term effect of digital eyestrain is not cumulative,” Dr. Tina McCarty, an optometrist from Minnesota and member of the AOA Public Policy Committee, told Healthline. “The eyes will get better when you give them a break and/or wear the proper eyewear in the form of lenses and coatings based on the patient’s specific needs to minimize eyestrain.” Read More: Is Technology Creating a Lifetime of Pain for Millennials? » Electronic devices also give off high-energy, short-wavelength blue and violet light. This light can affect vision and cause premature aging of the eyes. Early research shows that overexposure to blue light can contribute to eyestrain and discomfort. It also can trigger serious conditions later in life such as age-related macular degeneration, which can lead to blindness. “We know that damage from UV light is cumulative in the eye and that a lifetime of protection is critical in protecting from certain eye-related disease as we age,” said McCarty. “Blue light is very near UV light in wavelength and energy and therefore there is concern for cumulative damage over a lifetime of exposure.” The younger eye typically has a keen ability to accommodate and focus on close objects as the natural lens of the eye is smaller and clearer, she said. However, the accompanying blue light is more easily transmitted to the retina, potentially causing damage. Blue light can also interrupt sleep patterns and circadian rhythms when children view screens close to bedtime. Toddlers may still be settling into healthy sleep patterns, so McCarty says it’s even more critical for blue-light exposure to be eliminated long before these children go to bed. She said there is “increasing evidence to support a link between blue light exposure and macular degeneration.” Long-term effects of blue light exposure are still being studied, though. To protect their eyes and vision, children should take frequent visual breaks. Use the 20-20-20 rule: Take a 20-second break every 20 minutes and look at something 20 feet away. As far as how many hours a day your child should be allowed to use a digital device, McCarty said there’s no standard for what’s safe. Taking breaks is the best way to protect their eyes. Children should also have eye exams each year as their eyes are still developing between the ages of 5 and 13. “Be sure that children have had an annual comprehensive eye exam to find out if the digital devices are causing any eye problems,” McCarty said. If there’s a problem, it’s easier to correct when detected early. Vision and eye health can also affect a child’s learning capacity. It’s not only the screen that can cause problems. The position a child assumes while using an electronic device is also important. Dr. Peter Ottone, a chiropractor from New Jersey, said that poor posture from computer and tablet usage has become epidemic. “This problem has always affected adults but increasingly is having an effect on children’s spines and postures as well. With increasing computer usage for school as well as for leisure enjoyment, the time kids are spending on computers is ever increasing,” he told Healthline. The slouched posture students often use when at a computer workstation increases pressure on the spinal muscles, ligaments, nerves, and disks. This increases the susceptibility for neck pain, back pain, and headaches, Ottone said. “I have noticed a large increase in teen and preteen kids with these complaints enter my office over the past several years,” Ottone said. He reports also seeing a lot of cases of “text neck” from extensive mobile phone usage. For computers at desks, Ottone said that the top of a computer screen should be at or only slightly below eye level. The chair should allow the user to be as close to the mouse/keyboard as possible so as to eliminate reaching. The feet should be flat on the floor or placed upon a raised surface. When a child uses a tablet, the same principles apply, but a pillow should go under the forearms to raise the tablet to the appropriate level so the child doesn’t have to look down at the screen. “This will also relieve some pressure from the wrists, eliminating possible carpal tunnel and tendinitis conditions,” Ottone said. “Parents should take the time to make sure their kids are using proper ergonomics with all these devices and encourage kids to take regular breaks from these postures to help reduce the overuse syndrome risks,” he added. — Medically reviewed by The sclera is the part of the eye commonly known as the “white.” It forms the supporting wall of the eyeball, and is continuous with the clear cornea… Medically reviewed by The superior oblique is a fusiform (spindle-shaped) muscle belonging to the extraocular group of muscles.

97c1fabb-452f-465c-95fd-5fdfae22d98e,"Sitting Too Close to the Computer Screen Can Make You Go Blind Eyestrain is a common—and occasionally debilitating—effect of staring at screens You roll your head, hoping to loosen the knots in your neck, and shut your eyes. After rubbing them you settle back into staring, hunched inches away from the computer screen. Despite the brief reprise your vision remains cloudy, causing the words on the monitor to blur. At this point, you need to know: With each further click on the keyboard, video watched on and e-mail sent—are you damaging your vision? Ophthalmologists, optometrists and other eye professionals note a seeming link between myopia, also called nearsightedness, and ""near work""—visual activities that take place at a distance of about 40 centimeters (16 inches) from the eye—such as reading a book. Staring at a computer screen qualifies as well, though monitors usually are around 50 centimeters (20 inches) away. But only a small—and mysterious—subset of people see myopic progression from near work, whether they are focusing on a computer or accounting books. ""We are not very clever in identifying who [is affected] yet,"" says James Sheedy, a professor at the Pacific University College of Optometry in Oregon. The fact that near work doesn't lead to myopia in all of us, however, doesn't mean sitting close to a computer screen causes no problems. Though for most it is not permanently damaging, computer near work leads to an uncomfortable, at times debilitating, list of symptoms collectively known as eyestrain. Eyestrain, says Mark Bullimore, a professor at The Ohio State University College of Optometry, results from staring at a screen over long periods of time. Such activity causes eye exhaustion: burning, dryness and muscle aches—all unpleasant and potentially incapacitating symptoms while they last. The simplest way to understand why eyestrain develops—and learn how to prevent it—is by looking at the way our built-in binoculars show us the fine print. When we ""see"" something, light reflects from an object through the cornea, the transparent, dome-shaped layer covering the eye. The cornea and the crystalline lens (a transparent, round, flexible structure behind the iris) then bend the wavelengths so they hit the rods and cones—photoreceptors on the retina that gather incoming light information. This innermost layer at the back of the eye is responsible for collecting and then moving light information, via the optic nerve, to the brain, which produces an image. Staring closely at a screen forces our ciliary muscle, which controls the shape of our lens and therefore how well we focus, to remain contracted, without rest. This is demanding—and tiring—for the poor little muscle. Up close focusing also stops us from blinking. Blinking is essential because it spreads tears over the surface of the eye; if blinking stops, the corneal surface dries out. When this happens, the cornea becomes cloudy, causing ""foggy"" vision, according to Sheedy. The normal blink rate is around 20 times per minute but using a computer can drop it to as low as seven, though experts believe this has no long-term effect. Staring at a screen—surrounded by glaring peripheral lights—also causes us to squint, says Dennis Robertson, an ophthalmology professor at the Mayo Medical School in Rochester, Minn. And though squinting cuts down on glare and prevents exorbitant amounts of light from assaulting your eyeballs (which solves some of the problems created by not blinking), it's exhausting. Freezing the muscles around your eye into a tense, squinched position all day long is just as tiring as it would be to hold a stomach-crunch for nine hours. These eyestrain symptoms usually only last a few hours, dissipating as we allow ourselves time to blink and focus on things farther away. But once they start, they hamper productivity and, more importantly, make us grumpy. All is not lost, however. We can fix these burning, aching, dried out sensations one ergonomic workstation at a time. Invest in one of today's nonglare computer screens, and don't be afraid to change your computer's brightness, contrast or text size, all of which will alleviate eye stress. Also, position your screen slightly lower than your eyes; the top of your monitor should be level with your eyebrows. For physiological problems, hit your doctor up for a pair of corrective lenses. Finally, eliminate any glaring peripheral light. To find out what lights are bothersome, Sheedy recommends performing the hand-as-visor trick: Shield your eyes with your hand, and see if that makes the tension in your face and shoulders dissipate. If it does, manually adjust the lamps you blocked out as bothersome. As for watching TV, experts recommend laughing along with your favorite sitcom from a comfortable distance. (Finally, a reason to be a couch potato.) But by far the simplest and best expert advice for eliminating eyestrain from any type of medium: take regular breaks. Go on, walk over to the water cooler, even if you aren't thirsty; and by all means, move your easy chair at least two feet from the television. Above all: don't forget to blink.

b3c83669-56c4-4407-adff-e28ce61e86a3,"Medically reviewed by — — Your eyes may feel tired or irritated after focusing intensely on activity like viewing a computer screen, reading a book, or driving a car for a long period of time. This is known as eyestrain. Eyestrain is a common condition. It’s becoming even more frequent in this digital age. Eyestrain caused by the use of digital devices like computers, smartphones, and tablets is better known as computer vision syndrome or digital eyestrain. Generally, eyestrain can be treated with simple, noninvasive methods. Prolonged eyestrain or eye irritation may be a sign of something more serious and should be discussed with your doctor. Eyestrain may occur after focusing on one particular task for an extended period of time. Some symptoms of eyestrain include: One of the biggest causes of eyestrain is the daily use of digital screens for several hours at a time. The Vision Council reports that of those in the United States use one or more digital device for more than two hours a day. And the use of digital devices is not exclusive to adults. The same report states that 76.5 percent of American children are looking at screens for more than two hours a day. These children may experience the effects of eyestrain or other conditions as a result of this digital device exposure. focusing on a single task for a long length of time, such as driving or reading being in an inadequately lit environment, either too dim or too bright experiencing poor vision or eye problems like dry eyes maintaining poor posture when viewing a digital device holding a digital device too far or too close to your eyes being exposed to extended amounts of blue light, which is the light commonly emitted from digital devices viewing a screen that doesn’t have properly adjusted lighting There are some simple things you can do to help prevent eyestrain. Some of them you can even start doing today. Often eyestrain occurs when you engage in a single activity for too long a period of time without a break. You should shift your focus to something other than the activity every 20 minutes. What you focus on should be 20 feet away, and you should look at it for at least 20 seconds. This is known as the 20-20-20 rule. You should not only look away every 20 minutes, but also make sure to turn away from an intense activity for several hours during the day. If you have to work at a screen or drive a long distance for multiple hours, make sure to balance that activity with others that demand different uses of your eyes. For example, take a walk outside in the natural light during your lunch break if you’ve spent the whole morning working on a computer. Read more: 10 things that happen when you sit down all day » Make sure you’re looking at your digital device at the correct distance and in the proper position. The screen should be a few feet away from your eyes, or about arm’s length. You should view the screen at the level of your eyes or slightly below them. This goes for handheld digital devices, too: They should be read at below eye level. Another handy tip for digital devices is to enlarge the text on the screen to best suit your comfort level. You can likely adjust text size in the settings of your device. Lighting can cause eyestrain. It can either be too dim or too bright, depending on the activity. Light should come from behind you if you’re focusing intensely on something like reading. Dimming the lights may help reduce eyestrain when watching TV. Make sure the screens that you’re viewing are adequately lit as well. Adjust the brightness as needed. Glare can contribute to eyestrain, so try shading windows or using filters to reduce glare on your digital device. It’s common to need to use printed matter or other materials when working on a computer. For example, you may need to transcribe a form or notes. If you have to refer to documents and such while using your computer, you should position them to avoid having to move your eyes, neck, and head too frequently. A document stand can help you place materials between your keyboard and your monitor, resulting in less eyestrain. Intense focus, particularly when viewing a screen, can result in a dramatic reduction in how many times you blink per minute. When you blink less, your eyes can get dry and irritated. You can resolve this with the use of eye drops like artificial tears. You can also try to blink more often when using a screen, which can prevent the symptom from occurring. You may find that you spend time in a place that has poor air quality. Dry or polluted environments and places with fans and heating and cooling units may cause eyestrain. You may want to: relocate to a spot that doesn’t have the same air issues Work with your doctor to determine if you need special eyewear to reduce eyestrain. You may even need specialized lenses, devices, or eye therapy for the activity that causes strain. Certain coatings and tints for lenses may help your eyes. Or you may find that you need to cut the time you wear contact lenses to help rest your eyes. A simple way to avoid eyestrain is to limit the time you’re exposed to a single activity that requires intense focus. Try to spend less time on digital devices. In many cases, changes like the ones noted previously are all you’ll need to make to treat eyestrain. If you experience eyestrain that’s severe or lasts a long time, discuss the condition with your doctor. You may need corrective lenses, or it could be a symptom of a more serious condition. Spending a great amount of time on a focused activity puts you at risk for eyestrain. You may have an increased risk for eyestrain if you work on computers as part of your job. Children who spend lengthy amounts of time on digital devices may also experience eyestrain or other conditions, such as irritability or behavior problems. When you engage with digital devices for a lengthy amount of time, you expose yourself to blue light, which may be harmful to your eyes in the long term. Blue light can cause: Specialized lenses can reduce your exposure to blue light. Maintaining your eye health is key to reducing more serious vision problems in the future. You should see your doctor annually to have your eyes checked, especially if you experience frequent or long-lasting eyestrain. If you find you have symptoms of eyestrain, implement some methods to reduce eyestrain or prevent it altogether. If you find that these approaches don’t help your eyestrain, consult your doctor.

08dca6f6-27e2-48c7-9013-338724f57607,"— If you have dry eye, you may experience redness, stinging, or a gritty sensation in your eyes. Dry eye can be temporary or chronic. It occurs when your tear glands don’t produce enough tears or when your tears evaporate too quickly. Untreated chronic dry eye can cause a variety of complications, ranging from double vision to infections, but relief is available. Some people see a reduction in their symptoms with home remedies and over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription eye drops. It’s also important to understand the underlying causes so that you can prevent or manage them. Even though anyone can have dry eye, this condition becomes more common the older you get. Dry eye tends to affect people because tear production declines with age. This type of dry eye can’t be prevented, but using artificial tears on a regular basis can provide extra lubrication to coat your eyes and relieve dryness. Tears are composed of oil, water, and mucus. Certain medications, however, can reduce mucus production and contribute to chronic dry eye. These include antihistamines, antidepressants, diuretics, and beta-blockers used to treat hypertension. If you take a medication and experience eye dryness, talk to your doctor. Ask about an alternative medication or a lower dose to help reduce your dry eye. You may also want to use artificial tears along with your medication to keep your eyes lubricated. Some people who work on a computer experience eyestrain and tension headaches. In addition to these issues, staring at a computer often can also affect your tears and lead to dry eye. This is because people who work at a computer monitor tend to blink less often. As a result, their tears evaporate more quickly. If you use a computer for work, you can reduce dryness by blinking more frequently. Blinking will help lubricate your eyes. This can prevent dryness and irritation. If you still experience dryness, use artificial tears while working at your computer. Additionally, give your eyes a break every now and then. Look away about every 20 minutes and blink repeatedly to re-wet your eyes. Some people begin to experience dry eye after laser vision correction surgery. This procedure cuts some of the nerves in the cornea, causing the eyes to produce fewer tears. This type of dry eye is usually temporary and resolves after a few days or weeks. Until your eyes heal, use lubricating eye drops to keep your eyes moist. Hormones can play a role in dry eye. Some women experience dry eye symptoms during pregnancy, menopause, or while using birth control pills. Hormones stimulate the production of tears, so an imbalance can reduce tear production. Hormone replacement therapy doesn’t seem to improve dry eyes. But you can talk to your doctor about lubricating eye drops to reduce dryness and irritation. Vitamin A promotes healthy eyes. Foods rich in vitamin A include eggs, carrots, fish, spinach, broccoli, and peppers. A diet low in foods that contain this vitamin can lead to dry eye and other vision impairments, such as night blindness. A blood test can diagnose a vitamin A deficiency. You can also ask your doctor about using eye drops that contain vitamin A, although these aren’t commonly used for dry eye treatment. Cold climates and exposure to high winds can cause tears to evaporate too quickly, leading to chronic dryness. To protect your eyes, use lubricating eye drops and wear sunglasses that wrap around your head to protect your eyes from cold and wind. Sjögren’s syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that causes white blood cells to attack your salivary glands and tear glands, reducing tear production. Treatment involves OTC and prescription lubricating eye drops. Your doctor may also prescribe a steroid eye drop. When dry eyes don’t respond to eye drops, your doctor may recommend a surgery that involves inserting silicone plugs into your tear ducts to help preserve some of your tears. In addition to other symptoms, many autoimmune conditions like arthritis, lupus, and diabetes can also cause poor or insufficient tear production. Diagnosing and treating the underlying condition may help improve dry eye symptoms. Treatment for an autoimmune condition can involve an immunosuppressant drug or a corticosteroid. Diabetes involves managing your blood sugar with healthy lifestyle habits, diet, and medication. Blepharitis develops when small oil glands on your inner eyelid become clogged and inflamed. Along with dry eyes, you may have oily flakes around your eyelashes. There’s no cure for this condition. Still, you can reduce inflammation by applying a warm compress over closed eyes for a couple of minutes and cleaning your eyelids with baby shampoo. Until inflammation improves, use artificial tears to reduce dry eyes and redness. If your symptoms don’t improve, see your doctor and ask about treatment with antibiotic eye drops. Allergies can also trigger chronic dry eye. Your eyes may appear itchy, red, and watery. An oral antihistamine can reduce your allergies, although these medications can worsen symptoms of dry eye. If you only experience eye symptoms from allergies, ask your doctor about antihistamine eye drops. Sometimes, dry eye is the result of dehydration or not drinking enough fluids. Other symptoms of dehydration include dark urine, lack of energy, dizziness, a rapid heartbeat, and not urinating. Increasing your fluid intake and drinking more water can improve mild dehydration and ease chronic dry eye. Dry air also contributes to dry eyes. This can happen if there’s low humidity in your home, or if you sleep or work next to an air vent. Moving your bed or desk so that air doesn’t blow directly on your eyes may improve symptoms. You may also want to use a humidifier to moisten the air and prevent tear evaporation. Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke can also make your eyes dry. Avoid smoky environments, and if you smoke, take steps to quit. Use nicotine replacement therapy or ask your doctor about a prescription medication to curb cravings. Long-term use of contact lenses is another risk factor for chronic dry eye. This is because some lenses obstruct oxygen to the cornea. If your eyes don’t receive enough lubrication, switch to eyeglasses and ask your eye doctor about contacts specifically made for dry eyes. These lenses are designed to help your eyes retain moisture. Treating dry eye depends on the cause. In general, it may help to avoid: looking away from your computer or book to give your eyes a break using contact lenses intended for people with dry eyes taking prescription medications, depending on the cause of the dryness According to , omega-3 fatty acid supplements may also help improve dry eye symptoms. Additionally, a found that artificial tears containing trehalose (a sugar) and flaxseed oil may be effective for treating dry eye. More studies are needed on this treatment. If a certain medication is causing your eyes to dry out, talk to your doctor about switching to a different one. It may also help to treat other underlying health conditions that may be causing the dryness. In some cases, you may benefit from having plugs placed in your tear ducts to hold your tears around your eyes. Your doctor may bring this up as a temporary or permanent procedure. If your eyes are dry, red, or painful over a long period of time, talk to your doctor. You should also make an appointment if treatments at home aren’t helping. Your doctor can work with you to discover the cause of your dry eyes and suggest the best treatment. This is important because dry eyes may lead to complications, including infection, inflammation, or damage to your eyes. One of the first steps to relieving chronic dry eye is understanding what’s causing your symptoms. With medicated eye drops and a few simple lifestyle adjustments, you can make sure your eyes stay lubricated. This can help reduce your risk of dry eye complications. — Switching Dry Eye Treatment: What You Need to Know Millions of Americans are diagnosed with dry eyes each year.

db204b90-7010-42e6-8bf0-833df8eb2180,"Increased Screen Time? Here’s How You Can Protect Your Eyes Chances are you spend at least a few hours a day looking at a computer, tablet, phone, or other type of technology. Nowadays, you probably spend a lot more time looking at a screen. Well, staring at a computer screen can be hard on your eyes. Fortunately, there are some tips that can help you to protect your eyes while enjoying your daily screen time. Sitting too close or too far away from your computer screen can cause eyestrain. So, take a look at your computer setup. After sitting down, make sure your computer screen is at eye level. Also, position yourself twenty to forty inches away from your screen. That distance is equal to about an arm’s length. If the angle of your screen can be adjusted make sure it’s fully upright and not tilted. Just a few small changes to the way you sit at your computer can help to prevent eye strain. This is an easy way to prevent eye strain when you spend a lot of time looking at a computer screen. Take a few moments each day to clean your screen to remove dust and dirt that can build up. You’d be surprised at how quickly debris can collect on a screen. Looking through even a thin film of dust for a few hours can result in eye strain. You may want to use specially designed wipes to clean your screen or wipe it with a microfiber cloth. A dry microfiber cloth is made of particularly soft material that won’t scratch or otherwise damage your screen. Your screen is delicate and can be scratched by wiping it with a paper towel or even a rag. So, it’s best to keep a microfiber cloth handy for this task. If you want to use a mild cleaner designed for computer screens avoid spraying it directly onto the screen. You don’t want to take the risk of fluid dripping into the workings of your computer. Taking a break from your screen every 30 minutes or so can help prevent eye strain. Getting up and walking around for a bit gives your eyes some time to recover from your focused work. Look out a nearby window or get a glass of water. In short, spend your break doing something besides reading a screen. Taking regular breaks can also help you to refocus your mind and get the blood flowing more quickly in your hands, arms and legs. This sounds like a strange tip for avoiding eye strain. After all, blinking your eyes is an involuntary action for the most part. But, focusing intently on a computer screen can cause you to blink fewer times than normal. When you blink you’re adding moisture to your eyes. This moisture helps to ease the movement of your eyes and keeps your vision fresh. So, becoming more mindful of your blinking can help to keep eye strain from creeping up. You may want to set a timer for every twenty minutes to help you remember to keep blinking regularly. After a while, you may not need the timer as a reminder. When the light from your computer screen is much brighter than the lighting around you, you can experience eye strain. As a remedy, adjust the lighting around you to match or come close to the level of light coming from your screen. That way, your eyes aren’t working quite so hard to focus on the computer screen. Of course, if you’re working in an office or business, you may not be able to adjust the lighting around your work area. So, if you aren’t able to adjust the lighting, try adjusting the level of brightness of your computer screen. You can find and adjust the brightness level by looking into the settings of your computer. Try different levels to see what works best for you. You may experience dry eyes even if you remember to blink regularly while looking at your computer screen. If this is the case, buy some eye drops also known as artificial tears to add moisture to your eyes. Every time you feel your eyes beginning to dry out, put some drops in. This can make your eyes feel more comfortable and renewed for your next bit of reading or writing work. Be sure you have clean hands before putting the eye drops into your eyes. A computer keyboard can contain a lot of bacteria and you don’t want it going into your eyes as you use the drops. Check out the type of screen you have on your computer. A computer screen made of glass can create a glare that can bring on eye strain. A matte screen filter on your computer can help to soften the images and text as well as reduce eye strain. You can purchase a matte filter for your screen, but be sure you choose the proper size for your laptop, desktop, etc. Be sure to check the cleaning instructions for the matte filter. Did you know there are eyeglasses designed to wear when looking at a computer screen? The blue-violet light coming from your screen can cause eye strain when you look at it for prolonged periods of time. Computer eyeglasses are designed to block this blue-violet light so you can enjoy your screen time without the eye strain. There are stylish frames available for these eyeglasses so they can be a fashion statement and protect your eyes at the same time. Lastly, trying just a few of these tips can help you prevent eye strain whether you’re working or spending your free time looking at a screen.

The lenses, as we log hours on this earth, thicken, stiffen, even calcify. The eyes are no longer windows on souls. They’re closer to teeth. To see if your own eyes are hardening, look no further than your phone, which should require no exertion; you’re probably already there. Keep peering at your screen, reading and staring, snubbing life’s third dimension and natural hues. The first sign of the eyes’ becoming teeth is the squinting at phones. Next comes the reflexive extending of the arm, the impulse to resize letters into the preschool range. And at last the buying of drugstore readers. Virginia Heffernan () is an Ideas contributor at WIRED. She is the author of . She is also a cohost of , an op-ed columnist at the , and a frequent contributor to . Before coming to WIRED she was a staff writer at the —first a TV critic, then a magazine columnist, and then an opinion writer. She has a bachelor’s degree from the University of Virginia and a master’s degree and PhD in English from Harvard. In 1979 she stumbled onto the internet, when it was the back office of weird clerics, and she’s been in the thunderdome ever since. Modern medicine offers little apart from magnifying glasses to treat presbyopia (from the Greek , meaning “old man”). But those $3.99 specs will get you on your feet just fine, which is to say, you can once again relish your phone without squinting or arm-stretching. A remedy for farsightedness evidently succeeds to the degree that it restores a woman or man to the comfortable consumption of texts, email, ecommerce, and social media on a glazed rectangle of aluminum alloys held at a standard reading distance of 16 inches. With reading glasses we live again. Doesn’t this seem like an unwholesome loop? The eyes may be unwell, but the primary object of our eyesight seems corrosive. We measure our vision against the phone, all the while suspecting the phone itself is compromising our ability to see it. Even if we don’t say out loud that failing vision has something to do with our vastly narrowed visual field, our bodies seem to know what’s up. How convenient, for example, that you can turn up a phone’s contrast and brightness with a few taps. If perception can’t be improved, objects can be made more perceivable, right? But then the brightness seems, like morphine, to produce a need for more brightness, and you find yourself topping out, hitting the button in vain for more light only to realize that’s it. You’ve blinded yourself to the light that was already there. Having recently, in my forties, gotten reading glasses, I now find myself having to choose between reading and being, since I can’t read without them and I can’t see the world with them. The glasses date from a time when reading was much rarer a pastime than being; you’d grope for them to see a book, while relying on your naked eyes for driving, talking, walking. But of course now so many of us read all day long. And I opt to flood my field of vision with the merry play of pixels and emoji rather than the less scintillating, brown-gray “real world.” This means wearing the reading glasses, even on the street, and affecting blindness to everything but my phone. vision be today without the phone as its reason for being? If you were a nomadic goatherd in the Mongolian grasslands, you might not even consider presbyopia a pathology. Many nomads carry cell phones for calls and music, but, except to play games, they rarely gaze at them. Instead, they rest their eyes on the ever-moving flock, alert to vagaries in the animals’ collective configuration and inclinations; but simultaneously they soften the vision to wide angle, so as to detect peripheral anomalies and threats. On camelback in the wide-open grasslands, the eyes line easily with the horizon, which means their eyes take in distance, proximity, an unpixelated spectrum, and unsimulated movement. A panoramic view of the horizon line roots the beholder in the geometer’s simplest concepts of perspective: foreshortening, a vanishing point, linearity, and the changeable shadows cast by the movement of the sun over and under the horizon line. That third dimension—depth—is never, ever forgotten by the nomads. The sun rises and sets on depth. Depending on your after-hours curriculum in Mongolia (cooking, talking, playing the fiddle), you might rarely even need to do what digital moderns never stop doing: recruit the eye’s ciliary muscle and contract it, releasing tension in the ligaments that suspend the eye to acutely curve the lens and train it to a pixelated 1.4-milimeter letter  on, for instance, a mobile news app. If you explained to a nomad the failures of her aging eyes, she might shrug: Who needs anxious ciliary muscles? Indeed. And the use of those muscles by digital moderns gets even more complicated when we encounter our x’s not on paper—carbon-­black ink, like liquid soot, inscribed on bleached pulpwood—but on screens. That’s where we come across the quivering and uncertain symbols that play across the—surface, is it? Where are they exactly? Somewhere on or in our devices. No wonder the eyes are unwell. consequences for eyesight. Ice fishermen can go snowblind. Welders suffer arc eye. Ships’ lookouts hallucinate. Academics develop myopia. And texters—call it an avocation—have blurred vision. There are at least two recorded cases of something called smartphone blindness.  notes that both patients had been reading their phones in bed, on their sides, faces half-hidden, in the dark. “We hypothesized that the symptoms were due to differential bleaching of photo-­pigment, with the viewing eye becoming light-adapted.” Differential bleaching of the eyes! Fortunately, smartphone blindness of this kind is transient. Has This Stealth Company Solved Vision-Quality VR? The Oddly Fascinating, Fantastical History of Eyeglasses The blanket term for screen-borne eyesight problems is computer vision syndrome, an unsatisfactory name given to the blurring, dry eyes, and headaches suffered by the people of the screen. The name is unsatisfactory because, like many syndromes, it describes a set of phenomena without situating them in a coherent narrative—medical or otherwise. For contrast, arc eye is a burn: Welders get it from their exposure to bright ultraviolet light. Snowblindness is caused when corneas are sunburned by light reflecting off snow. Hallucinations afflict lookouts because, as Ishmael explains in , they’re up at odd hours and alone, parsing the “blending cadence of waves with thoughts” for danger, whales, or other vessels; the brain and eyes are inclined to make meaning and mirages of undifferentiated land- and seascapes where none exist. Computer vision syndrome is not nearly as romantic. The American Optometric Association uses it to describe the discomfort that people report feeling after looking at screens for a “prolonged” period of time. When screens pervade the field of vision all day, what counts as prolonged? (Moreover, reports of discomfort seem like not much to predicate a whole syndrome on.) But the AOA’s treatment of the syndrome is intriguing. This is the so-called 20-20-20 rule, which asks that screen people take a 20-second break to look at something 20 feet away every 20 minutes. The remedy helps us reverse-engineer the syndrome. This suffering is thought to be a function not of blue light or intrusive ads or bullying and other scourges. It’s thought to be a function of unbroken concentration on a screen 8 inches to 2 feet from the eyes. The person suffering eyestrain is taught to look 20 feet away but she might presumably look at a painting or a wall. Twenty feet, though, suggests it’s depth she may be thirsty for. a syndrome discharges the latest anxiety about screens, which have always been a source of social suspicion. People who are glued to screens to the exclusion of other people are regarded with disdain: narcissistic, withholding, deceitful, sneaky. This was true even with the panels that prefigured electronic screens, including shoji, as well as mirrors and newspaper broadsheets. The mirror-gazer may have been the first selfie fanatic, and in the heyday of mirrors the truly vain had handheld mirrors they toted around the way we carry phones. And hand fans and shoji—forget it. The concealing and revealing of faces allowed by fans and translucent partitions suggest the masquerade and deceptions of social media. An infatuation with screens can easily slide into a moral failing. Not long ago a science writer named began leading walks to identify trees for city dwellers in Washington, DC, many who do work that takes place on screens. That’s right, tree blindness—and the broader concept of blindness to the natural world—might be the real danger screens pose to vision. In 2012, Popkin had learned about trees to cure this blindness in himself and went from a naif who could barely pick out an oak tree to an amateur arboriculturist who can distinguish dozens of trees. The biggest living beings in his city suddenly seemed like friends to him, with features he could recognize and relish. I opt to flood my field of vision with the merry play of pixels and emoji rather than the brown-gray “real world.” This means wearing reading glasses, even on the street, and affecting blindness to everything but my phone. Once he could see trees, they became objects of intense interest to him—more exhilarating than apps, if you can believe it. “Take a moment to watch and listen to a flowering redbud tree full of pollen-drunk bumblebees,” he has written. “I promise you won’t be bored.” If computer vision syndrome has been invented as a catch-all to express a whole range of fears, those fears may not be confined to what blue light or too much close-range texting are doing to the eyesight. Maybe the syndrome is a broader blindness—eyes that don’t know how to see and minds that increasingly don’t know how to recognize nondigital artifacts, especially nature. Lately, when I pull away from the screen to stare into the middle distance for a spell, I take off my glasses. I try to find a tree. If I’m inside, I open a window; if I’m outside, I will even approach a tree. I don’t want mediation or glass. The trees are still strangers; I hardly know their names yet, but I’m testing myself on leaf shapes and shades of green. All I know so far is that trees are very unlike screens. They’re a prodigious interface. Very buggy. When my eyes settle after a minute or two, I—what’s that expression, “the scales fell from my eyes”? It’s almost, at times, like that. • • • • • • • WIRED . This article appears in the April issue. . Correction appended 04/03/18, 2:01 PST.

A of high school students in Connecticut found that internet use was problematic for about 4 percent of the participants. The researchers said that there might be an association between problematic internet use and depression, substance use, and aggressive behavior. They also noted that high school boys, who, according to the researchers, tend to be heavier users of the internet, may be less aware of these problems. A produced mixed findings on the relationship that social networks have with and . The evidence suggests that social network use correlates with mental illness and well-being.

The makes the following recommendations for screen time: Parents and caregivers can offer high-quality programs and watch them with their children. Limit to one hour per day of supervised high-quality programming. Place consistent limits on time and types of media.

If that sounds familiar, here are some ways to cut back on screen time: Clear your phone of unessential apps to keep you from constantly checking it for updates. Carve out a specific, limited amount of time to use your devices. Turn some television time into physical activity time. Keep electronic devices out of the bedroom. Charge them in another room. Turn clocks and other toward the wall at bedtime. Prioritize real-world relationships over online relationships. Limit their screen time, allowing it only at certain times of the day and restricting it during activities like meals and just before bedtime. Know what they’re doing. Review their programs, games, and apps, and encourage the engaging ones over those that are passive. Make sure that children have regular, unstructured, tech-free playtime.

(Read: ) Computer vision syndrome (CVS) is a condition which is ever-present in today’s urban population who spend all days on their laptops or computers. Viewing a computer screen often makes the eyes work harder than normal. The unique characteristics and high visual demands of working on computers make individuals susceptible to various vision related conditions. How is working on computers more strenuous than say reading a book? Viewing a computer screen is very different than reading a printed page. Often the letters on the computer screen are not as precise or sharply defined, the level of contrast of the letters to the background is reduced, and the presence of glare and reflections on the screen may make viewing difficult. Different distances and angles also result in aggravating the issue. Even minor vision problems can turn into major ones due to protracted computer use. Even people who have an eyeglass or contact lens prescription may find it’s not suitable for the specific viewing distances of their computer screen.  In fact along with eye conditions, the posture we use laptops in can result in muscle spasms or pain in the neck, shoulder or back.

So it’s no wonder researchers are investigating whether staring at glowing screens for hours at a time may have unwanted side effects. In the field of vision care, one concern focuses on blue light, the spectrum emitted by digital screens of all kinds. And screens aren’t the only source. New lighting technologies such as compact fluorescent lights and light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, also produce light predominantly in the blue spectrum. Perhaps never before have people been exposed to so much light in the blue spectrum for so many hours of the day and night. Could exposure to all of these sources of blue light be damaging our eyes? Does it cause ? Even before researchers have had time to answer any of the questions, manufacturers have rushed in, marketing a variety of blue light–filtering gadgets. Slick websites have popped up, issuing dire warnings about the hazards of blue light—and, naturally, offering all kinds of products to help protect against it, from special lenses to vitamin supplements. Should you consider buying lenses that protect your eyes from blue light, especially if you already have AMD? Here’s what researchers know—and don’t yet know—about the risks. Bright light of any kind, especially sunlight, can damage our eyes. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which is not visible, has been linked to the formation of cataracts and damage to the cornea. (It’s also the chief culprit in skin cancer.) UV light is mostly absorbed by the eye before it reaches the retina. But visible light does reach the retina—it’s how we see, after all. Visible light consists of a wide spectrum of wavelengths, represented by all the colors we see. Some research suggests that visible light from the blue spectrum may be especially damaging to the eyes. That has led some experts to speculate that prolonged exposure to blue light, over a life span, could be a factor in the development of AMD. But even with the proliferation of glowing screens and LEDs, most of our exposure to blue light comes in the form of good old sunlight (followed by fluorescent light, compact fluorescent light bulbs, and LED light). Blue light from screens may add to the risk of damage, but so far the evidence is based mostly on animal studies and remains theoretical for humans. Researchers have yet to definitively link exposure to blue light from artificial sources to an increased risk of AMD, or any other eye diseases. For that reason, many ophthalmologists think that it is premature to invest in lenses that filter out blue light. Wearing when you are outside remains the most important way to protect your eyes from damage. There’s another reason to be cautious about choosing blue light–filtering lenses. Scientists have learned in recent years that light in the blue spectrum plays a crucial role in regulating our circadian rhythm—the internal clock that determines waking, sleeping, and a host of physiological processes. In the morning, blue spectrum light, mostly from sunlight, wakes us up and stimulates the body. Wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses that block blue light could disrupt the normal circadian rhythm, potentially making people sluggish and less alert in the morning. Whether this concern is warranted or not remains to be seen. In a published in the journal in January 2017, researchers tested five different blue light–filtering spectacles. The lenses worked as advertised: They blocked a modest proportion of blue light. In theory, that might help protect against damage to the eye. But the lenses also blocked out enough blue light to potentially affect color sensitivity and interfere with people’s circadian rhythm, the researchers found. Even that wasn’t certain, however. When the researchers tested the lenses in a group of 80 subjects, they found that more than 70 percent of the volunteers could not detect any impairment in vision or sleep quality. For now, based on current evidence, the does not recommend the use of blue light–filtering lenses—or the use of any kind of special glasses for computer work. Recently, another electronic device has raised new concerns: natural-spectrum light boxes. The light generated by light boxes is meant to simulate sunlight, with the full spectrum of visible light. Light boxes are typically recommended to ease , a form of depression that is linked to low levels of sun exposure during the winter months. Light boxes are now available over the counter, but they are not approved or regulated by the FDA. And while they generate only a fraction of the intensity of sunlight, there’s worry that exposure for too long, especially over time, might cause damage to eyes. So far, though, no studies have definitively linked light boxes to retinal or corneal damage. Still, it is wise to play it safe. If you already have vision problems such as AMD or cataracts, speak with your ophthalmologist before using any kind of light box. Researchers still have a lot to learn about the effects of the artificial light we’re increasingly exposed to from digital screens and other sources. And even if blue light from your mobile phone or tablet poses no risk to your eyes, there are still reasons you may want to limit screen time, . Blue light from the sun normally helps to awaken us and reset our circadian rhythm. Preliminary studies suggest that exposure to blue light at night may disrupt that rhythm and make it more difficult to fall asleep. Staring for too long at glowing screens can also lead to headaches, eye strain, blurred vision, or dry eyes—symptoms that are collectively referred to by eye-care specialists as computer vision syndrome or digital eyestrain. Staring at your smartphone or tablet for long stretches of time may be different from, say, reading a book or newspaper because people tend to blink less when they are looking at a digital screen. If you must use a computer or tablet and can’t limit screen time, you can limit blue light exposure and eyestrain by turning down the brightness setting on your device in the evening. Some new devices have a “night shift” feature that you can turn on to reduce the amount of blue light the screen produces. And it’s always worth following the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, look up from your screen and focus on an object at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. If your eyes feel dry, try blinking more often or using to moisten them.

6cdb2ff2-a723-41b6-90c2-db91722b75c5,"— Maybe you’ve known you needed a for a while. Or perhaps you didn’t realize that your glasses weren’t giving you optimal vision until an eye exam made that clear. Either way, you may be surprised if your new, highly anticipated prescription glasses cause blurry vision, are hard to see through, or give you headaches. Sometimes, a new eyeglass prescription might even make you dizzy or nauseous. This distressing scenario may leave you wondering if there’s been a mistake. Before you revert to using your old lenses, make sure you understand what might be causing your headaches and what you can do about them. There are a number of reasons why new eyeglasses might cause . Each contains six muscles. As your eyes learn how to view the world through a new prescription, these muscles have to work harder or differently than they did before. This can cause within the eye and a headache. You may be more prone to this side effect if you’re or if your prescription has changed significantly. It can be particularly difficult adjusting to bifocals, trifocals, or progressives, especially for the first time. are known as no-line bifocals, or as multifocals. They offer a smoother transition between lens powers so that you can see near, far, and medium distances. Glasses that offer more than one lens power correct for multiple issues, such as and . You have to look through the lenses in just the right spot in order to get the vision correction you need. The bottom of the lenses are for reading and working close up. The top of the lenses are for driving and distance vision. This can take some getting used to. It’s not unusual for headaches, dizziness, and nausea to accompany the adjustment period for bifocals, trifocals, or progressive lenses. New glasses often mean new frames, as well as a new prescription. If your glasses fit too snugly across your nose, or cause pressure behind your ears, you may get a headache. Having your glasses fitted to your face by a professional is important. They will help you choose eyeglasses that fit properly and are the correct distance from your pupils. If your glasses feel uncomfortable or leave pinch marks on your nose, they can often be readjusted to fit your face more comfortably. This should make your headaches go away. Even though you try your best to give accurate information during an eye exam, there’s lots of room for human error. This may occasionally result in getting a less than optimal prescription. Your doctor may also have incorrectly measured the space between your pupils (interpupillary distance). This measurement must be precise or it can lead to eye strain. If your eyeglass prescription is too weak or too strong, your eyes will become strained, causing headaches. Headaches caused by new eyeglasses should dissipate within a few days. If yours doesn’t, you may need to have your eyes retested to determine if the prescription is at fault. These tips can help prevent or reduce eyeglass headaches: Don’t give into temptation and reach for your old glasses. This will only prolong the headache. Your eyes need time to adjust to the new prescription. The best way to do this is by wearing your new glasses as often as you wore your old ones. Try taking your glasses off and sitting in a dark room with your eyes open or closed for 15 minutes as needed throughout the day. This may help ease eye strain, tension, and headaches. Anything that makes your eyes feel rested, such as a , will help alleviate an eyeglass headache. Choose antireflective lenses for lengthy computer use If you sit in front of a computer screen for many hours, eye strain and headache may result. This may be exacerbated by the extra strain of adjusting to a new prescription. One way to minimize this is to make sure your new lenses are fitted with a high-grade, antireflective coating. This will help reduce glare from the computer screen, alleviating some stress on your eye muscles. If your eyeglasses feel tight, pinch your nose, or press behind your ears, have the frames refitted and adjusted. Take such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to alleviate headache pain. Keep in mind that it can take a few days to fully adjust to your new prescription. If you’re still experiencing headaches, dizziness, or nausea after a week, call your doctor. A can determine if the prescription needs to be adjusted or if the frames don’t fit properly. If you’re prone to , you may be concerned that a new eyeglass prescription will trigger them. If so, talk to your doctor about getting tinted lenses designed to filter out harmful light wavelengths, such as those caused by fluorescent lighting or the sun. These light wavelengths have been shown to trigger migraine in some people with this condition. A found that tinted eyeglasses helped reduce the frequency of migraine by reducing visual distortion and enhancing clarity and comfort. Headaches caused by a new eyeglass prescription are common. Usually, they go away within a few days as your eyes adjust. If your headaches don’t dissipate within a week, call your doctor, especially if you’re also dizzy or nauseous. In some instances, minor adjustments to the frame or lenses will alleviate the problem. In others, a new prescription may be needed. — Medically reviewed by Learn about 8 simple lifestyle changes you can make to help prevent eyestrain.

1a6a5c92-2008-4bdb-90d0-922ac8a9df4e,"— Many of us know what it’s like to have a headache. Depending on the cause, it can trigger sharp, dull, or throbbing pain. Headaches range in severity and can affect any part of your head. This can happen when you focus on a task, like using a computer, for too long. It can also occur when your eyes try to focus in light that’s too bright or dim. Essentially, eye strain is when your eyes get tired due to overuse. If you have eye strain, it doesn’t mean your eyes are injured or damaged. Your headache and other symptoms should ease or go away completely once you rest your eyes. Still, eye strain headaches can be frustrating and disruptive. They might make it difficult to focus on work, school, or other projects. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at why eye strain causes headaches, how you can find relief, and ways to prevent these kinds of headaches from derailing your day. There are many kinds of headaches. The most common types include: These headaches require different treatment and care than an eye strain headache. That’s why it’s important to know how to recognize an eye strain headache, which is mild when compared with other headache types. Eye strain headaches appear after you focus on something for a long time. They won’t develop when you wake up or if you haven’t been reading, watching, or focusing on something for a period of time. Typically, an eye strain headache will subside once you rest your eyes. Unlike other types of headaches, eye strain headaches are rarely associated with vomiting or nausea. The pain is usually located behind or around your eyes. The area might feel sore or tired. What’s the connection between eye strain and a headache? When you look at objects or screens at a close range, the muscles in and around your eyes need to work harder to focus. Over time, these muscles can get sore and tired, just like any other muscle in your body. Similarly, squinting for a long period of time may trigger spasms in your facial muscles and the muscles around your eyes. These spasms can lead to eye strain headaches. To identify the cause of your eye strain headache, consider what you were doing before your symptoms developed. This will help you determine how to reduce discomfort. Let’s take a closer look at some of the most common causes of eye strain headaches. Looking at a digital screen for a long time is the most common cause of eye strain. In this case, the condition is called digital eye strain or . When you focus on a screen, you tend to blink less often. This can lead to dry eyes, which may cause irritation. The following scenarios might also worsen digital eye strain: low contrast between the screen text and background You’re more likely to develop digital eye strain if you look at a screen for 2 or more hours without taking a break. It’s possible to develop eye strain without using a digital screen. Your eyes can get tired after continual focus on a single activity for a long time. These include: Uncorrected vision can also cause eye strain. You might need prescription glasses or contact lenses to help you see things clearly. If you already wear them, you may need a different prescription. If your vision is uncorrected, your eyes will need to work harder to try and form a clear image. This can make your eyes tired and lead to eye strain headaches. It’s difficult to see clearly in light that’s too bright or too dim. You might need to squint your eyes to see. You may have experienced this while driving a car on a sunny day without sunglasses, or walking into a dark room. As your eyes try to focus, they can become tired and strained. You can reduce your chances of getting these kinds of headaches by taking some simple steps. Here’s what you can do. Take frequent breaks while using digital screens. The involves looking at something at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes. Dry eyes can worsen your eye strain symptoms. Blinking often will help moisten your eyes. You can also use artificial tears to help prevent dry eyes. Your eyes will need to work extra hard to focus in the dark. The light from your screen should be similar to the light in the room to make it easier on your eyes. Place your screen at least 25 inches away from your eyes. Position the screen slightly below eye level to avoid straining upward. Try not to position your screen too far below eye level, though, because it could strain your neck muscles. Point your indoor light source, like a lamp, away from your eyes. To reduce screen glare, make sure the light source shines away from your computer screen. This could cause eye irritation and strain. In addition to modifying your habits, you can also relieve eye strain headaches at home by taking the following steps. Using reading or computer may provide relief. If you have glasses to correct your vision, be sure to use your most recent prescription. Simply resting your eyes for several minutes can ease your symptoms. Dryness can make your eye strain worse. Using artificial tears may help moisten your eyes and offer relief. If you have a stubborn eye strain headache, an over-the-counter may help. Often, simply making lifestyle changes — like those suggested in this article — can reduce the occurrence of your eye strain headaches. Visit a doctor if your headaches persist even after making these changes. You should also see a doctor if you have these symptoms along with your headaches: Be sure to get regular eye exams, even if you have good vision. Your can check for other problems like eye muscle imbalance. When your eyes work too hard, your eye muscles may contract too much. These contractions can trigger an eye strain headache. Often, these headaches cause pain and discomfort behind your eyes. You may develop an eye strain headache after focusing on a task for too long. Fortunately, you can usually find relief just by letting your eyes rest. It also helps to wear glasses or contact lenses that are the correct prescription. If lifestyle changes don’t help, visit a doctor. They can determine whether an underlying condition is causing your headaches. — Over-the-counter medications don’t always eliminate headache symptoms.

When you're working with power tools, chemicals, or lawn mowers, don't kid yourself into believing that your ordinary glasses are all the protection your eyes need. They aren't because: they don't shield a sufficiently large area; there's lots of room for debris or splashing fluids to get around your glasses and into your eyes ordinary glasses might put you at even greater risk of injury if shards from broken lenses fly into your eyes To keep our eyes working at their best, we need to give them a little attention -- and avoid hazards and careless acts that can do our eyes harm. First, let's learn how nutrition can help fortify your eyes. -- For generations, mothers have told their children to eat their carrots to see better at night. Well, maybe so, maybe not. Actually, this bit of folk wisdom is a slightly distorted version of a known scientific fact. Carrots are an excellent source of vitamin A, and one of the early symptoms of a deficiency of this nutrient is night blindness. That's not the same, however, as saying that eating carrots will make normal night vision even better. But there's no refuting that vitamin A is essential to healthy eyes and normal eyesight. Chronic, severe vitamin A deficiency causes a condition called xerophthalmia, or drying of the eye. It affects the cornea, the transparent covering that allows light to enter the eye. In xerophthalmia, the normally clear and glistening cornea becomes extremely dry. If left untreated, this condition can lead to blindness. Xerophthalmia afflicts some 3 million children each year in developing countries. Up to 250,000 of them end up permanently blind -- a tragedy that could be prevented by an adequate diet or supplementation with vitamin A. -- Antioxidants are much in the news these days because of evidence that they may prevent some of the biological deterioration that comes with aging. Researchers believe antioxidants benefit the body by preventing cell damage caused by oxidation. (Oxidation is a natural process that occurs as part of normal cell functioning. The process is similar to the browning effect that happens to cut fruit left exposed to air too long.) Besides reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer, antioxidants -- along with zinc -- may help protect against macular degeneration, a serious eye disease associated with aging. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) by the National Institutes of Health found that high levels of antioxidant vitamins A (beta-carotene), C, and E significantly reduced the risk of developing advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in those already at high risk for advanced disease. However, the study did not produce evidence that antioxidants are protective against the development of cataracts. -- In addition to antioxidants, certain minerals are also thought to be connected to eye health. Zinc, for example, has been shown to help reduce the risk of advanced age-related macular degeneration. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) found that taking high levels of zinc, along with high levels of antioxidant vitamins, reduced the risk of developing advanced AMD by about 25 percent. Eye injuries can happen most anywhere. Experts say that 90 percent of eye injuries could be prevented. What it takes is a little extra vigilance in situations that make your eyes vulnerable. Here are a few of them: -- Whether it's an errant fishing line, a bouncing ball, a recoiling bungee cord, or flying campfire sparks, recreational settings present serious eye-injury risks. The best way to play it safe is to be alert. Pay keen attention to what you're doing and what's going on around you. Sports-related eye injuries number at least 200,000 a year, with baseball, basketball, tennis, squash, and hockey players being the most susceptible. When you're on the field, court, or rink, wear protective glasses that protect you from the front and all sides. Glasses made of polycarbonate or another sturdy plastic are best. -- Flying wood chips, ricocheting nails, splashing paint thinner -- these are but a few of the dangers posed by do-it-yourself jobs at home. Wearing protective eyewear may seem like a hassle, but it also might save your sight. Here is some of the gear to choose from: . These cost only a few dollars and offer protection when you're hammering or using hand tools or slow-moving electric tools. Look for a logo that indicates the glasses have passed safety tests. Those made from polycarbonate will be the most impact resistant. Be sure the glasses have side shields, too, to deflect objects coming at you from the sides. If you need to wear prescription eyeglasses, you can also get prescription safety glasses.   These protect you from debris flying at you from all directions. Thus, goggles give you the most all-around protection when you're working with tools, chemicals, and so on. These are a good idea when you're using a lathe or router, for instance. If you're welding, be sure the shield has special shading to protect your eyes from the bright light. Because a shield doesn't protect against heavy impact or from objects that might fly up or around the shield, you should always use safety glasses or goggles under the shield. -- Many people have discovered the hard way that even a simple chore such as mowing the lawn can lead to eye injury. Thousands of eye wounds result from stones or twigs being spit out by lawn mowers. So it's a good idea to wear goggles to ward off flying debris. The same holds when you're trimming hedges; branches can snap back and hit you in the eye. And when you're using a chain saw, both a face shield and safety goggles are essential. -- Lots of other home-related jobs merit wearing eye protection, too. For instance, goggles can protect your eyes from falling grit when you're working under your car, from splashing chemicals when you're cleaning, or from dripping paint when you're painting a ceiling. Blunt trauma isn't the only way to damage your eyes. There could be small, seemingly harmless, things you do each day that could result in serious eye problems.

Read in good light. Dim light won't hurt your eyes but can tire them more quickly. If it bothers your eyes to watch television in a dark room, keep a light on. If you have glasses or contacts, use them. You won't have to strain so hard to see. Position the monitor so it's at or just below eye level and a little farther away than you'd hold a book while reading. Take frequent breaks from whatever you're doing to give your eye muscles a rest. While your eyes are amazingly intricate and resilient, there is only so much abuse they can take. Over the course of many years, simple day-to-day actions can damage your eyes. Here are some dangers to avoid. Sunglasses are much more than ""cool shades."" They're protective barriers that cut down exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, a portion of the sun's rays that can cause such eye diseases as cataracts and macular degeneration. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that you protect your eyes whenever you're in the sun long enough to get a suntan or sunburn. Wearing a brimmed hat cuts sunlight exposure to your eyes by about half. Sunglasses will further boost your protection. The sun's rays can also reflect off of water, sand, and snow, so it's advisable to wear sunglasses in addition to a wide-brimmed hat in these environments. You can get good UV blocking even with inexpensive sunglasses. Recommendations are that no more than 30 percent of sunlight should reach your eyes. In bright conditions, such as on sunlit ski slopes or the beach, it might be better to wear sunglasses with a transmission factor of only 10 percent. Keep in mind, too, that dark glasses with no UV blocking give you no protection whatsoever. In fact, they boost your risk of eye damage because they dilate your pupils. That lets more light in without blocking the harmful UV rays. Here are a few points to keep in mind when you're buying sunglasses: Lens color has no bearing on level of UV protection. Polarized lenses are not necessary for UV protection, but they do cut glare from reflective surfaces. Sunglasses that are darker on top and gradually clearing toward the bottom don't shield your eyes well enough when you're out in the open sunlight, such as on the beach or ski slope. They're fine, however, when you're driving in a car. Test nonprescription sunglasses for distortion by holding them a few inches in front of your eyes. Look through the glasses to focus on some rectangular shape, such as a window frame. Move the glasses slowly from side to side, then up and down. If straight lines look squiggly, the lenses are poor quality. Be sure the sunglasses feel comfortable; otherwise you won't want to wear them for long periods of time. Be sure the sunglasses are labeled as providing protection from ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B (UVA and UVB) radiation. Remember that price is not a good indicator of sunglasses' protective quality. Some very expensive designer sunglasses do not provide very good protection. Eyestrain, such as from reading or sewing, doesn't really injure the eyes, but it makes them tired. To be exact, it isn't really even the eyes that get tired or strained but the muscles around the eyes. The best cure for eyestrain is to give your eye muscles a rest. Take a break from what you're doing. Close your eyes and give them nothing to look at for a while, or stare off into the distance for a moment. Also, having sufficient light to read or work by helps prevent eyestrain in the first place. An adjustable gooseneck lamp lets you concentrate light where you most need it and not where it will irritate your eyes. Remember, the finer the task, the more light required. Although eyestrain doesn't harm your eyes, it can cause discomfort, such as watery or dry eyes, difficulty focusing, fatigue, and perhaps an accompanying headache. Also, although eyestrain itself isn't serious, it can be one symptom of serious conditions, such as glaucoma. If you're bothered by long-lasting, frequently recurring eyestrain, you should see an eye-care professional. People with diabetes need to be particularly concerned with protecting their eyes. The complications of diabetes pose several serious threats to the eyes. The major eye-disease risk for people with diabetes is diabetic retinopathy, in which abnormal blood vessels grow across the retina, damaging and sometimes permanently destroying vision. Diabetic retinopathy afflicts about one-third of people with diabetes, typically after they've had diabetes for at least a decade. About 5 percent of people with diabetes end up losing their sight because of retinopathy. In fact, diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in people younger than 60 years old in the United States and Canada. Diet, medication, and exercise are key to controlling diabetes and reducing the risks of retinopathy. High blood pressure increases the chances of developing retinopathy. Keeping close control of blood sugar levels is known to decrease a person's risk of progressive retinopathy. Anyone with diabetes who's at risk should be screened at least yearly for this eye disease, even if there are no vision symptoms. If caught early, advancement of retinopathy can sometimes be halted by laser treatments. Those recently diagnosed with Type II diabetes should have an eye exam soon after the diagnosis is made. It's common to have diabetes for some time before being diagnosed, and eye damage may already have occurred. True to human nature, most of us wait until our eyes are bothering us before we get a checkup. The problem with that approach is that we could have an eye disease without knowing it. By the time we get to an eye-care specialist, we might have lost some valuable time for treatment -- and some vision capability. Catching an eye problem early boosts the chance of successfully treating it. So your best bet is to get a checkup every two to four years between the ages of 40 and 65 and every one or two years after age 65. If you have diabetes or a family history of conditions such as glaucoma or macular degeneration, get a checkup once a year. Blacks and people with severe shortsightedness are also at increased risk of glaucoma and should consider regular screenings. What sort of eye specialist should you visit? Both ophthalmologists and optometrists are trained to evaluate eye problems. In most places, only ophthalmologists -- who are medical doctors -- can prescribe medications to treat eye diseases. And they are the only ones who can do eye surgery. A third kind of eye specialist, an optician, is trained only to make and fit prescription eyewear. If you are concerned that you may have a serious eye defect, we list and explain some of the serious eye disorders on the next page. This information is solely for informational purposes.

Since Since childhood, most of us have heard the old warnings about not reading in dim light. Or watching television in a dark room. Or sitting too close to the television. Or reading without our glasses. All of these actions, we've been told, are supposed to hurt our eyesight. Not so, say eye specialists. Sure, these activities may make your eyes tired, but they can do your eyes no actual damage. Astigmatism is caused by a defect in the curvature of the cornea or lens of the eye. 2006 Publications International, Ltd. Unfortunately, there are some eye disorders that people are born with, and there is no amount of prevention that will prevent the symptoms. Here are a few of the major ones: Astigmatism is a type of distorted vision caused by a defect in the curvature of the cornea or lens of the eye. Most people with astigmatism can see clearly those objects directly in front of them, but their peripheral vision -- perhaps above and below, or to the right and left sides, or diagonally -- is defective. Usually, prescription eyewear corrects the problem. Most people with astigmatism were born with the tendency, but it can also be caused by eye disease or injury. The latter type is more difficult to correct. Regardless of the cause, early treatment is crucial. Children, in particular, might be at risk of permanently defective vision if astigmatism isn't corrected early. A cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye that results in obscured vision. People with this defect see their environment as if they were looking through a waterfall -- hence the name of the disease. Other symptoms include The exact cause of cataracts is unknown. Aging probably plays a role. About half of Americans between ages 65 and 74 have cataracts, with that portion jumping to 70 percent in people older than 75. But cataracts can also occur in young people, even newborns whose mothers contracted German measles during pregnancy. There is ongoing research to determine whether certain vitamins and minerals might help prevent or slow down the development of cataracts. Injury to the lens, prolonged use of corticosteroid drugs, and high doses of radiation (such as X rays) may also trigger the condition. Overexposure to ultraviolet rays, a part of sunlight, also boosts the risk of cataracts. Although usually curable, cataracts can lead to blindness if untreated. When necessary, surgical treatment restores vision in 95 percent of cataract operations. The procedure is usually done on an outpatient basis. Surgery is performed, however, only when the cataracts are interfering with daily living. Years ago, patients had to wear special glasses with thick lenses after cataract surgery -- no longer. Now surgeons usually implant an intraocular lens, a tiny lightweight plastic disk, that produces an undistorted image. There is one shortcoming: Because it's not a natural lens, it can't adjust for focusing on near and distant images. Doctor and patient must decide before surgery which correction to choose. Glaucoma is an eye disorder caused by increased pressure within the eyeball, which builds up because fluids are unable to drain normally. The disorder is most common in people over 40 years of age; it's a leading cause of blindness in people over 60. About 90 percent of glaucoma is the chronic form, in which pressure builds gradually, undetected for years. In a much rarer type, acute glaucoma, pressure mounts suddenly, bringing severe pain and abrupt vision blurring. Vision deterioration in chronic glaucoma is so gradual and painless that it's been termed the sneak thief of sight. Sometimes loss of peripheral vision slowly progresses, while central vision remains normal. Other later symptoms include foggy or blurred vision; peripheral vision is usually affected first difficulty in adjusting to brightness and darkness But by the time symptoms appear, chronic glaucoma may already have done permanent damage. That's why regular screening after age 40 is essential to identify the disease early. Early treatment can slow damage to the eyes and prevent further vision loss. have been a long-term user of corticosteroid drugs People at high risk should get an exam at least once every two years. Others should be examined every three to five years. If detected early, glaucoma usually can be controlled with eyedrops, which sometimes have side effects of drowsiness, blurry vision, headache, or changes in heart rate. Laser surgery can be used when medications don't work well, but a 1996 study concluded that laser surgery, as a first-line therapy, works as well as eyedrops and has fewer side effects. However, the effect of laser surgery can wear off with time, and additional treatment may be necessary. When the eyeball is too long from front to back or the cornea is too curved, the result can be myopia, better known as nearsightedness. People with myopia can see close objects clearly, but objects at a distance look blurry. In normal vision, the image of a distant object gets focused on the retina, but in myopia, because of the greater length of the eyeball, the focused image falls short of the retina. The result: a fuzzy image. Myopia tends to be hereditary, developing at around age 12 and progressing until about age 20. Rarely does the condition get any worse after age 30 and, in fact, sometimes it improves after that age. Eyeglasses or contact lenses easily correct nearsightedness. People who don't want to bother with either types of eyewear might consider radial keratotomy. This is a surgical procedure that involves cutting a number of spokes into the corneal surface, thus altering the shape of the cornea and correcting nearsightedness. In 1994, ophthalmologists released the first long-term study on radial keratotomy, funded by the National Eye Institute. Results showed that 70 percent of people who'd had radial keratotomy didn't need to wear corrective lenses 10 years after surgery. Radial keratotomy doesn't work for everyone, and there are risks, such as poor reading vision or poor night vision. People who are the best candidates for the procedure are those who are only mildly nearsighted. Anyone considering the surgery should fully discuss the expected results and possible complications with an ophthalmologist. A new procedure, called photorefractive keratotomy, is also available. Most eye problems, thankfully, are only temporary, and they will clear up with the proper treatment. For more information on temporary eye conditions, turn to the next section.

If you're visually impaired due to glaucoma or another eye problem, many devices are available to help you see better. Magnifying spectacles (available over the counter at pharmacies) Telescopes (some people use tiny telescopes mounted in spectacles for sighting objects at distances, such as street signs) Closed-circuit televisions (these produce an enlarged image on a TV monitor) Talking appliances, such as timers, clocks, or computers Remember, too, that adequate lighting makes a big difference (the average 60-year-old with no eye disorder requires twice as much illumination as a 20-year-old to read comfortably). ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. Sometimes even the best prevention efforts can't stop a problem from cropping up. The following are some of the most common eye problems, how to recognize them, how to deal with them, and how to keep them from coming back. Blepharitis is an inflammation of the edges of the eyelids, causing redness and thickening. Scales and crusts or shallow ulcers (eroded areas) may also appear. The disease is common, especially in children, and often affects the upper and lower eyelids of both eyes. There are two types: ulcerous and nonulcerous. Infection of eyelash follicles and oil glands cause ulcerous blepharitis. The nonulcerous variety, which is more common, can be caused by an allergy or seborrheic dermatitis, which is an inflammatory scaling of the scalp, eyebrows, or ears. Lice can also sometimes cause the nonulcerous type. irritation of the underside of the lid (as if dirt or sand were underneath) Conjunctivitis, also called pinkeye, is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, a delicate membrane that lines the inner surface of the eyelid and covers the exposed surface of the eye. Children are more commonly affected than adults.Bacteria and viruses are the usual causes of conjunctivitis. Allergies, chemicals, dust, smoke, exposure to chlorine in swimming pools, and foreign objects that irritate the conjunctiva may also lead to this condition. Occasionally, a sexually transmitted disease can cause pinkeye. Normally, the retina is firmly attached to the choroid, an underlying layer of tissue that is rich in blood vessels. If sufficient blood or other fluid collects between the retina and the choroid, the retina can become partially or totally detached. Initial symptoms of a detached retina include seeing floating dark spots or streaks of light and experiencing blurring of vision. This can occur suddenly or gradually. As the condition progresses, a curtain or veil seems to fall over part or all of the field of vision. To safeguard your sight, you should seek medical attention immediately if these symptoms develop. Cataract surgery, severe nearsightedness, and injury can cause retinal detachment. Conditions that heighten susceptibility to this condition are inflammation or tumors of the eye, high blood pressure, and hemorrhaging (bleeding) inside the eye. Treatment procedures include, among others, laser fusion and surgery. Left untreated, detachment may worsen and eventually lead to blindness. Newborn babies are usually given antibiotic eye drops soon after birth to prevent development of conjunctivitis that could badly damage the eyes. Conjunctivitis is usually not a serious disease and may or may not require medical care. There is one important exception: Any time conjunctivitis appears in a newborn infant, treatment should be sought immediately. The baby's vision could be at risk. ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. When your eyes don't tear properly, they can sting, burn, and itch. These are the symptoms of dry eyes, a condition most common in women after menopause. Antianxiety and sleeping medications, antihistamines, decongestants, and some arthritis and high blood pressure medications also can cause or worsen dry eyes. Sometimes an allergic reaction to eyedrops or an infection that blocks the tear ducts can result in dry eyes, or the condition may, in rare cases, be the result of Sjögren syndrome -- a chronic connective tissue disorder. Dry eyes often accompany blepharitis. See your doctor for a diagnosis. Artificial tear preparations can help relieve the symptoms. Avoid over-the-counter eyedrops that contain vasoconstrictors; these may cause further drying. Other steps to take: Keep the relative humidity of your home and office between 30 and 50 percent. Red eyes can signify a variety of troubles, from lack of sleep or a minor medical condition to a major vision-threatening illness. If sleep deprivation isn't the problem, your red eyes might indicate: a small problem that will heal itself, such as a rupture of the tiny blood vessels of the conjunctiva possibly caused by hard coughing or sneezing iritis, an inflammation of the uvea, the layer of the eye that includes the iris (Iritis may require drug treatment.) a trauma, such as a foreign object in the eye, which may require first aid and possible professional medical attention To get rid of redness, you can use decongestant eyedrops available over the counter. But don't overdo them. Also, before using drops, check with your doctor to be sure your eye redness isn't a symptom of something serious. Also, any time you have red eyes along with pain, significant eye discharge, blurred vision, or severe sensitivity to light, see your doctor. These symptoms could indicate an inflammation on the inside of the eye, an ulcer of the eye, or even glaucoma. You should never rub irritated eyes. If a foreign object is in your eye, you could cause serious damage. In this condition, deterioration occurs in the macula, the small central part of the retina. This deterioration leads to blurring of central vision, while peripheral vision remains intact. Macular degeneration is the leading cause of central-vision loss among people over age 60. It usually doesn't lead to total blindness, but it severely restricts activities relying on central vision, such as reading and driving. Risk factors for macular degeneration include smoking, age, family history of macular degeneration, and being a white woman. There are two types of macular degeneration: dry macular degeneration and wet macular degeneration. Wet macular degeneration is the most severe type and causes the most visual loss, but it accounts for only 10 percent of all cases of macular degeneration. Dry macular degeneration is more common, accounting for 90 percent of all cases, and tends to progress more slowly. In all cases, visual loss is progressive, but the rate varies with the type and stage of the condition. There are many new treatment options that can slow its progression, although they cannot cure the disease. If you're diagnosed with an early stage of the disease, talk to your doctor about taking high doses of vitamins A, C, and E and the mineral zinc. These have been shown to help slow progression of the disease. Smokers, however, should not take formulations that contain beta-carotene, as this increases the risk of lung cancer. More advanced stages of macular degeneration can be treated with various types of laser therapy or with injections of a drug directly into the eye(s) that interferes with the mechanism that causes the condition. A person with night blindness can see fine in good light but not in dim or fading light. Causes of night blindness include either a severe vitamin A deficiency, or an inherited degenerative disorder of the retina called retinitis pigmentosa. In the case of severe vitamin A deficiency, treatment would be administration of the vitamin. A physician's care is crucial, however, to be sure that night blindness is, indeed, the problem and that the doses of the vitamin are safe. Inflammation of the retina, or retinitis, can have many causes, ranging from hereditary conditions to infections. Various forms have many of the same symptoms: Although it's only about the size of a pimple, a sty can be extremely annoying and painful. This inflamed or infected swelling can be the result of an infected follicle (the canals from which hairs sprout), or it may be from a blocked gland in the eyelid. Sties are sometimes, but not always, related to blepharitis. At first, a sty feels like a foreign object in the eye. Tearing, redness, swelling, and tenderness soon follow. The eye may be sensitive to light and touch, and pus may form inside the pimplelike bump, which may burst. A sty will go away on its own, although you might have to live with it for a week or so. Applying warm, moist compresses several times a day may encourage the sty to burst and then begin to heal. DO NOT, however, squeeze a sty. You risk making it much worse. If the sty doesn't improve, see your doctor. An antibiotic ointment or, rarely, surgical removal may be in order. Our eyes are extremely intricate yet delicate apparatuses. Since they are such a vital part of the way we interact with the world, don't they deserve the best care possible? This information is solely for informational purposes.

Overusing eyedrops won't do much for redness, either, as the drops remove the redness by constricting the blood vessels in the eyes. Repeated use leads to a rebound effect and makes the eyes redder in the long run. On the other hand, if you know you're suffering from dry eyes, a drop or two of an over-the-counter eye lubricant, commonly referred to as artificial tears, may give you relief.

Logout   Here’s how to protect yourself at a time that fewer people are going to the eye doctor | The pandemic hasn’t been good for our eyesight. It’s not just the amount of time we spend staring at computer screens. As we pared back our doctor visits, eye care was one of the first priorities to be slashed: There were an estimated 44 percent fewer ophthalmology visits and procedures done in 2020 than in 2019 — one of the biggest dips for any medical subspecialty, according to analysis from Strata Decision Technology. For the latest coronavirus news and advice . That’s a potential problem. “The eyes are built to last a long time,” says Stephen Christiansen, M.D., chief of ophthalmology at Boston Medical Center. But they need care. So as the global  heads into its second year, here are some steps you can take today to protect your eyes and equip your home in a vision-friendly way.  Keep it moving, people. Low to moderate exercise for as little as three hours per week is associated with as much as a 41 percent lower likelihood of developing age-related  (AMD), according to a meta-analysis in the In addition, a study of those diagnosed with glaucoma showed that taking an extra 5,000 steps a day slows the rate of vision loss by 10 percent.  of high blood pressure and diabetes, diseases that damage blood vessels that nourish the eyes, which can eventually compromise your vision or lead to blindness. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, typically infects you via your mouth and nose, but your eyes might also be a portal. Research has found that viral particles can land on the conjunctiva (the clear tissue covering the white part of your eye) and begin to replicate. “In a small proportion of patients, conjunctivitis — pink eye — can be one of the earliest signs of COVID-19,” explains ophthalmologist Stephen Christiansen, M.D. Be on the lookout for associated symptoms, like a fever. And be careful around others; tears themselves can be infected with the coronavirus. After blotting your eyes, properly dispose of any tissues and, yes, wash your hands (again). If you’re at especially high risk, or if you’re entering a high-risk area such as a hospital, it might be worthwhile to invest in a pair of protective goggles; be sure to wash them after use. .  UV light from the sun can damage the proteins in the lens of the eye, contributing to cataract formation. You need protection — even in January. “Wear sunglasses in the summer and winter, whether it’s cloudy or sunny, even in the car,” advises Stephanie Marioneaux, M.D., clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO). by buying a pair with “100% UV” or “UV400” protection, according to the sticker on the lens. You’ll find them at all prices. “I’ve even seen these at discount dollar stores,” she says. The AAO also recommends oversize sunglasses for maximum coverage. If you wear glasses but don’t want to buy a separate pair of prescription sunglasses, a money-saving option is clip-on shades that attach to your existing frame. These can be purchased online for as little as $25.  Whether you’re drilling or sawing, or just mowing your lawn, you’ll want to wear eye protection, notes Rachel Bishop, M.D., a staff clinician at the National Eye Institute. “It doesn’t take much — a shard of metal or a wood splinter — to lodge in your eye and cause an injury that could have been entirely avoidable.” Make it a habit to pop on a pair of well-fitting safety goggles or protective glasses when doing this kind of work, inside or out.  join AARP and enroll in Automatic Renewal for first year. Get instant access to discounts, programs, services, and the information you need to benefit every area of your life. While an at-home test isn’t a substitute for an in-person comprehensive eye exam, you can use it to monitor how your eyes are doing. This chart is a grid with a black dot in the center. “The Amsler grid is an extremely helpful tool for patients with age-related macular degeneration,” notes Paras Shah, M.D., an ophthalmologist with NorthShore University HealthSystem in Glenview, Illinois. AMD is one of the leading causes of vision loss, and it has no cure. But with proper treatment, its progress can be significantly slowed. Taking the at-home “test” can help you detect if there’s a change in one eye; you can alert your doctor accordingly. The chart is available at . The Snellen chart is the good old eye chart that you know and love. The AAO website () provides a . After printing it out, hang it on a wall with no windows. Sitting 10 feet away, with the grid at eye level, read the chart, covering one eye at a time. If the results are concerning, make an appointment with your eye doctor. Tear production naturally diminishes as you get older, Christiansen says. The problem is, tears are what keep the conjunctiva, the thin membrane on the surface of the eye, moist. “Once this membrane becomes dry, it loses its protective function and the result is inflammation,” he adds. Your eyes may become watery as your body tries to overcompensate for the dryness. For most patients, over-the-counter artificial tears are all that’s needed, says Christiansen. Eye drops with preservatives tend to be much cheaper, but some people find they cause irritation. Preservative-free eye drops are often packaged in single-use vials. Try both to see which works best for you, he recommends. . If harsh lighting conditions trigger headaches, try using softer-light or LED bulbs, which dim without flickering, strobing, causing glare or making a humming noise. Set up your computer so you’re about 25 inches away from the screen, and position it so you’re looking slightly down at it instead of straight ahead, suggests the AAO. Remember to give yourself occasional breaks from endless Zoom meetings by following the 20/20/20 rule: Turn your head every 20 minutes to look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. . Talk to your ophthalmologist about getting a pair of that are specially designed to help reduce eyestrain. The doctor will calculate the distance you sit from your computer and give you a prescription for single-vision glasses designed for intermediate-distance viewing. “They’re easier to use for prolonged computer use, compared with bifocals or trifocal lenses,” Marioneaux says. There’s no need, however, to invest in special glasses designed to block blue light. According to Marioneaux, the evidence-based medicine does not currently support the use of blue blockers.

c1be0b61-0f3e-4cfe-a7a8-8bd78f53dd36,". | Visitors are no longer permitted at any Ohio State health care facility. Nationally ranked in 9 specialties by U.S. News & World Report. Committed to improving health and wellness in our Ohio communities. The world is changing. Medicine is changing. We're leading the way. Author: For those of us who love to read, digital devices have opened up a rich new world of literary exploration. But as your mind expands, how are your eyes doing? They might be struggling. Here’s why digital content is tougher on your eyes—and what you can do make it easier and keep on reading. Digital content causes more interference with blink rate and increases dry eye symptoms, leading to more discomfort while reading. Our blink rate is reduced 30% to 50% when using digital devices, compared to when we’re having a conversation with someone in person. This disrupts the eye surface and the layer of tears covering the eyeball. Without adequate tear film coverage, you may notice blurred vision that varies while blinking, burning, irritation, redness and a sandy or gritty sensation. In addition, a full blink helps release secretions from eye glands that improve the tear film on the eye surface. When reading on digital devices, we often don’t completely blink, further drying out the surface of the eye. As we get older, the eye surface does change and symptoms of dryness generally increase. So while digital devices may dry our eyes, do they have any advantages over traditional books? The ability of a digital device to change font size, background color and contrast of the letters provides an advantage over printed material. Especially with newspapers and books that don’t have black letters on true white backgrounds, the contrast of the font color to the background color can cause difficulty reading. The ability to change font size digitally can also be significantly helpful if you have any visual impairments. Too much reading doesn’t usually cause long-term damage, but it can be very uncomfortable if the eye surface is excessively dry, you don’t have the correct glasses or contact lens prescription, or you have an eye muscle imbalance making it difficult to read comfortably. What should we do to give our eyes a break when we’re doing a lot of reading? We know symptoms of eyestrain related to reading increase as you continue to read without a break. The 20/20/20 rule allows your eyes to relax and relieve eyestrain. Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away (something on a wall, out a window, etc.) for 20 seconds to relieve any strain on your focusing system. What are some other ways to improve our digital reading experience? Read digital content from at least 16-30 inches away. If reading material is too close to the eyes, it can increase strain on the focusing system and eye muscles. Simulate the posture you have while reading printed material—move computer monitors to a position about five to six inches below eye level. By reading in a slight downward position, you allow your eyelids to stay at a more natural position. Increase font size on the screen if possible. You shouldn’t feel as if you’re straining or squinting to read. Decrease any glare on the screen you’re reading from, especially from windows or overhead lighting. Limit reading from digital devices before trying to fall asleep. Reading from digital devices can disrupt your ability to fall asleep and circadian rhythms, where traditional printed material doesn’t. If symptoms of dryness persist, consider using an artificial tear drop to aide in hydrating the eye surface. Avoid any drops that “get the red out,” as these drops aren’t helpful to dryness and will usually make redness worse as the drop wears off. Visit your eye doctor to assess if any glasses prescription or specific reading glasses would be helpful to relieve any symptoms you may have related to digital device use.  Should we consider audiobooks to reduce eyestrain, or are there benefits to reading? Audiobooks are an option if eyestrain is greatly limiting the amount of reading you’re able to do comfortably. There is a downside, though—studies show that people with normal vision comprehend more when reading versus audio recordings of the same content. This is also true for visually impaired people, where Braille comprehension is higher when compared to audio content. Stephanie Pisano is an ophthalmologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and an assistant professor in the Ohio State College of Medicine. Does blue light from electronic devices damage our eyes? Why contact lens wearers are switching to glasses during COVID-19 threat While you may prefer to wear contact lenses, there are several reasons why you may want to make a temporary switch to glasses during the COVID-19 threat. Glaucoma is the second-leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Millions of people have been diagnosed with glaucoma worldwide, and that number is expected to increase in the future. An ocular migraine is really a migraine with visual aura. Typically, these are visual symptoms that occur just prior to a migraine, although they can occur during a migraine, as well.

It’s not just the amount of time we spend staring at computer screens. As we pared back our doctor visits, eye care was one of the first priorities to be slashed: There were an estimated 44 percent fewer ophthalmology visits and procedures done in 2020 than in 2019 — one of the biggest dips for any medical subspecialty, according to analysis from Strata Decision Technology. For the latest coronavirus news and advice . That’s a potential problem. “The eyes are built to last a long time,” says Stephen Christiansen, M.D., chief of ophthalmology at Boston Medical Center. But they need care. So as the global  heads into its second year, here are some steps you can take today to protect your eyes and equip your home in a vision-friendly way.  Keep it moving, people. Low to moderate exercise for as little as three hours per week is associated with as much as a 41 percent lower likelihood of developing age-related  (AMD), according to a meta-analysis in the In addition, a study of those diagnosed with glaucoma showed that taking an extra 5,000 steps a day slows the rate of vision loss by 10 percent.  of high blood pressure and diabetes, diseases that damage blood vessels that nourish the eyes, which can eventually compromise your vision or lead to blindness. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, typically infects you via your mouth and nose, but your eyes might also be a portal. Research has found that viral particles can land on the conjunctiva (the clear tissue covering the white part of your eye) and begin to replicate. “In a small proportion of patients, conjunctivitis — pink eye — can be one of the earliest signs of COVID-19,” explains ophthalmologist Stephen Christiansen, M.D. Be on the lookout for associated symptoms, like a fever. And be careful around others; tears themselves can be infected with the coronavirus. After blotting your eyes, properly dispose of any tissues and, yes, wash your hands (again). If you’re at especially high risk, or if you’re entering a high-risk area such as a hospital, it might be worthwhile to invest in a pair of protective goggles; be sure to wash them after use. .  UV light from the sun can damage the proteins in the lens of the eye, contributing to cataract formation. You need protection — even in January. “Wear sunglasses in the summer and winter, whether it’s cloudy or sunny, even in the car,” advises Stephanie Marioneaux, M.D., clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO). by buying a pair with “100% UV” or “UV400” protection, according to the sticker on the lens. You’ll find them at all prices. “I’ve even seen these at discount dollar stores,” she says. The AAO also recommends oversize sunglasses for maximum coverage. If you wear glasses but don’t want to buy a separate pair of prescription sunglasses, a money-saving option is clip-on shades that attach to your existing frame. These can be purchased online for as little as $25.  Whether you’re drilling or sawing, or just mowing your lawn, you’ll want to wear eye protection, notes Rachel Bishop, M.D., a staff clinician at the National Eye Institute. “It doesn’t take much — a shard of metal or a wood splinter — to lodge in your eye and cause an injury that could have been entirely avoidable.” Make it a habit to pop on a pair of well-fitting safety goggles or protective glasses when doing this kind of work, inside or out.  join AARP and enroll in Automatic Renewal for first year. Get instant access to discounts, programs, services, and the information you need to benefit every area of your life. While an at-home test isn’t a substitute for an in-person comprehensive eye exam, you can use it to monitor how your eyes are doing. This chart is a grid with a black dot in the center. “The Amsler grid is an extremely helpful tool for patients with age-related macular degeneration,” notes Paras Shah, M.D., an ophthalmologist with NorthShore University HealthSystem in Glenview, Illinois. AMD is one of the leading causes of vision loss, and it has no cure. But with proper treatment, its progress can be significantly slowed. Taking the at-home “test” can help you detect if there’s a change in one eye; you can alert your doctor accordingly. The chart is available at . The Snellen chart is the good old eye chart that you know and love. The AAO website () provides a . After printing it out, hang it on a wall with no windows. Sitting 10 feet away, with the grid at eye level, read the chart, covering one eye at a time. If the results are concerning, make an appointment with your eye doctor. Tear production naturally diminishes as you get older, Christiansen says. The problem is, tears are what keep the conjunctiva, the thin membrane on the surface of the eye, moist. “Once this membrane becomes dry, it loses its protective function and the result is inflammation,” he adds. Your eyes may become watery as your body tries to overcompensate for the dryness. For most patients, over-the-counter artificial tears are all that’s needed, says Christiansen. Eye drops with preservatives tend to be much cheaper, but some people find they cause irritation. Preservative-free eye drops are often packaged in single-use vials. Try both to see which works best for you, he recommends. . If harsh lighting conditions trigger headaches, try using softer-light or LED bulbs, which dim without flickering, strobing, causing glare or making a humming noise. Set up your computer so you’re about 25 inches away from the screen, and position it so you’re looking slightly down at it instead of straight ahead, suggests the AAO. Remember to give yourself occasional breaks from endless Zoom meetings by following the 20/20/20 rule: Turn your head every 20 minutes to look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. . Talk to your ophthalmologist about getting a pair of that are specially designed to help reduce eyestrain. The doctor will calculate the distance you sit from your computer and give you a prescription for single-vision glasses designed for intermediate-distance viewing. “They’re easier to use for prolonged computer use, compared with bifocals or trifocal lenses,” Marioneaux says. There’s no need, however, to invest in special glasses designed to block blue light. According to Marioneaux, the evidence-based medicine does not currently support the use of blue blockers.

9e5450f0-3b99-42c7-96cd-1ffed58187e9,"Medically reviewed by — — Screen time is a big issue these days. You probably spend a good number of hours looking at screens, like your computer at work and at home, your smartphone, television, or other digital devices. Looking at screens too much can lead to eye strain. But the 20-20-20 rule may help. Keep reading to learn more about this eye exercise, how to do it, and whether or not research says it’s effective. If you find yourself gazing at screens all day, your eye doctor may have mentioned this rule to you. Basically, every 20 minutes spent using a screen, you should try to look away at something that is 20 feet away from you for a total of 20 seconds. Unless you have a tape measure you probably won’t be able to accurately measure 20 feet. Being exact isn’t the key. You should just try to focus on something far away from you. Consider looking out a window at an object that seems far away, like a tree or a building across the street. If you work in a small space, try walking outdoors or into a larger area where you can rest your eyes. It takes about for your eyes to completely relax. While you’re resting your eyes, it’s also a good idea to get up and grab a drink of water to keep yourself hydrated. If your body is hydrated, your eyes will be as well. Drinking green tea during your break may help even more. That’s because green tea contains antioxidants called that may help your eyes produce tears for better lubrication. What about reminding yourself to do this every 20 minutes? You probably get absorbed in reading or work when you’re looking at screens. Setting a timed reminder to pop up can help you take a break every 20 minutes. There are also free apps like that can help. Just click start when you begin your screen time, and the app will remind you to take a break. The explains that looking at digital devices won’t necessarily damage your eyesight. But it can cause strain and unpleasant symptoms. Humans normally blink around 15 times each minute. When staring at screens, this number decreases to a half or third that often. That can lead to dry, irritated, and tired eyes. Eye strain caused by screens has its own name. It’s called computer vision syndrome (CVS). In a study published by the , researchers examined computer use and its effects on the eyes of university students in Malaysia. Almost 90 percent of the 795 students had symptoms of CVS after just two continuous hours of computer usage. Taking frequent breaks to look at faraway objects during screen time significantly lessened their eye strain symptoms. In other words, the 20-20-20 rule works. While many doctors suggest the 20-20-20 rule is a best line of defense, researchers explain that any break from repetitive computer work or screens is beneficial. They also explain that children don’t typically notice eye strain as much as adults. As a result, children’s screen time should be monitored closely by caregivers. Having sore, tired, burning, or itching eyes are the main symptoms of eye strain. While these symptoms likely point to eye strain, it’s a good idea to report any changes in your vision or eye health to your doctor. Eye strain from computers and other digital devices can be uncomfortable. The 20-20-20 rule may help you avoid eye strain along with decreasing your time spent looking at screens. Even if the strain feels severe it will likely not cause permanent damage to your vision. And your symptoms should subside once you rest your eyes. Want to avoid eye strain? Whenever you sit down to look at a screen, remember to follow these ergonomic eye tips. Sit farther away from your computer screen. A good rule is to be at least , or roughly an arm’s length, away. While you’re at it, move the screen so you have to look slightly downward at the screen. Consider using a matte screen filter to reduce your screen’s glare. Try your best to remember to follow the 20-20-20 rule. Set a timer to remind you to look away every 20 minutes at an object that is about 20 feet away for a full 20 seconds. Buy some artificial tears at your local drugstore to use when your eyes feel dry. A humidifier can also help. Blink often to help replenish your eye’s own tears. Dim your screen if it’s much brighter than the rest of the light in the area. You could also adjust the room lighting so the contrast is lessened. Keep your screens clean. Dirty screens with fingerprints and other debris can strain your eyes even more. If you wear contact lenses, you may experience worsened symptoms of dryness and irritation. Try giving your eyes a break from time to time by wearing glasses. Avoid sleeping in contact lenses, even those that are marketed as “extended wear.” Also always wash your hands and follow other good hygiene when putting in or taking out your lenses.

48bce105-1340-4fe8-bb2a-297e13d3dec1,"Powered by | | | | | | | | Appropriately placing lighting and selecting the right level of illumination can enhance your ability to see monitor images. For example, if lighting is excessive or causes glare on the monitor screen, you may develop eyestrain or headaches, and may have to work in awkward postures to view the screen. Ventilation and humidity levels in office work environments may affect user comfort and productivity. Arrange your office to minimize glare from overhead lights, desk lamps, and windows. Avoid sitting directly under air conditioning vents that ""dump"" air right on top of you. Bright lights shining on the display screen ""wash out"" images, making it difficult to clearly see your work. Straining to view objects on the screen can lead to eye fatigue. Figure 1. Blinds are on the windows and the monitor is placed at an angle (perpendicular) Place rows of lights parallel to your line of sight (Figure 1). Provide light diffusers so that desk tasks (writing, reading papers) can be performed while limiting direct brightness on the computer screen. Remove the middle bulbs of 4-bulb fluorescent light fixtures to reduce the brightness of the light to levels more compatible with computer tasks if diffusers or alternative light sources are not available. a standard florescent light fixture on a nine-foot ceiling with four, 40-watt bulbs will produce approximately 50 foot-candles of light at the desktop level. Provide supplemental task/desk lighting to adequately illuminate writing and reading tasks while limiting brightness around monitors. Generally, for paper tasks and offices with CRT displays, office lighting should range between 20 to 50 foot-candles. If LCD monitors are in use, higher levels of light are usually needed for the same viewing tasks (up to 73 foot-candles). Bright light sources behind the display screen can create contrast problems, making it difficult to clearly see your work (Figure 2). Use blinds or drapes on windows to eliminate bright light. Blinds and furniture placement should be adjusted to allow light into the room, but not directly into your field of view (Figure 1). vertical blinds work best for East/West facing windows and horizontal blinds for North/South facing windows. Use indirect or shielded lighting where possible and avoid intense or uneven lighting in your field of vision. Ensure that lamps have glare shields or shades to direct light away from your line of sight. Reorient the workstation so bright lights from open windows are at right angles with the computer screen (Figure 1). High contrast between light and dark areas of the computer screen, horizontal work surface, and surrounding areas can cause eye fatigue and headaches. For computer work, use well-distributed diffuse light. The advantage of diffuse lighting is that: There are fewer hot spots (or glare surfaces) in the visual field. The contrasts created by the shape of objects tend to be softer. Use light, matte colors and finishes on walls and ceilings to better reflect indirect lighting and reduce dark shadows and contrast. Direct light sources (for example, windows, overhead lights) that cause reflected light to show up on the monitor (Figure 3) make images more difficult to see, resulting in eye strain and fatigue. Place the face of the display screen at right angles to windows and light sources. Position task lighting (for example, a desk lamp) so the light does not reflect on the screen (Figure 1). Clean the monitor frequently. A layer of dust can contribute to glare. Use blinds or drapes on windows to help reduce glare (Figure 1). vertical blinds work best for East/West facing windows and horizontal blinds for North/South facing windows. Use glare filters that attach directly to the surface of the monitor to reduce glare (Figure 4). Glare filters, when used, should not significantly decrease screen visibility. Install louvers, or ""egg crates"", in overhead lights to re-direct lighting. Use barriers or light diffusers on fixtures to reduce glare from overhead lighting. Generally, a large number of low powered lamps rather than a small number of high powered lamps will result in less glare. Reflected light from polished surfaces, such as a keyboards, may cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance and visibility. To limit reflection from walls and work surfaces around the screen, paint them with a medium colored, non-reflective paint. Arrange workstations and lighting to avoid reflected glare on the display screen or surrounding surfaces. Tilt down the monitor slightly to prevent it from reflecting overhead light. Set the computer monitor for dark characters on a light background; they are less affected by reflections than are light characters on a dark background. Users may experience discomfort from poorly designed or malfunctioning ventilation systems, for example, air conditioners or heaters that directly ""dump"" air on users. Dry air can dry the eyes (especially if the user wears contact lenses). Poor air circulation can result in stuffy or stagnant conditions. Temperatures above or below standard comfort levels can affect comfort and productivity. Do not place desks, chairs, and other office furniture directly under air conditioning vents unless the vents are designed to redirect the air flow away from these areas. Use diffusers or blocks to redirect and mix air flows from ventilation systems (Figure 6). Keep air flow rates within three and six inches per second (7.5 and 15 centimeters per second). These air flow rates are barely noticeable or not noticeable at all. Keep relative humidity of the air between 30% and 60%. The recommended ambient indoor temperatures range between 68° and 74° F (20° and 23.5° C) during heating season and between 73° and 78° F (23° and 26° C) during the cooling season. Exposure to chemicals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ozone, and particles from computers and their peripherals (for example, laser printers) may cause discomfort or health problems. Enquire about the potential for a computer or its components to emit pollutants. Those that do should be placed in well-ventilated areas. Maintain proper ventilation to ensure that there is an adequate supply of fresh air. Allow new equipment to ""air out"" in a well-ventilated area prior to installing. | | | | | | Occupational Safety and Health Administration 200 Constitution Ave NW Washington, DC 20210 (OSHA) Occupational Safety and Health Administration 200 Constitution Ave NW Washington, DC 20210 You are exiting the Department of Labor's Web server.

743b1add-9806-4357-ad63-e967375fa438,"Watching TV in a lawn chair in a dark room may cause eyestrain. Every kid knows the list of warnings from Mom: ""If you cross your eyes, they'll get stuck that way."" ""Gum stays in your tummy for seven years."" ""Cracking your knuckles causes arthritis."" ""Too much television is bad for your eyes."" Some of these are true; some aren't. And some exist in a murky place in between fact and fiction. ""Watching too much television is bad for your eyes"" is one of those murkier examples. The answer isn't all that clear. Most experts agree that staring at the television (and computer monitors) won't cause permanent damage to a person's eyes. However, focusing your eyes too long on any one thing can cause , a temporary (but irritating) problem. We'll talk more about later in the article. So, if watching too much television won't actually impair your vision, where did this warning come from? Interestingly enough, at one time, the warning was based in truth. Back in the 1960s, more and more families could afford televisions, and it was a pretty new and exciting technology. Of course, these weren't the flat-screen LCD televisions we enjoy today. Back then, televisions were big, boxy affairs -- full of tubes and wires and bulbs. Around 1967 or so, General Electric Company (GE) disclosed the fact that many of their color televisions were, due to a factory error, emitting excessive X-rays. Overexposure to X-rays can be dangerous, and Public Health Service officials estimated the radiation from the tube was 10 to 100,000 times the rate considered safe and normal. GE corrected the problem by shielding the tubes inside the television with leaded glass. At the time, health officials stated the excessive levels of radiation wouldn't harm most viewers. However, they did warn against children sitting close to the television for more than an hour, due to the X-rays shooting through the vents on the bottom of the set. Even though GE recalled and repaired the faulty television sets, the threat of physically damaging X-rays remained in people's thoughts. So, that's one reason why Mom and Dad warn us not to spend too much time watching TV. Another reason? Children typically sit on the floor to watch television, with their heads tilted up. This causes more eyestrain than sitting eye-level with the television set. Again, eyestrain isn't a permanent problem. Lastly, parents can mistake the symptom for the cause. Sitting close to the television may not make a child nearsighted, but a child may sit close to the television because he or she is nearsighted and undiagnosed. If your child habitually sits too close to the television for comfort, get his or her eyes tested. Next, we'll talk about the relationship between technology and eye problems. And later, you'll learn more about eyestrain and how to prevent it. Keep reading (but don't forget to rest your eyes)! Most eye doctors will assure you that watching too much television won't permanently damage your eyes. However, it's worth noting a few interesting studies on the subject. Several of these reports have illustrated a link between myopia (nearsightedness) and environment. First, a little bit about your eyes and . The cornea and the lens are the parts of the eye that focus images. In a normal eye, these parts have a perfect shape and curve. The curve refracts light so it makes a sharply focused image right on the retina. In a myopic eye, the cornea or lens usually curves too much, causing a refractive error. This causes the light to focus in front of the retina, making faraway objects appear blurry. If you suffer from myopia, you can see nearby objects clearly, but objects far away are out of focus. You might have to squint to see more clearly. Myopia can be slight or severe and is easily treated with corrective glasses or contact lenses. Some people believe that environmental factors may also cause myopia -- like sitting too close to the television or computer monitor, or too much close reading. Back in the late 1960s, a controversial study of Eskimo families ignited this debate. Researchers studied a group of Eskimos who hadn't been introduced to formal schooling or modern civilization until around World War II. The researchers made an interesting discovery -- in this group, people aged 56 or older had zero incidence of myopia. Parents aged 30 and up had about an 8 percent incidence, but their children -- who were the first of their group to start reading -- had a 59 percent incidence of myopia. The obvious conclusion was that close focusing, like reading, caused myopia. Some question this study, however, since the children who were tested were brought to the eye clinic because their parents already thought they had vision problems [source: ]. More recently, an Australian study found that children who spend more time outside don't develop myopia as often as children who spend more time indoors. The study compared two groups of children. Both groups spent an equal amount of time watching television, reading and playing computer games. However, one group spent only 30 minutes a day outside, while the other group spent about two hours outside. The second group had much fewer instances of myopia, leading researchers to believe that the sun may help regulate growth of the eyeball during childhood. Time spent watching TV didn't make much of a difference. While watching TV may not cause blindness or any other permanent damage to the eyes, it can cause eyestrain. More about that on the next page. Another thing Mom always told us to do? ""Eat your carrots for better eyes!"" It's true that carrots have Vitamin A, a deficiency of which can cause blindness. But eating more than the recommended daily allowance won't improve your vision. In reality, the dates back to World War II. The British government didn't want the Germans to know that the reason they were shooting down so many German planes was because of their new radar system. So they spread propaganda that said their pilots were eating tons of carrots to improve their vision. It's unlikely that watching too much television, reading too many books or staring at a computer screen will permanently damage your eyes. However, all of these activities can cause eyestrain, which isn't something you should ignore. Eyestrain is when your eyes get overtired from too much use. You can get eyestrain from watching television in a dark room, excessive computer use or even driving. can contribute to eyestrain as well. Any time you intensely focus your eyes on something for a long period, you're at risk for eyestrain. Trouble focusing between paper and computer monitor Eyestrain is a short-lived condition that you can treat yourself. For most people, the treatment simply is to rest your eyes. Take regular breaks from intense focus -- about five minutes each hour. Blink often to keep your eyes moist. If your eyes are dry, try some over-the-counter artificial tears to re-moisten them. Also, ensure your glasses or contact lenses are appropriate and up-to-date for your needs. You can even buy some that are specially suited for computer work. To prevent or minimize future eyestrain issues, you can make several changes to your work and home environments. Here are a few tips: The top of your monitor should be about eye level or below. You should look slightly down in order to read the monitor. Take steps to reduce glare -- turn off bright overhead lights or close the blinds. Make sure your keyboard is directly in front of your monitor so your eyes don't have to work too hard. When knitting, sewing or performing other up-close work, ensure your light is bright enough and shines directly on your work. While reading in a chair, the light source should come from behind you and shine directly on the page. Keep the room lighted softly while watching television or DVDs. Too much contrast between the screen and the rest of the room can make your eyes work too hard. For more on television and eyestrain, look at the links on the next page. Dry eye occurs when the eye doesn't produce enough moisture to keep itself protected and comfortable. Some people suffer from chronic dry eye, brought on by aging or simply an imbalance within the eye. However, those of us who work in front of a computer all day may suffer from dry eye from time to time. When we focus intensely on one thing for a while, we don't blink as often. Blinking is what keeps our eyes lubricated. You can avoid dry eye by remembering to blink, avoiding eyestrain, and using moisturizing eye drops. If you feel yours is a chronic condition, visit your doctor to find out about further treatments. Adams, Cecil. ""Will sitting too close to the TV, reading with bad light, etc., ruin your eyes?""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. 4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing The trend of increased degree production and course enrollment in computer science (CS) and related fields is prominent across a wide range of institutions, as discussed in and . As with any academic discipline, students’ enrollment decisions are informed by a variety of factors, including planned career path, availability of jobs, salary expectations, intellectual interest, appeal of specific degree programs and courses within an institution, and other social or personal factors. In order to shed light on the specific drivers underlying the current growth and how these factors may affect future enrollments, this chapter examines the labor market in computing and discusses the changing role of computing in the economy, in higher education, and in society at large. While it is impossible to know what the future will bring, understanding the drivers of the recent increases in CS enrollment will inform expectations of future demand. Undergraduate students’ choices about courses and major field of study may be directly and indirectly influenced by the current state of the labor market. The existence of dynamic adjustment in science and engineering labor markets was recognized as far back as the 1970s, when economist Richard Freeman wrote about the expansion and contraction of opportunities for physicists and engineers. Writing in 1975, Freeman described the labor market for physicists using this language of cyclical fluctuation: “Although the engineering profession has grown steadily over the past several decades, the labor market for engineers has exhibited marked cyclical fluctuation. A shortage of engineers in the late 1950s and early 1960s was followed by a surplus in the late 1960s and early 1970s” (see , ). ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. In essence, degree production in particular fields at colleges and universities can respond to opportunities in the labor market (especially wages) and how they are perceived by students, but the process is not instantaneous and involves lags of multiple years (depending on when students choose their area of specialization and how their expectations change). Factors affecting the demand for computer scientists in the labor market include changes in technology (in particular, the price and availability of hardware and software), changes in macroeconomic conditions that affect the demand for computer services, and changes in trade or immigration policies (). Key historical changes in technology with an impact on the labor market and student interests include the rise of the computer hardware industry, concurrent with development of computer technologies for home and business use in the mid-1980s, and the rise of the Internet for commercial purposes starting in the mid-1990s. The latter launched what is often called the “dot-com boom” (), which increased the demand for computer scientists and included the growth of firms like Yahoo, Amazon, and eBay that helped sustain the boom in the IT sector. (These firms survived the bust that followed; many others did not.) More recent changes in both technology and market conditions include the trends toward data-driven discovery and decision making often referred to as “the Big Data Revolution,” fueled by advances in machine learning and computing power; the rise of the smartphone, mobile applications, and social networks; and the ubiquity of software-as-a-service, cloud computing, and the on-demand economy. Forecasting challenges in science and engineering labor markets are well recognized: data deficiencies, incomplete models, and unanticipated events hinder prediction (; ). Because of the variety of factors influencing student choice of major, it is not practical to determine causation of past fluctuations in CS and computer and information science and support services (CIS) enrollments, especially given limitations on available data that would help to distinguish between shifts in supply and demand; neither is it possible to predict future trends with certainty. In fact, the committee did not come to consensus on the extent to which economic factors were the decisive cause of past CS enrollment trends, though all agreed that economic trends are one major important factor. Accordingly, in the following, several important economic trends and principles that have played a role in past degree production and enrollment trends are discussed in the context of historical data. Current and projected conditions of the CS labor market are discussed in the context of the current wave of growth in CS undergraduate enrollments. Employment in “computer occupations” (including those that do not require a bachelor’s degree) has grown significantly since the Bureau of Labor Statistics ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. (BLS) first introduced this category as one of its Standard Occupational Classifications (SOCs) in 1978, by roughly a factor of 20. According to the BLS Current Population Survey, more than 4.1 million individuals were employed in all computing jobs in 2015. While there are some discontinuities in this data set, it is evident that computing employment has increased significantly, especially during and since the 1990s. Due to discontinuities in data tracking before and after 2000-2002, one must consider a subset of relevant job titles whose definitions do not change (as do some under the unique group of “Computer Occupations”). In a paper commissioned for the committee (, p. 2), economists John Bound and Nicolas Morales tracked computing employment throughout this period by using the categories “Computer Systems Analysts,” “Computer Scientists,” and “Computer Software Developers.” shows the overall employment profile in these jobs among those with a bachelor’s degree in any discipline. The cumulative number of CIS degrees produced over time is included (dashed line) as a reference. It is apparent that the total number of computer jobs has increased steadily over this time period, with the exception of dips between 2001 and 2002 (coincident with the dot-com bust) and between 2008 and 2010 (at the onset of the Great Recession). According to the plot the cumulative number of CS bachelor’s degrees ever produced at any given point in time was roughly half the number of current computer jobs. At the same time, it is unknown how many of the corresponding employers would prefer these positions to be filled by workers with a bachelor’s degree in computer science—or if a bachelor’s degree is required at all. also considered employment of young college graduates (age 23-29) in computer occupations. The share of young college grad- The data over this time frame contain inherent limitations. First, the SOCs are periodically adjusted, meaning that some jobs may move between categories at certain points in time, and new job categories emerge with the evolution of the field; computer science in particular has seen significant growth from a single category into a multilevel hierarchy of occupations. In addition, data are unavailable for 2000-2001 on the public-facing site, and discontinuities in collection before and after these times make it difficult to compare trends directly across this boundary for the unique group of “computer occupations” as defined today (in the 2010 SOC revision). Data from the 2015 Current Population Survey of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, using the SOC of 15-1100, corresponding to “computer occupations.” Additional SOCs outside the 15- series may also fall under computing occupations, but they were excluded to avoid overestimating the workforce by including less relevant occupational fields. These categories correspond to 1990 SOCs of 171 (“Computer Scientists”), 229 (“Computer Software Developers”), 3921 (“Programmers, Business”), and 3972 (“Programmers, Scientific”); the data correspond to individuals with a bachelor’s degree in any field who are employed in one of these categories, which accounted for roughly two-thirds of all workers in “Computer Occupations” (15-1100 in the 2010 SOC revision) in 2015.

The share of new graduates with a bachelor’s degree in CS is also plotted for comparison. While these two data sets look at different but presumably overlapping populations, they should be related in two significant ways. First, some fraction of CIS graduates contribute to the population of young college graduates in computer occupations, with varying time delays between degree production and entering the workforce. Second, various aspects of the employment prospects in any given field, and how such conditions are perceived by undergraduates in the process of choosing a major, may influence their choice of major and affect the number of degrees produced at the corresponding time of graduation. Neither of these effects can be easily quantified; doing so would require primary research involving rigorous modeling and new mechanisms for further classifying these data, which is outside the scope of this study. ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. The plot illustrates that the fraction of young college graduates employed in computer occupations reached 7.4 percent in 2001 (coincident with the dot-com bust), after which they dropped slightly. CIS as a fraction of bachelor’s degrees produced in a given year peaked in 2004 at 4.2 percent, dropped to 2.4 percent in 2009, and steadily increased through 2015. While both employment and degree production seem to respond to the dot-com bust (the latter with a lag), no increase in employment in computing occupations among new college graduates is apparent in the years leading up to the recent CS enrollment surge. In a white paper provided to the committee (see ), economist Jennifer Hunt examined similar trends, this time using a somewhat broader set of occupational fields for a time series analysis. illustrates time series of the share of workers in computer and related occupations. The blue line corresponds to the combination of all computer and mathematics occupations as identified in the Current Population Survey. While this is broader than the set of computer occupations, the trends are consistent with the data from and similarly show that CIS and related fields have accounted ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing.""

Wages in a given occupational field are a dynamic component of the labor market, and their actual or perceived levels can also influence student choice of major. Median wages in computer occupations relative to all occupations held by college graduates are illustrated in for workers between 25-29 and 30-34 years of age. This figure shows that median wages for computer occupations in both age groups peaked around the dot-com boom, fell through 2006, ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. and have generally increased with some fluctuations between 2006 and 2012. At their peak CIS occupations offered on average a wage premium of 44 percent and 35 percent for the two age groups, respectively, compared to other fields. This boom and bust cycle does precede that of the fluctuation in CIS bachelor’s degree production by several years, which is consistent with the possibility that wages in computer occupations (or conditions connected to wages) may have contributed to student decisions to major in computer science and related fields. Post-2006 wage levels reset to higher than the pre-dot-com levels, similar to the trend observed for year-to-year CIS bachelor’s degree production. Hunt conducted a similar analysis, looking at the absolute median wages for “computer/mathematics” and other occupations, using data from the American Community Survey (ACS). These results are illustrated in . It is noteworthy that there are historical fluctuations in CS wage trends for young college graduates here as well, though not in recent years. In her white paper Hunt concluded that at least some of the increase in CS degree production since 2008 is in response to something other than wages for computer occupations. As noted previously, a deeper exploration of the correlations and causalities of these trends is an area for research and beyond the scope of this study. Such ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018.

A full model of the complex computing labor market would decompose changes in wages and employment levels into shifts in supply and demand, and connect these to changes in degree production and course enrollments. To do so would require accounting for conditions underlying industry demand as well as factors underlying supply, such as student and parent perceptions of job and earnings opportunities, institutional conditions that affect student interest and the production of degrees and delivery of education leading to computing skills, and federal policies affecting the academic and industrial sectors. These underlying factors, and their relative role in the overall computing labor market, likely change over time. ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. Labor market supply of computing workers includes computer science majors, students with bachelor’s degrees in other fields who have or can obtain sufficient computing skills and knowledge, and those with less than a bachelor’s degree. These workers can be domestic or foreign. illustrates the top field of degree for bachelor’s degree–holding computing workers from 2009 to 2014 according to the results of the ACS. It is noteworthy that only 37 percent of bachelor’s degree–holding computing workers age 23 to 39 identified in the ACS during this time reported a degree in a computing field (including the listed categories of computer science, computer engineering, computer and information, or information sciences). This is consistent with the evidence of significant levels of interest in computing among non-CS majors in recent years. As noted earlier and in previous sections computer science as a field of study and an occupation has demonstrated monumental growth over the last four decades. A closer look reveals that the growth of computing jobs is not limited to employment in the computer services industries; computing occupations have emerged in a range of industries, as illustrated in .

Current and Projected Demand for Computing Professionals Although the committee notes that significant uncertainty must be attached to future employment predictions, the most authoritative forecasts of computing employment show sustained demand for computing workers over the next decade. Every two years the BLS publishes projections of employment trends for the next decade. In the most recent projections, covering the decade from 2014 to 2024, the BLS predicted that the number of people employed in computing occupations will rise from 3,916,100 to 4,404,700. The addition of nearly half a million computing jobs to the economy corresponds to a growth of 12.5 percent over the decade, compared to an overall projected growth rate of 6.5 percent. This suggests that computing occupations are growing nearly twice as fast as the labor market as a whole. The centrality of computing to the national science and engineering workforce is reflected in , which compares the size and anticipated growth in the computing sector to those in other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The left-hand chart in shows the current distribution of STEM jobs, of which computing accounts for 62 percent. The middle chart shows that the BLS expects that more than three-quarters of the new STEM positions created between 2014 and 2024 will be in the computing sector. However, as shown in the chart on the right, computing is expected to represent 58 percent of all STEM job openings, reflecting a greater need for replacement ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. of workers in existing positions in other STEM fields, presumably because the workforce in computing is, on average, younger than that in the other STEM disciplines and therefore less likely to lose workers through retirement. Beyond the growth of the computing sector itself, analyses of job requirements show that employers now expect new hires to have significant levels of computing expertise, particularly at the high end of the labor market. A recent estimate from Burning Glass Technologies estimated that programming skills were important qualifications for nearly half of the job openings in the top quartile of the income distribution in 2015, as shown in . Burning Glass’s analysis also projected that the number of coding job openings will grow faster (8.8 percent net growth for IT jobs requiring coding skills and 7.2 percent for all jobs requiring coding skills) than other career-track jobs (6.4 percent net growth) between 2016 and 2026. This suggests that those without the opportunity to acquire these skills may be less competitive for certain high-paying occupations, and thus potentially at an economic disadvantage. This could have a significant impact on certain underrepresented groups, who are less likely to have experience in computer science in K-12 and college, as discussed in ; institutional structures that discourage the acquisition of these skills among some groups could perpetuate economic inequality. This study was conducted by analysis of 26 million U.S. job postings from 2015 (). defines “career-track jobs” as those that pay more than 15 dollars per hour. ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. The current starting salaries for bachelor’s degree graduates in computer science often influence the career choices of students. The 2017 National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) salary survey reported that computer science graduates received the second highest average salary ($65,540), right after engineering graduates ($66,097). NACE data show wide geographical differences in computer science, with a difference of $14,000 between jobs in the West and the South. For several above-average examples, one may look to the average reported starting salaries for CS graduates from Purdue University ($83,730 for 2015 graduates) (), the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ($85,000 for 2015 graduates) (), and the University of California at Berkeley ($99,700 for 2015 graduates and $103,963 for 2016 graduates) (). Both employment and degree production have risen substantially in the years since computing became an important component of the national economy. The question of whether a shortfall currently exists—that is, whether contemporaneous production of CS degrees is insufficient for employers to hire as many workers as and when they would like, at the going wage—in computing employ- ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. ment is a challenging one. Many estimates come primarily from sources tied to industry, which could be argued has some incentive to justify a more favorable hiring environment—to expand the pool of potential hires and create more competition, leading to more highly qualified talent and enabling them to offer lower wages. As of 2014 the number of people employed in computer occupations was 3,916,100 (). The total number of bachelor’s degrees in computer science awarded by U.S. institutions throughout the entire history of the field is only 1,313,034. The number of employees in computing occupations is therefore approximately three times larger than the number of bachelor’s degrees in computer science ever produced in the United States. Another way to examine the relationship between employment levels and degree production is to plot the anticipated employment needs—calculated here by assuming that the projected growth from 2014 to 2024 is distributed equally over the decade—against the number of degrees produced each year in several STEM fields. The resulting graph appears in , which is an updated version of a graph first presented by John Sargent, senior policy analyst, Department of Commerce, at the CRA Computing Research Summit on February 23, 2004. The leftmost bar in each cluster represents the projected growth in job openings for the most closely related occupational sector. The next four bars represent the number of degrees granted at the associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral levels. The graphs in illustrate several ways in which computer science differs from other STEM fields. First, computer science is the only major discipline in which the projected number of job openings exceeds the rate of bachelor’s degree production (). Second, computer science is the only STEM discipline that produces a significant number of associate’s degrees, which currently account for nearly one-third of computer science degrees. Third, the number of doctoral degrees in computer science is proportionally smaller than it is in any other STEM field. Each of these differences has an effect on the balance between employment needs and degree production. While it is unclear how many of the new computer jobs would require bachelor’s degrees in CS (or any degree at all), they are worth observing; it may be that graduates in other disciplines simply go into occupations outside of their major fields, and that this is less common for CS. In order to meet employment needs, one strategy is to hire employees with computer science degrees below the baccalaureate level. A second strategy is to hire university graduates with degrees in other areas and then provide those employees with whatever additional on-the-job training they require. A third is to hire computer science graduates from outside the United States. Driven by In the discussion, Dr. Freeman noted that this was a high-level observation, so there may be other fields for which this same imbalance is true if one looks beyond the major disciplinary divisions. ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. its need to fill a rapidly expanding number of positions, industry is pursuing all three of these strategies. That there is a market for workers with degrees below the baccalaureate level is supported by the unusually large number of associate’s degrees produced in the field. In 2014, U.S. institutions awarded 37,643 associate’s degrees in CIS, which comprises 31 percent of all CIS degrees. By contrast, associate’s degrees constitute an average of 4 percent of STEM degrees in other disciplines. Moreover, the number of associate’s degrees has been rising over time, as discussed in , though it has declined in recent years, in large part due to declines at the for-profits. It is worth noting in passing that computer science also produces a large number of certificates compared to other STEM fields, indicating that there is also a market in industry for these credentials. Understanding the flow of employees both into and out of computing is complicated by the fact that graduates often take positions that would most naturally be categorized as outside their principal area of study. For example, many computer science graduates take positions in occupations other than computing, just as many graduates from other disciplines end up working in the computing field. Such migration is common among graduates in general. As previously noted less than half of the people with CS bachelor’s degrees end up working in a core computer occupation. Conversely, computing occupa- ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. tions have an unusually high rate of in-migration, not only from other STEM fields but also from a wide range of academic disciplines: approximately 67 percent of the bachelor’s degree holders in the computing workforce have degrees from outside computer science. This is not necessarily because industry prefers to hire people without computer science degrees—it could also be due in part to their paucity in the labor pool. The third strategy for meeting workforce needs—hiring highly skilled workers with technical degrees from universities outside the United States—has long been a matter of public controversy. Industry representatives have lobbied for increases in the number of visas available under the H-1B program (though many participants received their degrees at U.S. institutions), which allows companies to employ noncitizens in particular “specialty areas.” Under the law employment is on a temporary basis, although many employees who enter the United States under the H-1B program are later qualified to become permanent residents. Industry maintains that they need the ability to hire foreign workers because there are not enough people in the United States with the necessary skills. In their paper commissioned for the committee Bound and Morales report that the percentage of foreigners in the computer science workforce has grown over the last decade, rising from 10.6 percent in 1994 to 26.8 percent in 2015 (), which is consistent with insufficient domestic supply to meet industry needs. The Effects of Competition for Highly Skilled Software Developers The expansion of the field of computer science has led to both specialization and heterogeneity among computer science graduates. The intensity of the competition for the best software developers reflects a long-standing recognition that large variations in productivity exist among individual software developers. The original study in this area was published in 1968 by Sackman et al., who found that programmers with the same level of experience exhibited variations of more than 20 to 1 in the time required to solve particular programming problems. Beyond this high variability in coding time, the study revealed that individual programmers showed highly correlated differences in other metrics that contribute to overall productivity, in the sense that the best programmers were not only able to complete the problem in less time but in so doing also typically produced programs that had fewer errors and were more efficient in both running time and utilization of memory. Thus, the best programmers were in fact more than 20 times as effective. Later studies have reaffirmed the results of the Sackman study and conclude that the best software developers are relatively few in number, but much more productive than the average. There is evidence that the variability in productivity has increased over time. In a story in November ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. 2005, Alan Eustace, then Google’s vice president of engineering, said that the best software engineer at Google is 300 times more productive than the average Google software engineer—and this in a company that hires less than one-tenth of 1 percent of its applicant pool (). The variation in productivity is the critical dynamic that underlies employment policies in the software industry. Companies are under intense competitive pressure to identify and hire those extraordinarily talented individuals at the high end of the productivity curve. Particularly for startups employing a small team of implementers, hiring just one extremely productive person can make the difference between success and failure. After all, if the best software developer can do the work of 10, 100, or even 300 run-of-the-mill employees, a company that attracts such a superstar can compete effectively against a much larger enterprise. Thus, companies whose business depends on software production will try to hire applicants from pools in which the likelihood of finding the most talented individuals is high, such as graduates from top computer science departments, successful participants in collegiate programming contests, or entrepreneurs who have developed successful freeware and shareware systems on their own. Competition to attract employees from these populations is intense. Companies likewise have a strong incentive to avoid problem programmers and are unlikely to hire applicants whom they fear might fall at the low end of the scale. In a column for the , Gary Chapman observed that “the software profession is beginning to resemble professional sports or the movie business much more than engineering. Exceptionally gifted programmers are referred to as ‘talent,’ like movie stars, and some have incomes that make those of film stars look puny” (). Images of career paths of computing superstars, which have been visible in contemporary news and media, may also contribute to increased interest among students in pursuing a career in computing. For example, wealthy technology magnates such as SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk, or Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg—including in films such as —along with fictional characters on shows such as and , may create a glamorous or appealing image of computer science professionals among young people. Another factor that complicates a full understanding of whether the supply of computing expertise is sufficient to meet workforce needs is that demand for particular specialties in computer science varies considerably over time. Some specialties have grown dramatically in importance in recent years. Three areas are commonly highlighted as facing acute demand: cybersecurity, data science, and machine learning. One of the areas in which a need for skilled workers is most evident is computer security, which today is more often called cybersecurity or abbreviated even ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. further simply to “cyber” Cybersecurity is a high priority for the U.S. government because of the need to protect classified data and other sensitive information. Ensuring that federal agencies are prepared against cyberattacks requires more workers trained in computer security. According to the Department of Homeland Security, [a]s technology becomes increasingly sophisticated, the demand for an experienced and qualified workforce to protect our nation’s networks and information systems will only continue to grow. Information security and cybersecurity are rapidly growing industries with increased workforce needs (). Computer security is also increasingly important throughout the private sector, leading to significant growth in workforce needs in this area. In a report titled , noted that American employers have realized the vital importance of cybersecurity—but that realization has created a near-term shortage of workers that may require long-term solutions. The report () listed the following findings about the cybersecurity job market: In 2014 there were 238,158 postings for cybersecurity-related jobs nationally. Cybersecurity jobs account for 11 percent of all IT jobs. Cybersecurity postings have grown 91 percent from 2010 to 2014. This is a faster growth rate than IT jobs generally. Cybersecurity postings advertise a 9 percent salary premium over IT jobs overall. Cybersecurity job postings took 8 percent longer to fill than IT job postings overall. The demand for certificated cybersecurity talent is outstripping supply. In the United States employers posted 49,493 jobs requesting a Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), recruiting from a pool of only 65,362 CISSP holders nationwide. It is useful to put the first list item in context. American employers posted 238,158 jobs in the cybersecurity area, which is four times the entire production of bachelor’s degrees in computer science in that year even though cybersecurity represents only 11 percent of IT jobs. Data science is another area that has shown enormous growth in recent years. A 2014 issue brief from the Business Higher Education Forum outlines the growing importance of the field in the following terms: ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. The application of data science is pervasive in both the public and private sectors. Companies of all sizes rely on data science and analytics as key transformational components to their core operations. A 2011 report by the McKinsey Global Institute, Big Data: the Next Frontier for Innovation, Competition, and Productivity, noted that “big data” is growing at a rate of 40 percent each year and has the potential to add $300 billion of value to the nation’s health care industry alone, with broad application in virtually every sector, including scientific organizations and cultural institutions. Projections by Gartner, Inc., indicate that in less than 12 months, 4.4 million information technology (IT) jobs to support big data will be created globally. About 1.9 million of those jobs will be within the United States, and big data has the potential to create three times that number of jobs outside of IT (). Additional recent studies have confirmed high levels of demand for “hybrid jobs” in data science that merge business and technology skills. A report from offered the following assessment of employment demand in this area: Data analytics, digital marketing, and mobile development are growing especially fast: Demand for data science skills has tripled over the past five years, while demand for digital marketing and mobile skills has more than doubled. The Burning Glass report includes surveys of job postings indicating that “more than 250,000 positions were open in the last year for these hybrid technical roles”—again, four times the annual production rate of bachelor’s degrees in computer science. Those positions, moreover, offer high salaries and are, in many cases, open to students with less background in computer science than that of a computer science major. The need for more qualified workers in such hybrid fields has led to an increase in the number of data-science courses, minors, and majors that colleges and universities offer to undergraduates. These trends are difficult to capture in systematically collected national data but are easy to illustrate by example. In recent years more than 25 universities—including Bowling Green State University, Columbia University, Drexel University, Florida State University, Marquette University, Portland State University, Purdue University, Rice University, the University of California at Irvine, University of California at San Diego, the University of Michigan, the University of Rochester, the University of San Francisco, and the University of Vermont—have created majors specifically titled “data science.” Other institutions offer similar courses of study under other names. At Stanford University, for example, the website for the major whose official title is Mathematics and Computational Science begins with a heading that describes the program as “the data science major.” At the committee’s public workshop in August 2016 several speakers identified machine learning—particularly in applications that use multilayer neural networks ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. to create more sophisticated structures often referred to as deep learning—as an area of intense demand (). The emergence of machine learning as a critical technology also changes the prospects for employment of graduates in other fields. Just as new opportunities are created for graduates with the skills to apply machine-learning strategies to automate the analysis of massive collections of data, opportunities are closing in those fields in which such analysis was formerly conducted by people. Employment in computing fields has grown steadily since 1975, and the number of jobs in computing occupations far exceeds bachelor’s degree production in CS. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that employment in computer occupations will rise more quickly than overall job growth for at least the next several years. As discussed in previous sections demand for employees with computing expertise is high and has grown steadily over time. That need has also been projected to grow for the foreseeable future. The number of undergraduates interested in studying computer science—both as majors and as non-majors (as detailed in )—has been increasing rapidly, since about 2005. As computing becomes central to an ever-widening number of disciplines, student interest will presumably continue to grow. Several high-demand areas—including cybersecurity, data science, and machine learning—face labor shortages that academic institutions are currently unable to fill. Each of these factors suggests a need to expand the nation’s supply of workers with sufficient understanding of computer science to meet the needs of the twenty-first-century workforce. The emergence of new information technology industries, the increased reliance on computation in all parts of society and in research, and shifts in the demand for computing throughout the economy reflect changes in the field and its broad applications (). Two areas have been central in the last decade: the continued and increased need for information security, and data as a resource and driver for decision making. The protection of digital information and data; the protection of software and hardware systems and networks from unauthorized access, change, and destruction; and the education of users to follow best security practices are crucial to every organization. We rely upon a connected, networked, and complex cyberspace with vulnerabilities that is almost continuously under attack. Teaching safe information security practices to students and similar training of the workforce are increasingly expected. The National Science Foundation (NSF) Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace program highlights many of the research challenges in ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. the area of cybersecurity involving hardware, software, networks, data, people, and the integration with the physical world. During the last decade, computing has taken a new, more empirically driven path with the maturing of machine learning, the emergence of data science, and the “big data” revolution. Data science combines computing and statistical methods to identify trends in existing data and generate new knowledge, with significant applications throughout all sectors of the economy, including marketing, retail, finance, business, health care and medicine, agriculture, smart cities, and more. The availability and use of big data sets, combined with computation, simulation, and modeling, has created new academic areas including digital humanities and computational social sciences. Software tools and systems for animation, visualization, virtual reality, and conceptualization have emerged as a medium for the arts (digital media and multimedia practices) and are driving advances in the entertainment industry (computer-generated graphics in films and video games, and digital methods in music recording), as well as training and education using virtual environments. The digital age created by computing and information technologies has enabled a new sector of the economy with a wide range of temporary, short-term jobs for independent workers, mediated via the use of digital platforms, including through companies like Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, TaskRabbit, and DagVacay. While a recent study suggests that jobs in this area currently account for approximately 0.5 percent of the U.S. workforce (), they display significant potential for impact on jobs and the economy as a whole (). Computing has become more pervasive among a host of academic disciplines, beyond just the practical use of ubiquitous software tools. New algorithmic approaches and discoveries are helping to drive advances across a range of fields, leading to new collaborations and an increased demand for deeper knowledge of computing among academics and researchers, challenging conventional disciplinary boundaries. Important examples can be found in the area of computational science, where computational approaches are used to carry out scientific models or simulations to an extent that would be essentially impossible without the aid of a computer. Computational methods have contributed to significant advances and led to new specializations in domains such as chemistry and biology. As one measure of the impact of computing on the advancement of scientific research, the 2013 Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded jointly to Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt, and Arieh Warshel for development of novel computational models for simulating chemical systems (). As more and more software systems are used throughout the economy and become integral to daily life, it is becoming increasingly important for individuals to understand how to use them. The fraction of people who need to use software in more targeted ways, write scripts to process and prepare data, and integrate tools and systems is likely to increase.

Computing is pervasive, and its penetration is deep and growing in virtually all sectors of the economy, all academic disciplines, and all aspects of modern life. The broad opportunities in computing, both in the labor market and for enabling a host of intellectual pursuits, will continue to be drivers of increasing enrollments in undergraduate computer science, from both majors and non-majors. While there will probably be fluctuations in the demand for CS courses, demand is likely to continue to grow or remain high over the long term. Increased Participation in Computing in Primary and Secondary Environments Another potential driver of recent (and possible future) increases in CS undergraduate enrollments at the undergraduate level is increased engagement of students with computing in K-12. Throughout the history of the field, student exposure to computer science has been small compared to that of other STEM disciplines. Many high schools do not offer CS courses, and most do not require students to take a course in computing. Currently, 13 states do not allow CS courses to be counted toward high school graduation requirements. The changing role of CS in society, including the pervasive exposure of students to new technologies such as smartphones, along with the historically low and uneven access of K-12 students to computing (), has prompted a series of efforts to enhance the exposure of primary and secondary students to CS in recent years. For example, in 2003, the Association of Computing Machinery established the K-12 Computer Science Task Force, and founded the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) in 2004. CSTA produced the K-12 Computer Science Standards, which became the de facto national standards for the discipline, and produced and disseminated a host of classroom resources designed to develop student interest in computer science as an education and career pathway. Universities have also participated in outreach to students in K-12 to help build interest in the field and break down stereotypical attitudes about computing. In particular, Carnegie Mellon University and Indiana University pioneered these efforts via a series of “roadshows.” Note that computing courses that teach computational thinking and/or coding are distinct from basic computer training courses that teach proficiency with word processing or other computer applications. In particular, teacher training has been a major challenge. See, for example, . ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. The NSF has sponsored such projects through its CS education programs. NSF’s Computing Education for the 21st Century was founded in 2011 with the aim of helping to reverse the decline in undergraduate computing majors that occurred after the dot-com bust “by engaging larger numbers of students, teachers, and educators in computing education and learning at earlier stages in the education pipeline” (). Its Broadening Participation in Computing program track (building on alliances developed between 2006 and 2009) () aims “to significantly increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents receiving postsecondary degrees in the computing disciplines, with an emphasis on students from communities with longstanding underrepresentation in computing” (). Another track, CS10K, “aims to have rigorous, academic computing courses taught in 10,000 high schools by 10,000 well-prepared teachers” (). In 2016 the College Board introduced a new Advanced Placement (AP) course, Computer Science Principles (CSP), developed in part with NSF support, in 2,700 high school classrooms nationwide, “with the goal of creating leaders in computer science fields and attracting and engaging those who are traditionally underrepresented with essential computing tools and multidisciplinary opportunities” (). This launch followed 10 years of development of course materials and other resources for high school teachers, and phased pilot efforts at dozens of high schools in the United States and Canada. In May 2017 it was announced that the implementation of this course has helped to increase high school student participation in AP computer science. In particular, the number of students sitting for any AP computing exam was approximately 111,000 in 2017, with approximately 51,000 of these students coming from the new CSP course, compared to approximately 57,000 in 2016 before CSP had launched (). Because participation in AP courses in general (and CS in particular) has been found to correlate to increased probability of majoring in the corresponding field (), the introduction of this new AP program is likely to newly contribute to an increase in the number of computing major enrollments in 2018 and computing degrees beginning in 2022. In 2016 President Obama announced a national effort for “Computer Science for All,” to be led by NSF and the U.S. Department of Education in partnership with other federal agencies to boost K-12 students’ CS knowledge and skills. This persists as a non-profit, the CS for All Consortium. In addition, many industry-sponsored efforts have focused on supporting professional development and providing resources for CS teachers. For example, Google’s CS4HS aims “to provide CS teachers globally with an opportunity to improve their technical and pedagogical skills.” This program, launched in 2009 after several years of pilots, supports CS education professionals in providing professional development opportunities and educational resources to high school ""4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24926. CS teachers around the world. Google has also made a variety of learning resources available online. Another example is Oracle’s Oracle Academy, an initiative to assist teachers in preparing secondary students for college and careers, through the provision of educational resources online. Microsoft’s Technology Education and Literacy in Schools program works to connect U.S. high schools with technical expertise and support to help build and sustain computer science courses; specifically, the program connects volunteers to teach or support high school introductory or AP computer science courses and instructors. Several private-sector technology and engineering companies also have launched initiatives to boost exposure to CS courses and skills. For example, IBM’s Pathways in Technology Early College High Schools (P-Tech), launched in 2011, created grades 9-14 technology-focused early-college high schools that culminate in an associate’s degree. The program promotes postsecondary degree completion and career readiness and provides engaging academic courses and work-related experiences through partnerships with industry partners. Several states and cities have launched networks of P-Tech schools. Raytheon teamed with the Science and Innovation Center of Pinellas County Florida, SRI International, and St. Petersburg College to create an innovative cybersecurity educational program that prepares high school students for testing in industry-recognized certifications and earning credits toward a 2- or 4-year degree in network security from St. Petersburg College. Combined, these and related activities indicate significant momentum toward earlier exposure of students to computer science. Impacts from efforts begun in 2009 could already be contributing to enrollment growth. Moving forward, continued increases in the level of exposure of students to computing before they enroll in college could have multiple possible effects on undergraduate enrollment. First, this earlier formal education in computing could provide some of the skills that certain students might otherwise seek in a postsecondary computing course. On the other hand, early exposure to computing could have the opposite effect of increasing course or major enrollments by stimulating student interest early and prompting further exploration in the postsecondary environment. Finally, the need for more teachers to administer these courses could also lead to increased demand on CS undergraduate education and training in order to meet it. These and related programs also have implications for student diversity, as discussed in . See https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/ptech/index.html.

The field of computer science (CS) is currently experiencing a surge in undergraduate degree production and course enrollments, which is straining program resources at many institutions and causing concern among faculty and administrators about how best to respond to the rapidly growing demand. There is also significant interest about what this growth will mean for the future of CS programs, the role of computer science in academic institutions, the field as a whole, and U.S. society more broadly. Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments seeks to provide a better understanding of the current trends in computing enrollments in the context of past trends. It examines drivers of the current enrollment surge, relationships between the surge and current and potential gains in diversity in the field, and the potential impacts of responses to the increased demand for computing in higher education, and it considers the likely effects of those responses on students, faculty, and institutions. This report provides recommendations for what institutions of higher education, government agencies, and the private sector can do to respond to the surge and plan for a strong and sustainable future for the field of CS in general, the health of the institutions of higher education, and the prosperity of the nation. 3 The Current Landscape of Computer Science Enrollments 4 Drivers of the Recent Increase in Enrollments in Computing 5 Impacts of Enrollment Growth on Diversity in Computing Appendix C: Commissioned Paper: Workforce Trends in Computer Science Appendix D: White Paper: Does the Recent Increase in Computer Science Degrees Reflect Increased Demand?

Logout   New Vision Tests and Technology Can Help Save Your Sight | If you think you have to live with diminished eyesight as you get older, you're wrong. The latest technologies — combined with yearly dilated-eye exams — can detect and treat eye diseases more readily, while new lenses can correct your vision better than ever before. ""Eye technology is rapidly evolving,” says Edward Manche, M.D., director of cornea and refractive surgery at Stanford University. Here's a glance at some of the new tests and remedies now available for your eyes. A allows a doctor to literally see inside your body, checking on the health of your blood vessels, among other things. “There are around 300 systemic diseases that can show up in the eye,” says optometrist Kerry Gelb, who stars in s, a documentary film that explores this concept. To name a few health issues that a dilated-eye exam can help detect: high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and autoimmune diseases. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), a high-definition technology that uses light waves to take cross-sectional images of the eye, has been around for decades. OCT angiography (OCTA) is a newer variation that allows doctors to see blood flowing through the vessels in the retina — even tiny capillaries. “This gives clinicians an ability to detect problems in the blood vessels in the eye long before they appear in the heart and brain,” Gelb says. Ask about the technology that is available in your doctor's office and if the practitioner uses OCTA as a wellness screening tool. Traditional antihistamine-containing eye drops can make redness and burning worse by exacerbating dryness, says Alisha Fleming, an optometrist based in Philadelphia. Last October, Refresh launched a new drop for , Refresh Relieva, which boosts hydration with glycerin and hyaluronic acid. Soothe XP and Systane are other brands that may offer relief. This condition, in which pressure builds up in the eye and damages the optic nerve, is a leading cause of blindness and particularly affects African Americans and Hispanics. Stents, some as small as an eyelash, are newer, minimally invasive options for . The stent (Hydrus Microstent and Glaukos iStent are two examples) is implanted in the eye during cataract surgery to relieve eye pressure.  join AARP and enroll in Automatic Renewal for first year. Get instant access to discounts, programs, services, and the information you need to benefit every area of your life. EyeQue's VisionCheck ($69) is an automated miniscope that attaches to your smartphone. It performs an app-based refraction test, allowing you to track vision changes between doctor visits, and gives you your unique “eyeglass numbers” needed to order specs online. For a smaller price, you can purchase the company's Personal Vision Tracker ($35), a manual device also used in conjunction with a smartphone to check your vision. EyeQue can even send you a pair of Try-On Glasses ($19) to see if the corrective lenses work for you before you order a more expensive pair.  (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss after age 50. For certain patients with the dry form of AMD (which accounts for up to 90 percent of all cases), taking AREDS 2 — a supplement containing antioxidants lutein, zeaxanthin, copper, zinc, and vitamins C and E — can decrease the risk of progression of the dry form of the disease into the more destructive wet form, says J. Martin Heur, M.D., medical director of the USC Roski Eye Institute in Los Angeles. AREDS 2 now comes in mini-gel and chewable forms, which are easier to swallow. Be certain the supplement you take contains the exact nutrient formula recommended by the National Eye Institute. Progressive lenses seamlessly adjust to correct vision at multiple distances; trifocal lenses have visible lines but work similarly to improve vision necessary for tasks like computer work or shaving. “As a kid, you could see what you needed to see at all ranges. Trifocals can help nudge patients back to this natural vision,” Fleming says. Cataracts — the — can blur and double vision, intensify light sensitivity and decrease night vision. If you're considering cataract surgery, ask your doctor if you're a candidate for PanOptix, a trifocal-lens implant approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2019. Other cataract lenses, such as monofocal, can correct distance vision but leave much to be desired when it comes to near and intermediate distances. The ultimate goal with PanOptix is to reduce or eliminate the need for glasses. Staring at a screen may cut your blinking rate, drying out your eye. There's also evidence that blue light late at night skews your circadian rhythm, making it harder to fall asleep. One solution, from Eyesafe, filters blue light from digital devices. Certain models of Dell computers are now equipped with the filter, but the technology is also available through Zagg VisionGuard, a line of screen protectors that adhere to your smartphone or tablet. Ill-fitting frames can affect your vision. If you have an iPhone, there are a number of apps that allow you to virtually try on glasses — from companies such as Warby Parker and Topology — to get the right fit before placing an order online.

It is now proven that there is a link between good nutrition and the maintenance of healthy eyes. Many reports have indicated that some age-related eye diseases may be slowed by vitamins and minerals consumed in fruits and vegetables or taken as supplements. As we age, the importance of good nutrition increases for a number of reasons. The human body needs more vitamins and nutrients to keep it working properly, and it has a harder time digesting and processing the vitamins that we eat in our regular diets. Since the eyes are probably the most important organ connected to the senses, certain vitamins and nutrients can help protect the eye from age-related diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). Vision problems, eye diseases, and other conditions can affect the physical health of the eye, and if the eye is not properly taken care of, blindness can result. Therefore, early detection and treatment of eye diseases can prevent vision loss. Annual eye examinations and good nutrition are very important to keep the eyes healthy. The National Eye Institute (NEI) has reported that more than 9.3 million Americans have ARMD, one of the leading causes of vision loss for people aged >60 years. More than 23 million people have cataracts, and about 2.1 million have glaucoma. Diabetic retinopathy affects the vision of more than half of the 25.8 million people aged 18 years who have diabetes. This institution has ranked vision loss ahead of memory and hearing loss as measured by the number of people affected. Many causes of blindness are preventable through timely examination, good nutrition, and early treatment. In this article, we will discuss the role of certain vitamins and nutrients in maintaining eye health and in early eye treatment. Cataracts, or clouded lenses, affect vision and are very common in older people. Cataracts affect over 40% of people between ages 50 and 65 years, over 60% of people > age 66, and up to 90% of people >90 years. Common symptoms of cataracts include blurry vision, colors that seem faded, glare, poor night vision, double vision, and frequent changes in prescriptions for eyeglasses. The chance of developing cataracts can be greatly reduced by taking certain vitamins before the cataracts start to appear. However, in most cases surgery is an option that involves removing a cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. Glaucoma damages the eye’s optic nerve and is an age-related eye disease that affects about 1 in every 200 people. The optic nerve damage is the result of increased intraocular pressure in and around the eye. Glaucoma has no early symptoms and usually goes undetected until it is fairly advanced. Loss of at least some vision is almost guaranteed if preventive measures are not taken and comprehensive eye examinations not done. Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness among African Americans and Hispanics. African Americans experience this eye disease at a rate three times that of whites. This disease affects about 9 million people in the United States alone. It is a disease that destroys the sharp central vision needed to see objects clearly. It affects all daily activities including reading, driving, and watching television. ARMD is a disease in which certain deposits or blood vessels under the macula can damage the eye rods and cause cells in the macula to die. In some cases, ARMD advances so slowly that people do not notice major vision problems. Diabetic retinopathy is the result of diabetes and is another major age-related eye disease affecting the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye; it causes most cases of blindness in U.S. adults and is treated with surgery or laser surgery. With adequate control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, and with regular follow-up care, blindness from diabetes can be prevented. Nearsightedness results in blurred vision when the visual image is focused in front of the retina, rather than directly on it. It usually occurs when the cornea or lens is not evenly and smoothly curved. For this reason, in children with nearsightedness light rays are not refracted properly. Nearsightedness often develops in the rapidly growing school-aged child or teenager and progresses during the growth years, requiring frequent changes in glasses or contact lenses. Farsightedness results when the visual image is focused behind the retina rather than directly on it. Hyperopia may occur if the eyeball is too small or the focusing power is too weak. Farsightedness is frequently present from birth, but children can often tolerate moderate degrees of it without difficulty and most outgrow the condition. In astigmatism, the cornea is more oval than round. This prevents the eye from allow focusing clearly. This condition is accompanied by near- and farsightedness. Current treatments adjust the cornea’s uneven curvature through corrective lenses or refractive surgery. Computer vision syndrome, or digital eyestrain, describes a problem that results from prolonged computer, tablet, e-reader, and cell phone use. Many people experience eye discomfort and vision problems when viewing digital screens for long periods of time. The level of discomfort appears to increase with the amount of digital screen use. Uncorrected vision problems —farsightedness and astigmatism or eye-coordination difficulties—and aging can all contribute to the development of visual symptoms when using a computer or digital screen device. High visual demands of computer and digital screen viewing make many individuals susceptible to the development of vision-related symptoms. Solutions to digital screen–related vision problems are varied. In some cases, individuals who do not require the use of eyeglasses for other daily activities may benefit from lenses prescribed specifically for computer use. In addition, persons already wearing glasses may find their current prescription does not provide optimal vision for viewing a computer. Many computer users experience problems with eye focusing or eye coordination that cannot be properly corrected with eyeglasses or contact lenses. A program of vision training may be needed to treat these specific problems. This program trains the eyes and brain to work together more effectively. These eye exercises help eye movement, eye focusing, and eye teaming and reinforce the eye-brain connection. Dry-eye syndrome, also known as ,is an eye condition in which tear film evaporation is high or tear production is low. This will cause the eyes to dry out and become inflamed. The eyes are producing tears all the time, not just when people weep or have an emotional experience. Healthy eyes are covered with a liquid tear film, which is designed to remain stable between each blink. This tear film prevents the eyes from becoming dry and keeps them clear and comfortable. If the tear glands produce a lower quantity of tears, the tear film can become destabilized. It can break down quickly, creating dry spots on the surface of the eyes. Dry-eye syndrome is more common with older age, when the individual produces fewer tears, but it can occur at any age. In some parts of the world, where malnutrition results in vitamin A deficiency, dry-eye syndrome is much more common. Symptoms of dry eye include stinging and burning sensations in the eyes, a feeling of dryness in the eyes, eye sensitivity to smoke, eye fatigue even after reading for a relatively short period, sensitivity to light, blurred vision, and sticking together of the eyelids upon waking up. Other complications are eye redness, painful eyes, and eyesight deterioration. Artificial tears may be a simple, effective treatment for mild dry eyes. Eyedrops without preservatives can be used as many times a day as desired. Those with preservatives usually have a maximum safe dosage of four times a day. It may be a good idea to apply eyedrops before activities that may exacerbate dry eye symptoms. Ointments are generally better for nighttime use because they may blur vision. Eyedrops for removing redness should not be used. According to the CDC, fruits and vegetables of various colors help to promote optimal health. The National Eye Institute has reported that a combination of three antioxidant vitamins (C, E, and beta-carotene) and the minerals zinc and copper have reduced the advancement of ARMD by 25% and the risk of moderate vision loss by 19%. The results of a follow-up study indicated that adults who ate kale, mustard greens, collard greens, raw or cooked spinach (vegetables high in the pigments lutein and zeaxantine, called ), and two antioxidants from beta (the carotene family) were at considerably less risk of developing advanced ARMD than those who did not eat them. Adults consuming more sources of the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA were also at lower risk of this disease. The yellow color of the macular region of the retina is due to the presence of macular pigment, composed of the two dietary compounds lutein and zeaxanthin, and a third, called . This compound is presumably formed from either lutein or zeaxanthin in the retina. The macular pigments absorb the blue light and protect the underlying photoreceptor cell layer from light damage. There is ample epidemiologic evidence that the amount of macular pigment is inversely associated with the incidence of ARMD, an irreversible process that is the major cause of blindness in the elderly. Either increasing the intake of foods that are rich in lutein and zeaxanthin or supplementing with lutein or zeaxanthin can increase the macular pigment in the retina. Although increasing the intake of lutein or zeaxanthin might prove to be protective against the development of ARMD, more studies are needed to demonstrate this. As mentioned, vitamin A has been known to have a beneficial effect in the eye as well as in the rest of the body. Vitamin A was the first vitamin studied in detail for its effects on the eye. The precursor beta-carotene (found in carrots and yellow or orange vegetables) is converted into forms of vitamin A called . Retinols have numerous functions in the body, including assisting the bioelectrical process of vision (preventing loss of night vision), eliminating damaged cells from the body, and helping to prevent dry macular degeneration. Vitamin A palmitate (or retinyl palmitate, 5,000 IU) helps with day-to-day vision. Lutein is a carotenoid that is now thought to have more preventive properties than vitamin A at a dosage of 5 mg daily. As early as the 1940s, World War II pilots claimed that bilberries significantly increased their night vision when conducting night missions. Bilberries are smaller and of a darker blue color than blueberries. They are also softer and juicier than blueberries, making them difficult to transport. Because of these factors, bilberries are only available fresh in markets and are also more expensive. They are easily distinguished from blueberries because of the way they stain the hands, teeth, and tongue deep blue or purple. Bilberries contain natural antioxidants called , which, among other properties, strengthen blood cells, significantly reducing hemorrhaging in the eye that can lead to both macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Bilberries are also a good source of chromium, which helps control blood sugar levels and preserves the strength of smaller blood vessels—particularly important for patients with diabetes who are at risk for diabetic retinopathy. In addition, bilberries contain both vitamin A and vitamin C, which are vital to eye health. Recent studies have shown that bilberries also aid in stabilizing and preventing the deterioration of the collagen in eye tissue, thereby helping to prevent intraocular pressure issues such as occur in glaucoma. In Scandinavian countries, bilberries are collected from forests. They are eaten fresh or can be made into different jams, pies, and other dishes. Omega-3s play an important role in eye health. DHA is naturally concentrated in the retina of the eye and is thought to promote healthy retinal function. It has been reported that eating larger amounts of fish or omega-3 may help promote macular health and reduce dry-eye syndrome. Both omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids (EFAs) are the precursors of eicosanoids, locally acting hormones involved in mediating inflammatory processes. Recent studies have shown significant improvement in ocular irritation symptoms by the fatty acids linolenic and gammalinolenic acid administered orally. Evidence suggests that supplementation with omega-3 EFA may be beneficial in the treatment and prevention of dry-eye syndrome. Vitamin B (riboflavin) has also been used for years in helping to strengthen the cornea through a process called . Riboflavin has been shown to stop the onset of the eye disorder keratoconus. While vitamins can be obtained by taking supplements, it is best to get as many of these nutrients as possible through diet. A diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in trans fats and sugar not only helps with eye health but also contributes to overall health. Although increasing the intake of antioxidants will probably not restore vision that is already lost, it may slow the progress of disease. Patients with eye problems should consult with their physicians about including more foods rich in antioxidants in their diet and/or taking vitamin supplements. Some people have other health considerations that could be affected by these dietary changes. Nutrition and health are lifelong concerns, and people should not wait until they develop an eye problem or other health concern to make changes in their diet. 1. Saljoughian M.

Logout   New Vision Tests and Technology Can Help Save Your Sight | If you think you have to live with diminished eyesight as you get older, you're wrong. The latest technologies — combined with yearly dilated-eye exams — can detect and treat eye diseases more readily, while new lenses can correct your vision better than ever before. ""Eye technology is rapidly evolving,” says Edward Manche, M.D., director of cornea and refractive surgery at Stanford University. Here's a glance at some of the new tests and remedies now available for your eyes. A allows a doctor to literally see inside your body, checking on the health of your blood vessels, among other things. “There are around 300 systemic diseases that can show up in the eye,” says optometrist Kerry Gelb, who stars in s, a documentary film that explores this concept. To name a few health issues that a dilated-eye exam can help detect: high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and autoimmune diseases. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), a high-definition technology that uses light waves to take cross-sectional images of the eye, has been around for decades. OCT angiography (OCTA) is a newer variation that allows doctors to see blood flowing through the vessels in the retina — even tiny capillaries. “This gives clinicians an ability to detect problems in the blood vessels in the eye long before they appear in the heart and brain,” Gelb says. Ask about the technology that is available in your doctor's office and if the practitioner uses OCTA as a wellness screening tool. Traditional antihistamine-containing eye drops can make redness and burning worse by exacerbating dryness, says Alisha Fleming, an optometrist based in Philadelphia. Last October, Refresh launched a new drop for , Refresh Relieva, which boosts hydration with glycerin and hyaluronic acid. Soothe XP and Systane are other brands that may offer relief. This condition, in which pressure builds up in the eye and damages the optic nerve, is a leading cause of blindness and particularly affects African Americans and Hispanics. Stents, some as small as an eyelash, are newer, minimally invasive options for . The stent (Hydrus Microstent and Glaukos iStent are two examples) is implanted in the eye during cataract surgery to relieve eye pressure.  join AARP and enroll in Automatic Renewal for first year. Get instant access to discounts, programs, services, and the information you need to benefit every area of your life. EyeQue's VisionCheck ($69) is an automated miniscope that attaches to your smartphone. It performs an app-based refraction test, allowing you to track vision changes between doctor visits, and gives you your unique “eyeglass numbers” needed to order specs online. For a smaller price, you can purchase the company's Personal Vision Tracker ($35), a manual device also used in conjunction with a smartphone to check your vision. EyeQue can even send you a pair of Try-On Glasses ($19) to see if the corrective lenses work for you before you order a more expensive pair.  (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss after age 50. For certain patients with the dry form of AMD (which accounts for up to 90 percent of all cases), taking AREDS 2 — a supplement containing antioxidants lutein, zeaxanthin, copper, zinc, and vitamins C and E — can decrease the risk of progression of the dry form of the disease into the more destructive wet form, says J. Martin Heur, M.D., medical director of the USC Roski Eye Institute in Los Angeles. AREDS 2 now comes in mini-gel and chewable forms, which are easier to swallow. Be certain the supplement you take contains the exact nutrient formula recommended by the National Eye Institute. Progressive lenses seamlessly adjust to correct vision at multiple distances; trifocal lenses have visible lines but work similarly to improve vision necessary for tasks like computer work or shaving. “As a kid, you could see what you needed to see at all ranges. Trifocals can help nudge patients back to this natural vision,” Fleming says. Cataracts — the — can blur and double vision, intensify light sensitivity and decrease night vision. If you're considering cataract surgery, ask your doctor if you're a candidate for PanOptix, a trifocal-lens implant approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2019. Other cataract lenses, such as monofocal, can correct distance vision but leave much to be desired when it comes to near and intermediate distances. The ultimate goal with PanOptix is to reduce or eliminate the need for glasses. Staring at a screen may cut your blinking rate, drying out your eye. There's also evidence that blue light late at night skews your circadian rhythm, making it harder to fall asleep. One solution, from Eyesafe, filters blue light from digital devices. Certain models of Dell computers are now equipped with the filter, but the technology is also available through Zagg VisionGuard, a line of screen protectors that adhere to your smartphone or tablet. Ill-fitting frames can affect your vision. If you have an iPhone, there are a number of apps that allow you to virtually try on glasses — from companies such as Warby Parker and Topology — to get the right fit before placing an order online.

54d06601-f40d-4554-867d-3bbb90004522,"The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence is a by inventor and about and the future course of . First published in hardcover on January 1, 1999 by , it has received attention from , and . In the book Kurzweil outlines his vision for how technology will progress during the 21st century. Kurzweil believes provides evidence that humans will one day create more than they are. He presents his to explain why ""key events"" happen more frequently as time marches on. It also explains why the capacity of is increasing . Kurzweil writes that this increase is one ingredient in the creation of ; the others are automatic and like , , and . Kurzweil predicts machines with human-level intelligence will be available from affordable devices within a couple of decades, revolutionizing most aspects of life. He says will augment our bodies and even as humans connect to computers via or live full-time in . Kurzweil predicts the machines ""will appear to have their own "" and even ""spiritual experiences"". He says humans will essentially live forever as humanity and its machinery become one and the same. He predicts that intelligence will expand outward from until it grows powerful enough to influence the fate of the . Reviewers appreciated Kurzweil's track record with predictions, his ability to , and his clear explanations. However, there was disagreement on whether computers will one day be conscious. Philosophers and insist that computation alone cannot possibly create a machine. Searle deploys a variant of his well-known argument, this time tailored to computers playing chess, a topic Kurzweil covers. Searle writes that computers can only manipulate symbols which are meaningless to them, an assertion which if true subverts much of the vision of the book. Ray Kurzweil is an inventor and serial entrepreneur. When was published he had already started four companies: Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. which created and technology to assist the blind, , which developed with high quality emulation of real instruments, Kurzweil Applied Intelligence, which created technology, and , which made reading technology. Critics say predictions from his previous book ""have largely come true"" and ""anticipated with uncanny accuracy most of the key computer developments"" of the 1990s. After this book was published he went on to expand upon its ideas in a follow-on book . Today Ray Kurzweil works at where he is attempting to ""create a truly useful AI [artificial intelligence] that will make all of us smarter"". Kurzweil opens by explaining that the frequency of universe-wide events has been slowing down since the while has been reaching important milestones at an ever-increasing pace. This is not a paradox, he writes, (disorder) is increasing overall, but local pockets of increasing order are flourishing. Kurzweil explains how biological evolution leads to which leads to which leads to . Kurzweil unveils several laws of his own related to this progression, leading up to his which says time speeds up as order increases. He believes Moore's law will end ""by the year 2020"" but that the law of accelerating returns mandates progress will continue to accelerate, therefore some replacement technology will be discovered or perfected to carry on the exponential growth. Time periods between key events in human history shrink exponentially in a chart by Kurzweil depicting his law of accelerating returns. As in Kurzweil argues here that has an just slightly greater than zero. He says it is not higher than that because evolution operates so slowly, and intelligence is a function of time. Kurzweil explains that humans are far more intelligent than evolution, based on what we have created in the last few thousand years, and that in turn our creations will soon be more intelligent than us. The law of accelerating returns predicts this will happen within decades, Kurzweil reveals. Kurzweil introduces several thought experiments related to brain implants and brain scanning; he concludes we are not a collection of , instead we are a pattern which can manifest itself in different mediums at different times. He tackles the mystery of how self-awareness and can arise from mere matter, but without resolution. Based partly on his religious education Kurzweil feels ""all of these views are correct when viewed together, but insufficient when viewed one at a time"" while at the same time admitting this is ""contradictory and makes little sense"". Kurzweil defines the spiritual experience as ""a feeling of transcending one's everyday physical and mortal bounds to sense a deeper reality"". He elaborates that ""just being—experiencing, being conscious—is spiritual, and reflects the essence of spirituality"". In the future, Kurzweil believes, computers will ""claim to be conscious, and thus to be spiritual"" and concludes ""twenty-first-century machines"" will go to church, meditate, and pray to connect with this spirituality. Kurzweil says 's 1950 paper launched the field of artificial intelligence. He admits that early progress in the field led to wild predictions of future successes which did not materialize. Kurzweil feels intelligence is the ""ability to use optimally limited resources"" to achieve goals. He contrasts solutions with , he likes both but specifically mentions how valuable neural nets are since they destroy information during processing, which if done selectively is essential to making sense of real-world data. A neuron either fires or not ""reducing the babble of its inputs to a single bit"". He also greatly admires which mimic biological evolution to great effect. Recursion, neural nets and genetic algorithms are all components of intelligent machines, Kurzweil explains. Beyond algorithms Kurzweil says the machines will also need knowledge. The emergent techniques, neural nets and genetic algorithms, require significant training effort above and beyond creating the initial machinery. While hand-coded knowledge is tedious and brittle acquiring knowledge through language is extremely complex. Kurzweil shows that computer power is growing exponentially. To build an artificial brain requires formulas, knowledge and sufficient computational power, explains Kurzweil. He says ""by around the year 2020"" a $1,000 personal computer will have enough speed and memory to match the human brain, based on the law of accelerating returns and his own estimates of the computational speed and memory capacity of the brain. Kurzweil predicts Moore's law will last until 2020 so current integrated circuits should come close to human brain levels of computation, but he says will be the next big technology, followed potentially by , , , or . Kurzweil feels the best model for an artificial brain is a real human brain, and suggests slicing up and digitizing preserved human brains or examining them non-invasively as technology permits. Kurzweil differentiates between scanning the brain to understand it, in a generic fashion, and scanning a particular person's brain in order to preserve it in exact detail, for ""uploading"" into a computer for example. The latter is much harder to do, he notes, because it requires capturing much more detail, but it will eventually happen as well. When it does ""we will be software, not hardware"" and our mortality will become a function of our ability to ""make frequent backups"". Kurzweil notes that many thoughts people have are related to their bodies, and reassures that he does not believe in creating a disembodied brain. He reviews all the various body implants that existed when the book was published, explaining that our bodies are already becoming more synthetic over time. Kurzweil says this trend will continue and that the technology will advance from macroscopic implants, to cellular sized insertions, and finally to nanotechnology. Molecular-sized gears are an example of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology has the potential to reshape the entire world, Kurzweil exclaims. Assembling materials molecule by molecule could solve energy problems, cure and other diseases, strengthen our bodies, and produce self-assembling food, clothing, and buildings. Kurzweil admits that nanotechnology carries a big risk; a self-replicating substance, without the constraints of a living organism, might grow out of control and consume everything. However he points out that today there are already technologies which pose grave risks, for example or , and we have managed to keep them relatively safe, so he feels we can probably do the same with nanotechnology. Finally Kurzweil says there is the prospect of virtual bodies, where direct neural implants would give us the sensation of having bodies and a way to exert control, without any physical manifestation at all. Although he quickly brings things back to nanotechnology by pointing out that sufficiently advanced nanotechnology will be like having a virtual world, since """" will appear to be entirely absent and then instantly morph into functional physical shapes. Kurzweil broaches the topic of sex in futuristic times, reminding us that every new technology ""adopts sexual themes"". Kurzweil envisions , sexbots, and as well as more chaste activities like strolling along a ""virtual beach"". Luddites smashing loom; Kurzweil predicts there will be a similar reaction to intelligent machines. Kurzweil explains that in 1999 computers are essential to most facets of life, yet he predicts no major disruption related to the then-pending problem. He says computers are narrow-minded and brittle so far, but suggests in specific domains they are showing signs of intelligence. As examples Kurzweil cites computer-generated or assisted music, and tools for the automatic or semi-automatic production of literature or poetry. He shows examples of paintings by as programmed by which can be automatically created. Kurzweil reviews some of his predictions from and various past presentations, and is very pleased with his record. Finally he predicts a new movement as intelligent machines take away jobs, although he predicts a net gain of new and better jobs. Kurzweil has a dense chapter of predictions for each of these years: 2009, 2019, 2029, 2099. For example, when discussing the year 2009 he makes many separate predictions related to computer hardware, education, people with disabilities, communication, business and economics, politics and society, the arts, warfare, health and medicine, and philosophy. As one example he predicts a 2009 computer will be a tablet or smaller sized device with a high quality but somewhat conventional display, while in 2019 computers are ""largely invisible"" and images are mostly projected directly into the retina, and by 2029 he predicts computers will communicate through direct neural pathways. Similarly in 2009 he says there is interest and speculation about the , by 2019 there are ""prevalent reports"" of computers passing the test, but not rigorously, while by 2029 machines ""routinely"" pass the test, although there is still controversy about how machine and human intelligence compare. In 2009 he writes it will take a supercomputer to match the power of one human brain, in 2019 $4,000 will accomplish the same thing, while in 2029 $1,000 will buy the equivalent of 1000 humans brains. Dollar figures are in 1999 dollars. Kurzweil predicts life expectancy will rise to ""over one hundred"" by 2019, to 120 by 2029, and will be indefinitely long by 2099 as humans and computers will have merged. The book features a series of sometimes humorous dialogs between an initially unnamed character, later revealed to be a young woman named Molly, and the author. For most of the book she serves as proxy for the reader, asking the author for clarification, challenging him, or otherwise eliciting additional commentary about the current chapter. For example: So I'll be able to download memories of experiences I've never had? Yes, but someone has probably had the experience. So why not have the ability to share it? I suppose for some experiences, it might be safer to just download the memories. Less time-consuming also. Do you really think that scanning a frozen brain is feasible today? Sure, just stick your head in my freezer here. Later in the book during the prediction chapters Molly seems to inhabit whatever year the predictions are about, while Kurzweil remains in the present. So Kurzweil starts questioning her about how things are in future, and her lines serve as additional predictions or commentary. For example: No, I'm talking about real reality now. For example, I can see that Jeremy is two blocks away, headed in this direction. An embedded chip? That's a reasonable guess. But it's not a chip exactly. It's one of the first useful nanotechnology applications. You eat this stuff. Stuff? Yeah, it's a paste, tastes pretty good, actually. It has millions of little computers — we call them trackers — which work their way into your cells. Kurzweil says a universe infused with intelligence may be able to decide its own fate, perhaps avoiding the ""big crunch"" depicted here. Kurzweil says life in the universe is ""both rare and plentiful"" meaning for vast stretches there is nothing then piled into a small space it is everywhere. He suggests any form of life that invents technology will, if it survives, relatively quickly reach the point of merging with that technology, the same thing he predicts will happen to humans. Therefore, Kurzweil explains if we ever met another civilization, we would really be meeting with its technology. The technology would likely be microscopic in size because that is all that would be necessary for exploration. The civilization would not be looking for anything except knowledge, therefore we would likely never notice it. Kurzweil feels intelligence is the strongest force in the universe, because intelligence can cause sweeping physical changes like defending a planet from an asteroid. Kurzweil predicts that as the ""computational density"" of the universe increases, intelligence will rival even ""big celestial forces"". There is disagreement about whether the universe will end in a big crunch or a long slow expansion, Kurzweil says the answer is still up in the air because intelligence will ultimately make the decision. John Searle believes computers cannot be conscious; he says they can only manipulate meaningless symbols. Kurzweil uses , the IBM computer that beat the world chess champion in 1997, as an example of fledgling machine intelligence. , author and professor of philosophy at , reviewing in disagrees with Kurzweil's interpretation. Searle argues that while Kasparov was ""quite literally, playing chess"" the computer in contrast was doing ""nothing remotely like it;"" instead, it was merely manipulating ""a bunch of meaningless symbols"". Searle offers a variant of his argument, calling it the Chess Room Argument, where instead of answering questions in Chinese, the man in a room is playing chess. Or rather, as Searle explains, he is inside the room manipulating symbols which are meaningless to him, while his actions result in winning chess games outside the room. Searle concludes that like a computer, the man has no understanding of chess. Searle compares Deep Blue's victory to the manner in which a pocket calculator can beat humans at arithmetic; he adds that it is no more significant than a steel robot which is too tough for human beings to tackle during a game of American football. Kurzweil counters that the very same argument could be made of the human brain, since the individual neurons have no true understanding of the bigger problem the brain is working on but, added together, they produce what is known as consciousness[5]. Searle continues by contrasting simulation of something with ""duplication or recreation"" of it. Searle points out a computer can simulate digestion, but it will not be able to digest actual pizza. In the same way, he says, computers can simulate the processes of a conscious brain, but that does not mean it is conscious. Searle has no objection to constructing an artificial consciousness producing brain ""using some chemistry different from neurons"" so long as it duplicates ""the actual causal powers of the brain"" which he says precludes computation by itself, since that only involves symbol manipulation. Searle concludes by saying the increased computational power that Kurzweil predicts ""moves us not one bit closer to creating a conscious machine"", instead he says the first step to building conscious machines is to understand how the brain produces consciousness, something we are only in the infancy of doing. , an author and philosophy professor at the , wrote in that machines might eventually exhibit external behavior at a human-level, but it would be impossible to know if they have an ""inner subjective experience"" as people do. If they do not, then ""uploading"" someone into a computer is equivalent to letting their mind ""evaporate into thin air,"" he argues. McGinn is skeptical of the Turing test, claiming it smacks of the long-abandoned doctrine of behaviorism, and agreeing with the validity of 's ""quite devastating"" argument. He believes minds do compute, but that it does not follow that computation alone can create a mind, instead he says minds have phenomenological properties, perhaps originating from organic tissue. Therefore, he insists that neither silicon chips nor any future technology Kurzweil mentions will ever be conscious. McGinn says is ""detailed, thoughtful, clearly explained and attractively written"" as well as having ""an engaging discussion of the future of virtual sex"" and that the book is for ""anyone who wonders where human technology is going next"". However, Diane Proudfoot, philosophy professor at the , wrote in that Kurzweil's historical details are inaccurate and his philosophical understanding is flawed and that these transgressions inspired ""little confidence in his imaginings about the future"". Chet Raymo, physics professor at writes that ""Ray Kurzweil has a better record than most at foreseeing the digital future"" and ""Kurzweil paints a tantalizing — and sometimes terrifying — portrait of a world where the line between humans and machines has become thoroughly blurred"". He says the book is a ""welcome challenge to beliefs we hold dear"" and feels we can only shape the future if we anticipate it first. Jim Bencivenga, staff writer for , says Kurzweil ""possesses a highly refined and precise ability to think exponentially about technology over time"". Bencivenga also says we should take Kurzweil's predictions very seriously because of his ""proven track record"". Lyle Feisel, former electrical engineering professor, writes the predictions from Kurzweil's ""have largely come true"" and so ""engineers and computer scientists would do well to give [this book] a read"". The Canadian rock band based their 2000 concept album on They recruited to voice several tracks, on which he read select passages from the book.

4f7dc0da-8484-4ba2-b13b-0dbe855a8538,"— Yogic eye exercises, also called eye yoga, are movements that claim to strengthen and condition the muscles in your eye structure. People who practice eye yoga are often hoping to improve their vision, treat symptoms of dry eye, and decrease eye strain. There’s no evidence to support the claim that eye yoga can actually correct conditions like astigmatism, nearsightedness, or farsightedness. No exercise has been discovered that can definitively give your vision more clarity. That doesn’t mean eye yoga serves no purpose. There’s some evidence that eye yoga might actually be able to help with your ability to focus your eyes and help relieve eye strain symptoms. This article will cover what the science says about eye yoga, as well as information about eye exercises that can help your eyes function better. The research on the benefits of eye yoga is mixed. There are some conditions that it appears to help, while others it most likely doesn’t work for. There’s no evidence to suggest that eye yoga or any eye exercise can improve nearsightedness, known as . A of eye yoga techniques for people with astigmatism and refraction errors showed little to no objective improvement. The authors of this study believe that more research is needed to rule out eye yoga completely as a complementary treatment for eyesight. Some claim that eye yoga exercises may help to bring down the intraocular pressure (IOP) inside your eye. If so, this may slow the progression of , a condition that erodes your optic nerve. A in the International Journal of Yoga compiled evidence to make the case that eye yoga could work to bring down IOP. So far, no clinical trials have been done to prove this theory. There’s no evidence that suggests that eye yoga exercises can help with the symptoms of chronic dry eye. Some people claim that doing eye yoga after cataract surgery can help rebuild ocular strength. It isn’t a good idea to try this immediately after having a removed. Your eye needs time to heal and adjust to the artificial lens inserted during cataract surgery. Speak to your ophthalmologist before you attempt any kind of eye exercise, or exercise in general, after cataract surgery. Eye yoga will most likely not increase the blood flow underneath your eyes in any significant way and won’t help with dark circles under your eyes. Eye yoga may work to prevent and relieve the symptoms of . In a study of 60 nursing students, 8 weeks of eye yoga practice to make eyes feel less tired and fatigued. Eye strain is related to stress, so practicing eye yoga may work in two ways: by actually stimulating the muscles that move your eye and strengthening them, and by bringing down stress levels and helping the students to remain centered and focused. There’s more science to support the practice of eye yoga than you might expect, though much more research is needed to back up the many claims its supporters make. Eye yoga involves focusing on objects both close at hand and far away. It also involves moving your eyes from the left, upward, to the right, and downward. These focusing movements and muscle training serve two purposes. First, tending to small, purposeful movements through any kind of yogic practice calms your body down. Bringing peace to your body through healthy stress coping mechanisms helps treat hypertension, which is linked to glaucoma, headache, and anxiety, all of which can make eye strain and other optical conditions aggravated. Second, practicing focus may help improve your brain’s response to the way it interprets what you see, even if your eyes tend to send what’s called “refraction errors” that make images difficult to make out. You might not actually be seeing , but you might be becoming more attentive to what you see. That could be why, in , no improvement in eyesight could be objectively measured but participants felt like they were seeing more clearly. A of 60 participants noted that simple eye exercises improved response time to what the study group was seeing. In other words, eye exercises helped them to more quickly identify what they were looking at. Eye exercises, including eye yoga, may work to help with eye strain as well as a decrease in stress. Feeling less stress can help you focus better, so while you may not be “healing” or fixing your eyesight, you may be better able to see and recognize what’s going on around you. You may want to try these exercises on days when you have been looking at a screen for several hours to see if they help relieve discomfort. If you wear contact lenses or glasses, you’ll want to remove them before trying these exercises. This exercise trains eye muscles while also working to improve your ability to focus. Stick your left hand out as far as it will go and raise your thumb in a thumbs-up posture. Sit up straight with your eyes looking straight ahead. Focus your eyes on your thumb. Move your arm slowly to your right as far as you can, with your eyes following your thumb. Move your arm back in the other direction, following your thumb as far as your eye will go without moving your neck or chin. This is another eye exercise meant to help with eye strain. Slowly look up to the ceiling, letting yourself focus above. Roll both of your eyes so that you’re looking all the way to your right. Roll both of your eyes so that you’re looking all the way down. Roll both of your eyes so that you’re looking all the way to your left. Come back to looking at the ceiling, then look straight ahead and take a breath. Repeat several times before switching direction and moving your eyes counterclockwise. You may want to finish your eye exercises with a few moments of palming, which are meant to calm you down and help you focus. Place both hands over your eyes, as if you were going to play “peek-a-boo.” Rest your fingertips on your forehead and don’t let your palms touch your eyes — they should be slightly cupped away from your face, with your palms resting on or around your cheekbones. Breathe in slowly and clear your mind. Try not to think about anything as you look into the darkness of your hands. Repeat for several minutes as you take deep breaths in and out. Beyond trying out eye yoga, there are many research-backed ways to keep your eyes healthy. Get regular eye exams. This is essential for the early detection of conditions like cataracts and glaucoma. It also gives you the opportunity to talk to your doctor about any concerns you have about your vision. After age 60, you should go to the eye doctor every year, even if you have 20/20 vision. Protect your eyes from ultraviolet light by wearing sunglasses. If you work at your computer or use screens often, take stock of your screen time and take 5-minute breaks every hour or so. Drink plenty of water to keep your eyes (and the rest of you) lubricated. Eat green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, and kale, as well as oranges and carrots. We need more research to back up the many claims that people make about eye yoga. There’s reason to believe that eye yoga and other eye exercises might help with eye strain by decreasing stress and improving your focus, but the truth is that we don’t have a lot of definitive science to support that one way or another. If you want to give eye yoga a try, there’s very little risk, no minimum fitness level, and at the worst, you’ll lose a minute or two of your time. Speak to your doctor if you’re concerned about diminishing eyesight, dry eye, cataracts, or frequent eye strain. Eye yoga and other eye exercises aren’t an acceptable form of treatment to replace medical advice from an eye doctor. — Medically reviewed by Learn about 8 simple lifestyle changes you can make to help prevent eyestrain.

The main cause of eyestrain is thought to be fatigue of ciliary and extraocular muscle due to prolonged accommodation and vergence required by near vision work. (1-4) With the increasing use of video display terminals in day to day life eyestrain is becoming the problem of many people. Need for the Study: Almost every day an ophthalmologist comes across a patient who is an emmetrope but complains of eyestrain. In general practice we tend to ignore the symptom of eyestrain if the patient is an emmetrope; this study highlights that there are several other causes which should be investigated before labeling a patient as a malingerer. A recent Romanian study revealed that roughly 3 in 5(60.4%) of young adult patients complaining of blurred vision at near work suffered from convergence insufficiency. Similar studies conducted by Southern California college of optometry found that approximately 1 in 8 i.e. 13% of fifth and sixth grade children examined during visual screening had the disorder of convergence insufficiency as did nearly 1 in 5(17.6%) of 8 to 12 year olds, receiving examinations at optometry clinics. In the past many workers have studied the incidence of convergence insufficiency in causing eyestrain and recently there have been various studies regarding VDTS, but all the causes of eyestrain have not been taken into account. I would like to undertake this study where all the causes of eyestrain have been encompassed. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: 1) To find the prevalence of Video display terminal syndrome (VDTS). 2) To find the prevalence of convergence/ divergence anomalies. 3) To find the prevalence of latent squint. 4) To find prevalence of Binocular vision anomalies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted among emmetropic patients presenting with eyestrain, 10 to 18 years old, in the eye O.P.D. of Krishna Hospital, Karad during the period of November 2011 to May 2013. All the patients were subjected to routine clinical examination, cycloplegic refraction; fundoscopy.100 patients with normal vision were taken up for this study. All the patients were enrolled for the study after explaining the purpose of the study to them. Tests for latent and manifest squint, binocularity and testing for near point of convergence as well as near point of accommodation were done and causes of eyestrain identified. Study Design: Cross sectional study design. Sample Size: 100 patients. Inclusion Criteria: * Age: 10-18 years. * Emmetrope (Normal undilated and cycloplegic refraction). * Using video display terminal for more than 3 hours/day. * Symptoms of eyestrain. * Symptoms of eyestrain while viewing computer/ microscope. Exclusion Criteria: * Age <10 years or >18 years. * Ammetrope. * H/o any refractive/ocular surgery. * H/o any ocular trauma. * H/o any ocular pathology. Statistical test used: Pearson's chi square test and unpaired t test were used. METHODOLOGY: Procedure: For each patient one information sheet was completed. This included following data: * Age. * Sex. * Standard/College. * H/O systemic illness. * H/O watching Video Display terminal. * Hours of viewing video display terminal. * Any other systemic disease/drugs/cosmetics/face pimple/scar treatment: drugs used/Laser. * H/o similar complains in the family. * Visual acuity (distant and near). * Cycloplegic retinoscopy. * Anterior segment examination on slit lamp. * Posterior segment examination with direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy. Following investigations were undertaken: 1) Hirschberg corneal reflex test (degree): 2) Cover tests: Direct cover test Cover Uncover test Alternate cover test 3) Ocular movements: 4) RAF ruler: Near point of convergence. Near point of accommodation. 5) Prism bar reflex test: Range of fusion: with base out -with base in. 6) Worth's four dot test: 7) Maddox rod test: 8) Two pencil test: 9) Synaptophore: Simultaneous macular perception. Fusion. Stereopsis. Heterotropia. Convergence Range. Blinking rate/Schirmer's test (if more than 3hrs use of video display terminal): The final diagnosis of each patient was determined.

DISCUSSION: VDTS: The use of computers and digital electronic devices for both vocational and non-vocational activities including e-mail, internet access and entertainment is almost universal in modern society. A recent estimate of internet usage by continent ranged from 77.4% of the population of North America to 10.9% of Africa, with an estimated 1 966 514 816 users worldwide (or 28.7% of the world's population).5 Today's visual requirements may include viewing laptop and tablet computers, electronic book readers, smart phones and other electronic devices either in the workplace, at home or in the case of portable equipment, in any location. Furthermore, computer use is not restricted to adults. A recent investigation of over 2000 American children between 8 and 18 years of age reported that in an average day they spend approximately 7.5 h using entertainment media, 4.5 h watching TV, 1.5 h on a computer and over an hour playing video games. (6) These increased visual demands may give rise to a variety of symptoms which have been termed computer vision syndrome (CVS). Working at a computer terminal is invariably associated with ocular disorders that may affect visual acuity. Initially research was focused on the ocular effects of radiation hazards, but subsequently came to include symptoms due to exposure of the eyes to video display terminals (VDT), known as the Video Display Terminal/Computer Vision Syndrome. The American Optometric Association defines CVS as the combination of eye and vision problems associated with the use of computers. These symptoms result from the individual having insufficient visual capabilities to perform the computer task comfortably. (7) In a review of CVS, Thomson (8) indicated that up to 90% of computer users may experience visual symptoms including eyestrain, headaches, ocular discomfort, dry eye, diplopia and blurred vision either at near or when looking into the distance after prolonged computer use. It is unclear whether this number has increased, given the increased use of electronic displays today. Further, Rossignol et al. (9) reported that the prevalence of visual symptoms increased significantly in individuals who spent more than 4 h daily working on video display terminals (VDTs). Convergence Insufficiency (CI): Definition: Convergence Insufficiency (CI) is a binocular vision disorder; first described by von Graefe (1) in 1855 and later elaborated by Duane (2) and is typically characterized by the following signs: 1. Exophoria that is greater at near than distance, 2. A remote near point of convergence (NPC), i.e., a breakdown in convergence greater than 3 inches, or 3. Decreased positive fusional convergence (PFC) at near. (2,10) It often is associated with symptoms such as double vision, eyestrain, headaches, blurred vision, and loss of place while reading or performing near work; however, not all patients present with symptoms. Convergence insufficiency (CI) is a common and distinct binocular vision disorder with a reported prevalence among children and adults in the United States of 2.25% to 8.30%. (3, 4 11-13) Common symptoms include diplopia, asthenopia, headaches, and blurred vision usually associated with activities requiring close vision (eg: reading, computer viewing, or deskwork). (13-20) The exact impact of symptomatic CI on an individual's performance in school, at work, and on quality of life is unknown. Clinical signs of CI typically include exophoria that is greater at near than at distance, a receded near point of convergence measurement, and reduced positive fusional vergence at near measurement. (13, 20, 21) EPIDEMIOLOGY: The prevalence of CI is not truly known because no population-based studies are available. There is great variability in the reported prevalence of CI ranging from 1.75 to 33%. (14, 18, 20, 22-27) SQUINT: Virtually everyone has a heterophoria, but comparatively few people experience symptoms. The appearance of symptoms depends on the state of the sensorimotor system, the use made of the eyes, and the general well-being of a person. The absolute amount of the heterophoric deviation is not the most important factor; what matters is the presence or absence of a discrepancy between the deviation and amplitudes of motor fusion. If the amplitudes are inadequate to cope comfortably with the deviation, asthenopic symptoms may arise. Persons can overcome a heterophoria, provided there is no interference with fusion, by maintaining a tonus distribution in the extraocular muscles so that their visual axes are parallel for distance and are properly directed in near vision. Under certain circumstances, this task may be too difficult and may cause subjective symptoms consisting of discomfort of varying degree and location, so-called asthenopic symptoms, or diplopia. Patients always relate the symptoms to use of their eyes and to so-called eyestrain. Complaints range from redness and a feeling of heaviness, dryness, and soreness of the eyes, to pain in and around the eyes, frontal and occipital headaches, and even gastric symptoms and nervous exhaustion. The eyes are easily fatigued, and such patients often have an aversion to reading and studying. Typically, these complaints tend to be less severe or to disappear altogether when patients do not use their eyes in close work. (28) Binocular Vision Anomalies: BOAD syndrome: Binocular, Oculomotor, Accommodative Dysfunction. It affects a significantly high percentage of children and adults. It impacts reading and learning performance. It is often associated with behavioral/emotional problems. It has little or no impact on distant visual acuity leading to false negatives on acuity- based vision screenings. (29) CONCLUSION: Hence from this study we conclude that every patient with coming to ophthalmic O.P.D. with ocular strain and 6/6, N6 vision, needs to be worked up thoroughly regarding his/her binocular visual functions, Video Display Terminal use and tests for convergence, apart from routine slit lamp and fundus examination, rather than dispensing the patient as normal, malingerer or referring to other disciplines of medicine.

d6a94ac8-a642-4cdf-b065-3d282d67c7ed,"Natural Vision Improvement for Children and Adults listed in , originally published in It is said that the eyes are the windows to the soul. But, they can also be mirrors that reflect your overall health, as well. What then do we make of the 66% increase in cases of myopia (nearsightedness) that afflict the ""internet generation today?""[1] Thankfully, natural vision improvement is possible. How you see is part of your body's dynamic posture. The entire body participates in seeing poorly, and a lot of strain and muscle tension goes into inappropriate use of the eyes. Thus, the pain in your eyes, scalp, neck, shoulders and upper back as you work on a stressful task at your desk are part of the same problem. Therefore, it is important to attend to the needs of your eyes. Beginning with my journey out of blindness and experience from thousands of other cases, I have found that we can improve our eyesight, reduce muscle stiffness and pain, and improve the health of the whole body, through a program of eye exercises, movement, and massage/self-massage. Applying the holistic Method of Self-Healing, we create a more relaxed, balanced use of the body - and the eyes - which can bring dramatic improvement for people of all ages. This can literally be the difference between darkness, and the light of day. I was born blind from congenital cataracts, nystagmus, glaucoma and small corneas. Unsuccessful surgeries left my ocular lenses shattered and full of scarred tissues. The medical diagnoses of permanent blindness set a cloud of doubt upon the situation, so I learned to read Braille until I was seventeen. However, this changed when I discovered the Bates Method of eye exercises. I devoted myself to a practice of vision improvement that was first developed by Ophthalmologist William H Bates.[2] Adding my own intuitive exercises of massage and movement therapy, I was able to self-heal myself, and subsequently, put together an integral Self-Healing Method. I now have an unrestricted California driving license. Parents should know that the plasticity and ability of the brain and body to heal is especially effective for children. I have seen kids accomplish vision improvements in 30 minutes when it takes adults 3 times as long. This is good news because the visual stress caused by computers, cell-phones, and even school sessions are linked to many refractive problems.[3] This is great news, considering that corrective care for refractive errors amounts to an estimated $3.8 billion to $7.2 billion annually.[4] We can endure anything ourselves, but pain is magnified when it comes to our children. It was an incredibly tense moment when I learned that my son, Gull, was born with cataracts. I refused to have him raised visually impaired, as I had been. Luckily, surgeries are better today than they use to be. However, most people born with cataracts end up with 20/80 vision - vision that is half of normal. Working with my son, we were able to restore his vision to 20/40, and 20/15 with glasses. Unlike adults, children often are not motivated to work on their vision. However, one can implement fun activities that naturally strengthen vision. Swinging, for example, is a great activity because constant distance changes between objects strengthen the ability of eyes to focus. If you are facing the child who is swinging, you can call for their attention by constantly being playful (making faces, stealing their hat, catching their feet). Playing catch, jumping on trampolines, and juggling have also been effective at helping kids and adults improve their visual functioning. One thing I try to emphasize with parents is the important role they have in promoting visual activities that maintain their children's optimal health.  One fun and helpful technique I used with my son was working with his innate creative interests and having him draw objects that he could see in the world around him. Do you know that 'sparkle' that some people have in their eye? The sparkle is made up of tiny and quick movements associated with healthy eyes. In perfect vision, the eyes move effortlessly from one small detail to another, skimming the world like a butterfly. Dull and fixed stares that are not rich in detail create the perception of a world that is one big undifferentiated item. Shifting your vision from a smaller to larger text, from close objects to distant vistas, and conscientiously blinking your eyes will refresh your eyes and increase the vivid beauty of the world around you. The increase of people using computers, playing video games, and working at cramped cubicles requires that we all become conscious of ways to protect ourselves and our loved ones from the physical and visual strains associated with the 21st century lifestyle. Children that do not get enough exercise and stay indoors will lack the eye movement and natural sunlight that is necessary for sustaining healthy eyes. To eliminate and recover from eyestrain, it is critical to learn how to rest the eyes while using the computer, how to pay attention to peripheral vision and how to frequently, look briefly far into the distance. Without healthy eye habits, the cumulative effects of computer use can be devastating. Those of us with bad eyesight are using our eyes anxiously - reaching with them, and craning the head forward, as if the eyes were trying to arrive a few seconds ahead from the rest of the body. It is important to see poor eyesight and its posture as part of a whole-body response to chronic stress. This stress is likely to involve a cognitive-emotional strain, or, as Dr William H Bates put it, ""a strain of the mind,"" linked with prolonged work.[5] Exercise that flexes the iris and pupulae muscle. They help the eye shape to the admittance of light The visual stress from computer use tends to bring on nearsightedness or make it worse; it can also worsen farsightedness. Like carpal tunnel, Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) is a repetitive strain syndrome in which the ciliary, a small muscle within the eye that changes the shape of the lens to determine the focus, is strained. The brain tells the ciliary to set up the focus for a given distance, 16 inches, for example. To figure out that the page you are reading is 16 inches away from your eyes, your brain analyzes the edges and spaces of the letters. Unfortunately, there is neither definite edge nor space on a computer screen. There are only pixels - tiny, fuzzy grey dots. Bereft of essential clues, the brain endlessly searches for a focal length that can never be found.  This is as if you decided to exercise your biceps by quivering them through an inch or so of their range for hours on end, rather than doing biceps curls through the full range of movement for a few minutes. I once worked with a 50 year-old computer programmer whose vision had degenerated to 20/140. Mitch found 'sunning' to be a stimulating eye exercise. It involves helping the eye adjust to varying intensities of light. This exercise reduces squinting, which profoundly strains the eyes and creates tension in the face muscles. After working with me for one year, Mitch was able to pass the DMV test (the cut-off is 20/50) and remove the restriction for glasses. He was also able to work more efficiently, as computer glare and fluorescent lighting no longer bothered him as much as it had before. Used to relax the eyes, this technique is credited to helping Meir get his driver license Palming is another exercise that effectively restores good circulation to the neck, face, and eyes. It involves visualization of the colour black (deep purple or navy blue are acceptable substitutes). Start with some gentle upper-body stretches, or shake out tension by jumping on a mini-trampoline. Darken the room, play soft music if you like, and position yourself for maximal comfort, with your elbows well supported. Gently massage the back of your neck, your scalp, jaws, and forehead, and along the eyebrow ridge and cheekbones. Now warm your hands by rubbing them together and drop your shoulders. Close your eyes. Gently cover them, without pressure and with your cupped hands, resting the heels of your hands on your cheekbones. Breathe deeply. Now start to imagine ever-deepening blackness - a school of fish near the ocean floor, a black horse trotting along a starlit beach, or the world around you turning black, one object at a time. You may experience eyestrain that you have been shutting out; stay with it until it clears up. (It is important for glaucoma patients to limit this type of exercise to five minutes - but repeat often throughout the day!) With children, you can tell a story, or take turns making up a story; just include images of darkness, like chocolate soup or dark mud. With both of my kids, I was told that they would always depend on glasses and external help, since their ocular lens was removed. However, a simple ball-rolling exercise proved to reduce and eliminate their dependence.  We would construct an opening, a goalie, between two goals, while my daughter watched the ball roll, slowly, back in and out. This exercise was also crucial for improving coordination between the eyes and helped balance the eye-body dynamics associated with posture. You might try it out in a dark room with glow in the dark balls as well! Yoginis, or practitioners of yoga, have been defined as ""someone who knows that the entire cosmos is situated within his own body.""[6] Now that people have begun to realize the power of the mind-body connection, it is time for us to realize that we can do ""Yoga for our Eyes"" as well.[7] Obstructing central vision to strengthen to the peripheral. Obstruction causes eyes to utilize peripheral vision more intensely Promoting Relaxation of the Visual System, Developing Healthy Ocular Habits, Natural Vision Improvement Exercises Darken the room, play soft music if you like and position yourself for maximal comfort. You will need to sit quietly for awhile with the palms of your hands covering the orbit of your eyes and your elbows comfortably supported. Warm your hands by rubbing them together and drop your shoulders. Close your eyes. Gently cover them with your cupped hands without pressing on your eyes (the heel of each hand rests on a cheekbone). Breathe deeply and slowly. Regular daily brief 30 seconds - 5 minutes sessions and one or two 15- 20-minute sessions are recommended, along with occasional marathon palming sessions with friends. Don't continue palming more than five minutes at a time if you have glaucoma; do it more often instead; Sunning teaches the eye to accept strong light without resisting and creating tension, and adjusts the eye to different intensities of light. Lightly close your eyes, raise your face to the sun and move the head from side to side as far as you can in either direction, as if signalling 'no'. Then lightly massage around the eyes to prevent frowning and squinting; No sunning through glass. The head stays in motion continually. Avoid the strong sun of midday. Sunning is done only with the eyes CLOSED; This exercise bathes and massages the eye, relieves tension around it and breaks up staring. Blink effortlessly, while breathing deeply and relaxing your upper body, about 300 times. Stop and visualize it, then do it again. Flutter softly, like butterfly wings; Tape a piece of black construction paper 2"" high x 4"" wide between your eyes and, gazing straight ahead, wave your hands on each side of your head, then above and below your face, noticing your hands at the side of your face. Use the same piece of paper when you are a passenger in a car. Your brain will begin to find the moving scenery at the sides more interesting than the paper and register more of the periphery. When you are at the computer, wiggle your fingers at the side of your eyes from time to time to maintain peripheral awareness; Sit down, and have an assistant stand behind you. This is a great exercise to do with a child. Look straight ahead while your helper wiggles his or her thumbs just outside your field of vision and then into it, above, below and to the sides. When a hand comes into your field of vision, grab it. As you discover where the borders of your periphery are, you can tease them back with the same exercise. Between attempts, stop for a moment and visualize that you see the thumbs easily and well in a position just beyond where you can see them now; This exercise creates fluidity in the gaze, promotes flexibility in the lens and refreshes the eye greatly. Find a great view. Look as far away as you can, and start moving your attention from one small detail to another. It should feel light and effortless; allow the details to appear. Notice contrasts, in colour, in shape, etc. Let your eyes caress and trace shapes or details. Pick a slightly closer distance and do the same, enjoying the smallest details you can see. Interrupt your scan from time to time to visualize what you have just seen, enjoying the details. Continue until you are scanning very nearby. Shift from far to near and near to far, back and forth; This exercise allows the muscles around the lens to relax and is an important way to relieve the strain of looking at near objects (like computer screens, papers, etc). Gaze softly at the sky, the ocean, the mountains or the horizon (i.e. as far as you can see) for 7 minutes a day, sifting from place to place, noticing details, differences; This exercise breaks up the habit of straining to see, develops peripheral vision, and, for people with low vision, creates an improved sense of where they are in relationship to objects around them, i.e., a visual map. Standing with your legs about two feet apart, holding a finger in front of your face about two feet away, begin to sway the upper body to the left and right far enough that the back heel lifts. Keep looking at your finger and let the rest of the world - the periphery -- appear, moving in the opposite direction;   Close your eyes, breathe deeply and slowly, and relax. Stroke gently with your fingertips across the eyebrows, starting at the bridge of the nose and working outward toward, but not on, the temples. As you stroke, stretch the skin and underlying muscle very lightly; With your eyes closed, stroke your temples very gently to loosen the muscles there; Massage very gently and tactfully, in the area just around the eyes (within the eye orbits), making small, circular strokes; Self-Healing regimens nurture the visual system, while attending to  the needs of the whole body and person moment by moment. Thousands of people in many parts of the world have used these techniques to improve their vision and maintain a healthy visual system. Postural dynamics and shallow breathing are often connected to the vision problems people experience from computer use, as well as other sedentary habits. We sit in offices, living rooms and airplanes. We sit in front of TVs and computers. Cumulatively, the body becomes stiff, rigid and unfeeling. Little by little, joints and muscles degenerate and eyesight deteriorates. At the computer, we sit with hunched, rounded shoulders and a forward head and tend to ignore our periphery until it shrinks, and our central vision becomes strained. Many bifocal wearers tilt the head upward to aim the bifocal inserts at the screen. Worst of all, we, and our children, suppress the pain from the hours of eyestrain and bad posture. Prevent degeneration by becoming more alive, and become conscious of your body and eyes. When you are tense, notice if you are fatigued or hunching your shoulders. Fatigue and tension constricts circulation. Working at the computer strains the face, the eyes and the body. Many people believe in ergonomics as a solution for computer-related problems. While sitting differently at your desk can be helpful, periodically standing and holding your foot and stretching your leg backward is even more effective. Breathing deeply from time to time is also helpful. Most people do not realize that when concentrating, whether in front of a computer or not, they have a tendency to breathe shallowly or hardly breathe at all. Take a break and try to find a place with pleasing scenery. Wiggle your shoulders to loosen them, breathe deeply, and blink gently for three minutes, imagining that the tips of your eyelashes are leading the motion. Letting your eyes remain soft, look at small details in the distance. Isn't it easier to enjoy the beauty of the scene once the eyes are relaxed? The increased circulation and reduced strain of palming and blinking lend to a vibrancy that replaces the dullness of tired eyes. Self-healing through natural exercises is an invaluable tool for all families and communities as it is documented to: provide rehabilitation of injuries, nurture health as a preventative measure against illness, as well as exist as a holistic health-care system that is crucial, especially considering the shortcomings of national (and international) health care availability. When we understand the dynamics of the mind-body-visual system, we experience first-hand that seeing clearly is a good sign of our overall health and vitality. 1.    Paul AS.

b54ca387-cd34-49da-b306-d88a74eddb9d,"in is the difference in appearance of two or more parts of a field seen simultaneously or successively (hence: brightness contrast, lightness contrast, color contrast, simultaneous contrast, successive contrast, etc.). in is a quantity intended to correlate with the perceived contrast, usually defined by one of a number of formulae (see below) which involve e.g. the of the stimuli considered, for example: ΔL/L near the luminance threshold (known as Weber contrast), or L/L for much higher luminances. A can also be due to differences of specified by colorimetric characteristics (e.g. the ΔE CIE 1976 UCS). Visual is always contained in some kind of visual contrast, thus is an essential performance feature of . The of electronic visual displays depends on the electrical driving (analog or digital input signal), on the ambient illumination and on the direction of observation (i.e. ). The ""luminance contrast"" is the ratio between the higher luminance, L, and the lower luminance, L, that define the feature to be detected. This ratio, often called , CR, (actually being a ), is often used for high luminances and for specification of the of devices. The luminance contrast (ratio), CR, is a , often indicated by adding "":1"" to the value of the quotient (e.g. CR = 900:1). with 1 ≤ CR ≤ The contrast can also be specified by the (or ), C, defined as: {\displaystyle C_{M}={\frac {(L_{H}-L_{L})}{(L_{H}+L_{L})}}} with 0 ≤ C ≤ 1. Another contrast definition is a practical application of , sometimes found in the electronic displays field, K or C, is: {\displaystyle C_{W}={\frac {(L_{H}-L_{L})}{L_{H}}}} with 0 ≤ C ≤ 1. C = 0 means no contrast, while maximum contrast, C equals one, or more commonly described as a percentage like Michelson, 100%. A modification of Weber by Hwaung/Peli adds a glare offset to the denominator to more accurately model computer displays. Thus the is: {\displaystyle C_{m}W={\frac {(L_{H}-L_{L})}{(L_{H}+0.05)}}} This more accurately models the loss of contrast that occurs on darker display luminance due to ambient light conditions. Two parts of a can be of equal luminance, but their color () is different. Such a can be described by a distance in a suitable chromaticity system (e.g. CIE 1976 UCS, , CIELUV). A metric for often used in the electronic displays field is the ΔE*uv or ΔE*ab. During measurement of the luminance values used for evaluation of the contrast, the active area of the display screen is often completely set to one of the optical states for which the contrast is to be determined, e.g. completely white (R=G=B=100%) and completely black (R=G=B=0%) and the luminance is measured one after the other (time sequential). This way of proceeding is suitable only when the display device does not exhibit , which means that the luminance of the test pattern is varying with the size of the test pattern. Such loading effects can be found in -displays and in . A small (e.g. 4% window pattern) displayed on these devices can have significantly higher luminance than the corresponding full-screen pattern because the supply current may be limited by special electronic circuits. Any two test patterns that are not completely identical can be used to evaluate a contrast between them. When one test pattern comprises the completely bright state (full-white, R=G=B=100%) and the other one the completely (full-black, R=G=B=0%) the resulting contrast is called . This contrast is the highest (maximum) contrast the display can achieve. If no test pattern is specified in a data sheet together with a contrast statement, it will most probably refer to the . The standard procedure for contrast evaluation is as follows: Apply the first test pattern to the electrical interface of the display under test and wait until the optical response has settled to a stable steady state, Measure the luminance and/or the chromaticity of the first test pattern and record the result, Apply the second test pattern to the electrical interface of the display under test and wait until the optical response has settled to a stable steady state, Measure the luminance and/or the chromaticity of the second test pattern and record the result, Calculate the resulting for the two test patterns using one of the metrics listed above (CR,C or K). When luminance and/or chromaticity are measured before the optical response has settled to a stable steady state, some kind of has been measured instead of the . When the image content is changing rapidly, e.g. during the display of video or movie content, the optical state of the display may not reach the intended stable steady state because of slow response and thus the apparent contrast is reduced if compared to the . This illustration shows the repetitive impulse response between several states of gray when each state is applied for one frame only. It is obvious that the stationary luminance levels (indicated by dashed horizontal lines) are not reached within a single frame. This is a technique for expanding the contrast of LCD-screens. LCD-screens comprise a backlight unit which is permanently emitting light and an LCD-panel in front of it which modulates transmission of light with respect to intensity and chromaticity. In order to increase the contrast of such LCD-screens the backlight can be (globally) dimmed when the image to be displayed is dark (i.e. not comprising high intensity image data) while the image data is numerically corrected and adapted to the reduced backlight intensity. In such a way the dark regions in dark images can be improved and the contrast between subsequent frames can be substantially increased. Also the contrast within one frame can be expanded intentionally depending on the histogram of the image (some sporadic highlights in an image may be cut or suppressed). There is quite some required for implementation of the in a way that is pleasing to the human (e.g. no flicker effects must be induced). The contrast within individual frames () can be increased when the backlight can be locally dimmed. This can be achieved with backlight units that are realized with arrays of LEDs. High-dynamic-range (HDR) LCDs are using that technique in order to realize (static) contrast values in the range of CR > 100.000. In order to measure the highest contrast possible, the dark state of the display under test must not be corrupted by light from the surroundings, since even small increments ΔL in the denominator of the ratio (L + ΔL) / (L + ΔL) effect a considerable reduction of that quotient. This is the reason why most contrast ratios used for advertising purposes are measured under dark-room conditions (illuminance E ≤ 1 lx). All emissive electronic displays (e.g. CRTs, PDPs) theoretically do not emit light in the black state (R=G=B=0%) and thus, under darkroom conditions with no reflected from the display surface into the light measuring device, the luminance of the black state is zero and thus the contrast becomes infinity. When these display-screens are used outside a completely dark room, e.g. in the living room (illuminance approx. 100 lx) or in an office situation (illuminance 300 lx minimum), ambient light is reflected from the display surface, adding to the luminance of the dark state and thus reducing the contrast considerably. A quite novel TV-screen realized with OLED technology is specified with a ratio CR = 1.000.000 (one million). In a realistic application situation with 100 lx illuminance the contrast ratio goes down to ~350, with 300 lx it is reduced to ~120. The contrast that can be experienced or measured in the presence of ambient illumination is shortly called ""ambient contrast"". A special kind of ""ambient contrast"" is the contrast under outdoor illumination conditions when the illuminance can be very intense (up to 100.000 lx). The contrast apparent under such conditions is called ""daylight contrast"". Since always the dark areas of a display are corrupted by reflected light, reasonable ""ambient contrast"" values can only be maintained when the display is provided with efficient measures to reduce reflections by anti reflection and/or anti-glare coatings. When a test pattern is displayed that contains areas with different luminance and/or chromaticity (e.g. a checkerboard pattern), and an observer sees the different areas simultaneously, the apparent contrast is called (the term is already taken for a different effect). Contrast values obtained from two subsequently displayed full-screen patterns may be different from the values evaluated from a checkerboard pattern with the same optical states. That discrepancy may be due to non-ideal properties of the display-screen (e.g. crosstalk, halation, etc.) and/or due to straylight problems in the light measuring device. When a contrast is established between two optical states that are perceived or measured one after the other, this contrast is called . The contrast between two full-screen patterns (full-screen contrast) always is a . Depending on the nature of the display under test (direct-view or projection) the contrast is evaluated as a quotient of luminance values (direct-view) or as a quotient of illuminance values (projection displays) if the properties of the is separated from that of the projector. In the latter case, a checkerboard pattern with full-white and full-black rectangles is projected and the illuminance is measured at the center of the rectangles. The standard ANSI IT7.215-1992 defines test-patterns and measurement locations, and a way to obtain the from illuminance measurements, it does not define however a quantity named ""ANSI lumen"". If the reflective properties of the projection screen (usually depending on direction) are included in the measurement, the luminance reflected from the centers of the rectangles has to be measured for a (set of) specific . , contrast and of is usually varying with the (i.e. ). The variation of electro-optical characteristics with can be measured sequentially by mechanical scanning of the ( approach) or by simultaneous measurements based on .
