chatgpt_35,"A ketogenic or keto diet may be suitable for people with diabetes, but it is important to first consult with a healthcare provider. The diet involves significantly reducing carbohydrate intake and increasing fat intake to promote a state of ketosis, in which the body burns fat for fuel instead of glucose. This can help to regulate blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity in some people with type 2 diabetes. However, the diet may also lead to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (dangerously high levels of ketones) in some people with diabetes, particularly those who take insulin or certain medications. A healthcare provider can help to assess whether a keto diet is appropriate and safe for an individual with diabetes, and can provide guidance on monitoring blood sugar levels and adjusting medication as needed.",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-0.004175872541964054,0

Figuring out a diet that fuels our body’s needs and keeps us healthy without sacrificing taste is a daunting task for anyone. Factor in diabetes and this task can suddenly seem like an insurmountable obstacle overcome only by the most health-conscious fitness guru. Some diets are clearly fads, popping up into existence seemingly overnight, selling books and recipes and often food itself, only to fade into the twilight and be overtaken the next day by yet another set of guidelines by which we are to become, optimistically, the best self we can be. There are seemingly endless options to curate a diet to meet every notion or need. However, those living with diabetes may find that these diets don’t always work to balance glycemic control and blood sugar. So what about the ketogenic diet? Is it a fad that will one day be supplanted by the next newest way to eat, or will the science behind it ensure it keeps a lifelong and loyal following? And if the latter, what role can it play in the lives of those living with diabetes? Ketogenic diets were first proposed as a way to control epileptic seizures in children. Before keto diets, epileptics often fasted to reduce seizures, so the keto diet offered a less restrictive alternative. Though effective, the diet was mostly supplanted by medications – except in a segment of the population suffering from epilepsy that cannot control it with medicine, and for them, the ketogenic diet has had great success. Along with the benefits it offers to epileptics, especially children, the keto diet is also being studied as a possible salve for many neurological conditions and diabetes, too. All of our cells need fuel to function. This fuel comes from three sources: fat, carbohydrates and protein, called macronutrients. Too much protein without fat puts us at risk for a handful of complications, so protein can never healthily serve as a primary source of fuel. We are left then with fat and carbohydrates as the main providers of energy – the energy that allow us to do everything from breathing and blinking as we veg out on the couch to swimming the English Channel. Our cells’ preferred fuel comes from carbohydrates, which are easily converted to glucose, which, in turn, is readily converted to energy. This is why athletes “carb load” before they compete. Peak performance occurs when the body has plenty of glucose and glycogen stores available at hand. When glycogen runs out, that’s when the body turns to fat. When there is no more blood sugar for our cells to consume, they seek an alternative form of energy. This energy comes from ketones, which are compounds our body produces from stored fat. So a ketogenic diet is one that is high in fat and very low in carbohydrates, resulting in the production of ketones to be used for fuel instead of glucose. The word “keto” often has negative associations for people living with diabetes, especially Type 1. DKA, diabetic ketoacidosis, is a life-threatening condition arising when the body produces too many ketones. So how does entering ketosis deliberately through a conscientious diet differ from entering it accidentally? The answer has to do with the level of ketones, the former causing and the latter causing an overabundance. The benefits of a ketogenic diet have been for those living with Type 2 diabetes. Not only does the diet help manage blood sugar but it promotes weight loss as well. The results for those living with Type 1 are less conclusive. Many studies tend to address low carb diets like paleo and Atkins, which focus more on types of low carb food to eat, unlike a keto diet, which pays close attention to macronutrients and staying in ketosis. There seem to be fewer studies exploring the latter, but there is that seems to the diet offers a way to manage A1C levels and glycemic control. Many people with diabetes who abide by the keto diet have found that they significantly reduce their use of insulin. So what makes Keto unlike other diets? Meat, meat and more meat. There is no meat or fish that is off limits on keto, including the usually verboten bacon. Non-starchy vegetables like Brussels sprouts and cauliflower are encouraged, as are oils, butter and lard. Cheese and Greek yogurt can also be staples of a keto diet. However, this diet isn’t for everyone. If traditional bread, pasta, rice, potatoes and/or fruit are what you live for, then you might just be miserable on keto. However, if you’re open to exploring different tastes, then the good news is there are substitutes for many of these foods. Cauliflower pizza crust, rice, and even gnocchi; zoodles (noodles made from zucchini); almond flour bread and almond milk are all readily available from most stores now.  A small amount of berries is acceptable, but for the most part say goodbye to apples, melons, plums and peaches. Booze and sugar are also out, but if you’re living with diabetes, you likely already know how to manage these desires. If you are taking insulin, you may immediately need to lower your intake anywhere from as soon as you enter ketosis. For those living with Type 1, this can significantly help with controlling highs and hypos. As with any diet, precautions need to be taken. Pregnant women and those with kidney disease are not good candidates for this diet, and some people with diabetes may find that the diet . Dairy can often spike blood sugar, so avoiding the dairy in a keto diet and taking a Vitamin D supplement might be a better option for some people. It’s important to pay attention to the way your body responds and realize that no diet is a one-size-fits-all model. The trick to reaping the benefits of the keto diet is to stay in ketosis, which means keeping your carbs at or less of your calories. The 5% can fall anywhere between 20-50 grams a day. However, if an insulin shot is missed while in deep ketosis, there’s a good chance you will find yourself quite sick, so it’s probably best to avoid the risk and of this spectrum. This diet might be untenable as a long-term way of life for many people, but if you have iron willpower and the desire to try a restrictive diet that still allows you to indulge yourself with fatty meats and oils, a keto diet might very well be the way for you to help manage your diabetes while managing weight. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2129159/ (2004) https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/with-diabetes-medications (2018) https://ketologic.com/keto-faqs/how-many-carbs-a-day-for-ketosis/ (2017) https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/well/live/low-carb-diet-type-1-diabetes.html (2018) https://diabetesstrong.com/ketogenic-diet-and-diabetes (2018)",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-0.023524120450019836,1

If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. The ketogenic, or keto, diet is a very-low-carb, high-fat diet that has been shown to offer several health benefits. In recent years, interest in using the keto diet as a tool to help manage diseases, such as epilepsy, cancer, and diabetes, has increased. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition in which your pancreas produces little or no insulin. It should not be confused with type 2 diabetes, which affects the way your body processes blood sugar and is usually associated with insulin resistance. Though the keto diet has been shown to improve blood sugar control and reduce insulin requirements, several complications may arise for those with type 1 diabetes (). This article tells you whether the keto diet is safe for those with type 1 diabetes. A common area of misunderstanding surrounding the keto diet is the concept of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) versus nutritional ketosis (ketosis). Knowing the difference between the two becomes even more important if you have type 1 diabetes. On a , you significantly reduce your carb intake to less than 50 grams per day and increase your fat intake instead. This pushes your body to produce ketones from fat in your liver and use fat as its main fuel source as opposed to carbs. This shift in metabolism results in , which means your body uses ketones in your blood for energy. On the other hand, diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency that occurs mostly in people with type 1 diabetes if they don’t take insulin. Without insulin to transport blood sugar into your body’s cells, blood sugar and ketone levels rise rapidly, disrupting your blood’s acid-base balance (). Thus, the main difference between nutritional ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis is as follows: In ketosis, only ketone levels are elevated, allowing your body to use mostly fat for energy. In diabetic ketoacidosis, blood sugar and ketone levels are very high, resulting in a critical health state. If you have type 1 diabetes and are thinking about trying a ketogenic diet, it’s extremely important to work with healthcare professionals, such as a registered dietitian and medical doctor, to avoid serious complications. Nutritional ketosis is a metabolic state in which your body burns fat instead of carbs as its primary fuel source. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication in type 1 diabetes in which blood sugars run high and excess ketones are produced. The keto diet has been shown to significantly levels in people with type 1 and 2 diabetes (, ). One 2.5-year study in 11 adults with type 1 diabetes found that the keto diet significantly improved A1C levels, a marker of long-term blood sugar control (). However, some participants experienced episodes of their blood sugar levels falling too low. This can happen if your blood sugar levels drop below 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/L) and is likely due to improper insulin dosing. The keto diet raises the risk of your blood sugar levels becoming too low. This could lead to potentially serious complications, such as confusion, dizziness, slurred speech, and loss of consciousness (, ). The keto diet can considerably lower blood sugar levels in people with type 1 and 2 diabetes. Without proper insulin adjustments, your levels may become too low, leading to potentially serious complications. Strong evidence suggests that the keto diet can (). A number of factors are believed to be responsible, including: The keto diet promotes feelings of fullness, likely due to changes in hunger hormones, making you less likely to overeat (). Higher-carb foods are eliminated, reducing your calorie intake (). Keto diets tend to be higher in protein than standard diets, leading to increased fullness at meals (). While some people with type 1 diabetes may be interested in losing weight, this is not the goal, or even safe, for everyone. It’s important to take this possible side effect into consideration before starting the keto diet. Following a keto diet may lead to weight loss, which may be undesirable or unsafe for some people, especially those who are underweight. To control their blood sugar, people with type 1 diabetes use short-acting insulin in varying doses that depend on how high their blood sugar levels are and how many carbs a given meal contains. When drastically reducing your carb intake, such as with the keto diet, blood sugar levels trend much lower, requiring less insulin to manage them. For instance, a study in 10 people with type 1 diabetes on a found that participants needed an average of 20 fewer units of insulin per day (). Insulin dosing must be properly adjusted to account for your current blood sugar levels, which will likely be lower after starting the keto diet. If you administer the same amount of insulin as before starting the diet, you may experience hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), a serious side effect. Considering that less insulin is required, it’s crucial to seek medical guidance and test your blood sugar levels frequently to prevent episodes of hypoglycemia. On a keto diet, blood sugar levels run lower due to reduced carb intake. If you have type 1 diabetes, you may need to decrease insulin accordingly. This reduction should be supervised by your doctor. Whether the keto diet is safe for people with type 1 diabetes does not have a simple yes-or-no answer. Many factors need to be considered. If your diabetes is well managed and you thoroughly educate yourself and seek medical guidance, the keto diet can be a relatively safe option (, ). However, it’s best to experiment with a lower-carb diet before implementing a full keto diet to see how your body responds. If you have type 1 diabetes and are interested in the keto diet, it’s extremely important to start by seeking medical guidance from a registered dietitian (RD) and medical doctor (MD). An RD can assist you with the specific format and outline of the diet, whereas your doctor can help adjust your insulin regimen or oral medications accordingly. Together, their supervision and guidance will greatly reduce your risk of serious complications and help you adhere to the diet safely and sustainably. In addition to closely monitoring your blood sugar levels, be sure to test your ketone levels regularly when following a keto diet. Many people with type 1 diabetes may be familiar with already, as it’s used to detect early stages of diabetic ketoacidosis (). You can purchase meters with test strips that work similarly to blood glucose meters. You can buy test strips that indicate ketones by color when submerged in a urine sample. These devices measure acetone levels, a ketone byproduct, in your breath. Specifically, you should check your ketone levels if your blood sugar level is above 300mg/dl (16.6 mmol/L) or you’re feeling sick, confused, or in a fog (). Blood ketone meters tend to be the most accurate and are readily available or in pharmacies. and can be purchased as well. Due to potentially negative overall health effects, some people with type 1 diabetes should not follow a keto diet, including: those with a history of chronic low blood sugar levels people who are underweight or have an people undergoing or recovering from a medical procedure These populations have an increased risk of complications and are not advised to start a keto diet without medical clearance (, ). Some people with type 1 diabetes can safely follow a keto diet, though close medical supervision is crucial. Other groups of people should avoid the diet. It’s important to monitor ketone levels, especially if your blood sugar levels are elevated. Whether the keto diet is safe if you have type 1 diabetes depends on many individual factors, such as how well your diabetes is managed or whether you’re underweight or have a history of low blood sugar levels. With proper medical guidance, the keto diet can be a relatively safe option for some people with type 1 diabetes while others should avoid it altogether. It’s best to start by trying a lower-carb diet before implementing a full ketogenic diet to gauge how your body responds. If you have type 1 diabetes and want to try the keto diet, speak to your healthcare provider and a dietitian to set up a personalized program to minimize your risk of potentially dangerous .

Keto Diet and Diabetes: Do They Work Well Together? Do a keto diet and diabetes make a perfect match? Some experts and diabetics think so! When you follow a , your body converts fat, rather than sugar, into energy which may improve blood sugar levels while also reducing the need for insulin. In many ways, a ketogenic diet seems like it’s made for people trying to avoid or manage diabetes because it takes away two of the most concerning aspects of most diets — and carbohydrates. While following this new way of eating, diabetics have seen drastic reductions or even elimination of their medications (more on those studies to come). And don’t worry — this diet doesn’t make you feel deprived. If anything, it has a reputation for making people feel very satisfied and energetic once they reach a . Let’s take a look at whether or not the keto diet may be a healthy choice for you and your diabetes management! For people with , type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes, minimizing sugar as well as carbohydrate intake is typically recommended to maintain healthy . The ketogenic diet is a very low-carb diet that changes the body’s “fuel source”  from burning glucose (or sugar) to burning dietary fat instead. Making this major switch in dietary habits promotes a state of “ketosis” which means your body is now a fat burner rather than a sugar burner. Research as well as firsthand accounts show that this ketogenic way of eating may help some diabetics to decrease and better control their blood glucose levels. is one of the principle risk factors for diabetes and following a ketogenic diet has been shown to help with weight loss. According to  published in 2014, “A period of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet may help to control hunger and may improve fat oxidative metabolism and therefore reduce body weight.” Many prediabetics struggle with being overweight so a keto diet can , which can help to decrease the chances of developing full blown diabetes. In addition, as the  points out, “Carbohydrate metabolism plays a huge role in the development of type 2 diabetes, which occurs when the body can’t make enough insulin or can’t properly use the insulin it makes.” When a food containing carbohydrates is eaten, the digestive system has to process these carbs and turns them into sugar which then goes into the bloodstream. The ketogenic diet majorly minimizes carbohydrate intake so prediabetics, as well as type 1 and type 2 diabetics, aren’t challenging their bodies with carbohydrate breakdown that can raise blood sugar levels and create problematic insulin demands for the body. Is a keto diet good for type 2 diabetes? The keto diet can be very helpful for type 2 diabetes since the body is now using fat rather than carbohydrates as its main source of fuel. This way of eating and helps to keep blood glucose levels at a low yet healthy level. If you’re a type 2 diabetic who takes insulin, then you may likely need less insulin as a result of following the ketogenic diet. published in 2012 in the journal, , compares low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) with a low-calorie diet (LCD) in improving glycemia (the presence of glucose or sugar in the blood). Overall, the study finds a low-carb keto diet to be more beneficial than a low-calorie diet for obese type 2 diabetics. The study concludes, “The ketogenic diet appears to improve glycemic control. Therefore, diabetic patients on a ketogenic diet should be under strict medical supervision because the LCKD can significantly lower blood glucose levels.” Previous research has also shown that for patients with type 2 diabetes, long-term administration of the keto diet lowered body weight, improved blood sugar levels and can result in a smaller needed dose of antidiabetic medication. Another published in the journal, , finds that both a low-glycemic index, reduced-calorie diet and a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet can improve glycemic control, encourage weight loss, and reduce or eliminate the need for diabetic medication over a 24-week period with the lower carbohydrate keto diet being “most effective for improving glycemic control.” Researchers note that subjects taking between 40 to 90 units of insulin before the study were able to completely eliminate their insulin use while also improving blood sugar control! They also point out that this effect happens “immediately upon implementing the dietary changes” so people with type 2 diabetes need to monitor their blood sugar closely and likely adjust their medication dosages/needs with the help of their doctors. An article published in the in 2018 explores the . The article points out how many diabetes experts will not recommend low-carb diets for type 1 diabetics, especially if they are children, due to concerns over hypoglycemia as a result of carb restriction and the possibility of this having a negative effect on a child’s growth. The pieces also points out that studies are disproving this concern and making a case for both children and adults with type 1 diabetes to consider a ketogenic diet. Specifically, a published in the journal, , which took a look at glycemic control among children and adults with type 1 diabetes who followed a very low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet. The researchers found that both the adults and children who consumed this diet along with smaller doses of insulin than typically required exhibited “exceptional” blood sugar control without high rates of complications. In addition, the study data did not show an adverse effect of a very low-carbohydrate diet on children’s growth, although more research may still be a good idea, according to researchers. If you , talk to your doctor before starting a . Once you get approval from your doctor, here are some of the key building blocks of the ketogenic diet to get you started: Examples include , monounsaturated fats and some polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs), especially . It’s best to include all of these varieties on a daily basis, with an emphasis on , especially compared to PUFAs. A typical recommended keto protein intake is between one and 1.5 grams per kilogram of your ideal body weight. To convert pounds to kilograms, divide your ideal weight by 2.2. It’s important to note that  recommends that adults with diabetes limit their protein intake to less than one gram per kilogram of body weight each day and that adults with chronic kidney disease avoid protein intake greater than 1.3 grams per kilogram per day. Historically, a targeted keto diet consists of limiting carbohydrate intake to just 20–30 net grams per day. “Net carbs” is the amount of carbs remaining once is taken into account. Because fiber is indigestible once eaten, most people don’t count grams of fiber toward their daily carb allotment. In other words, total carbs – grams of fiber = net carbs. That’s the carb counts that matter most. Drinking enough water can help you to avoid fatigue and is important for good digestion. It’s also needed for detoxification. Aim to drink 10–12 eight-ounce glasses a day. There no “cheat days” or “cheat meals” on the keto diet. The main reason is that if you eat a meal too rich in carbohydrates, it will take you out of ketosis and then will be like you’re starting all over. Plus, if you do have a , you may experience a return of that you already made a thing of the past. Ready to dive in to your new keto diet plan? Here are some examples of foods that are top choices for a ketogenic diet and for keeping blood sugar levels down.

It’s also essential that diabetics continue to follow their doctor’s instructions, including appropriate insulin use, while following any diet. Can keto trigger diabetes? The early findings of one research study published in 2018 finds that short term feeding of a ketogenic diet appears to trigger . Sometimes ketosis is confused with ketoacidosis. Ketosis is the result of following the standard ketogenic diet. Ketosis takes place when glucose from carbohydrate foods is drastically reduced, which forces the body to find an alternative fuel source: fat. The end result is staying fueled off of circulating high ketones. is what happens when “ketosis goes too far.” People with diabetes can experience diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), when they don’t take sufficient amounts of insulin or when they are sick, dehydrated, or they experience physical or emotional trauma. According to the , “Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious condition that can lead to diabetic coma (passing out for a long time) or even death.” This is why following a ketogenic diet when you have diabetes has to be done very carefully and under a healthcare professional’s supervision. People with type 1 diabetes are more likely to develop ketoacidosis. If you experience , your blood sugar level is consistently above 300 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 16.7 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), or you have ketones in your urine and can’t reach your doctor, seek emergency medical care. If you are a diabetic following a ketogenic diet, it’s vital that you follow this new way of eating under your doctor’s supervision, check your blood sugar regularly and take insulin as recommended. Insulin dosages often need to be adjusted after changing to a keto diet.  It’s also important to monitor the renal function of diabetics while they are following a ketogenic diet. A ketogenic diet is a very low-carbohydrate way of eating that changes the body’s “fuel source”  from burning glucose (or sugar) to burning dietary fat instead. Some studies show that this can help people with prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and type 1 diabetes to lower their blood sugar levels and decrease or eliminate the need for insulin. The keto diet has been shown to reduce obesity, which is a major risk factor the development of diabetes. When following a ketogenic diet meal plan for diabetes, make sure you check with your doctor about your planned intake of nutrients, especially appropriate daily amounts of protein since diabetics with kidney issues need to be mindful of their intake. While consuming a low-carb diet, it’s essential that people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes to monitor their blood sugar levels closely and to adjust their medication dosages as needed with their doctor’s help. Never put a child on a ketogenic diet without a doctor’s approval and guidance. Untreated diabetic ketoacidosis can be fatal so seek urgent medical care if you experience symptoms of ketoacidosis.

9ee82bf3-ec23-4b4c-9598-5c0b5883f578,"The keto diet is a low carbohydrate, high fat diet. Low carbohydrate and moderate protein intake results in the production of small molecules known as “ketones”. These ketones are used for energy when the body does not produce enough glucose (blood sugar). During a keto diet, the body runs on fat and therefore burns fat all the time. This process, where the body uses fat as a fuel and produces ketones is known as ketosis. The production of ketones increases as insulin levels drop when people adhere to the keto diet. Normally, carbohydrates and starches are broken down by the body into glucose. Insulin helps glucose to be taken up into cells to use as a source of energy. A further role of insulin is to inhibit the production of sugar in the liver. However, if the glucose levels in the blood are higher than normal, it can lead to diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance. This differs from type 1 diabetes, which is an autoimmune condition that prevents the production of insulin. Type 2 diabetes is often caused by the overconsumption of sugary foods, which causes the pancreas to overproduce insulin to keep blood glucose levels under control. As blood levels of insulin are consistently high, the body becomes resistant towards insulin.  Ketones, which are produced during the ketogenic diet, have been shown to reduce the need for medication in .

Losing two to three kilograms of weight can almost halve the risk of Type 2 diabetes ACE2/TMPRSS2 not expressed in pancreatic islet endocrine cells Keto diet could be beneficial for elderly COVID-19 patients The keto diet is similar to starvation in that both glucose and insulin plasma levels are low. Some studies suggest that 1 to 3 days of starvation or decreased carbohydrate intake is enough to decrease the need for medication to control type 2 diabetes. Several studies of keto diets have shown that an increased risk of type 2 diabetes does exist early during the diet. In a study by ETH Zurich and University Children's Hospital Zurich, mice were put on one of two different diets - the ketogenic diet or a high fat diet. Metabolic tests showed that abnormal glucose levels and insulin resistance developed in the livers of mice fed a keto diet to a greater extent than in mice fed a high fat diet. As the liver was unable to deal with normal levels of insulin for glucose control, the risk of type 2 diabetes also increased. In another study, the ketogenic diet was introduced to mice for several days. Researchers found that the liver has begun to resist insulin and the mice could not regulate their normal blood sugar levels. Insulin resistance is the key marker of type 2 diabetes. This indicates that there could be an increased risk of type 2 diabetes with the keto diet. However, the study did not analyze whether the keto diet would lead to obesity in the long term. Additionally, the aetiology of type 2 diabetes and the ultimate causes are not completely understood. Examining the connection between keto diets and type 2 diabetes is important. Furthermore, the process by which low carbohydrate and high fat diets cause physiological changes that lead to insulin resistance remain unexplored. Contrary to these findings, in 2018, a study by Westman et al. showed that keto diets might reduce the effects of diabetes type 2 rather than increase the risks. It has been reported that a low carbohydrate, ketogenic diet might be effective to improve glycemia and reduce medication needs for persons with type 2 diabetes. The diet, which was introduced to patients with type 2 diabetes, was shown to improve glycemic control. This resulted in reduction and in some cases discontinuation of medication for type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the diet has shown positive effects towards weight loss and the glycemic control. However, it has been suggested that diets be adjusted for each patient. Earlier, a study by Saslow et al. in 2017 showed that HbA1c levels were lower with a keto compared to control diet. Patients with type 2 diabetes improved their glycemic control and lost more weight. The researchers speculated that self-management of type 2 diabetes may be possible with a ketogenetic diet. The inconsistency in study results necessitates that further, well-controlled human studies be performed to determine whether a keto diet is safe for patients with type 2 diabetes or at risk of type 2 diabetes.

5fdf085d-b0b0-4b8c-8e77-8cba2b211662,"Can Going Keto Actually Help Manage Type 2 Diabetes? — At times, type 2 diabetes can feel like carrying around an incessant party pooper on your back. Anytime you want to treat yourself, he’s there to swat that apple cider donut right out of your hands. And while no one is calling T2 diabetes a party, there plenty of ways to keep your condition from raining on your parade. One of the most promising? The Ketogenic diet. You’ve probably heard a lot about it, some true, some false. So — does it help? Is it just another fad? Is it true that a keto meal plan includes deep-fried cheese sticks wrapped in deep-fried bacon? No. Read on for everything you need to know about how going keto could get that party pooper off your back. It’s that diet where you stuff your face with cheese and miraculously lose weight right? Sorry, no. The keto diet was actually developed back in 1923 to help those suffering from drug-resistant epilepsy. It involves eating a high fat, moderate protein, very low carbohydrate diet to “starve” cells of traditional fuel (aka carbs), and in turn, reduce epileptic seizures. Eventually, people discovered that the diet had , such as helping people manage chronic conditions like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, cancer, and — you guessed it — type 2 diabetes. …as most people forget that the high-fat, low-carb part of this diet comes with precise specifications. To properly follow the keto diet, your food intake should break down to about , , and . Notice how this is a lot different than subbing bread with cheese and calling yourself keto. You gotta play by the rules for it to work! Carbohydrates are the primary fuel source for most of the body’s processes. When carbohydrates are restricted or absent, your body is forced into a state of what it views as starvation. With fat being plentiful, your body begins to use fat as its primary fuel source. This state is called (get it — keto?). In ketosis, fat is broken down into ketones to be used as fuel instead of the glucose (aka sugar) your body would normally get from carbs. Because this diet promotes the burning of body fat, it frequently appeals to individuals hoping to lose weight. It’s also to have positive impacts on cardiovascular health, including increased HDL cholesterol (the good kind), improved blood pressure and reduced triglyceride levels. Maintaining a healthy weight and keeping blood sugar levels in check are the hallmark recommendations for controlling diabetes. can help you thanks to side effects like weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, lower blood sugar levels, and reduced need for medication. All you need to do is give your doctor a heads up — they can answer any questions you might have and refer you to a registered dietitian who can put together a meal plan that works for you — and follows the keto rules. 5 percent of calories from carbohydrates translates to about 20–50 grams per day. Yikes! For reference, one slice of bread contains between 15–20 grams of carbs and a medium apple has between 20–25 grams. , on the other hand, contains just 6 grams. It’s also important to remember that the amount of carbohydrates allowed per day is based on very personal, specific calculations based on a person’s body fat percentage, which is why it’s so important to consult with a medical pro you hop on the keto train. In addition to the amount of carbs you’re permitted to eat, the keto diet also limits carb types. (We know — we’re feeling personally attacked too.) Bread, pasta, beans, legumes, and starchy vegetables (think corn, carrots, peas) are not recommended. The same goes for root vegetables, most fruits, alcohol, and processed foods in general. Sugar also gets the stanky boot (RIP Krispy Kreme). On the plus side, lots of good stuff is permitted. Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy (butter, cheese, cream), nuts, seeds, oils, avocados, non-starchy vegetables, and some fruits (mostly berries) are good to go. It’s restrictive, but not totally impossible to follow. Needless to say, completely rearranging the way your body burns energy comes with a few side effects. Here’s what you can expect: . The primary side effect when beginning the ketogenic diet is affectionately known as . For the first few weeks, your body is adapting to using this new energy source, and it needs a minute to figure out what the heck is going on. Symptoms can include brain fog, difficulty sleeping, gastrointestinal discomfort, intense food cravings, and fatigue. Initial weight loss is mostly from dehydration so be sure to drink extra fluids. . A significant decrease in fiber + a surge in fat = a lot of . Be sure to drink plenty of water and work in some high-fiber, low-carb foods like broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and nuts to get things moving again. . No one wants to be the smelly friend, but going keto will give you some extra work in the odor-control department. Ketones are released in sweat, urine, and your breath. You may notice a in your mouth, due to the presence of a specific type of ketone called acetone. Combat these effects with a stash of mints, extra-strength deodorant, and a quick flush after you use the facilities. Don’t panic — side effects should dissipate within a few weeks as your body adjusts to its new fuel source. Keto is not for everyone though, and if symptoms persist, this may not be the best eating plan for you. Very high intake of fat, particularly saturated or trans fats, has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease. This is bad news to begin with, but doubly so considering people living with diabetes are already at higher risk for cardiovascular disease. Hypoglycemic episodes (aka low blood sugar), and worse, are potential side effects of going keto, especially for people who take insulin. Certain nutrient deficiencies are also commonplace given the drastic reduction in nutrient-dense foods like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. With the overwhelming popularity of keto, it’s easy to forget there are lots of other diets out there known to help people manage their type 2 diabetes. Here’s how they stack up: Thought to trigger a similar state of ketosis through cycles of fasting and eating, is gaining a lot of traction as a beneficial long-term strategy to optimize health and reduce inflammation. During these our cells get really stressed out, and adapting to this stress helps to make them more resilient, and also better at fighting off disease. The focus in IF is on to eat, not necessarily to eat. Quality food sources are encouraged with no specific restrictions. The Atkins diet is almost identical to the ketogenic diet, but focuses more on the grams of carbohydrates eaten per day (starting at 20 grams) and less on the specific amount of fat and protein. The diet is broken up into 4 phases, gradually increasing the amount of carbohydrates allowed until weight loss goals are reached. . The emphasis here is on whole, minimally processed, and mostly plant-based foods. Unlike the keto diet, it includes whole grains, some dairy, and moderate consumption of alcohol with minimal, if any, added sugar. It promotes a sensible, inclusive eating pattern, and is probably the most sustainable diet of the bunch. . This diet emphasizes foods theoretically consumed by our early ancestors. It includes lean meat, fish, eggs, berries, and nuts. While there is no limit on carbohydrates, grains are not allowed, nor is dairy, sugar, or refined foods of any kind. The paleo diet has been shown to support efforts for those who follow it, mostly due to the significant reduction in carbs. . (that’s the low-glycemic index diet) involves eating foods that take longer to break down into sugar in your bloodstream. It was created specifically to help people with diabetes manage their blood sugar. The rules are simple: Eat foods that have a glycemic index of less than 55. — Smiling Through the Sadness?

Now you can gain access to these resources too. The following are individual success stories and the results may vary. We briefly explore the pros and cons to this very popular diet as well as what we recommend here at Cederquist Medical You can probably name at least one person in your social circle who has tried the “keto” diet. In this article, we’ll explore what it is, review some pros and cons, and summarize what we here at Cederquist Medical Wellness Center recommend. The “keto” diet, A.K.A “ketogenic” diet is a way of eating that incorporates high amounts of fat, moderate protein, and very low amounts of carbohydrates. It was first designed in the 1920s as a way to help treat and manage epilepsy, but in the last 15 years has gained massive popularity with the weight-loss crowd. The purpose of the ketogenic diet is to mimic our bodies’ response to fasting by significantly reducing the amount of carbohydrates available and increasing the amount of dietary fat. This fat will then be converted into something called ketone bodies, which will be the main source of fuel - this is known as “being in ketosis”. Our body will use these ketone bodies as its primary source of energy, thus creating a convenient system of inputs and outputs - the input being fat for energy and the output being weight loss. . The ketogenic allows you to consume foods that are high in fat. These foods take longer to break down, increase satiety, and therefore help you stay full longer. It is important to focus on the quality of the fats you eat, however, as not all fats are created equal. .  While this may be true, if you take medication for blood sugar and diabetes it’s important to talk to your doctor before making changes to your carbohydrate intake as your dosage of medications may need adjustment to prevent hypoglycemia.   .  High triglycerides are directly linked to an increased intake in simple carbohydrates, alcohol or sugary beverages. When we remove these food items from our diet, our triglyceride levels can drastically decrease. .  As mentioned previously, the ketogenic diet was first developed for the treatment of epilepsy and continues to show promising results. It has also been shown to be helpful for those with Type 2 Diabetes, morbid obesity and some research even shows it being helpful for Alzheimer’s Disease. However, it is not for everyone and it’s important to consult your doctor or a health care professional who understands your biology and metabolism. .  Due to the fact that the keto diet is very restrictive, some people find it hard to stick to and maintain longer term. .  Because of the restrictions on the amount of fresh fruits, whole grains, legumes, and many vegetables, people on the keto diet miss out on many important vitamins and minerals.  The high-fat nature of the keto diet can leave people feeling very full on small portions, risking calorie depletion and unintentional weight loss. .  To meet fat content needs, people often resort to ingesting processed, high-calorie foods containing lots of sodium as well as saturated and trans fats. .  People on the keto diet frequently do not get enough fiber which can lead to constipation. .  Elevated ketone levels within the body is also known to cause bad breath. Because of the restrictions a keto diet imposes as well as the potential risks, we at Cederquist Medical Wellness Center do not generally recommend keto diets to our patients. Each of us is different genetically and metabolically, so we take a scientific approach by analyzing each patient’s medical history, blood chemistry, metabolism, activity level, age, and how they feel.  This information allows us to customize a plan that will work best for each individual.  We find that most people lose a proper amount of weight through a balance of fat, protein, and carbohydrates and are more apt to keep it off long-term.  Here are a few general tips that may help you in your wellness journey as you decide what's best for you: Avoid saturated fats, trans fats, and processed foods. Choose healthy fats such as olive oil, nuts, seeds, salmon, avocado, etc. Make sure to include quality, lean proteins such as chicken breast, turkey and white fish. The quality of what you eat matters! Adjust your carbohydrate intake to a level that’s right for you and your metabolism. This depends on your metabolism and how active you are.

d7dc887d-5482-484a-a4cf-62b9f47187a3,"The ketogenic or simply keto diet is a low-carb, high-fat and moderate-protein diet. It affords many health benefits, including weight loss, blood sugar control and longevity (, , ). A common goal of people on the keto diet is to achieve ketosis, a natural state in which your body burns fat for fuel. However, it can be difficult to determine whether your diet needs adjusting to reach and maintain ketosis. This article explains how to use keto strips to measure ketosis and how to reach this state through a ketogenic diet. If you follow a standard high-carb diet, your cells use glucose as their main energy source, which comes from the carbs in your diet, including sugars and starchy foods like bread, pasta and vegetables. But if you limit or avoid these foods — such as when you’re on a — your body doesn’t have enough glucose to meet its energy needs. This means it must look for alternative fuel sources. Your body does this by breaking down stored fat into fatty acids and ketones. These ketones replace glucose and supply most of the energy your brain needs, resulting in a physiological state called dietary ketosis (). Being in dietary ketosis increases your ketone levels, which are detectable in your breath, urine and blood (). When you restrict or limit carbs from your diet, your body produces ketones from fat, resulting in the physiological state of ketosis. If you want to , urine strips are a cheap and convenient way of finding out. They were originally developed for people with type 1 diabetes to determine if they’re at immediate risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, a potentially life-threatening condition (). You can purchase urine strip kits over-the-counter at your local pharmacy and supermarket, as well as online. They’re relatively inexpensive and can contain from 50 to several hundred strips. The strips typically expire within three to six months after opening, so keep in mind how often you intend to use them (). If you want to check your urine ketones day-to-day, stick with a specific time, like in the morning or several hours after your last meal of the day, for best comparison (). The process of using keto strips looks like this: Wash your hands, then take a urine sample in a small container. Immerse the absorptive end of the strip into the sample for a few seconds, then remove. Wait for the amount of time outlined on the package for the strip to change color. Compare the strip with the color chart on the packaging. Dispose of the urine and strip in an appropriate manner before washing your hands. The color corresponds to the concentration of ketones in your urine, which can range from no ketones to high concentrations. The darker the color, the higher your ketone levels. Urine strips are an easy and convenient way to measure ketosis. Follow the directions on the kit for the most accurate results. Ketone blood meters are a reliable and accurate way to measure the ketones in your body (, , ). Originally designed for people with type 1 diabetes, they also appeal to those following a ketogenic diet as a more accurate way to measure ketosis (). You can usually find blood strips at any place that carries urine strips. However, you will need a meter to read the blood strips as well. Many blood glucose readers will also read blood keto strips, even though the glucose strips are different from the keto strips. Blood strips cost on average $1 per strip and typically last 12–18 months before they expire — much longer than urine strips (, ). Load the lancet with the needle, following the directions provided. Insert a blood ketone strip into the ketone meter. Prick your finger to draw a small drop of blood using the lancet. Let the strip come in contact with the drop of blood and check the results. Dispose of the strip and lancet as suggested in the directions. A preferable blood level of ketones for is 0.5 – 3 mmol/L (9 – 54 mcg/dl) (). Measuring the ketones in your blood is a more accurate but also more expensive way of measuring ketosis. Urine strips are a good tool to measure whether you’re in ketosis during the first few weeks of going keto. During this time, your body can’t use ketones efficiently for energy, and so you urinate many of them out (). But as you get deeper into ketosis, your body adapts to using ketones for fuel and becomes more optimized in producing them, leaving less unused (). In other words, if you’ve been in a keto-adapted state for many months, a keto strip may indicate that your urine contains only trace amounts of ketones, if any. This can mislead people into thinking they’re no longer in ketosis, which may not be the case (). Nonetheless, using urine strips when you’re is an easy and affordable way to see if your ketone levels are rising. On the other hand, if you’ve followed a ketogenic diet for several months and want a more accurate picture of your ketone levels, blood keto strips are a more suitable option (). However, it’s important to consider the higher price of the blood strips and whether you want to prick your finger every time you measure your ketone levels. Urine keto strips can help you determine if you’re in ketosis, but possibly not on the long run. If you want a more accurate reading, blood keto strips are a better option. For healthy individuals, it can take several days on a keto diet to go into ketosis and a few more weeks thereafter to become keto-adapted (). A keto diet is high in fat, moderate in protein and very low in carbs. Some people mistake the keto diet for being low in carbs and high in protein. But consuming too much protein will not allow your body to enter ketosis (). More specifically, the diet allows 65-90% of calories from fat, 10-30% from protein and less than 5% from carbs. For comparison, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that people get (): Usually, consuming less than 50 grams of carbs per day will . That being said, everyone is different — some people may need to eat less while others can get away with more (). If you’re new to the keto diet and want to make sure your diet is on track, urine strips can be a useful tool. A keto diet is a high-fat, low-carb and moderate-protein diet. It takes several days for your body to enter ketosis and several weeks thereafter to adapt to using ketones for fuel. Ketone strips have become increasingly popular as a way for people following a keto diet to check whether they’re in ketosis. There are two types of keto strips: urine and blood. Urine strips are ideal if you’re new to the keto diet and want an easy and affordable way to ensure you’re headed towards ketosis. Once your body has become keto-adapted, blood strips are more accurate but also more expensive. In either case, the strips can help you monitor and adjust your diet accordingly to get into and maintain a level of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that can be caused by a low-carb or ketogenic diet. Here are 10 signs and symptoms that you're in ketosis. Ketogenic diets have many powerful health benefits, but some people have trouble getting into ketosis. Here are 7 effective tips to get into ketosis.

If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. The ketogenic diet (or keto diet, for short) is a low carb, high fat diet that offers many health benefits. In fact, many studies show that this type of diet can help you lose weight and improve your health (). Ketogenic diets may even have benefits against diabetes, cancer, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s disease (, , , ). Here is a detailed beginner’s guide to the keto diet. The ketogenic diet is a very low carb, high fat diet that shares many similarities with the and diets. It involves drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat. This reduction in carbs puts your body into a metabolic state called . When this happens, your body becomes incredibly efficient at for energy. It also turns fat into in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain (). Ketogenic diets can cause significant reductions in blood sugar and insulin levels. This, along with the increased ketones, has some health benefits (, , ). The keto diet is a low carb, high fat diet. It lowers blood sugar and insulin levels and shifts the body’s metabolism away from carbs and toward fat and ketones. There are several versions of the ketogenic diet, including: This is a very low carb, moderate protein and high fat diet. It typically contains 70% fat, 20% protein, and only 10% carbs (). This diet involves periods of higher carb refeeds, such as 5 ketogenic days followed by 2 high carb days. This diet allows you to add carbs around workouts. This is similar to a standard ketogenic diet, but includes more . The ratio is often 60% fat, 35% protein, and 5% carbs. However, only the standard and high protein ketogenic diets have been studied extensively. Cyclical or targeted ketogenic diets are more advanced methods and primarily used by bodybuilders or athletes. The information in this article mostly applies to the standard ketogenic diet (SKD), although many of the same principles also apply to the other versions. There are several versions of the keto diet. The standard (SKD) version is the most researched and most recommended. is a metabolic state in which your body uses fat for fuel instead of carbs. It occurs when you significantly reduce your consumption of carbohydrates, limiting your body’s supply of glucose (sugar), which is the main source of energy for the cells. Following a ketogenic diet is the most effective way to enter ketosis. Generally, this involves limiting carb consumption to around 20 to 50 grams per day and filling up on fats, such as meat, fish, eggs, nuts, and healthy oils (). It’s also important to moderate your protein consumption. This is because protein can be converted into glucose if consumed in high amounts, which may slow your transition into ketosis (). Practicing could also help you enter ketosis faster. There are many different forms of intermittent fasting, but the most common method involves limiting food intake to around 8 hours per day and fasting for the remaining 16 hours ().

Diabetes Self-Management offers over 900 diabetes friendly recipes to choose from including desserts, low-carb pasta dishes, savory main meals, grilled options and more. , ketosis, ketoacidosis, …these are words that you’ve probably heard at one point or another, and you might be wondering what they mean and if you need to worry about them at all, especially if you have diabetes. This week, we’ll explore the mysterious world of ketones, including if and how they may affect you. Ketones are a type of acid that the body can form if there’s not enough carbohydrate to be burned for energy (yes, you do need carbs for fuel). Without enough carb, the body turns to another energy source: fat. Ketones are made in the liver from fat breakdown. This is called ketogenesis. People who don’t have diabetes can form ketones. This might occur if a person does extreme exercise, has an eating disorder, is fasting (not eating), or is following a . This is called ketosis and it’s a normal response to starvation. In a person who has diabetes, ketones form for the same reason (not enough carb for energy), but this often occurs because there isn’t enough insulin available to help move carb (in the form of glucose) from the bloodstream to the cells to be used for energy. Again, the body scrambles to find an alternate fuel source in the form of fat. You might be thinking that it’s a good thing to burn fat for fuel. However, for someone who has diabetes, ketosis can quickly become dangerous if it occurs due to a continued lack of insulin (the presence of ketones along with is not necessarily a cause for concern). In the absence of insulin (which can occur if someone doesn’t take their insulin or perhaps uses an insulin pump and the pump has a malfunction, for example), fat cells continue to release fat into the circulation; the liver then continues to churn out ketones. Remember that ketones are acids. These ketones lower the pH (a measure of acidity) of the blood, making it too acidic and potentially leading to a very dangerous and possibly life-threatening situation. People who have are at risk for DKA, and, less commonly, so are people with . This doesn’t mean they will get DKA — they just need to be sure to take their insulin as prescribed and follow their treatment plan. DKA is a very serious medical condition that requires immediate attention. As ketone levels climb in the blood, the body becomes more “acidic.” Normally, the body stays at a certain pH. With DKA, the pH is lowered, leading to a state of metabolic acidosis. As I mentioned earlier, DKA can occur in the absence of sufficient insulin. In fact, DKA is sometimes the first symptom that a person with Type 1 diabetes has — before they’re actually diagnosed. But it can also occur as a result of a severe infection, illness, or dehydration, too. If DKA is not treated, it can lead to coma and even death. DKA can come on quickly (often within 24 hours), so it’s important to know the signs and symptoms. : • Excessive thirst • Frequent urination • Nausea and vomiting • Abdominal pain • Confusion • Weakness and fatigue • Shortness of breath • Fruity-smelling breath In addition to the above symptoms, you will likely have high blood sugar levels (above 250 mg/dl) and positive urine ketones. If your blood sugar levels are running high and you have ketones in your urine, call your doctor right away. If you have any of the above symptoms, head to your local emergency room, as you need to be treated immediately. DKA is treated in the hospital with a combination of fluids, electrolytes, and insulin, with the immediate goal of getting your blood chemistry back into a safe range. Depending on the cause of DKA, you may need antibiotics or other types of treatment, as well. Talk with your doctor or about testing for ketones. If you have Type 1 diabetes, you need to know how to do this. Most people who have Type 2 diabetes don’t need to check for ketones, since DKA is rare in this group. However, you may, particularly if you take both mealtime (fast-acting) and long-acting insulin. It’s best to talk with your doctor or diabetes educator to find out. • Using urine ketone strips • Using a meter that checks for blood ketones Urine ketone strips are more commonly used. You can purchase a bottle or box of these without a prescription at your local pharmacy. The strips are easy to use, and directions are provided on the package. The result may be negative, or may show trace, small, moderate, or large amounts of ketones. Typically, you should call your doctor if you have moderate or large amounts of ketones in your urine. Some blood glucose meters have the ability of measuring ketones in the blood. If you have one of these meters, you will need to use ketone test strips, not your blood glucose test strips. The meter’s user’s manual will provide instructions on how to test your blood for ketones and how to interpret the results. • Your blood sugar is greater than 250 for two checks in a row. • You are sick, have an infection, or have an injury. • You are planning to exercise and your blood sugar is above 250. • You are pregnant. You should check for ketones every morning before you eat and when your blood sugar is over 250. Again, talk with your doctor so that you’re clear on when the best times are for you to check for ketones. Prevention is always the best policy when it comes to DKA, and involves: • Taking your insulin as prescribed. If you don’t think your doses are correct, check with your doctor or diabetes educator. • Following the other aspects of your diabetes treatment plan, including your meal plan and exercise plan. • Checking your blood sugar regularly and more often if you are sick, injured, or exercising. • You’ll need to check your blood sugar frequently, too, if you use an insulin pump. Also, if you wear a pump, check your tubing for air bubbles, insulin leaks, and any other signs that insulin delivery has been interrupted. • Making sure insulin hasn’t expired or “gone bad” from being kept in a hot or cold environment. • Keeping your blood sugars and within your target range.

d093a04d-ecf8-4fd8-a4ca-e717aa6b5127,"— The ketogenic, or keto, diet is a high fat, moderate protein, and very low carb diet that’s used to manage various medical conditions, including epilepsy, obesity, and diabetes (). Given that it’s very carb restrictive, many people wonder whether high carb foods like sweet potatoes can still be included within the parameters of a ketogenic dietary pattern. This article explores whether you can still enjoy sweet potatoes while following a keto diet. One of the primary goals of a ketogenic diet is to facilitate your body’s . Ketosis is a metabolic state in which your body relies on energy produced from fat — instead of carbs — to carry out all of its essential functions. When you consume a varied diet, your body defaults to using glucose — a type of carb — as its primary fuel source. But when carbs are unavailable, your body makes energy from fat-derived compounds called ketones (). Your body’s ability to maintain ketosis is dependent upon a lack of dietary carbohydrates. If you consume too many carbs, your body reverts to using glucose for energy, thereby throwing you out of ketosis. This is why many types of high carb foods, including starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes, are usually considered on a ketogenic diet. However, the extent to which a person needs to limit their total carb intake to maintain ketosis can vary. Most people following a ketogenic diet limit their carb intake to no more than 5–10% of their daily calorie needs, or a maximum of 50 grams of carbs per day (). Precisely where you fall on that spectrum depends on how readily your body moves into and out of ketosis. Keeping your carb intake very low is essential for maintaining ketosis when following a keto diet. This is why many people opt to exclude sweet potatoes from keto meal plans. A sweet potato is a type of starchy root vegetable that’s often excluded from ketogenic diets because of its naturally high carb content. However, with proper planning, some people may still be able to successfully incorporate small portions of sweet potato into a keto diet plan. A medium-sized sweet potato (150 grams) contains a total of 26 grams of carbs. After subtracting the 4 grams that come from fiber, you’re left with a of roughly 21 grams of carbs per potato (). If you’re on a keto diet that limits you to 50 grams of carbs per day, you could opt to expend approximately 42% of your carbs on a whole sweet potato if you want to. You may also consider dividing the sweet potato into smaller portions to further reduce your carb intake without having to exclude it from your diet entirely. That said, if you’re on a diet plan that requires you to stick to a much lower carb limit, even a very small portion of sweet potato could make it considerably more difficult to stay within your allotted carbs for the day. Ultimately, whether you should include sweet potatoes in your diet depends on your and ability to consistently adhere to the restrictions required for you to maintain ketosis. Sweet potatoes are fairly high in carbs, but some people may be able to include small portions of them while staying within their keto carb restrictions. Certain preparations may be more keto-friendly than others If you decide to include sweet potatoes as part of your keto diet plan, it’s important that you also consider how various preparation methods may affect the total carb content of the final dish. For instance, sweet potatoes prepared with very high carb ingredients, such as brown sugar, maple syrup, or fruit juices would be inappropriate for a ketogenic diet. Preparation methods that are more keto-friendly may include thinly slicing and frying them to make sweet potato fries, or roasting them whole and serving them with butter, , or melted cheese. Certain sweet potato preparation methods are not keto-friendly, especially those that utilize high carb ingredients like brown sugar or maple syrup. are characterized by their high fat and very low carb contents. Sweet potatoes tend to be naturally high in carbs and are typically excluded from keto diet plans because they can make it difficult for many people to maintain ketosis. That said, you may not have to eliminate sweet potatoes from your diet, as long as you moderate your intake and plan ahead to ensure they don’t cause you to overconsume carbs for the day. When creating your diet plan, avoid sweet potato preparations that include high carb ingredients like brown sugar or maple syrup.

Diabetes Self-Management offers over 900 diabetes friendly recipes to choose from including desserts, low-carb pasta dishes, savory main meals, grilled options and more. People with diabetes, particularly those with , have been at least vaguely aware of the word for a long time. With the recent resurgence of popular interest in , however, just about everyone seems to be talking about ketones these days. But does anyone really know what ketones are? Are they a danger to your health (as in ), or a sign that you have lowered your carbohydrate intake enough to cause weight loss (as some people who follow low-carbohydrate diets believe)? Ketones are end-products of fat metabolism in the body. That is, they are formed when fat is burned for energy by the muscles. Chemically, they are acids known as and there are three types: beta-hydroxybutyric acid, aceto-acetic acid, and acetone. But you don’t have to be a chemist to understand what role they play in the body. To get to know ketones, it’s helpful to understand how your body burns fuel. A simple analogy is that of an automobile. For a car engine to run, the engine must burn fuel (gasoline), and when the fuel is burned, exhaust (carbon monoxide) is created. The carbon monoxide is the end-product of gasoline combustion. Your body also has an engine that must burn fuel to operate. The engine is muscle, and the fuel is fat, carbohydrate (glucose) and, in certain conditions, protein. When fat is burned, the “exhaust” is ketones, and when glucose is burned, the “exhaust” is lactic acid. Fat is more desirable as a fuel than glucose because there are more calories in a gram of fat (9 calories per gram) than there are in a gram of glucose (4 calories per gram), so you get more energy per gram of fat burned. In a sense, you could call fat a high-test fuel. But there is one catch to burning fat: To burn it efficiently, with little “exhaust,” you have to burn glucose at the same time. If you don’t have glucose available for fuel (because you are on a low-carbohydrate diet, for example), you will form ketones when your muscles burn fat. For most people, the ketones that form as a normal product of fat burning and weight loss are nothing to be concerned about because they are simply burned for energy by the body, and any excess are passed out of the body in the urine. In fact, while the brain normally uses glucose for energy, during — and particularly during long-distance events like marathons, when glucose reserves may drop very low — the brain can use ketones for energy. Your liver makes extra ketones when glucose reserves are low so that your brain has enough energy. For people with Type 1 diabetes, however, having measurable amounts of ketones in the urine or blood is cause for concern. Ketones in a person with Type 1 diabetes may be a sign that his diabetes is out of control, he is ill or has an infection or he is under extreme stress. Because above-normal levels of ketones in the blood can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening condition, people with Type 1 diabetes who have measurable ketones in their blood or urine should speak with their or doctor promptly. Low-carbohydrate diets are sometimes called “ketotic” diets because they cause the body to burn mostly fat for energy (since the intake of carbohydrate is so low), which in turn causes the formation of ketones. Some people who follow low-carbohydrate diets periodically test their urine for ketones to see if fat-burning is indeed taking place. However, people who are losing weight on any diet might have a trace of ketones in their urine since a person who is losing weight is almost certainly burning and losing fat. With all the talk of ketones, some people have the mistaken impression that ketones are a sort of magic bullet that melt fat from the body, no matter how much a person eats. That’s simply not the case. Ketones are only by-products of the metabolism of fat and are markers that show that you are burning fat. They have no active role in burning fat or weight loss. In fact, ketone levels in people who are on low-carbohydrate diets are just barely above baseline, indicating they have no role in producing weight loss. The reason people lose weight on low-carbohydrate diets is not because of ketones; it’s because they have cut out a large food group from what they eat, and as a result, they end up eating fewer calories. Another unproven belief about both ketones and low-carbohydrate diets is that they suppress appetite, and that’s why people lose weight. Some scientists believe that the excess fat a person eats while on a low-carbohydrate diet has a satiating effect, causing people to eat less. Other experts believe that an elevated level of ketones causes a decrease in appetite, while still others believe that a high protein intake suppresses appetite. There are some studies in rats to suggest that elevated levels of protein during low-carbohydrate diets can cause a decrease in appetite, but so far, research on the effect of ketones and fat on appetite is inconclusive. The jury is still out on the long-term safety and effectiveness of diets that are low in carbohydrates for the general population, although some nephrologists link a growing incidence of kidney stones to high-protein diets. (Low-carbohydrate diets tend to be high in protein.) Most diabetes experts, however, agree that a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet is not worth the risk for people with diabetes because they have a high risk of developing , and a high protein intake can be stressful on the kidneys in those with kidney disease. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure in the United States, accounting for approximately 43 percent of all Americans who start treatment for kidney failure each year. According to Joslin Diabetes Center, as much as 40 percent of people with Type 1 diabets and 20 percent to 30 percent of people with have . You may find it easier to control your blood glucose if you severely restrict your carbohydrate intake, but keep in mind that even in people without kidney disease, no one knows the effects of a high-protein diet on the kidneys over the long term. If you’re considering a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet for weight loss or blood glucose control, check with your doctor or diabetes educator first. During exercise, both fat and glucose are burned for fuel by the muscles. If your glucose stores are low, fat will be your body’s primary fuel. If you exercise and burn lots of fat without glucose, you will make ketones. People who are very lean and efficient at burning fat, people who are losing weight, and people who do lots of endurance exercise (like training for a marathon) use up their stores of glucose rather quickly, and when they do, they frequently develop ketones in the blood. The type of ketone they develop is acetone, and it’s not unusual for their breath to smell fruity or like alcohol as the acetone leaves the body through their breath. For people with diabetes, exercise typically lowers blood glucose. But sometimes exercise can raise blood glucose. This can happen when you are low on insulin. As you exercise, your liver converts stored glycogen into glucose to use for energy and pumps it into your bloodstream. If there’s little insulin available, your muscles can’t use the glucose and your blood glucose level will rise. If you have even a trace of ketones when you begin your exercise and your blood glucose rises as you exercise, the amount of ketones in your blood may rise as well, particularly if you have Type 1 diabetes. Although diabetic ketoacidosis as a result of exercise is very rare, it is possible, so precautions need to be taken. The American Diabetes Association guidelines for exercise, blood glucose, and ketones are as follows: • People with Type 1 diabetes should avoid exercise if blood glucose levels are greater than 250 mg/dl and ketones are present. • They should use caution if blood glucose levels are greater than 300 mg/dl and ketones are not present. • People with Type 2 diabetes should avoid exercise if blood glucose levels are above 400 mg/dl. If your blood glucose level is higher than 250 mg/dl, you do not have ketones in your blood or urine, and you want to exercise, I recommend starting your workout then stopping after 15 minutes to see if your blood glucose level is rising or dropping. If it’s dropping, it’s OK to continue exercising. If it’s rising, you should stop exercising and follow your doctor’s recommendations for treating high blood glucose. As stated earlier, for most people, ketones are nothing to worry about. But when you have diabetes, particularly Type 1 diabetes, they may signal that your diabetes is out of control. Your body may make ketones when you are sick, have an infection, are injured, or are experiencing high levels of stress. They can appear in your urine () and in your blood (). The problem with high levels of ketones is that they are relatively strong acids, and because of their acidity, their presence in the blood can reduce the ability of oxygen to bind to hemoglobin, the molecule that transports oxygen to cells that need it. That means muscles and other organs might not function as well as they should. In addition, high levels of ketones for people with Type 1 diabetes can lead to dehydration and diabetic ketoacidosis (sometimes called DKA). Diabetic ketoacidosis is rarely seen in people with Type 2 diabetes because their pancreases usually still produce some insulin, which means that the body is able to burn some glucose. People with Type 1 diabetes have most likely been asked by a doctor or diabetes educator to test their urine for ketones at one time or another. x make it possible to check blood levels of ketones at home. Two other home analyzers, the CardioChek and the CardioChek/PA (which also measure blood cholesterol levels), can also measure blood ketone levels. It’s a good idea to review ketone testing guidelines with your doctor or diabetes educator, but here are some general guidelines for who should test and when: • People with Type 1 diabetes whose blood glucose level is over 250 mg/dl for two readings in a row or who are sick should always test for ketones. • Pregnant women with diabetes are usually advised to check their urine for ketones every morning before eating and additionally if their blood glucose level is above 200 mg/dl or if they are ill. • People with diabetes who are ill. ( can cause sudden high blood glucose levels.) • Most adults with Type 2 diabetes don’t need to worry about ketones, but check with your doctor or diabetes educator for specific instructions. • Most of the time, children with Type 2 diabetes don’t need to check for ketones, but ask your doctor, especially if your child experiences unexplained weight loss or his blood glucose level consistently remains over 200 mg/dl. Ketones are usually tested with urine test strips, which change color based on the presence and concentration of ketones in the urine. The results are usually expressed as “negative,” “trace,” “small,” “moderate” or “large.” If the test result is positive, you should call your doctor or diabetes educator. You may need to take extra insulin, and your health-care provider will instruct you on how much. You should also drink lots of water or other calorie-free beverages to flush out excess ketones, continue to check your blood glucose level every three hours, and continue to test for ketones if your blood glucose level is over 250 mg/dl. If you are losing weight, you may have a small amount of ketones in your urine. This is OK for people with Type 2 diabetes, as long as their blood glucose level is in a normal range, but people with Type 1 diabetes should check with their doctor. The mild ketosis (the presence of small amounts of ketones in the body) that occurs in people on low-carbohydrate diets should not be confused with the life-threatening levels of ketosis that someone who has Type 1 diabetes can develop. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious medical emergency that requires immediate medical attention. The Foracare Fora 6 Connect, Foracare Test N’ Go Advance, Foracare Test N’ Go Advance Voice and Nova Max Plus meters can measure ketones in your blood with special strips that take a fingerstick blood sample, just like the procedure for blood glucose monitoring. Blood testing for ketones is superior to urine testing because it measures beta-hydroxybutyric acid, the primary ketone that’s formed in diabetic ketoacidosis, while urine testing measures acetoacetic acid. Urine testing can lead to a false negative result (which means it might show negative ketones when in fact you do have ketones), and there is a time delay to diagnosis of ketosis with urine testing since it takes some time for ketones to get from the blood to the urine. Another possible advantage to blood ketone testing is convenience. In a study of teenagers with Type 1 diabetes, teens preferred and were more likely to test their blood for ketones than they were to test their urine. Here’s what the results mean when testing blood for ketones: • Greater than 3.0 millimoles per liter (mmol/liter) is a serious metabolic condition and emergency medical care is necessary. • 1.6–3.0 mmol/liter is a high level of ketones and means you are at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis. Your doctor or diabetes educator should be contacted immediately. • 0.6–1.5 mmol/liter is a moderate level of ketones and probably indicates fat metabolism and weight loss, but not a deficiency of insulin. You should speak with your doctor or diabetes educator about what to do when ketones are in this range. • Below 0.6 mmol/liter is a normal blood level of ketones. While low-carbohydrate diets are usually discussed as tools for weight loss, that is not their only role. So-called ketogenic diets (diets that intentionally cause ketosis) have been used to treat epileptic seizures in children since the 1920s. The diets, which do not work in adults, are high in fat, low in protein, and virtually carbohydrate-free. The precise mechanism of how ketones work to prevent epilepsy is unknown, but for some children with difficult cases of epilepsy that do not fully respond to medication, the ketogenic diet is another treatment option. There are several centers in the United States that provide the diet. You can find out more at the following website: Ketogenic diets are also being tested for treatment of Parkinson disease. Some evidence suggests that ketones in the brain may help resolve some of the symptoms that people with Parkinson disease experience. Like epilepsy, the mechanism of action has not been discovered, and much more work needs to be done in this area. Understanding how your body works — and why it sometimes breaks down — puts you in the driver’s seat when it comes to your health and diabetes care.

According to the  in the UK, on an average, people get half their energy from carbs.  But following keto diet in the long run leads to nutritional deficiencies as it makes you cut down on carbs completely. This leads to various health issues including keto flu. Well, while it looks like a magic wand for all the weight issues that you have been complaining of so far, remember, keto diet isn’t designed to be followed on a long-term basis. ? To put it simply, this is a high-fat, low-carb diet which existed even a century ago (the name didn’t, of course!). Originally created for people with diabetes and epilepsy back then, ketogenic diet re-emerged as a weapon against weight loss in the 21st century when researchers found that it had a similar effect on the body as fasting. As you fast, your body resorts to the fat reserves in your liver for energy. When your body is without food it breaks down your stored liver fat into something called ketone bodies and burns them for energy. This process is known as ketosis. A Ketogenic Diet takes your body into this state of ketosis by curbing your carbohydrate intake. Sounds vague? Here is how it works: When you load up on carbs, the glucose in your blood increases, and as a result, your insulin levels also soar up. Insulin, in turn, prevents the fat that you eat, from entering your bloodstream. So, when you starve your body of carbohydrates, your insulin levels drop, and the fats that you consume get into the bloodstream, heading straight to the liver.  Depleted of glucose, the easiest source of energy, your body breaks down the fat stored in your liver in order to keep going. A standard Keto Diet is composed of 75-80 per cent fat, 15-20 per cent protein and 5 per cent carbohydrate. To put things in perspective, most of our diets consist of 55 per cent carbohydrates, 30 per cent fat, and 15 per cent protein.

c3884848-b0d3-447b-8278-43403241a9ff,"Vegan Keto Diet Guide: Benefits, Foods and Sample Menu The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carb, moderate-protein diet promoted for its powerful effects on weight loss and overall health. Though often associated with animal foods, this way of eating can be adapted to fit plant-based meal plans — including vegan diets. Vegan diets exclude all animal products, making it more difficult to eat low-carb. However, with careful planning, vegans can reap the potential benefits of a ketogenic diet. This article explains what to eat and avoid on a vegan keto diet and provides a one-week vegan keto menu. The ketogenic diet is low in carbs, high in fat and moderate in protein. Carbs are typically reduced to 20 to 50 grams per day to reach and maintain — a metabolic process in which your body burns fat for fuel instead of glucose (, ). Since this way of eating is composed mostly of fat — generally around 75% of your intake — keto dieters often turn to high-fat animal products, such as meats, butter and full-fat dairy. However, those who eat plant-based diets, including , can follow a ketogenic diet as well. People on a vegan diet consume only plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits and grains, and avoid animal-based foods like meat, poultry, eggs and dairy. Vegans can reach ketosis by relying on high-fat, plant-based products like coconut oil, avocados, seeds and nuts. The vegan keto diet is a low-carb, high-fat, moderate-protein diet that excludes all animal-based foods. Several health benefits are and ketogenic diets. However, no studies focus specifically on vegan keto diets. Following a vegan diet has been shown to lower the risk of chronic health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers. For example, studies have observed that vegans have a 75% lower risk of developing high blood pressure and up to a 78% risk reduction of type 2 diabetes (). What’s more, vegans tend to weigh less than non-vegans, and those who adopt vegan diets are more successful at losing weight than people who eat animal products (). A review of 12 studies found that over 18 weeks, people who followed vegan diets lost an average of 5.5 pounds (2.52 kg) more than participants on non-vegetarian diets (). Like the vegan diet, research has shown that following the high-fat, low-carb ketogenic diet may . The keto diet is well known for its effectiveness in weight loss, blood sugar control and reduced heart disease risk factors. A study in 58 obese children and teens showed that participants following a ketogenic diet lost significantly more weight and fat mass than those on a low-calorie diet. In addition, the keto diet significantly raised levels of adiponectin, a protein involved in blood sugar regulation and fat metabolism (). Higher levels of adiponectin have been associated with better blood sugar control, reduced inflammation and a lower risk of obesity-related diseases, including heart disease (, ). Ketogenic diets have also been shown to reduce heart disease risk factors, including high triglycerides, blood pressure and “bad” LDL cholesterol (). Being that both vegan and ketogenic diets may benefit your health in similar ways, it’s likely that combining the two by following a vegan keto diet would positively impact health as well. Both vegan and ketogenic diets have been linked to health benefits, including weight loss and a lower risk of heart disease and diabetes. When following a vegan keto diet, you must significantly reduce your carb intake and replace carbs with healthy fats and vegan sources of protein. Animal products, including eggs, meat, poultry, dairy and seafood, are excluded on a vegan keto diet. Here are examples of foods that should be completely avoided: Whey protein, honey, egg white protein. Here are examples of foods that should be significantly reduced: Cereal, bread, baked goods, rice, pasta, grains. Sweet tea, soda, juice, smoothies, sports drinks, chocolate milk. Brown sugar, white sugar, agave, maple syrup. Potatoes, sweet potatoes, winter squash, beets, peas. Black beans, chickpeas, kidney beans. All should be limited. However, small portions of certain fruits like berries are allowed. Beer, sweetened cocktails, wine. Low-fat foods tend to be high in added sugar. Barbecue sauce, sweetened salad dressings, marinades. Limit packaged foods and increase whole, unprocessed foods. The level of carbohydrate restriction when following a vegan keto diet varies depending on your health goals and individual needs. In general, healthy, high-fat vegan foods and should make up the majority of your diet. Animal products, as well as high-carbohydrate foods such as grains, sweetened beverages and starchy vegetables, should be restricted when following a vegan keto diet. When following a vegan keto diet, it’s important to focus on vegan, healthy foods that are high in fat and . Full-fat coconut milk, coconut cream, unsweetened coconut. Olive oil, nut oil, coconut oil, , avocado oil. Almonds, Brazil nuts, walnuts, , chia seeds, macadamia nuts, pumpkin seeds. Peanut butter, almond butter, sunflower butter, cashew butter. , Brussels sprouts, zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, peppers, mushrooms. Coconut yogurt, vegan butter, cashew cheese, vegan cream cheese. Blueberries, blackberries, raspberries and strawberries can be enjoyed in moderation. Nutritional yeast, fresh herbs, lemon juice, salt, pepper, spices. Though the keto diet cuts out many food groups that vegans rely on, such as whole grains and starchy vegetables, a vegan keto diet can be followed with careful planning. Vegan keto dieters should get their calories from whole, unprocessed foods while avoiding highly processed vegan foods. Vegan keto diet foods include non-starchy vegetables, avocados, nuts, seeds, coconut, vegan protein sources and healthy oils. Though the vegan keto diet may seem very restrictive, many meals can be constructed using vegan-friendly ingredients. Following is a one-week sample menu for the vegan keto diet: Keto porridge made with full-fat coconut milk, ground flaxseeds, and unsweetened shredded coconut.

Meals and snacks should be high in healthy fats and low in carbs. While the vegan keto diet may benefit your health, it has some potential drawbacks. Vegan diets tend to be , especially if not carefully planned. Vitamin B12, vitamin D, vitamin K2, zinc, omega-3 fats, iron and calcium are examples of nutrients that some vegan diets lack (, ). Because the vegan keto diet is more restrictive than normal vegan diets, it’s critical that those following it supplement with high-quality vitamins and minerals and plan their meals to ensure a nutritionally adequate diet. Eating fortified foods, focusing on whole-foods and enhancing nutrient availability, for example through fermenting and sprouting, is important for people following a vegan keto diet. However, it may be difficult for vegan keto dieters to meet their micronutrient needs through food alone. with certain vitamins and minerals commonly lacking in vegan diets is a smart way to prevent potential deficiencies and ensure that your daily requirements are met. Transitioning to a ketogenic diet can be difficult. Often referred to as the , the transition period from a higher-carb diet to a keto diet can be challenging on your body. As your body switches from burning glucose to fat for fuel, unpleasant symptoms may occur. Side effects of the vegan keto diet may include (): Staying hydrated, getting enough rest, eating fiber-rich foods and engaging in light activity can help ease keto flu symptoms. What’s more, supplementing with the electrolytes magnesium, sodium and potassium can help reduce certain symptoms, such as muscle aches, headaches and insomnia. As the vegan keto diet restricts many foods, it’s not appropriate for everyone. The vegan keto diet may not be suitable for those with type 1 diabetes, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, athletes or those with eating disorders or a history of disordered eating. If you consider transitioning to a vegan keto diet, consult your doctor or a qualified health professional first to ensure the diet is safe to follow. Low-carb, high-fat diets may not be suitable for pregnant women, children and people with certain medical conditions. If you’re unsure whether the vegan keto diet is the right choice for you, seek advice from your doctor. The high-fat, low-carb vegan keto diet focuses on whole, unprocessed, plant-based foods. Vegan and ketogenic diets have been linked to benefits like weight loss and reduced heart disease and diabetes risks. Certain supplements may be necessary to ensure nutrient needs are met, including iron and vitamins B12 and D. Though research shows that both the vegan diet and the keto diet may benefit your health, studies on the effects of the vegan keto diet are needed to determine if this diet is effective and safe to follow long term.

Although it has benefits as a medical treatment for certain groups of people, there is little evidence to recommend it as a long-term weight loss technique for healthy people. , or ‘carbs’, are an important nutrient. They are an excellent source of energy for the body and brain. Most foods that contain carbohydrates also provide vitamins, minerals and fibre for good bowel health. People on a ketogenic diet eat a very small amount of carbohydrates, a moderate amount of protein and a high amount of fat per day. This means that the body burns fat for fuel, as its main source of fuel and breaks it down into ‘ketone bodies’ (or ‘ketones’) in a process called ketosis. People on a ketogenic diet usually eat only 20 to 50g of carbohydrates per day. As an example, 50g of carbohydrate is equivalent to 2 slices of bread and a banana. Carbs make up about one tenth of daily kilojoule intake in a ketogenic diet (a kilojoule is a measure of how much energy we get from food). This means the person’s body stays in a constant state of ketosis. Evidence shows that the diet may be suitable for some people with certain medical conditions, but there is very limited evidence that healthy people should use it as a long-term diet. Evidence suggests that a ketogenic diet, under the supervision of a doctor or dietitian, is useful for children with who continue to have while on antiepileptic drugs. There is growing interest in its use in cancer, particularly in , although more studies are needed on humans before this can be recommended. For people who have , a ketogenic diet may improve control in the short term. However, the long-term effects are not known, particularly on levels, which increased in some studies. A typical ketogenic diet significantly reduces a person’s intake of rice, pasta, fruit, grains, bread, beans and starchy vegetables such as peas and potatoes. For example, the says that this could restrict you to the carbohydrate levels of only a small tub of yoghurt, a medium-sized potato and one apple a day. Many Australians find it hard to meet the recommended daily intakes of wholegrains, vegetables and fruit a day. The Australian Dietitians Association says that being on a ketogenic diet can make it harder to reach these targets without supplements. A ketogenic diet should always be followed in consultation with your doctor or an accredited practising dietitian, to ensure that you get the right amount and types of fats, fibre and vitamins, as well as minerals like calcium, magnesium, iron and potassium. The ketogenic diet is often promoted for in healthy people. There have been only limited and small studies on the ketogenic diet for weight loss. These studies have shown that the diet has short-term benefits in some people including weight loss and improvements in total cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure, but at one year these effects are about the same as those of conventional weight loss diets. While a ketogenic diet can be fast and effective in the short term, it can be hard to maintain because it’s very limiting. This means a large number of people tend to drop out of the diet, contributing to unhealthy, ‘yo-yo’ dieting behaviour. The key to maintaining a healthy weight in the long-term is an eating pattern that you can sustain over time. It is important to remember that people have different needs, and that no single weight-loss diet suits everyone. A ketogenic diet may be an option for some people who have had difficulty losing weight with other methods, but if you choose to go on a ketogenic diet, it’s best to be under the supervision of a doctor and an accredited practising dietitian.

Harvey is a registered dietitian specializing in the ketogenic diet for children and adults. She is a certified specialist in pediatric nutrition and educates children with epilepsy on the ketogenic diet as an anti-seizure medication. Harvey also manages a private nutrition practice consulting adults on the ketogenic way of eating. There's no denying that the keto diet still reigns as one of the most popular—and highly researched—diets out there right now. But there are two clear sides to the keto debate: There are folks who are for the high-fat lifestyle and those who, well, absolutely aren't. , for example, is clearly a proponent—as is , , and . Jenna, for example, credits the keto diet with her more than 80-pound , while Halle swears that it helps her maintain her health (she has type 2 diabetes). Then there are the people who don't love the diet: , who was on the keto diet for about a month, decided to quit, saying it ""doesn't do anything"" and noting that it made her feel sick (#). And Jillian Michaels last year that people should ""avoid the keto diet—common sense. A balanced diet is key."" Amidst all the positive and negative reviews, though, you may still be a little hazy on the details of the keto diet—like what it is, how it works, and exactly how much butter and cheese you get to eat. Don't worry, I got you. Short for “ketogenic diet,” this eating plan is all about minimizing your carbs and upping your fats to get your body to use fat as a form of energy, says Scott Keatley, RD, of . While everyone's body and needs are slightly different, that typically translates to: That usually means eating no more than 50 grams of carbs a day (some strict keto dieters even opt for just 20 grams a day). After about two to seven days of following the keto diet, you go into something called ketosis, or the state your body enters when it doesn't have enough carbs for your cells to use for energy. That's when you start making ketones, or organic compounds that your bod then uses in place of those missing carbs. At this point, your body also starts burning fat for more energy, says Beth Warren, RD, founder of and author of . So how do you know you're in ketosis? There are a few , like (seriously), or you can use devices like (which you pee on) or to tell you. Believe it or not, the keto diet was originally designed to help people who suffer from seizure disorders—not to help people lose weight, says New York-based RD . That's because both ketones and another chemical produced by the diet, called beta hydroxybutyrate, may help minimize seizures. But people who started following the keto diet noticed weight loss for a few reasons: When you eat carbs, your body retains fluid in order to store carbs for energy (you know, in case it needs it). But when you’re not having much in the carb department, you lose this water weight, says Warren. Also, it's easy to go overboard on carbohydrates—but if you're loading up on fat, it may help curb cravings since it keeps you satisfied. That, plus the fact that ketosis encourages your body to burn fat, means you can end up with pretty dramatic weight loss. While it’s easy to think that the keto diet is one-size fits all, there are actually several different types of keto diets, and they all have different benefits, depending on what your nutritional goals are. “They all have the same gist—super low-carb, high-fat—but they each have their own set of unique guidelines,” says , MS, RD, CDN. Below are the four most common variations of the keto diet. “The cyclic keto diet is similar to standard keto, with the exception of one to two days per week,” explains Rissetto. “Five to six days per week, a cyclic keto dieter will eat according to standard keto guidelines. Then, for one or two days, they will have a ‘carb cycle’—also commonly known as a ‘carb refeed’ day. On this day, they will eat about 140 to 160 grams of carbohydrates.” This type of keto diet is often followed by athletes, since they require a carb refeed day to replenish glycogen stores in their muscles. “High levels of athletic training drains nearly all glycogen from their muscle stores, so it’s necessary to replenish them,” says Rissetto. It’s important to note, though, even if you choose to do this diet, that doesn’t mean your days off should involve tons of processed foods and desserts. Instead, look to whole grains, starchy vegetables, and fruits for your carb intake. “On this diet, you follow all the guidelines of the standard keto diet, with one exception—before intense workouts, you eat carbohydrates,” explains Rissetto. “Typically, targeted keto dieters will consume anywhere from 25 to 50 grams of carbohydrates about 30 minutes to an hour prior to working out. Dieters often find that this helps them feel stronger and more capable during workouts. While this does take the body out of ketosis temporarily, it will resume within a few hours, depending on how many carbs you consumed.” Essentially, the theory behind this diet is that since the additional carbs are immediately burned off, they won’t get stored as body fat. “The vegan keto diet is for individuals who want to follow a high-fat, low-carb diet, but do not consume animal products,” says Rissetto. “This can be difficult to achieve, as many keto dieters rely on animal products for a large portion of their diet. Common protein sources for vegan keto dieters include tofu, tempeh, nuts and nut butters, and beans and legumes in moderate amounts.” Though challenging, a vegan keto diet isn’t impossible—it just takes a lot of advance planning. I also keep seeing offshoots of keto, like lazy keto. Thoughts? When something is popular, it’s pretty much a guarantee that people are going to come up with new or easier ways of doing it. Enter the diets. With lazy keto, people try to limit their carb intake to 20 to 50 grams a day but don’t really track it; with dirty keto, people generally follow the same macronutrient breakdown as ""regular"" keto, but it doesn't matter where those macronutrients come from. Keatley has some…thoughts about those. “Dirty keto is a waste of your time since good habits have not been developed and it is simply too easy to fall back into a high-calorie diet,” he says. If you’re trying to do a lazy keto diet, he recommends following the USDA’s MyPlate instead and monitoring your meals based on proportions vs. macros. “It’s easier, more flexible, and has shown, when combined with moderate exercise, to be effective over the long term,” he says. What’s the deal with combining keto with ? You’ve probably noticed that plenty of people rave about combining keto with fasting diets. Just in case you’re not familiar with intermittent fasting, here’s a : Intermittent fasting centers around a pattern of eating and fasting periods, i.e., times when you don’t eat. This can look different for everybody, but some popular forms of this are the , where you fast for 16 hours (usually from dinnertime until a late breakfast) and eat all your food within an eight-hour span. Another is the , where you eat less than 500 calories for two non-consecutive days a week and then eat normally for the rest of the week. What's With Intermittent Fasting On The Keto Diet? that doing keto along with intermittent fasting is awesome for weight loss, but it’s likely any results you’d see with this would be short-lived. Meaning, when you start eating regularly again, you’ll probably gain the weight back. “Combining a super restrictive diet with long periods of non-eating is not good,” says Keatley. “The body will cannibalize its own muscle for energy if intake from food is too low but the body does not differentiate between something like a calf muscle or a heart muscle. Keep in mind all your important organs are made of smooth muscle and going on a diet like this may harm something like your bladder or lungs just as much as provide fat loss.” The science thus far on IF has been pretty clear that weight loss from intermittent fasting is due to calorie restriction, Keatley points out. And, , just eating less, or healthier in general, usually does the same thing. “You are literally starving” on an intermittent fasting diet, Keatley says. “Methods such as this are attractive as weight loss can go from one pound a week to four pounds, but this is mostly lean muscle which is essential to healthy functioning as you age and is very hard to get back once it is gone,” he adds. So…it’s not really recommended that you try this unless you hash it out with your doctor or nutritionist to make sure it's a fit for you and your lifestyle. Okay, so while there are different versions of keto, let's say you're thinking of following the standard keto diet, for the sake of convenience. Just because you're not eating all your fave carb-y foods, that doesn't mean you're going to go hungry. You'll be loading up on (like olive oil and avocado), along with plenty of like grass-fed beef and chicken, and . (Check out this printable , plus this recommended by nutritionists, to get started.) More good news: Snacks are totally allowed (and I'm not just talking about carrot sticks). There are plenty of packaged options out there designed for keto fans. is one of them. These snack bars have 200 calories, 16 grams of fat, and four grams of net carbs. They're also plant-based and are made with almond or cashew butter, cocoa butter, coconut, pea protein, sunflower seeds, and chia seeds. For coffee drinkers mourning the loss of their vanilla lattes, an option. This is your standard coffee but with grass-fed butter and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) oil added to help give you a boost of healthy fats in the A.M. If you're looking for something to satisfy your sweet tooth, have a solid following. As the name implies, these are little snacks that are high in fat and low in carbs, so you can be on-point with your diet, even when you indulge. And if you can't survive without your pasta, there are out there like Explore Cuisine's organic black bean spaghetti that give you the pasta experience without the carbs. There are also tons of —like , , and —that can allow you to treat yourself to a night out without coming out of ketosis. Because you'll be focusing on fat and protein—and going easy on the carbs—big bowls of pasta (or any grain, really) definitely won't be on your menu. It also means that starchy vegetables like potatoes and carrots, as well as legumes like chickpeas, lentils, and black beans are off-limits, too. Another thing you can't have: sweets—artificial or natural. Candy, cakes, and doughnuts are a no; and even many fruits aren't allowed (apples, bananas, pears—they all have tons of sugar, which is definitely a carb). Alcohol's another grey area on the keto diet—many beers and sugary cocktails are banned on the keto diet, as well as some sweeter wines. Tbh, a lot of keto meals sound pretty decadent and delicious, and it's easy to see how they could be super filling. Below, check out a week’s worth of meal options that all adhere to the standard keto diet guidelines, going low on the carbs, and heavy on fat and protein. It usually takes three to four days for your body to go into ketosis because you have to use up your body's stores of glucose, i.e., sugar first, Keatley says. Any major diet change can give you some, uh, issues, and Keatley says he often sees patients who complain of IBS-like symptoms and feeling wiped out at the beginning of the diet. (The tiredness happens because you have less access to carbs, which give you quick energy, he explains.) Those issues can be part of what's known as the “,” Warren says. Other , all of which are tied to carb withdrawal, can include lightheadedness, nausea, mental fog, cramps, and headaches, in addition to tiredness. Luckily, the keto flu doesn't usually last more than a week—which is coincidentally about when people start to see the number on the scale go down, says Warren. Aside from the typical keto flu complaints, and """" are also common keto diet side effects. I’m dying to know: Will the keto diet help me lose weight? As mentioned, there are a few reasons why the keto diet usually equals weight-loss gold, says Keatley. For starters, people usually reduce their daily caloric intake to about 1,500 calories a day because healthy fats and lean proteins make you feel fuller sooner—and for a longer period of time. And then there’s the fact that it takes more energy to process and burn fat and protein than carbs, so you're burning slightly more calories than you did before. Over time, this can lead to weight loss. Everyone is different, and how much you weigh when you start the diet matters, but you could safely lose around one to two pounds a week on keto, Keatley says. ""It's sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on the individual's caloric needs,"" he adds. Worth noting: The keto diet isn’t a “miracle fat burner,” says Keatley. “The calories in fat are still calories, so working out and keeping total intake at a reasonable level is the only way it works,” he says. “Being on a keto diet but eating more calories than you need will still add fat to your frame.” Can a keto diet help with prediabetes or diabetes? There’s some evidence that it might help with type 2 diabetes. “An is finding that a keto plan may have some real benefits thanks to its ability to improve the body’s ability to use insulin and also help control appetite, which can result in easier weight loss,” says Karen Ansel, RDN, co-author of . If you have diabetes, you'll want to check with your doc before starting a new diet, though. This content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site. Beyond that, experts aren't convinced that the keto diet has any other scientifically proven health benefits. In fact, it may have some distinct downsides. If you follow the keto diet incorrectly, for example (like by eating lots of saturated fats, versus healthy unsaturated fats), you're at risk of raising your cholesterol levels. “The best strategy to keep your heart healthy is to get as much fat as possible from unsaturated sources such as olive, avocado and canola oils, nuts, seeds, avocados, and olives,"" says Ansel. For some people, it's possible to actually improve cholesterol if the fats in their diet are from varied and healthy sources, says Harvey. Also, keep this in mind: “This diet is not going to support good bones, a healthy brain, heart, colon, or gut microbiome,"" says Angelone, and it could lead to plaque in the arteries (which could cause a heart attack or stroke) later on. The keto diet is not easy—or necessarily healthy—to follow over a long period of time (certain types of carbs are good for you!), say both Keatley and Warren. Rissetto also cautions that several populations may not be suitable for the keto diet. “The ketogenic diet is appropriate for people with any stage of pre-existing kidney or liver disease,” she stresses. “The higher protein intake that is typical of the ketogenic diet can put a great deal of added stress on the kidneys. The emphasis on high-fat foods can potentially lead to, or exacerbate, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.” You also shouldn’t be on the diet if you’re pregnant: “Fetal growth depends heavily on glucose from carbohydrates,” says Rissetto. So, a diet low in carbs will impact the growth of the baby. “It's also not advised that people with digestive disorders follow a ketogenic diet,” says Rissetto. “Fiber is an extremely important nutrient for digestive health, and it is common for keto dieters to under-consume this nutrient. Since whole grains and fibrous carb sources are omitted, it’s difficult to get the daily recommended amount—25 to 35 grams—of fiber from non-starchy vegetables alone, as you'd have to consume a very large amount of them.” If you don't fall into any of those groups and you’re interested in following keto for a short period of time, Cording says it’s important to set yourself up for success by making sure you have the right ingredients and tools to make it happen. Overall, if you want to go ahead and try the keto diet on for size—just remember that it's not necessarily a diet you can or should stay on forever.

feca6169-dc56-4108-b3bb-04903d0cc512,"— Medically reviewed by The ketogenic, or keto, diet is a very low carb, high fat eating pattern that has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years. It has been shown to offer several impressive health benefits — including weight loss. Thus, many people turn to this way of eating to reach their weight loss goals. While research indicates that the diet can help shed body fat, long-term studies supporting its effectiveness are lacking. This article reviews the keto diet’s potential to aid weight loss. When following the traditional keto diet, your carb intake is limited to less than 5–10% of your total daily calorie intake (). This allows your body to , a state during which the body switches to using fat instead of carbs as its primary fuel source, and ketones are produced in the liver (). The reduced carb intake is usually made up for by increasing fat intake to around 70–90% of calories, or 155–200 grams for (, ). Protein intake is moderate, usually around 20% of calories, or 100 grams for a 2,000-calorie diet (, ). There are several proposed weight loss mechanisms associated with the ketogenic diet, though long-term studies are lacking. One of the main weight loss mechanisms related to the keto diet is likely its ability to (, ). Following the ketogenic diet has been linked to decreased levels of ghrelin, one of your body’s main hunger hormones (). Reducing ghrelin levels and hunger can cause you to eat fewer calories throughout the day, which may result in weight loss (). In fact, one study in 20 people with obesity following the keto diet associated this way of eating with reduced food and alcohol cravings (). Thus, the keto diet may be an effective strategy to regulate your hunger levels, though its long-term safety must be taken into consideration. Another potential weight loss mechanism of the keto diet is the that accompanies the significant reduction in carb intake. This is because carbs, in their stored form in your body, hold water (, ). Thus, when you reduce your carb intake, such as during the initiation phase of the keto diet, stored carbs are released along with additional fluid, resulting in weight loss of varying amounts. To determine whether the keto diet can aid weight loss, it’s important to review how weight loss is traditionally achieved. To lose weight, you must eat fewer calories than you burn, which is also referred to as a . One study in 17 men with obesity or excess weight found that the keto diet was associated with a small increase in the number of calories burned. Although, this did not lead to increased body fat losses, compared with a traditional baseline diet (). These results suggest that the is not necessarily superior to a traditional diet for weight loss when calorie intake is matched. The keto diet’s weight loss effects are therefore much more likely to be a result of reduced calorie intake due to changes in satiety signals associated with high fat, very low carb diets. The keto diet has been associated with weight loss, though the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Studies suggest that weight loss related to the keto diet is likely due to a calorie deficit, reduction in hunger levels, and water weight loss. Since the keto diet’s surge in popularity, numerous supplements catered to keto dieters have appeared on the market, and some of them may aid weight loss. Here are the top along with their proposed functions: . This oil, which contains medium-chain triglycerides, can help keto dieters add more fat to their diets and stay in ketosis. It’s digested more rapidly than traditional fats but can have digestive side effects. These are ketones from an outside source, as opposed to naturally produced endogenous ketones. They can increase blood ketone levels and help you achieve ketosis more rapidly (). These protein powders are formulated to have a low carb content. Electrolyte depletion is common when first starting a keto diet due to water weight loss. Electrolyte supplements can help prevent deficiency of common electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium (). Due to the high fat content of the keto diet, some people may experience digestive issues. Digestive enzyme supplements, specifically lipase, can help break down fats. When it comes to the weight loss effects of ketogenic supplements, studies are limited. One study in mice looked at the viability of . It found that several exogenous ketones, as well as MCT oil, may aid weight loss by reducing hunger and causing you to naturally eat fewer calories (). Still, human research supporting these claims is lacking. While keto supplements are not necessary, they can help keto dieters transition into this rather restrictive way of eating and increase the tolerability of the diet. That said, these supplements should not be used solely for weight loss, as the data is insufficient and their long-term side effects are unknown. MCT oil and exogenous ketones can help you get into ketosis quicker and avoid many of the side effects associated with the transition. While they may also reduce appetite, it’s not recommended to use them as weight loss supplements. When following a keto diet for weight loss purposes, some other factors also need to be kept in mind to ensure progress. When starting a ketogenic diet, it may help to keep track of exactly you are consuming daily. This helps ensure that you enter ketosis relatively quickly and avoid some of the symptoms associated with the “,” which is a group of symptoms, including headaches and brain fog, related to starting a keto diet. If you eat too many carbs, you will not stay in ketosis, and the potential benefits of the diet, including weight loss, will be diminished. For most people, eating less than 50 grams of carbs per day should be sufficient to stimulate ketosis (). is an often overlooked aspect of any diet. Studies show that a lack of sleep and chronic stress can negatively impact weight loss outcomes. This holds true when following the keto diet (). Studies also suggest that a lack of sleep can negatively impact hunger hormones, such as ghrelin and leptin. This can cause increased appetite, counteracting the hunger-reducing effects of the keto diet (). Ensuring that you take time to unwind and get at least 7 hours of sleep per night can help support the benefits of a ketogenic diet (). While the keto diet alone may provide weight loss, combining it with a regimen can enhance this effect (, ). When adapted to the diet, your body can use fat as its primary fuel source for exercise. Studies suggest that this is most beneficial in endurance-based sports (, , ). It’s important to note that you should be well adjusted to the keto diet before performing any moderately intense exercise to avoid negative side effects. When it comes to weight loss on the keto diet, several other factors need to be considered, such as your specific carb intake and sleep and exercise routine. One of the major — especially for weight loss — is long-term sustainability. Considering that the diet is quite restrictive, some people may find it difficult to adhere to. It particularly creates challenges when or gathering with family and friends for the holidays, as a new way of eating must be adopted, potentially affecting social interactions. Furthermore, studies on the health effects of following the keto diet for long periods are lacking (). These factors must be considered before starting it. Due to its restrictive nature, the keto diet may be difficult to stick to in the long term. Eating out and other social situations may require particular diligence and preparation. The keto diet is a very low carb, high fat diet that has been shown to offer , including weight loss. While the exact weight loss mechanisms associated with this way of eating are still under investigation, it appears that weight loss is caused by a calorie deficit, reduction in hunger levels, and water weight loss. Keto supplements may reduce hunger and help you get into ketosis more rapidly, though they should not be used to promote weight loss. While the weight loss benefits of the keto diet may seem promising, it’s important to consider its potential side effects, downsides, and the lack of long-term research on it. — Medically reviewed by Ketogenic diets have many powerful health benefits, but some people have trouble getting into ketosis.

The ketogenic diet was originally used as a way to reduce seizure activity in people with epilepsy (). However, research suggests that it may also offer other health benefits, such as weight loss, reduced insulin resistance, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels, and even improvements in neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s ().

To maximize the effects of the diet, you must continue to , a characteristic of the metabolic state of ketosis. As such, you have to eat mostly fat, a moderate amount of protein, and very few carb-containing foods. Eating too many carbs can quickly kick you out of ketosis. In addition, high amounts of protein may bring you out of ketosis, as your body can convert protein into glucose (). The standard keto diet typically comprises about 80% of calories from fat, 15% from protein, and 5% from carbs (). Thus, if your goal is 2,000 calories per day, you should aim for about 178 grams of fat, 75 grams of protein, and only 25 grams of carbs each day to get into ketosis.

Dairy foods like milk and yogurt are usually too high in carbs, but full fat cheese is allowed. When following a ketogenic diet, dairy foods like cheese can provide needed fat, along with high quality protein, calcium, and variety, so it’s nice to have them as an option. However, the carb and fat contents of cheese can vary, especially among varieties. If you want to add cottage cheese to your keto diet, it’s important to check its nutrition label. Reduced fat or nonfat cottage cheeses not only have less fat but also potentially more carbs than whole milk cottage cheese. That’s because some reduced fat products contain fruit, and many contain gum-based thickeners, which are used to give low fat dairy foods a similar texture and thickness as full fat products. However, they also increase the carb content. Below is the nutrition info for about a 1/2-cup (100-gram) serving of various types of cottage cheese: (, , , , , ) All cottage cheese is a , but since it’s not excessively high in this nutrient, it should fit into your daily protein allowance if you’re on a keto diet.

To make a tasty low carb vegetable dip, blend your cottage cheese with a whole, roasted red pepper, 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder, and a generous pinch of dried basil. If you want to bump up the fat content without affecting the carbs, stir in some olive oil or a few tablespoons of chopped olives. Plain, full fat cottage cheese can be paired with low carb vegetables for a keto-friendly snack. You can also use it to make a tasty, low carb dip base. Cottage cheese can be a keto-friendly protein option, but ideally, you should choose full fat, plain cottage cheese. For a healthy, low carb snack, combine it with vegetables or use it as a dip base.

Adhering to a certain diet can have a huge impact on a person’s health. Keto diet too can affect different people differently.

This makes your body more efficient at burning fat, which can have some side effects on your body. Nutritionist Biswas points out the dangerous side effects of the diet you should be aware of: People thinking of going on a keto diet need to know about keto flu as well. Restricting your carbs intake forces your body to burn ketones instead of glucose for energy. In this process, ketones are removed from the body through frequent and increased urination. This often leads to dehydration, flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, irritability, nausea and . Frequent urination can also lead to the loss of electrolytes, which can exacerbate the symptoms. Another side effect of the keto diet is sugar cravings. Carbohydrates are a source of energy and stimulation, and removal of this source of energy can result in increased , difficulty in concentrating and brain fog. There are several other dangers of the keto diet that people might face, including bad breath, fatigue, , irregular menstrual cycle, reduced bone density, and sleep problems. A healthy ketogenic diet consists of about 75% healthy fat, 10-30% protein and 5-10% or 20-50 gm of carb. Ms Biswas recommends going for high-fat and low-carb foods like meats, eggs, dairy and low-carb vegetables. A good amount of vegetables should be included in your diet. Limit the intake of highly processed foods, unhealthy fats and sugary beverages. If weight loss is your goal, remember you can achieve it by eating healthy and exercising regularly.

2b545365-c075-48e5-86e6-bedc55c97dc6,"Some people believe that ketosis and ketoacidosis are the same condition, but these are two different conditions related to the body’s metabolism. Learning the differences between ketosis vs ketoacidosis will help to dispel myths surrounding their cause and diagnosis. is a state in which the body starts burning fat for energy due to lack of new glucose in the diet. Althugh ketosis is commonly seen in individuals participating in a low-carb diet, it is also seen in people suffering from a lack of insulin as well as prolonged periods of fasting or starvation. Carbohydrates provide the body with glucose. The pancreas secretes a hormone called insulin that works with the glucose in the bloodstream to provide energy to the body’s organs and cells. When the glucose supply is exhausted, it begins to break down stored fat to meet its energy needs for normal functioning. The accumulation of ketone molecules in the blood make it extremely acidic. This irritates the kidneys, which flush out ketones through urine. Ketosis gets its name from the ketones that are produced in the process of breaking down the fat. In a healthy person, the amount of fat that is burned and ketones that are produced is tightly controlled, causing no harmful side effects. Dietary ketosis seen in those participating in low-carbohydrate diets can be quite helpful in losing weight, as fat is burned in the entire process to gain energy. As ketosis is usually a diet-induced process, it isn’t harmful, unlike ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening condition. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a condition afflicting mainly type 1 diabetes patients who suffer from hyperglycemia as a result of lack of insulin. Inadequate insulin levels result in the failure of the body to utilize blood glucose as a fuel source; rather, to compensate the decreased energy levels, the body starts breaking down fat, resulting in ketones. Without insulin to control the amount of ketones produced during this process, an excessive amount is produced. The high concentration of ketones coupled with heightened blood glucose levels causes the blood to become significantly acidic. As a result of high blood sugar levels and inadequate insulin, acidic ketones create chemical imbalance in the body and produce life-threatening symptoms and can even cause death. Diabetic ketoacidosis in children might be the result of undiagnosed diabetic mellitus. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis in children are: Fruity-scented breath, primarily because of ketones In the case of adults, common diabetic ketoacidosis symptoms are: Though type 1 diabetes patients are more vulnerable to developing diabetic ketoacidosis, in some cases, type 2 diabetes patients, too, can develop this condition due to prolonged illness. Now that we have understood both Ketosis and Ketoacidosis, it is clear how both terms differ. Ketosis, in most cases, is a diet-induced condition that results in the body breaking down fat and fatty acid to create energy because of inadequate glucose supply in the diet, normally from a low-carbohydrate diet, a prolonged fast or starvation. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a condition when the body cannot use blood glucose to produce energy due to lack of insulin and thus uses its muscle mass, fat, and fatty acid. In ketosis, do not cause harm to the body because insulin keeps a check on their production. In diabetic ketoacidosis, the blood becomes extremely acidic because of high sugar levels, inadequate insulin and an excess of ketones, resulting in chemical imbalance in the body. Remain strict with your diabetes management by taking daily doses of insulin, following a heart-healthy diet and adding physical activity to your daily routine. This would keep diabetic ketoacidosis at bay to a great extent. 3.

415722d4-92ba-459c-8aec-9f78141ad90f,"— The ketogenic diet is a low carb, high fat diet commonly used for weight loss. Restricting carbs and increasing fat intake can lead to ketosis, a metabolic state in which your body relies primarily on fat for energy instead of carbs (). However, the diet also carries risks you should be aware of. Carb intake on the keto diet is typically limited to fewer than 50 grams per day, which can come as a shock to your body (). As your body depletes its carb stores and switches to using ketones and fat for fuel at the start of this eating pattern, you may experience flu-like symptoms. These include headaches, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and constipation — due in part to dehydration and that happen as your body adjusts to ketosis (). While most people who experience feel better within a few weeks, it’s important to monitor these symptoms throughout the diet, stay hydrated, and eat foods rich in sodium, potassium, and other electrolytes (). As your body adjusts to using ketones and fats as its primary energy source, you may experience flu-like symptoms at the beginning of the keto diet. High fat animal foods, such as eggs, meat, and cheese, are staples of the keto diet because they don’t contain carbs. If you eat a lot of these foods, you may have a higher risk of . That’s because a high intake of animal foods can cause your blood and urine to become more acidic, leading to increased excretion of calcium in your urine (, ). Some studies also suggest that the keto diet reduces the amount of citrate that’s released in your urine. Given that citrate can bind to calcium and prevent the formation of kidney stones, reduced levels of it may also raise your risk of developing them (). Additionally, people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) should avoid keto, as weakened kidneys may be unable to remove the acid buildup in your blood that results from these animal foods. This can lead to a state of acidosis, which can worsen the progression of CKD. What’s more, are often recommended for individuals with CKD, while the keto diet is moderate to high in protein (). Eating a lot of animal foods on the keto diet can lead to more acidic urine and a higher risk of kidney stones. This acidic state can also worsen the progression of chronic kidney disease. 3. May cause digestive issues and changes in gut bacteria Since the keto diet restricts carbs, it can be difficult to meet your daily fiber needs. Some of the richest sources of fiber, such as high carb fruits, starchy vegetables, whole grains, and beans, are eliminated on the diet because they provide too many carbs. As a result, the keto diet can lead to digestive discomfort and constipation. A 10-year study in children with epilepsy on the ketogenic diet found that 65% reported as a common side effect (). What’s more, fiber feeds the beneficial bacteria in your gut. Having a healthy gut may help boost immunity, improve mental health, and decrease inflammation (). A low carb diet that’s lacking in fiber, such as keto, may negatively affect your — although current research on this topic is mixed (). Some keto-friendly foods that are high in fiber include flax seeds, chia seeds, coconut, broccoli, cauliflower, and leafy greens. Due to its carb restrictions, the keto diet is often low in fiber. This may trigger constipation and negative effects on gut health. Since the keto diet restricts several foods, especially nutrient-dense fruits, whole grains, and legumes, it may fail to provide recommended amounts of vitamins and minerals. In particular, some studies suggest that the keto diet doesn’t provide enough calcium, vitamin D, magnesium, and phosphorus (). A study that evaluated the nutrient composition of common diets revealed that very low carb eating patterns like , which is similar to keto, provided sufficient amounts for only 12 of the 27 vitamins and minerals your body needs to obtain from food (). Over time, this may lead to . Notably, guidelines for clinicians who manage people on a very low calorie keto diet for weight loss recommend supplementing with potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, omega-3 fatty acids, psyllium fiber, and vitamins B, C, and E (). Keep in mind that the nutritional adequacy of this diet depends on the specific foods that you eat. A diet rich in healthy low carb foods, such as avocados, nuts, and non-starchy vegetables, provides more nutrients than processed meats and keto treats. Some studies suggest that keto provides insufficient vitamins and minerals, including potassium and magnesium. Over time, this could lead to nutrient deficiencies. Low carb diets like keto have been shown to help manage blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. In particular, some studies suggest that keto may help decrease levels of hemoglobin A1c, a measure of average blood sugar levels (, , ). However, individuals with type 1 diabetes may be at a high risk of more episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which is marked by confusion, shakiness, , and sweating. Hypoglycemia can lead to coma and death if not treated. A study in 11 adults with type 1 diabetes who followed a ketogenic diet for over 2 years found that the median number of low blood sugar events was close to 1 per day (). Individuals with type 1 diabetes typically experience low blood sugar if they are taking too much insulin and not consuming enough carbs. Thus, a low carb keto diet may increase the risk. Theoretically, this could also happen to individuals with who are taking insulin medications. Even though low carb diets have been shown to improve blood sugar control in people with diabetes, they may also increase your risk of low blood sugar events — especially if you have type 1 diabetes. The keto diet is also associated with impaired . Several studies in animals link the keto diet to decreased bone strength, likely due to losses in bone mineral density, which may occur as your body adapts to ketosis (, ). In fact, a 6-month study in 29 children with epilepsy on the keto diet discovered that 68% had a lower bone mineral density score after going on the diet (). Another study in 30 elite walkers determined that those who followed keto for 3.5 weeks had significantly higher levels of blood markers for bone breakdown, compared with those who ate a diet (). All the same, more extensive research is warranted. The keto diet may reduce your bone mineral density and trigger bone breakdown over time, though further studies are needed. 7. May increase your risk of chronic diseases and early death The ketogenic diet’s effect on your risk of chronic illness, such as heart disease or cancer, is hotly debated and not entirely understood. Some evidence suggests that high fat, low carb diets that focus on animal foods may lead to poor health outcomes, while diets that emphasize provide benefits (, ). A long-term observational study in over 130,000 adults linked animal-based low carb diets to higher rates of death from heart disease, , and all causes (). On the other hand, vegetable-based low carb diets were associated with a lower rate of death from heart disease and all causes (). Another study in over 15,000 adults found similar results but tied both low and high carb diets to a greater all-cause death rate, compared with moderate carb diets in which carbs comprised 50–55% of total daily calories (). While research is mixed, some evidence suggests that low carb diets that focus on animal foods may lead to higher death rates from heart disease, cancer, and all causes. While the keto diet is linked to weight loss and in the short term, it may lead to nutrient deficiencies, digestive issues, poor bone health, and other problems over time. Due to these risks, individuals with kidney disease, diabetes, heart or bone ailments, or other medical conditions should speak to their healthcare provider before trying the keto diet. You may also want to consult a dietitian to plan and monitor your nutrient levels while on this diet to help minimize the risks of complications and nutrient deficiencies. — The Keto Diet Is Gaining Popularity, But Is It Safe?

c9a2ac9f-d844-41b8-98f7-0b60afab7acd,"Vegetarian and ketogenic diets have been studied extensively for their health benefits (, ). The ketogenic, or keto, diet is a high-fat, low-carb diet that has become especially popular in recent years.

One large review of 12 studies showed that those following a vegetarian diet lost an average of 4.5 pounds (2 kg) more than non-vegetarians over 18 weeks (). Also, in a 6-month study in 74 people with type 2 diabetes, vegetarian diets promoted both fat and weight loss more effectively than traditional low-calorie diets ().

In fact, studies tie them to a lower risk of cancer and improved levels of several heart disease risk factors, including BMI, cholesterol, and blood pressure (, ). The keto diet has also been studied for its effects on disease prevention. In a 56-week study in 66 people, the keto diet led to significant reductions in body weight, total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood sugar, all of which are risk factors for heart disease (). Other studies suggest that this diet may safeguard and help treat Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases (, ). Animal and test-tube studies likewise note that the keto diet may reduce the growth of . However, more research is needed (, , ). Vegetarian and keto diets each support .

Both vegetarian and keto diets have been shown to increase weight loss, support blood sugar control, and protect against several chronic illnesses. Keep in mind that no studies examine the vegetarian keto diet specifically. The vegetarian keto diet has a few drawbacks to consider as well.

4d398b39-5f71-4d55-a40f-ec7b0cad1def,"— The ketogenic diet is a popular very low carb, high fat diet favored by many people for its ability to promote quick weight loss. There are other benefits related to the keto diet as well, including improved blood sugar regulation and other markers of metabolic health. However, you may wonder whether the ketogenic diet is equally effective for all populations, including women. This article reviews how the ketogenic diet affects women’s health. The ketogenic diet shows promise when used therapeutically to improve certain factors of health. Studies have shown that it can be used as a way to reduce body fat and improve blood sugar, and even as a complementary treatment for certain cancers (, ). Although much of the research focuses on how well the keto diet works in men, a decent number of studies have included women or focused exclusively on the effects of the keto diet on women. One of the main reasons why women turn to the keto diet is to lose excess body fat. Some research suggests the keto diet may be an effective way to encourage fat loss in the female population. Studies have shown that following a keto diet by increasing fat burning and decreasing calorie intake and hunger-promoting hormones like insulin — all of which may help encourage fat loss (). For example, one study in 45 women with ovarian or endometrial cancer found that women who followed a ketogenic diet for 12 weeks had significantly less total body fat and lost 16% more belly fat than women assigned to a low fat, high fiber diet (). Another study in adults with obesity that included 12 women demonstrated that following a very low calorie ketogenic diet for 14 weeks significantly reduced body fat, decreased food cravings, and improved female sexual function (). Additionally, a review of 13 randomized controlled trials — the gold standard in research — that included a population comprised of 61% women found that participants who followed ketogenic diets lost 2 pounds (0.9 kg) more than those on low fat diets after 1 to 2 years (). Although research supports the use of this very low carb way of eating to enhance fat loss in the short term, keep in mind that there’s currently a lack of studies exploring the long-term effects of the keto diet on weight loss. Plus, some evidence suggests that the weight-loss-promoting benefits of the keto diet drop off around the 5-month mark, which may be due to its restrictive nature (). What’s more, some research shows that less restrictive low carb diets may result in comparable effects and are easier to sustain long term. For example, a study that included 52 women found that low and moderate carb diets that contained 15% and 25% carbs, respectively, reduced body fat and waist circumference over 12 weeks similar to a ketogenic diet that contained 5% carbs (). Plus, the higher carb diets were easier for the women to stick to. The ketogenic diet typically limits carb intake to less than 10% of total calories. For this reason, the diet is favored by women with high blood sugar, including those with . A 4-month study that included 58 women with obesity and type 2 diabetes found that a very low calorie keto diet caused significantly greater weight loss and reductions in fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) than a standard low calorie diet (). HbA1c is a marker of long-term blood sugar control. A 2019 case study in a 65-year-old woman with a 26-year history of type 2 diabetes and depression demonstrated that after following a ketogenic diet for 12 weeks, along with psychotherapy and high intensity exercise, her HbA1c dropped out of diabetic range. Her fasting blood sugar and her markers for clinical depression normalized. Essentially, this case study showed that the ketogenic diet reversed this woman’s type 2 diabetes (). A study in 25 people that included 15 women showed similar results. After 34 weeks of following a keto diet, approximately 55% of the study population had HbA1c levels below the diabetic level, compared with 0% who followed a low fat diet (). However, it’s important to note that currently, studies on the long-term adherence, safety, and efficacy of the ketogenic diet on blood sugar control are lacking. Plus, many other less restrictive diets, including the Mediterranean diet, have been researched for decades and are well known for their safety and beneficial effects on blood sugar control and overall health (). The ketogenic diet has been shown to be beneficial when used as a complementary treatment method for alongside traditional medications. One study in 45 women with endometrial or ovarian cancer found that following a ketogenic diet increased blood levels of ketone bodies and lowered levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I), a hormone that may promote the spread of cancer cells. The researchers acknowledged that this change, along with the decrease in blood sugar seen in those following ketogenic diets, creates an inhospitable environment for cancer cells that may suppress their growth and spread (). Plus, research also shows that the ketogenic diet may improve physical function, increase energy levels, and decrease food cravings in women with endometrial and ovarian cancer (). The ketogenic diet has also shown promise when used as a treatment alongside standard treatments like chemotherapy for other cancers that affect women including glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive cancer that affects the brain (, , ). However, it’s important to note that because of the highly restrictive nature of the ketogenic diet and the current lack of high quality research, this diet isn’t recommended as a treatment for most cancers. Some research has shown that the ketogenic diet may be effective at promoting weight loss and improving blood sugar regulation in women. Plus, it may be beneficial when used as a complementary therapy in women with certain types of cancers. Does the ketogenic diet pose any risks for women?  One of the largest concerns over following a very high fat, low carb diet is its potential on heart health. Interestingly, while some evidence shows that the ketogenic diet may increase certain heart disease risk factors including LDL (bad) cholesterol, other studies have found that the diet may benefit heart health. A small study that included 3 female Crossfit athletes found that after 12 weeks of following a ketogenic diet, LDL cholesterol was increased by around 35% in the ketogenic diet, compared with the athletes who followed a control diet (). However, a study in women with endometrial and ovarian cancer demonstrated that following a ketogenic diet for 12 weeks had no adverse effects on blood lipids when compared with a low fat, high fiber diet (). Likewise, other studies have shown conflicting results. Some findings indicate that the ketogenic diet raises heart-protective HDL cholesterol and reduces total and LDL cholesterol, while others have found the ketogenic diet to significantly raise LDL (, , ). It’s important to note that depending on the composition of the diet, ketogenic diets are likely to affect heart health risk factors differently. For example, a ketogenic diet high in saturated fat is more likely to raise LDL cholesterol than a keto diet primarily composed of unsaturated fats (). Plus, although it’s been shown that the keto diet may increase certain risk factors for heart disease, more research is needed to determine how this high fat diet may increase or decrease the risk of heart disease itself and to better understand its effect on overall health. Due to its restrictive and hard to maintain macronutrient ratio, the ketogenic diet isn’t appropriate for many people. For example, it’s not recommended for the following populations (, ): people who have disorders that affect fat metabolism people who have certain deficiencies including carnitine deficiency those who have a blood disorder known as porphyria people who can’t maintain adequate nutritional intake In addition to the contraindications listed above, there are other factors to consider when thinking about trying the ketogenic diet. For example, the ketogenic diet can cause unpleasant symptoms known collectively as the during the adaptation phase of the diet. Symptoms include irritability, nausea, constipation, fatigue, muscle aches, and more. Although these symptoms typically subside after a week or so, these effects should still be considered when thinking about trying the keto diet (). The long-term effect of the ketogenic diet on heart health and overall health is unknown due to the current lack of high quality research. The keto diet isn’t appropriate for many populations and can cause unpleasant side effects like irritability. Whether you should try the keto diet depends on many factors. Before you start any significant dietary changes, it’s important to consider the positives and negatives of the diet, as well as its appropriateness based on your current health status. For example, the ketogenic diet may be an appropriate choice for a woman with obesity, diabetes, or who’s unable to lose weight or manage her blood sugar using other dietary modifications. Additionally, this diet may also be effective for women who have overweight or obesity and have . Studies show that the keto diet may help women with PCOS lose weight, improve hormonal imbalance, and enhance fertility (). However, being that the ketogenic diet is restrictive in nature and lacks long-term, high quality studies backing its safety and efficacy, less restrictive dietary patterns may be the best choice for most women. Depending on your health and dietary needs, it’s always suggested to adopt a dietary pattern that’s rich in whole, nutritionally dense foods that can be maintained for life. Before trying out the keto diet, it’s a smart choice to explore other, less restrictive options to improve your health and reach your wellness goals. Since the keto diet is highly restrictive and its efficacy depends on maintaining ketosis, it’s recommended that this diet only be followed while working with a qualified health professional. Speak to your medical provider or a registered dietitian if you’re interested in trying out the ketogenic diet. Although the ketogenic diet may result in positive health changes in some women, it’s a highly restrictive diet. Most women will likely find long-term success by adopting a less restrictive, nutrient-dense diet for long-term health. The has shown promise when used therapeutically to improve certain aspects of health in women including body weight and blood sugar control. However, there are some caveats that come along with the keto diet, including the lack of studies investigating the diet’s long-term effect on overall health and its restrictive macronutrient composition. Plus, this diet isn’t safe for certain female populations, including women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Although some women may find success when following a ketogenic dietary pattern, choosing a less restrictive, nutritious diet that can be followed for life is likely more beneficial for the majority of women. — The Ketogenic Diet: A Detailed Beginner’s Guide to Keto The ketogenic diet (keto) is a low-carb, high-fat diet that causes weight loss and provides numerous health benefits.

e7e22d52-9fdb-4116-953d-864a230c1fdb,"— The ketogenic, or keto, diet has become increasingly popular. It is a very low carb, high fat diet that many people use to lose weight and has been linked to various other health benefits. For a long time, many people assumed that it was impossible to build muscle on a keto diet or low carb diets in general. That’s because low carb diets restrict carbs, which are known to promote the release of insulin, an anabolic hormone that helps shuttle nutrients into cells, which helps create conditions that drive muscle growth (). Yet, you may wonder whether it’s true that low carb diets hinder muscle growth. This article provides you with a complete guide on how to build muscle on a keto diet. The ketogenic, or keto, diet is a very low carb, high fat diet. It involves drastically lowering your carb intake and consuming fat instead. This helps your body transition into a metabolic state known as ketosis. Ketosis occurs when your body has limited access to glucose or carbs, the body’s preferred source of fuel for many processes. To compensate, your body uses fat to make ketone bodies as an alternative fuel source (). To transition into ketosis, people typically need to consume fewer than 50 grams of carbs per day, while getting the rest of their calories from a high fat, moderate protein diet (). Generally, it takes 2–4 days to if your carb intake is 50 grams per day or less. Still, some people may find it takes a week or longer (, , ). Most people use a ketogenic diet for , as research has shown that it can help you lose weight and curb your appetite (, ). Aside from weight loss, the keto diet has other benefits and can be used to aid people with epilepsy, control blood sugar levels, and help reduce your risk of various chronic conditions, such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and certain cancers (, , ). The keto diet is a very low carb, high fat diet that encourages your body to use ketones as fuel rather than glucose — the body’s preferred source of energy. It’s commonly used for weight loss but has various other possible benefits. Studies show that it is possible to build muscle on the keto diet. For example, a study in 25 college-aged men compared a traditional Western diet against the ketogenic diet for muscle gain, strength, and performance, and found that both diets were equally effective (). Other studies have shown that keto may provide similar as a conventional high carb diet while also helping shed body fat (, , ). Still, if you’re new to keto, you may initially experience a drop in strength and performance. It’s important to note that this drop is often temporary and happens because your body is adapting to relying on ketones (). Several studies show that it’s possible to build muscle and improve strength on the keto diet much as you would on a traditional higher carb diet. The following recommendations can help you structure a keto diet to build muscle. To optimally build muscle, you need to consistently eat more calories than you burn (). The number of calories you need to eat per day to build muscle depends on several factors, such as your weight, height, lifestyle, sex, and activity levels. The first thing you need to do is determine your maintenance calories — the number of calories you need to consume per day to stay the same weight. To do so, weigh yourself at last three times per week and record your food intake over the week with a calorie tracking app. If your weight stays the same, that is roughly your maintenance calories. Alternatively, you can determine your maintenance calories using . When you’re trying to build muscle, it’s recommended to increase your calorie intake by 15% above your maintenance calories. So if your maintenance calories are 2,000 per day, you should eat 2,300 calories per day to build muscle (). As you build muscle, it’s a good idea to adjust your calorie intake around once per month to account for the changes in your weight. What’s more, it’s recommended to gain no more than 0.25–0.5% of your body weight per week to prevent accumulating too much fat (). is essential for building muscle. That’s because protein is the building block of muscles, which means that you need to consume more protein than your body breaks down through natural processes when trying to build muscle (). Most studies suggest that eating 0.7–0.9 grams of protein per pound of body weight (1.6–2.0 grams per kg) is ideal for building muscle (, ). There’s some concern among keto dieters about consuming too much protein because it could encourage your body to use gluconeogenesis — a process in which amino acids are converted from protein into sugar, which could stop your body from making ketones (). However, studies have shown that people can safely consume around 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight (2.1 grams per kg) and stay in ketosis (, , ). Traditionally, carbs make up the bulk of the calories on a muscle-building diet. However, if you’re trying to stay in ketosis, then you need to restrict carbs. To reach and stay in ketosis, most people need to eat per day, although the exact value can vary (, ). You may find that timing your carb intake around your workouts can be beneficial, especially if you believe your performance is affected. This strategy is known as a targeted keto diet, in which you consume your daily allowed carbs around your workouts to aid exercise performance (). If you’re struggling to complete workouts, you could try a targeted keto approach. Otherwise, feel free to consume your carbs whenever it suits you best. Monitoring your is incredibly important on the keto diet. That’s because your body relies primarily on fat for fuel when you limit carb intake and are in a state of ketosis (). After accounting for protein and carbs, fat should make up the rest of your diet. Both protein and carbs provide 4 calories per gram while fat provides 9 per gram. After subtracting your protein and carb needs from your daily calorie needs (see above), divide the final number by 9 to determine your daily fat requirements. For example, a 155-pound (70-kg) person on a 2,300-calorie muscle gain diet may eat 110 grams of protein and 50 grams of carbs. The remaining 1,660 calories can be taken up by 185 grams of fat. These guidelines tend to align with standard keto recommendations for fat intake — 70–75% of your daily calories (, ). To build muscle on a keto diet, you should calculate your calorie, protein, carb, and fat needs based on your weight and lifestyle factors. Other than diet, there are several factors you should consider to help you build muscle on the keto diet. While nutrition is important, is also key to gaining muscle. Resistance training typically involves lifting weights or doing other strength-based exercises to build strength and gain muscle mass (, ). According to a review of 10 studies, resistance training at least twice a week was more effective at promoting muscle growth than training once per week (). Try incorporating exercises like squats, bench presses, pullups, and pushups into your weekly resistance training routine to encourage muscle growth. If you’re new to the gym, consider hiring a personal trainer to show you proper techniques to maximize your efforts and reduce your risk of injury. While not required, supplements may help you build muscle. If you’re struggling to reach your daily protein needs, you could use a protein powder supplement, such as whey, casein, pea, or hemp protein. However, it’s important to note that many contain carbs, so you’ll need to account for these carbs in your daily carb allowance to stay in ketosis. You could also try using a supplement, as studies show that it can aid gym performance, leading to more muscle gain (, , ). Remember that your body’s levels of sodium, potassium, and magnesium may drop while on keto. Thus, it’s best to eat foods rich in these minerals, such as dark leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and avocados. Alternatively, you can take a supplement. Resistance training is crucial for building muscle on the keto diet. Though not necessary, supplements may help you maximize your gains. Here are some more tips to help you build muscle on the keto diet:If you’re new to keto, you may experience an initial drop in strength and performance. It’s important to note that this drop is temporary, occurring as your body adapts — so be patient and don’t quit early. This helps ensure that you eat fewer than 50 grams of carbs per day to stay in ketosis. When some people start this diet, they may experience the — a collection of symptoms, such as fatigue, nausea, irritability, and insomnia, that occur as your body adapts to its new regimen. Beverages and condiments typically contain carbs that many people are unaware of, so it’s important to not overlook them. You can use or a keto breath test to determine if you’re in ketosis or if you need to adjust your diet accordingly. Proper sleep is very important for muscle gain and exercise performance (, ). To optimize muscle growth on the keto diet, make sure you have a solid nutrition plan and get plenty of sleep. Also, make sure to monitor your carb intake and ketone levels to ensure you stay in ketosis. Though it involves carefully watching your protein, carb, and fat intake, the keto diet may be as effective as traditional higher carb diets for . Simply following the above guidelines can help you plan an effective keto strategy for building muscle. However, it’s unclear whether offers more benefits for building muscle than a traditional higher carb diet. — The 7 Best Low-Carb, Keto-Friendly Protein Powders Protein powders are a convenient and tasty way to increase your intake of this important nutrient, even when you're watching your carb intake.

477c1096-796a-4f22-9dd6-58fa4dcef953,"Keto Diet vs. Vegan Diet: Is One Better for Weight Loss? Experts say the best diet is the one you can stick with. You don’t have to spend much time on social media before you’re likely to see a post about weight loss. It may be someone promoting their newest weight loss goal. Another might lament that their diet is too restrictive for them to splurge on their favorite snack. Weight loss is a multibillion dollar industry in the United States, and it’s no wonder: Today, more than are considered to be overweight or have obesity, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. What’s more, about 1 in 6 children and adolescents between the ages of 2 and 19 are considered obese. Each year, healthcare professionals and researchers look for reliable and scientifically supported strategies for successful weight loss. At the same time, extreme diets and weight loss plans — both the absurd (cabbage soup diet) and the more sane (Mediterranean diet) — ebb and flow in popularity. Two of those plans — the vegan diet and the ketogenic diet — stand at polar opposites in terms of food strategy, but they’re both popular for their promise to get the pounds off. Here’s how they compare. The ketogenic (keto) diet is a high-fat, low-carb diet. It emphasizes rich sources of fat, like dairy products and avocado, with moderate protein servings and very few carbs. That leaves out many vegetables, fruits, and grains. Sugar is also a no-go. The vegan diet is a plant-based eating plan. It eliminates all foods that come from animal sources, but it’s rich in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Research shows that both plans can lead to weight loss. What it takes to get there — and how likely you are to sustain it — are factors that help determine if either of these diets can be successful in the long run. The human body stores carbohydrates as glycogen. That’s the body’s preferred source of energy. You have a steady supply of these energy reserves. Your body will burn through carbs you eat and then turn to the glycogen for energy. If you eliminate carbs from your diet, however, your body will quickly use up those reserves. When glycogen is lost, your body also loses the excess water glycogen holds. Immediately, you’ll drop several pounds without this water weight. In a few days, your body will enter a metabolic state called ketosis. In ketosis, your body is using fat stores for energy since it has no carbohydrates or glycogen. The high amount of fat consumed on this diet also helps minimize cravings. You may feel fuller longer, which cuts down how much you eat in a day. Some people on keto turn to intermittent fasting to sustain weight loss. For vegan dieters, a plant-based plan is “often low in fat and protein and overall calories so people often feel like they can eat all day and still lose weight,” said Danielle Aberman, RDN, a dietitian who specializes in working with people with migraines, as well as those who have difficulty losing weight and keeping it off. In fact, research shows and are more likely to have a lower body mass index (BMI) than nonvegans. They are also likely to have . By nature of the food vegans eat, plant-based eaters also typically of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients than omnivores. They also have a lower average calorie consumption than nonvegans. In one study, vegans lost than people not following a plant-based diet over the course of one year. The study didn’t require participants to reduce their calorie intake or perform regular exercise. In existing mice studies, a keto diet has shown some improvements in weight loss. It has also shown promising results in reducing obesity-related conditions like type 2 diabetes. A great deal of keto research has been conducted in rats and mice only. are few and far between, but more are being done, thanks in large part to the keto diet’s increasing popularity. A , however, found that most individuals on a low-carbohydrate diet were no longer in ketosis after six months. A found that most keto-fed rats see weight loss in the first weeks of the diet, but during the 22-week study, the weight loss wasn’t maintained. A reason for this could be that many keto dieters return to their tried-and-true dietary preferences after a period of time, despite initial success. That might be because weight loss results have stalled or the strict keto plan was too hard to follow. Research also suggests keto dieters lose a greater percentage of lean body mass — the muscles that burn calories and help keep your metabolism running. This can affect your weight loss abilities in the future. When it comes to parsing the benefits of the keto diet and the vegan diet, experts will tell you that you can expect to see results on either diet — but they may not last unless you can sustain this new lifestyle for the long term. It turns out that’s the hardest part of picking a diet. “When you bring up the concept of which diet is more successful for weight loss, I would only label a diet successful if it is sustainable,” said Ashley Chambers, RD, a dietitian with . “Most diet trends for weight loss, such as the ketogenic diet and vegan diets, will lead to weight loss if you follow them strictly, but they often restrict so much that people have a hard time sustaining them for the long term.” , a Philadelphia-based, board-certified physician in obesity medicine and a clinical exercise specialist, agrees. “You can only look at the success of a program if you’re able to follow it,” said Seltzer, who specializes in weight loss, lifestyle, and fitness solutions. “If it’s unmaintainable over the long run, it doesn’t really matter which is theoretically better.” Seltzer says many people can try the keto diet and expect to see some success in the beginning. However, he adds that the people you see posting their weight loss results on social media are the tip of the keto iceberg, as it were. They’re the ones who’ve found a plan that works for them. That doesn’t show you the multitude of people who haven’t found success with the diet. “For every 100 people who try it, probably 99 of them will fail,” Seltzer said. “That’s because you can’t do either of them for the rest of your life. They’re difficult to do.” For Kristin Koskinen, RDN, who has a private practice in Washington State, the problem with the keto diet is what you’re not eating. “My concern about keto is the long-term issues that may arise from limiting carbohydrates, which ultimately means plant-based foods,” Koskinen said. “My recommendation is that keto be used as a therapeutic tool or as a limited-duration strategy for weight loss. If you have diabetes or any other known health condition, consult with your healthcare provider before starting a keto diet.” That doesn’t mean, however, that Koskinen falls in the vegan camp for weight loss either. “Though a vegan diet can be part of a healthy lifestyle, it doesn’t always produce weight loss results,” Koskinen said. “In my experience, choosing a vegan diet must accompany other lifestyle habits for weight loss, such as stress management and regular activity.” These experts, and many like them, stress that there are no quick-fix options for weight loss. It requires work if you want it to be sustainable and long term. “Changing habits is very difficult,” Seltzer said. “Making major lifestyle changes overnight is very difficult. Then trying to reintroduce your old lifestyle after a set period of time is even more difficult.” Ultimately, the prescription for weight loss may be a highly specific one — that is, one that works for you and likely you alone. “It’s important to come up with a plan that is acceptable and sustainable based on your individual food preferences, lifestyle, and degree of motivation to change from what has failed you in the past,” Aberman said. Two popular diets — the vegan diet and the ketogenic diet — stand at polar opposites in terms of food strategy, but they’re likewise popular for their promise to get the pounds off. Experts will tell you that you can expect to see results on either diet — but they may not last unless you can sustain this new lifestyle for the long term. Many people on the keto diet do lose weight in the short run, but they also can lose mean muscle mass, and one study found they were no longer in ketosis six months after starting the diet. For the vegan diet, one study found participants lost about 9 pounds over a year. But experts say that simply eating vegan doesn’t guarantee weight loss, and similarly people may give up the diet due to it being very restrictive. Experts point out that a successful diet is one that is sustainable in the long term for individuals.

DKA can also occur in individuals with who have little or no insulin production. is the presence of ketones. It’s not harmful. You can be in ketosis if you’re on a low-carbohydrate diet or fasting, or if you’ve consumed too much alcohol. If you’re in ketosis, you have a higher than usual level of ketones in your blood or urine, but not high enough to cause acidosis. Ketones are a chemical your body produces when it burns stored fat. Some people choose a to help with weight loss. While there is some controversy over their safety and long-term sustainability, low-carb diets are generally fine. Talk to your doctor before beginning any extreme diet plan. DKA is the of death in people under 24 years old who have diabetes. The overall death rate for ketoacidosis is. People under the age of 30 make up of DKA cases. Twenty-seven percent of people with DKA are between the ages of 30 and 50, 23 percent are between the ages of 51 and 70, and 14 percent are over the age of 70. What are the symptoms of ketosis and ketoacidosis? may cause .

That is because a low-carb diet will cause you to have less in your blood, which will, in turn, cause your body to burn fat for energy instead of relying on sugars. Poor diabetes management is a leading trigger for DKA. In people with diabetes, missing one or more insulin dose, or not using the right amount of insulin, can lead to DKA. An illness or infection, as well as some drugs, can also prevent your body from using insulin properly. This can lead to DKA.

People on restrictive diets or people with an may be at a higher risk for ketosis. Type 1 diabetes is the main risk factor for DKA. In one of people with DKA, researchers found that 47 percent had known type 1 diabetes, 26 percent had known , and 27 percent had newly diagnosed diabetes If you have diabetes, a main risk factor for DKA is not following the routine for blood sugar management that your doctor recommends. Researchers looked at diabetes in children and teenagers. They found that one in four participants had DKA when their doctor first diagnosed them with diabetes. Additional risk factors include: You can get a simple blood test to detect the level of ketones in your blood. You can use the level of ketones to determine if you have ketosis or DKA. You may also be able to take a urine test at home. For this test, you’ll place a dipstick into a clean catch of your urine. It will change colors based on the level of ketones in your urine. Nutritional ketosis (ideal for purposeful ketosis)High risk for ketoacidosis (if blood sugar is greater than 250 mg/dL, call your doctor) Diabetics who are losing weight will have often have , which doesn’t increase your risk for diabetic ketoacidosis if your blood sugar is managed and within normal ranges. Your risk for DKA increases as your ketone levels rise and your blood sugar is above 250mg/dL (14 mmol/L). Blood ketone tests are the ideal method for diabetics to check ketone levels because they measure the levels of beta-hydroxybutyric acid, the primary ketone involved in ketoacidosis. You should go to your doctor or the emergency room immediately for evaluation and treatment if you have diabetes, or you take care of someone with diabetes, and you notice any of the symptoms of DKA. Call 911 if the symptoms worsen quickly. Prompt treatment for DKA can save you or your loved one’s life. Your doctor will want to know the answers to these questions: Your doctor will perform a physical exam. They’ll also do a blood test to check your electrolytes, glucose, and acidity. The results from your blood test can help your doctor determine if you have DKA or other complications of diabetes. Your doctor may also perform: Illness can affect diabetes and increase your blood sugar level. The recommends that you check for ketones every four to six hours if you have a cold or the flu, or when your blood sugar is higher than 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). You can monitor blood sugar and ketones with over-the-counter test kits. You can using a blood test strip, and you can test for ketones using a urine test strip. Some blood glucose meters also have the ability to check for blood ketones like Nova Max Plus and Abbott Precision Xtra. If you have ketosis, you’ll not need to receive treatment. You may need to go to the emergency room or stay in the hospital if you have DKA. Treatment usually involves: replacement of electrolytes, such as chloride, sodium, or potassium intravenous insulin until your blood sugar level is below 240 mg/dL screening for other problems you may have, such as infection Ketosis generally isn’t dangerous. It’s usually related to a planned, low-carbohydrate diet or a transient condition related to diet. DKA can improve with treatment within . The first step after recovery from DKA is to review your recommended diet and insulin management program with your doctor. Make sure you understand what you have to do to keep diabetes under control. Talk to your doctor if you’re unclear about anything. Keeping a log can help you monitor your diabetes and flag any warning signs of possible DKA in the future. If you’re sick with a cold, the flu, or an infection, be especially alert for any possible symptoms of DKA. — — The Ketogenic Diet: A Detailed Beginner’s Guide to Keto The ketogenic diet (keto) is a low-carb, high-fat diet that causes weight loss and provides numerous health benefits.

f1a26adf-ed4f-41a6-85f6-8fa5901a7e07,"Are Low Carbohydrate Diets Good for Type 2 Diabetes? Obesity is one of the main problems, especially in the US, leading to health problems such as Type 2 diabetes. One popular diet for weight management to control diabetes is known as the low carb diet. As the name already states, in a low carb diet, carbohydrates within the diet are restricted. There are different -restricted diets, some of which restrict carbohydrates to very low levels without restricting dietary protein or fat (for example, the Atkins-style diet). Others allow moderate carbohydrate consumption together with moderate protein and fat intake (for example, South Beach and Zone). Very-low-carb diets limit protein to moderate levels, which introduces ketosis without restricting fat or total calories. The 2015 to 2020 Dietary Guidelines for America recommend three healthy eating patterns that including US healthy eating diet, a healthy Mediterranean diet, and the healthy vegetarian diet. The carbohydrates within a diet can be divided into simple and complex carbs. Simple carbohydrates such as sugar, white flour, and white rice have shown to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. To prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus, minimizing carbohydrate intake to total daily caloric consumption, as well as intake of foods with a low glycaemic index, is recommended. For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the American Diabetes Association recommends a moderate intake of carbohydrates (44%-46% of total calories). The carbohydrates should be taken from vegetables, legumes, fruits, low-fat dairy, and whole grains, with limited sugars from natural sources such as fruit. Brown rice and whole wheat products should replace white wheat products, and foods with added sugar should be avoided. Several studies have shown the effectiveness of a low carb diet for the purpose of weight loss. However, recent studies have emerged questioning whether this diet has any effects on patients with Type 2 diabetes. Worldwide, 382 million adults have diabetes. It is a major cause of death in patients under 60 years of age. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance. Overconsumption of food or certain types of food causes the pancreas to create extra insulin in order to keep blood glucose (or blood sugar) under control. Study explores link between aging, obesity, and metabolic diseases Including unhealthy foods may diminish benefits of Mediterranean diet Mother's diet while breastfeeding can shape the profile of human milk oligosaccharides Eventually, the blood glucose reaches an uncontrollable level because the pancreas can no longer keep up with the demand. Being inactive or overweight increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes. Food consumption is, therefore, linked to the . Symptoms of diabetes can include thirst, increased toilet trips, and tiredness. However, diabetes also increases the risks of heart attack and stroke. Diabetes can also cause problems with blood vessels outside the heart and brain. Irreversible nerve damage, vision problems and blindness, and kidney disease are signs of long-term diabetes. Other than medication, diet is the most important way to prevent and control diabetes and its complications. Effects of low carbohydrate diets for Type 2 diabetes Several studies have been conducted to try to determine the most healthful diet for persons with type 2 diabetes. Results have been conflicting because the types of diets, methods, and study sizes have all varied. However, a pattern has emerged. In 2005, Bodenstudied the effects of a low carb diet on ten obese people with Type 2 diabetes. The study reported improved 24-hour blood glucose profiles. Furthermore, the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; blood glucose) decreased from 7.3% to 6.8 % in only two weeks. These findings suggested that blood glucose levels were regulated by carbohydrate intake. Insulin sensitivity also improved due to an improved glucose-insulin ratio. This study was conducted for only two weeks, so the long-term effects of a low carb diet could not be determined. More recently, Skytte (2019) evaluated the dietary recommendations for people with type 2 diabetes. In the study, a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein (CRHP) diet was compared to iso-energetic conventional diabetes (CD) diet to see the effects on glycaemic control and selected cardiovascular risk markers during the six weeks. Patients had the same number of calories on each diet but exchanged some of the carbohydrates from the CD diet for protein in the CRHP diet. The trial concluded that, compared to the CD diet, the CRHP diet reduced HbA1c levels and fasting glucose levels. The study shows that substituting carbohydrates with protein and fat without increasing calories for six weeks reduced HbA1c and liver fat content in people with type 2 diabetes. Taken together, these two studies point to the likely benefits of replacing some carbohydrate intake with protein. However, this type of diet is very different from some popular high-protein and high-fat diets that encourage unrestricted or high levels of animal product intake. A 2019 review by showed that increasing animal product intake and following a low-carb diet increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. Eating high-quality plant-based foods prevents diabetes. It is generally accepted among healthcare providers and nutrition scientists that reducing simple carbohydrates in the diet (sweets, sodas, white bread, regular pasta) is important for improving diabetes outcomes and heart disease. When decreasing carbohydrate intake and increasing protein intake, patients with diabetes should focus on plant sources whenever possible (beans, legumes, soy, nuts). Lean meats and fish can be healthful sources of protein and fat for those who eat animal products. Impacts of low carbohydrate intake in patients with Type 2 diabetes All studies confirmed that a low carbohydrate diet could be beneficial for the management of Type 2 diabetes. In some patients, it even helped to discontinue or reduce their medication. Decreasing carbohydrate intake can be a healthful weight loss and diabetes control strategy, so long as carbohydrates are replaced with plant-based sources of protein and fat. Replacing carbohydrates with animal food sources increases the risk of diabetes and worsens glucose control for those with diabetes. Boden, G., 2013.

Reviewed by Last Updated: Looking for a no-hype guide to the ketogenic diet? From keto's effects on exercise, fat, muscle, and disease to potential long-term health issues that are often overlooked, we take a science-based approach to help you get the most out of your keto diet. Trust the science: this guide is light-years ahead of other reference material you'll find online. What is keto, and how is it different from ""low carb""? Humans have always used ketone bodies for fuel. Even if you've never ""gone keto"", you too have used ketone bodies. That's because they're present in low levels after a period of even short fasting, such as nightly sleep. After a typical period of sleep, ketone bodies supply 2–6% of your energy requirements, which bumps up to 30-40% after three days without any food. The official history of the ketogenic diets started in the 1920s as an epilepsy treatment, although ketone bodies themselves were first discovered in the mid 1800s, in the urine of patients with diabetes. From the mid 1900s onwards, ketogenic diets were used less and less, as medications were used for epilepsy control. They came back onto the scene in the early 2000s, in the form of a ""modified Atkins"" diet used for intractable seizures. In modern research studies, you may see keto interchangeably referred to as ""ketogenic diet"", ""low-carb ketogenic diet"" (LCKD), or ""very low-carb ketogenic diet"" (VLCKD). Occasionally, you may run into ""targeted ketogenic diet"" (TKD, where carb intake is concentrated into the hours around exercise) or ""cyclical ketogenic diet"" (CKD, where a few days of keto is followed by a day or two of higher carb intake). These are more typically referred to in online discussion of bodybuilding diets, and the occasional animal study. There are five major ways that ketones can become elevated. First, and most simply, fasting will lead to increased ketone production as your body's glycogen stores are depleted.  Second, prolonged exercise results in increased ketone production, especially if you're already eating a low-carb diet. Third, diabetes can result in elevated levels of ketones, not only in insulin-dependent type 1 and type 2 diabetics, but also in non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetics. Even if those who aren't yet diabetic, elevated levels of ketones can predict worse blood sugar control and development of diabetes in the following years. Fourth, supplementing with ketones themselves (i.e. exogenous ketones) or consuming large amounts of coconut fat (which contains medium chain triglyerides that can be broken down into ketones), will raise ketone levels even when not eating low-carb. Fifth, typical ketogenic diets will cause sustained ketone production due to low carb intake. Typical ketogenic diets can be supplemented with exogenous ketones as well, if higher ketone levels are desired, and MCT ketogenic diets with higher carb intake have been commonly used for epilepsy.  Some food groups are not feasible to include in a ketogenic diet on a regular basis due to carb content, such as grains. Other groups can be eaten ad libitum, such as animal products (other than honey). Many types of foods fall in a middle ground though, such as fruits and dairy. Too much of high-carb varieties can cause you to eclipse your carb limit and be kicked out of ketosis. Keto is only effective if you maintain it; occasional keto is fine but yo-yo dieting with keto followed by carb binges is not. Keto dieters tend to eat less than higher carb dieters when given free reign to choose their food. This is a boon for adherence. When looking at all trials measuring adherence, keto had a similar adherence rate as other diets, at around 24%. That being said, carb intake, on average, creeps up over time in longer-term studies, with longer term studies having similar adherence as longer term non-keto studies. This masks individual differences though - some stick to it strictly, others go way off track. In a two-year open-label (non-randomized) study, dropout rates were 35% for the keto group and 28% for the control group. The most reliable data for side effects and adverse events come from large trials in children with epilepsy. These show varying rates of a variety of possible side effects, from infrequent gallstones and elevated liver enzymes to more frequent elevated lipids and gastrointestinal upset. Some side effects such as nausea and vomiting may be more likely in the first weeks of the diet, as you adapt to higher ketone levels. Also, acetone can be exhaled and is a fairly accurate marker of ketosis, but can unfortunately also be perceived as ""bad breath"" by some. Certain electrolytes (specifically calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium) can be low on keto diets. If you're low on any of these, supplementation or changing your food choices to more nutrient-dense foods can reduce side effects. There are several health conditions for which keto is absolutely contraindicated, such as Porphyria and genetic deficiencies like fatty acid beta-oxidation defects. Other contexts haven't had much if any keto research, and caution is warranted, such as with pregnancy and eating disorders. For those undergoing a keto diet for serious medical conditions such as epilepsy, accidentally ingesting too much carbohydrate via medication or supplement can disrupt ketosis and indirectly cause danger through reduced diet efficacy. Chewable and liquid medication may have relatively high carb levels, not all of which are accurately labeled. Several objections have been raised to low-carb diets including keto, positing theories of harm but not yet showing it through trial evidence. One such objection is that a lack of carbohydrate could be detrimental to gut and immune health. This doesn't appear to be born out in trials, which rather often show either a neutral or beneficial effect for gut health. However, there is much uncertainty here. Researchers have found that ketogenic diets in children with epilepsy reduces levels of certain beneficial bacteria. Whether this has any health implications, though, is uncertain. Because keto has also been proposed as a general strategy for weight loss and diabetes prevention, some researchers have recommended a more moderate low-carb diet (100-150 grams of carbs) given the relative lack of long-term safety data for ketogenic diets. There is a perception that micronutrient intake will be low on ketogenic diets. That is not necessarily the case, as keto diets that are well-formulated (similar to the case for any other diet) can meet all micronutrient requirements. A ketogenic diet that's consistently high in red meat, though, could theoretically contribute to iron overload in those who are genetically susceptible. Too much iron is implicated in Alzheimer’s, heart disease, and colorectal cancer. Nearly one million Americans who have genetic susceptibility due to having hereditary hemochromatosis, a condition where you absorb too much dietary iron. In most studies, keto diets decrease hunger and desire to eat. The most important factor in this may be swapping refined carbohydrate for protein, as protein is the most satiating macronutrient. Ketone bodies themselves may also reduce appetite, although this is still an open research question. There are two types of studies looking at fat mass: free-living studies (where you assign one group a keto diet and another non-keto, and track their fat loss over time) and metabolic ward studies (where you consign participants in each group to a metabolic ward, to tightly control their diet). The former can be much longer than the latter, but lack of dietary control can make results less reliable. Free-living studies do, however, reflect real-world adherence and regular life better. Metabolic ward studies show similar fat loss in keto dieters as non-keto dieters, over the course of 2-4 weeks. This is also the result of a well-designed two month metabolic ward study. Free-living studies tend to show slightly greater fat loss in keto dieters, although results aren't consistent.  Out of studies that paired exercise with keto diets, and compared them to non-keto diets plus exercise, the findings are mixed. While the non-keto groups often appear to show better mass retention, much of that may be due to keto groups losing water weight, which is counted as lean mass in body composition measurements. Initial weight loss on a keto diet (meaning the first week) is nearly entirely water and glycogen, rather than fat. You simply cannot lose several pounds of fat in one week absent extreme situations. As you ratchet down carbs, you use up liver glycogen. Since each gram of glycogen is paired with about 2.4 grams of water, a full male liver is heavier by 289–432 grams (0.6–1.0 lb), and a full female liver is heavier by 241–364 grams (0.5–0.8 lb). Eventually, you'll tap more and more into your muscle glycogen and empty those stores as well, to the tune of 1.1-1.4 kg (2.4-3.2 lb). Adding this to your liver glycogen, it's easy to lose at least 2-3 kg (5-7 lb) or more of glycogen and water weight. The ketogenic diet hasn't been tested in randomized trials for acne, eczema, and other common skin conditions. Researchers have proposed that keto may help skin conditions such as acne and psoriasis, and case studies have been reported, but human trials are currently lacking. On the flip side, two case studies have been published on increased carbs helping treat Prurigo pigmentosa (a rare inflammatory dermatitis) in two people who had been on keto diets. Ketosis was proposed to be involved in the initiation of the condition. Body Composition Changes After Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet in Obesity Evaluated by 3 Standardized Methods. .

Reviewed by Last Updated: Looking for a no-hype guide to the ketogenic diet? From keto's effects on exercise, fat, muscle, and disease to potential long-term health issues that are often overlooked, we take a science-based approach to help you get the most out of your keto diet. Trust the science: this guide is light-years ahead of other reference material you'll find online. What is keto, and how is it different from ""low carb""? Humans have always used ketone bodies for fuel. Even if you've never ""gone keto"", you too have used ketone bodies. That's because they're present in low levels after a period of even short fasting, such as nightly sleep. After a typical period of sleep, ketone bodies supply 2–6% of your energy requirements, which bumps up to 30-40% after three days without any food. The official history of the ketogenic diets started in the 1920s as an epilepsy treatment, although ketone bodies themselves were first discovered in the mid 1800s, in the urine of patients with diabetes. From the mid 1900s onwards, ketogenic diets were used less and less, as medications were used for epilepsy control. They came back onto the scene in the early 2000s, in the form of a ""modified Atkins"" diet used for intractable seizures. In modern research studies, you may see keto interchangeably referred to as ""ketogenic diet"", ""low-carb ketogenic diet"" (LCKD), or ""very low-carb ketogenic diet"" (VLCKD). Occasionally, you may run into ""targeted ketogenic diet"" (TKD, where carb intake is concentrated into the hours around exercise) or ""cyclical ketogenic diet"" (CKD, where a few days of keto is followed by a day or two of higher carb intake). These are more typically referred to in online discussion of bodybuilding diets, and the occasional animal study. There are five major ways that ketones can become elevated. First, and most simply, fasting will lead to increased ketone production as your body's glycogen stores are depleted.  Second, prolonged exercise results in increased ketone production, especially if you're already eating a low-carb diet. Third, diabetes can result in elevated levels of ketones, not only in insulin-dependent type 1 and type 2 diabetics, but also in non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetics. Even if those who aren't yet diabetic, elevated levels of ketones can predict worse blood sugar control and development of diabetes in the following years. Fourth, supplementing with ketones themselves (i.e. exogenous ketones) or consuming large amounts of coconut fat (which contains medium chain triglyerides that can be broken down into ketones), will raise ketone levels even when not eating low-carb. Fifth, typical ketogenic diets will cause sustained ketone production due to low carb intake. Typical ketogenic diets can be supplemented with exogenous ketones as well, if higher ketone levels are desired, and MCT ketogenic diets with higher carb intake have been commonly used for epilepsy.  Some food groups are not feasible to include in a ketogenic diet on a regular basis due to carb content, such as grains. Other groups can be eaten ad libitum, such as animal products (other than honey). Many types of foods fall in a middle ground though, such as fruits and dairy. Too much of high-carb varieties can cause you to eclipse your carb limit and be kicked out of ketosis. Keto is only effective if you maintain it; occasional keto is fine but yo-yo dieting with keto followed by carb binges is not. Keto dieters tend to eat less than higher carb dieters when given free reign to choose their food. This is a boon for adherence. When looking at all trials measuring adherence, keto had a similar adherence rate as other diets, at around 24%. That being said, carb intake, on average, creeps up over time in longer-term studies, with longer term studies having similar adherence as longer term non-keto studies. This masks individual differences though - some stick to it strictly, others go way off track. In a two-year open-label (non-randomized) study, dropout rates were 35% for the keto group and 28% for the control group. The most reliable data for side effects and adverse events come from large trials in children with epilepsy. These show varying rates of a variety of possible side effects, from infrequent gallstones and elevated liver enzymes to more frequent elevated lipids and gastrointestinal upset. Some side effects such as nausea and vomiting may be more likely in the first weeks of the diet, as you adapt to higher ketone levels. Also, acetone can be exhaled and is a fairly accurate marker of ketosis, but can unfortunately also be perceived as ""bad breath"" by some. Certain electrolytes (specifically calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium) can be low on keto diets. If you're low on any of these, supplementation or changing your food choices to more nutrient-dense foods can reduce side effects. There are several health conditions for which keto is absolutely contraindicated, such as Porphyria and genetic deficiencies like fatty acid beta-oxidation defects. Other contexts haven't had much if any keto research, and caution is warranted, such as with pregnancy and eating disorders. For those undergoing a keto diet for serious medical conditions such as epilepsy, accidentally ingesting too much carbohydrate via medication or supplement can disrupt ketosis and indirectly cause danger through reduced diet efficacy. Chewable and liquid medication may have relatively high carb levels, not all of which are accurately labeled. Several objections have been raised to low-carb diets including keto, positing theories of harm but not yet showing it through trial evidence. One such objection is that a lack of carbohydrate could be detrimental to gut and immune health. This doesn't appear to be born out in trials, which rather often show either a neutral or beneficial effect for gut health. However, there is much uncertainty here. Researchers have found that ketogenic diets in children with epilepsy reduces levels of certain beneficial bacteria. Whether this has any health implications, though, is uncertain. Because keto has also been proposed as a general strategy for weight loss and diabetes prevention, some researchers have recommended a more moderate low-carb diet (100-150 grams of carbs) given the relative lack of long-term safety data for ketogenic diets. There is a perception that micronutrient intake will be low on ketogenic diets. That is not necessarily the case, as keto diets that are well-formulated (similar to the case for any other diet) can meet all micronutrient requirements. A ketogenic diet that's consistently high in red meat, though, could theoretically contribute to iron overload in those who are genetically susceptible. Too much iron is implicated in Alzheimer’s, heart disease, and colorectal cancer. Nearly one million Americans who have genetic susceptibility due to having hereditary hemochromatosis, a condition where you absorb too much dietary iron. In most studies, keto diets decrease hunger and desire to eat. The most important factor in this may be swapping refined carbohydrate for protein, as protein is the most satiating macronutrient. Ketone bodies themselves may also reduce appetite, although this is still an open research question. There are two types of studies looking at fat mass: free-living studies (where you assign one group a keto diet and another non-keto, and track their fat loss over time) and metabolic ward studies (where you consign participants in each group to a metabolic ward, to tightly control their diet). The former can be much longer than the latter, but lack of dietary control can make results less reliable. Free-living studies do, however, reflect real-world adherence and regular life better. Metabolic ward studies show similar fat loss in keto dieters as non-keto dieters, over the course of 2-4 weeks. This is also the result of a well-designed two month metabolic ward study. Free-living studies tend to show slightly greater fat loss in keto dieters, although results aren't consistent.  Out of studies that paired exercise with keto diets, and compared them to non-keto diets plus exercise, the findings are mixed. While the non-keto groups often appear to show better mass retention, much of that may be due to keto groups losing water weight, which is counted as lean mass in body composition measurements. Initial weight loss on a keto diet (meaning the first week) is nearly entirely water and glycogen, rather than fat. You simply cannot lose several pounds of fat in one week absent extreme situations. As you ratchet down carbs, you use up liver glycogen. Since each gram of glycogen is paired with about 2.4 grams of water, a full male liver is heavier by 289–432 grams (0.6–1.0 lb), and a full female liver is heavier by 241–364 grams (0.5–0.8 lb). Eventually, you'll tap more and more into your muscle glycogen and empty those stores as well, to the tune of 1.1-1.4 kg (2.4-3.2 lb). Adding this to your liver glycogen, it's easy to lose at least 2-3 kg (5-7 lb) or more of glycogen and water weight. The ketogenic diet hasn't been tested in randomized trials for acne, eczema, and other common skin conditions. Researchers have proposed that keto may help skin conditions such as acne and psoriasis, and case studies have been reported, but human trials are currently lacking. On the flip side, two case studies have been published on increased carbs helping treat Prurigo pigmentosa (a rare inflammatory dermatitis) in two people who had been on keto diets. Ketosis was proposed to be involved in the initiation of the condition. Body Composition Changes After Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet in Obesity Evaluated by 3 Standardized Methods. .

1143b184-583b-4ca2-a833-97b1f1818ec4,"Keto Diet Can Help You Live Longer, Researchers Say — Two recent studies concluded that the low-carbohydrate diet can increase life span. However, there is still plenty of controversy surrounding the Keto diet. Has the fountain of youth been sitting on your dinner plate? Two new independently concluded that a ketogenic diet increased lifespan and preserved memory and motor function in mice. For advocates of the diet, the results are another feather in their cap, but the question remains if the science really outweighs the hype for humans. “The conclusion we draw out of this is that it’s a robust effect,” said Dr. Eric Verdin, president and chief executive officer of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and senior author of one of the papers, in a press release. “The two studies reinforce each other because they both show the same global effect on healthspan.” “This is a really exciting finding and long overdue,” Susan A. Masino, PhD, a professor of applied science at Trinity College in Connecticut, told Healthline. “[Ketogenic diets] mimic the metabolic state of fasting, or caloric restriction — which has many similar benefits.” Masino has spent years researching the ketogenic diet, metabolism, and brain health — that is, how what we eat affects our brains. In Verdin’s study, some mice were fed between 70 percent and 90 percent of their daily food calories from fat. That was compared with control groups receiving only 13 percent to 17 percent from fat, with carbohydrate calories making up the bulk of the difference. The mice on higher fat diets had longer lives, lower midlife mortality rates, and performed better on tests pertaining to certain cognitive functioning. The results “clearly demonstrate that lifespan is increased in mice consuming a ketogenic diet,” compared with a control group, the authors wrote. But, it’s impossible to say that such a conclusion could be reproduced in humans. As such, some experts are more measured in their assessment of these findings. , MS, RDN, CDE, CDN, a dietitian and diabetes educator, agrees that the results are promising, but she cautions that it is still “too soon to recommend” the diet to many individuals. The ketogenic diet has become pervasive in the United States in both popular culture and fitness circles for its myriad health benefits, but it remains contentious. The diet is based on the simple premise that when carbohydrate intake is drastically lowered, or stopped entirely, the body must find a new primary source of energy. Ketosis is , which is the leading cause of death of people with diabetes under 24 years of age. Ketosis is identified by the presence of ketones in the bloodstream, a chemical that the body produces when it burns stored fat. The ketogenic diet has proven effective in helping to in some people with epilepsy. Advocates have also hailed its ability to help shed pounds. These new results, Masino said, are further proof of what some researchers, herself included, have believed for years. However, any time a diet, scientifically backed or not, takes over Americans’ dinner plates, there are bound to be complications. on the ketogenic diet pointed out a number of problems individuals can have with the diet. These include the risk of muscle loss, fatigue, and, of course, the many health issues associated with yo-yo or fad dieting. Even in that story, many experts were at odds with each other. But Weiner and Masino both agree that for the average American, cutting down on carbs is probably a good thing. “Most adults would benefit from reducing the overall amount of carbohydrate in their diet significantly,” said Masino. “Following a strict ketogenic diet is probably not necessary or realistic for most people unless they have very specific health goals.” The “unrealistic” aspect of the ketogenic diet is that it can actually be difficult to maintain. It requires a strict adherence to a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, with little wiggle room for “cheat meals,” and absolutely no sweets or alcohol. “In any kind of nutrition change there has to be sustainability,” said Weiner. For individuals who are out to lose weight, choosing a difficult diet can be taxing, and may cause further setbacks rather than help. “When you stop short, it does affect people feeling bad about themselves because they can’t keep up with it necessarily at the pace that it’s being recommended,” Weiner said. “So they feel it’s another failure in their trying to lose weight.” The ketogenic diet has been called “antisocial” because dining out becomes difficult, depending on how strictly one is adhering to the diet. Even when preparing food at home, time management and cost are also factors for individuals who want to cook their own meals. “The social and economic situations affect this decision as well,” said Weiner. The bottom line is that individuals hoping to embark on a nutritional diet should be aware of the multifold ways in which it can impact their lives, beyond potential health benefits or harms. While this new research on the ketogenic diet is exciting, there still remains significant work to be done in human trials. Even then, it may not be beneficial for everyone. But as interest in it continues to grow among the general public, the more informed decision an individual can make about their diet, the better. Weiner said proponents of this [diet] suggest that our current nutritional habits may lead to an increase incidence of obesity, prediabetes, cancer and type 2 diabetes. More studies are needed to determine if the ketogenic diet should be recommended for those at high risk for developing these conditions. For most Americans, having to adhere to a strict ketogenic diet is more difficult than simpler dietary steps such as eating fewer sweets and carbohydrates, and eating more fresh vegetables. — The Keto Diet Is Gaining Popularity, But Is It Safe?

4d2dd83c-d531-4554-b62d-8ff08e3e614b,"/ / What happens when you cheat on your keto diet? Cheating on a keto diet can be disastrous, says expert. By: | Cheats day have become an integral part of a diet and workout routine. After days of slogging it out at the gym and watching what you eat, you start craving for sugary desserts and deep-fried treats. It is not so much a weight loss tool as a psychological coping mechanism for restrictive diets that keeps you from falling off the wagon. Keto diet bans consumption of carbohydrates beyond 30 gms per day. Some people may find this extremely restrictive and start craving carb-rich foods like bread, cake and other desserts within just days of going on the diet. But will cheating on your keto diet interfere with weight loss? Also Read - Keto Diet: Is this low-carb diet good for your health? Also Read - Ketogenic diet can lead to flu-like symptoms during first few weeks, says study Also Read - “The ketogenic diet is a low carbohydrate, high fat, moderate protein (LCHF) diet. Most people do keto to help in weight loss; but, it also has other health advantages like: lowering risk for heart disease, cancer, stroke, helping those with epilepsy and other neurological illnesses,” explains Rinki Kumari, chief dietician, Fortis Bangalore. Here are the Unlike other generic diets, the keto diet alters the way your body utilises energy from food. Rinki says that when you eat food with carbohydrates, your body produces glucose and insulin. “Carbs are broken down into glucose, a single molecule of sugar that body uses for energy. Since glucose is the simplest molecule, the body will choose it over any other energy source,” she says. Since glucose is the body’s first choice, fats are not used and get stored. Read this before you But a keto diet alters this process by putting your body into a state of ketosis by creating a shortage of carbohydrates. In the absence of carbs, the body utilises fats for fuel. “Keto is meant to put your body into a state of ketosis, where burn ketones for fuel (ketosis) instead of glucose (glycolysis),” she says. On a keto diet, your body achieve a ketosis stage, where the chief source of fuel is fat instead of carbohydrates. A single cheat meal can change that, and you may go into the glycolysis state again, where your body uses glucose for energy. This will cost you all the hard work you undertook to achieve ketosis. When you cheat on your keto diet with a high-carb food, an energy crash follows. Rinki recommends that you take a cup of coffee or tea with coconut oil or medium chain triglyceride oils to counter the crash that comes after a cheat meal. It will help you get some of your energy back. Soon after you indulge in a pizza or a burger, insulin levels go up and you tend to feel hungry again sooner than you would on a ketogenic diet. What you get next is a vicious circle of more and more snacking. Constantly cheating on your keto diet will cause weight gain. Immediate effects of a carb-rich meal during a keto diet is water retention and water weight. Too many of those cheat diets will ruin the effect of ketosis and you’ll be back to your old self, gaining more weight. When you breach your ketosis state with carbohydrates, the ketone levels in your blood start fluctuating. This will make it difficult for your body to get into the ketosis state and burn fat instead of carbs. Keto flu, seen at the start of a keto diet when your body goes from glycolysis to ketosis, returns with a bang. You start experiencing symptoms such as headache, bloating, gastric disturbances and low energy all over again. The ice diet claims to aid weight loss.

f673d345-f066-4056-967c-421d746e40ca,"— Medically reviewed by The low carb and keto diets are two popular ways of eating that involve restricting your carb intake. Given that they both limit carbs, you may wonder what sets the two apart. This article reviews the differences between the low carb and keto diets, the pros and cons of each, as well as which one may be a better option for you. A low carb diet is a way of eating that restricts dietary , mainly from grains, sugar-sweetened beverages, and bread. Studies suggest that a low carb diet comprises 10–30% of calories from carbs, although there is no set definition. For a healthy person who consumes 2,000 calories per day, this equals 50–150 grams of carbs (, ). When , it’s common to increase your intake of protein, healthy fats, and vegetables to replace the carbs and promote fullness. Also, by restricting carbs, you eliminate many high calorie foods from your diet. All these factors may work together to reduce your overall calorie intake and promote weight loss (, ). A low carb diet has been linked to several health benefits in , including weight loss and improved blood sugar control and cardiovascular risk factors (). It’s also commonly used to induce weight loss (, ). While a low carb diet may not be for everyone, it can be a viable weight loss option for most healthy people. A low carb diet restricts carbs, such as grains, rice, and starchy vegetables, to 10–30% of your overall calorie intake, which may lead to weight loss. You should consider the diet’s pros and cons before starting it. The ketogenic — or keto — diet is a very low carb, high fat diet that has gained popularity in recent years. The has several therapeutic properties, such as helping treat refractory epilepsy. Promising research shows it may also impair the growth of certain types of cancer. Furthermore, some people utilize it to lose weight (, , ). When following a keto diet, the goal is to reach . In this state, your body produces ketones from fat in your liver and uses fat as its main fuel source instead of carbs.

This puts your body in a state of nutritional ketosis, which promotes the use of fat as a primary fuel source. The diet’s pros and cons should be considered before starting it. When it comes to choosing between the low carb and keto diets, there are several factors to consider. The main difference between these diets is carbohydrate intake. On a low carb diet, you typically eat 50–150 grams of carbs per day, but on the keto diet, daily carb intake is restricted to fewer than 50 grams. Another main difference is protein intake. With low carb diets, may be high, but with keto diets, protein intake should be moderate at around 20% of total calories. This is because excessive protein intake can prevent ketosis (). Additionally, fat intake tends to be significantly higher on the keto diet, as fats replace carbs and protein. The keto diet may be too restrictive for most people, leading to poor long-term adherence. Furthermore, the keto diet is more likely to cause (). Therefore, a low carb diet is likely a better option for most people. That said, it’s important to consult your healthcare provider before starting any diet to reduce your risk of complications.

79d41760-f609-4a7d-a1ee-2a96b7f4f43d,"— From the Keto “flu” to low libido, here’s how the diet can affect you. It seems like everyone is praising the keto diet these days. But if you’re considering this diet, you’ll probably want to know about the side effects before you decide if it’s right for you. The keto diet requires adhering to an extremely low-carb, high-fat diet in order to put your body into a metabolic state called ketosis. This makes your body more efficient at burning fat. In recent weeks, the keto diet has been in the because some experts say it can cause changes in libido. “The ketogenic diet can definitely result in a drop in libido when starting the diet, as the dieter will be experiencing symptoms of carb withdrawal and potentially the keto flu,” noted Dr. Nancy P. Rahnama, a bariatric and internal medicine doctor based in California. “Once the withdrawal and flu-like symptoms have passed, and the dieter has adapted to the lower-carb lifestyle, the libido will most likely reset and potentially be better than prior as a result of weight loss from the diet,” she said. While the libido warning got a lot of notoriety in the media, actual research confirming this side effect was hard to come by. “Overall, ketogenic research is limited,” said Stephanie McKercher, a Colorado-based registered dietitian and recipe developer at The Grateful Grazer. “We need more studies to fully understand all of the potential adverse effects of this diet.” She pointed out that the diet was originally developed for a medical purpose to aid people with epilepsy. However, there are some side effects, that are well known and that any aspiring keto dieter can get ready for. Most people already know about the keto flu, which can happen when you start the diet. It’s a result of the body adapting to the low-carb state. Lowering carb intake forces the body to burn ketones for energy instead of glucose. Once the body is in ketosis — burning fat instead of glucose — the keto diet is working. But you may not feel so great at first, hence the term keto flu. Symptoms of the keto flu can include everything from headache, weakness, and irritability, to constipation, nausea, and vomiting. “With the start of the keto diet, the body switches from using sugar as a source of energy to using the body’s stored fat,” Rahnama explained. “In the process of breaking down fat, the body produces ketones, which are then removed by the body through frequent and increased urination. This may lead to dehydration and flu-like symptoms, such as fatigue, dizziness, irritability, nausea, and muscle soreness.” “With this frequent urination, there is also the inevitable loss of electrolytes, which can exacerbate these symptoms. In addition, as carbohydrates are a source of energy and stimulation, removal of this source of energy will result in increased sugar cravings, brain fog, [and] difficulty concentrating, much like most other withdrawal symptoms.” For most people, the keto flu only lasts about a week. Because the body can be low on electrolytes and fluid on top of the increased urination, that can lead to a loss of electrolytes such as sodium, magnesium, and potassium. This can make people prone to acute kidney injury. “Dehydration is serious and may result in lightheadedness, kidney injury, or kidney stones,” she said. This may put the dieter at risk of a cardiac arrhythmia, as electrolytes are necessary for the normal beating of the heart, Rahnama added. “Electrolyte deficiencies are serious and may results in an irregular heartbeat, which can be deadly,” she added. The keto diet can also lead to yo-yo dieting, because people have difficulty staying on the restrictive diet permanently. There are few long-term studies on the keto diet, which may be because it’s difficult to follow, so people aren’t staying on it for a long time. “If trying to go keto causes you to yo-yo and go off and on diets, that has impacts related to weigh fluctuations and increased mortality risk,” added Sharon Palmer, a dietitian from California. Other side effects can include bad breath, fatigue, constipation, irregular menstrual cycles, decreased bone density, and sleep issues. Then there are other effects that are not well studied, mostly because it’s hard to track dieters on a long-term basis to find out the lasting effects of the eating plan. “We don’t know for sure the effects on blood cholesterol, some studies show increases, others show decreases, but we don’t know over the long-term because of a lack of research,” Palmer said. “There is a fear among health experts that such high intakes of unhealthful fats would have a long-term negative effect,” she explained. Weight loss can often confuse the data in the short term. This is because when overweight people lose weight, regardless of how they do it, they often end up with better blood lipids and blood glucose levels. The keto diet is also extremely low in certain fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes that are generally thought of as healthy. Without these foods, people on the diet can miss out on fiber, certain vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals that only come in these foods. That has significant human health impacts over the long term such as bone loss and increased risk of chronic diseases. “Hundreds of studies suggest that diets rich in whole plant foods are linked with significantly lower levels of diseases like osteoporosis, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes,” Palmer said. “So, do people want to risk their long-term health just to lose weight more quickly?” Not all patients are appropriate candidates for the keto diet, especially those with chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or other conditions that may be the result of a previous diet, Rahnama noted. She also pointed out that this diet can result in such a big change for many people’s metabolic and other bodily systems, that adhering to the diet may even change the effectiveness of a person’s medication. Patients need to be evaluated and monitored by a physician when they start a keto diet due to the level of dietary restriction. They may need to begin electrolyte supplementation or change any daily medication dosages they take. Talking to your doctor before you begin is a smart idea. Got the keto diet go-ahead? You’ll want to boost your water intake before you start. “Some patients may need to supplement with sodium, as long as they do not have blood pressure issues. Some may even need prescription potassium supplementation,” Rahnama said, adding that she begins all keto diet patients on a magnesium supplement, as it’s an electrolyte that can be taken with low risk of overdose. She also said keto dieters may have to up their carb intake if they have continued issues with hydration. “Keto is not a great long-term diet, as it is not a balanced diet,” Rahnama said. “A diet that is devoid of fruit and vegetables will result in long-term micronutrient deficiencies that can have other consequences.” The keto diet can be used for short-term fat loss so long as the patient is medically supervised. But it’s not a permanent weight loss or maintenance solution, Rahnama said. “The keto diet is a very successful way for rapid weight loss as long as it is done safely, you do not want to cause bigger problems in order to solve a smaller one,” she added. — The Ketogenic Diet: A Detailed Beginner’s Guide to Keto The ketogenic diet (keto) is a low-carb, high-fat diet that causes weight loss and provides numerous health benefits.

Instead of following the science, we’ve demonized fat and animal protein, and urged patients to follow a carbohydrate-rich, plant-based diet while exercising to “burn off calories”; this paradigm has failed miserably, with ever-escalating percentages of Americans overweight and developing metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Drawing from research, interviews with hundreds of experts, and his own personal experience, Taubes describes the benefits of high-fat, low-carb dieting.

1d5e4b69-414b-4b2a-8aa5-ffb24af0df18,"I believe one of the most-studied strategies in the recent years for weight management is the ketogenic diet. Many studies have shown that this kind of nutritional approach has a solid physiological and biochemical basis and is able to help the body burn fat as fuel to support a healthy weight while also offering other health benefits.  New to the ketogenic diet (or keto diet) and keto-friendly foods … and wondering how it works? Here’s a quick rundown of what a keto diet is and what I believe are the top 6 benefits. The ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet plan. It was originally designed in the 1920s for a specific purpose, but there was more to the diet that caught researchers’ attention. They discovered that fasting came with some additional benefits that are generally acquired only through a radical overhaul of the diet. Now, you and I both know that long-term fasting (or even short-term fasting for some people) is not a feasible option. It is typically meant for no more than a day or so, and must be approached carefully and under the supervision of a health professional. So, researchers kept digging. And the ketogenic diet was born. It’s a diet designed to mimic similar beneficial effects of fasting — without completely eliminating certain foods, or being laden with the risks and unsustainability that can come with a drastic, extended reduction in calories. Today, the ketogenic diet goes by several different names, including “keto.” But what does “keto” stand for exactly? Keto is short for “ketogenic” or “ketosis.” Following a ketogenic diet can put the body into a state of “ketosis.” Here’s what it all means: When the body has the ability to burn fat as fuel, the liver naturally creates fats called . Ketones can burn fat more efficiently than carbs can, which, in turn, creates a balanced environment for maintaining a healthy weight and overall health.   Long story short, eating fewer carbs, more healthy fats and moderate protein fuels the body to achieve , in which most of the body’s energy comes from ketone bodies in the blood, rather than from glucose. This is in contrast to a glycolytic state, where blood glucose (sugar) provides most of the body’s fuel (or energy). Once ketone levels in the blood rise to a certain point, then the person has officially entered into a state of ketosis. While everyone is different, generally, people usually enter into ketosis after 3-to-4 days of following a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet that forces the need for an alternative energy source: body fat! Typically, when following a ketogenic diet, the body burns fat for energy rather than carbohydrates. In the process, a person can enter the fat-burning zone rapidly, even when consuming lots of fat and adequate calories through the diet. Low-carb, high-fat, moderate-protein diets (such as keto) have been used for decades to help people maintain a healthy weight. By consuming a higher-fat/lower- carb diet, the body is retrained to use fat as an energy source, allowing the body to tap into its own fat reserves for energy. High-fat diets such as the keto diet can actually reduce appetite — even when restricting calories. This is due to the satiating nature of fat-rich foods. Not interested in the fat-burning aspect of a keto diet? Keto may still be right for you. A big reason why so many people love the ketogenic diet is due to its support of mental clarity. In fact, the keto diet is becoming incredibly popular in many high-performance career fields. Many with sensitive guts shudder at the thought of eating a high-fat, low-carb diet because increased fat intake can sometimes boost bowel transit time. But this is generally only a short-lived side effect. Overall, a low-carb diet can support a healthy gut, so the keto diet may be a great “gut” option! The keto diet and lifestyle has also been show to help support a healthy response to stress—and who wouldn’t want that? What’s probably most shocking about a ketogenic diet is how it reportedly supports energy levels. How is that possible? Fat (and the ketones produced from fat) are readily available source of fuel. Once someone is fat-adapted and in ketosis, they will typically find that they can easily go for hours without certain foods and not come up short on energy. There’s a solid amount of benefits for those who make the switch to a After reading this, if you are interested in trying the ketogenic diet, be sure you check with your medical professional prior to beginning. Here’s why: As with any dietary or lifestyle regimen, before attempting a ketogenic diet in any capacity, I recommend you try it ONLY with the support of your doctor or other health professional. Also, if you are interested in trying the ketogenic diet, be sure check out my  designed to help you as you embark on a “keto” journey. Of course, the ketogenic diet of high-fat, low-carb and moderate-protein foods is primary, but I believe this combination of step-by-step coaching, supplements, meal plans, regular exercise and other lifestyle measures can help you maximize your experience with the keto diet.

2ecf08fb-8b66-4569-8204-59ac75c02f4e,"15 Health Conditions That May Benefit From a Ketogenic Diet — Early research suggests this high-fat, very low-carb diet may benefit several health conditions. Although some of the evidence is from case studies and animal research, results from human controlled studies are also promising. Here are 15 health conditions that may benefit from a ketogenic diet. Epilepsy is a disease that causes seizures due to excessive brain activity. Anti-seizure medications are effective for some people with epilepsy. However, others don’t respond to the drugs or can’t tolerate their side effects. Of all the conditions that may benefit from a , epilepsy has by far the most evidence supporting it. In fact, there are several dozen studies on the topic. Research shows that seizures typically improve in about 50% of epilepsy patients who follow the classic ketogenic diet. This is also known as a 4:1 ketogenic diet because it provides 4 times as much fat as protein and carbs combined (, , ). The modified (MAD) is based on a considerably less restrictive 1:1 ratio of fat to protein and carbs. It has been shown to be equally effective for seizure control in most adults and children older than two years of age (, , , , ). The ketogenic diet may also have benefits on the brain beyond seizure control. For example, when researchers examined the brain activity of children with epilepsy, they found improvements in various brain patterns in 65% of those following a ketogenic diet — regardless of whether they had fewer seizures (). Ketogenic diets have been shown to reduce seizure frequency and severity in many children and adults with epilepsy who don’t respond well to drug therapy. Metabolic syndrome, sometimes referred to as prediabetes, is characterized by . You can be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome if you meet any 3 of these criteria: 35 inches (89 cm) or higher in women and 40 inches (102 cm) or higher in men. 150 mg/dl (1.7 mmol/L) or higher. Less than 40 mg/dL (1.04 mmol/L) in men and less than 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) in women. 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) or higher. People with metabolic syndrome are at increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and other serious disorders related to insulin resistance. Fortunately, following a ketogenic diet may improve many features of metabolic syndrome. Improvements may include better cholesterol values, as well as reduced blood sugar and blood pressure (, , , , ). In a controlled 12-week study, people with metabolic syndrome on a calorie-restricted ketogenic diet lost 14% of their body fat. They decreased triglycerides by more than 50% and experienced several other improvements in health markers (). Ketogenic diets may reduce abdominal obesity, triglycerides, blood pressure and blood sugar in people with metabolic syndrome. People with glycogen storage disease (GSD) lack one of the enzymes involved in storing glucose (blood sugar) as glycogen or breaking glycogen down into glucose. There are several types of GSD, each based on the enzyme that is missing. Typically, this disease is diagnosed in childhood. Symptoms vary depending on the type of GSD, and may include poor growth, fatigue, low blood sugar, muscle cramps and an enlarged liver. GSD patients are often advised to consume at frequent intervals so glucose is always available to the body (, ). However, early research suggests that a ketogenic diet may benefit people with some forms of GSD. For example, GSD III, also known as Forbes-Cori disease, affects the liver and muscles. Ketogenic diets may help relieve symptoms by providing ketones that can be used as an alternate fuel source (, , ). GSD V, also known as McArdle disease, affects the muscles and is characterized by a limited ability to exercise (). In one case, a man with GSD V followed a ketogenic diet for one year. Depending on the level of exertion required, he experienced a dramatic 3- to 10-fold increase in exercise tolerance (). However, controlled studies are needed to confirm the potential benefits of ketogenic diet therapy in people with glycogen storage disease. People with certain types of glycogen storage disease may experience a dramatic improvement in symptoms while following a ketogenic diet. However, more research is needed. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disease marked by hormonal dysfunction that often results in irregular periods and infertility. One of its hallmarks is insulin resistance, and many women with PCOS are obese and have a hard time losing weight. Women with PCOS are also at an increased risk for type 2 diabetes (). Those who meet the criteria for metabolic syndrome tend to have symptoms that affect their appearance. Effects may include increased facial hair, acne and other signs of masculinity related to higher (). A lot of anecdotal evidence can be found online. However, only a few published studies confirm the benefits of and ketogenic diets for PCOS (, ). In a 6-month study of eleven women with PCOS following a ketogenic diet, weight loss averaged 12%. Fasting insulin also declined by 54% and reproductive hormone levels improved. Two women suffering from infertility (). Women with PCOS following a ketogenic diet may experience weight loss, reduction in insulin levels and improvement in reproductive hormone function. People with diabetes often experience impressive on a ketogenic diet. This is true of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Indeed, dozens of controlled studies show that a very low-carb diet helps control blood sugar and may also provide other health benefits (, , , , ). In a 16-week study, 17 of 21 people on a ketogenic diet were able to discontinue or decrease diabetes medication dosage. Study participants also lost an average of 19 pounds (8.7 kg) and reduced their , triglycerides and blood pressure (). In a 3-month study comparing a ketogenic diet to a moderate-carb diet, people in the ketogenic group averaged a 0.6% decrease in HbA1c. 12% of participants achieved an HbA1c below 5.7%, which is considered normal (). Ketogenic diets have been shown to reduce blood sugar in people with diabetes. In some cases, values return to a normal range, and medications can be discontinued or reduced. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. In recent years, scientific research has suggested that a ketogenic diet may help when used along with traditional treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation and surgery (). Many researchers note that elevated blood sugar, obesity and type 2 diabetes are linked to breast and other cancers. They suggest that restricting carbs in order to lower blood sugar and insulin levels may help prevent tumor growth (, ). Mice studies show ketogenic diets may reduce the progression of several types of cancer, including cancers that have spread to other parts of the body (, , , ). However, some experts believe the ketogenic diet may be particularly beneficial for brain cancer (, ). Case studies and patient data analyses have found improvements in various types of brain cancer, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) — the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer (, , ). One study found 6 out of 7 GBM patients had a modest response to an unrestricted-calorie ketogenic diet combined with an anti-cancer drug. Researchers noted that the diet is safe but probably of limited use alone (). Some researchers report preservation of muscle mass and slowed tumor growth in cancer patients who follow a ketogenic diet in conjunction with radiation or other anti-cancer therapies (, ). Although it may not have a significant impact on disease progression in advanced and terminal cancers, the ketogenic diet has been shown to be safe in these patients and potentially improve quality of life (, , ). Randomized clinical studies need to examine how ketogenic diets affect cancer patients. Several are currently underway or in the recruiting process. Animal and human research suggests ketogenic diets may benefit people with certain cancers, when combined with other therapies. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a condition characterized by problems with communication, social interaction and, in some cases, repetitive behaviors. Usually diagnosed in childhood, it is treated with speech therapy and other therapies. Early research in young mice and rats suggests ketogenic diets may be helpful for improving ASD behavior patterns (, , ). Autism shares some features with epilepsy, and many people with autism experience seizures related to the over-excitement of brain cells. Studies show that ketogenic diets reduce brain cell over-stimulation in mouse models of autism. What’s more, they appear to benefit behavior regardless of changes in seizure activity (, ). A pilot study of 30 children with autism found that 18 showed some improvement in symptoms after following a cyclical ketogenic diet for 6 months (). In one case study, a young girl with autism who followed a gluten-free, dairy-free ketogenic diet for several years experienced dramatic improvements. These included resolution of morbid obesity and a 70-point increase in IQ (). Randomized controlled studies exploring the effects of a ketogenic diet in ASD patients are now underway or in the recruiting process. Early research suggests some people with autism spectrum disorders may experience improvements in behavior when ketogenic diets are used in combination with other therapies. Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a nervous system disorder characterized by low levels of the signaling molecule dopamine. The lack of dopamine causes several symptoms, including tremor, impaired posture, stiffness and difficulty walking and writing. Because of the ketogenic diet’s and nervous system, it’s being explored as a potential complementary therapy for PD (, ). Feeding ketogenic diets to rats and mice with PD led to increased energy production, protection against nerve damage and improved motor function (, , ). In an uncontrolled study, seven people with PD followed a classic 4:1 ketogenic diet. After 4 weeks, five of them averaged a 43% improvement in symptoms (). The effects of a ketogenic diet on PD is another area that needs controlled studies. The ketogenic diet has shown promise in improving symptoms of Parkinson’s disease in both animal and human studies. However, high-quality research is needed. show that very low-carb, ketogenic diets are often more effective for weight loss than calorie-restricted or low-fat diets (, , , , ). What’s more, they typically provide other health improvements as well. In a 24-week study, men who followed a ketogenic diet lost twice as much fat as men who ate a low-fat diet (). In addition, the ketogenic group’s triglycerides dropped significantly, and their HDL (“good”) cholesterol increased. The low-fat group had a smaller drop in triglycerides and a in HDL cholesterol. Ketogenic diets’ ability to reduce hunger is one of the reasons . A large analysis found that very low-carb, calorie-restricted ketogenic diets help people feel less hungry than standard calorie-restricted diets (). Even when people on a ketogenic diet are allowed to eat all they want, they generally end up eating fewer calories due to the appetite-suppressing effects of . In a study of obese men who consumed either a calorie-unrestricted ketogenic or moderate-carb diet, those in the ketogenic group had significantly less hunger, took in fewer calories and lost 31% more weight than the moderate-carb group (). Studies have found that ketogenic diets are very effective for weight loss in obese people. This is largely due to their powerful appetite-suppressing effects. Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) deficiency syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, involves deficiency of a special protein that helps move blood sugar into the brain. Symptoms usually begin shortly after birth and include developmental delay, difficulty with movement and sometimes seizures. Unlike glucose, ketones don’t require this protein to cross from the blood to the brain. Therefore, the ketogenic diet can provide an alternative fuel source that these children’s brains can use effectively. Indeed, ketogenic diet therapy seems to improve several symptoms of the disorder. Researchers report decreased seizure frequency and improvement in muscle coordination, alertness and concentration in children on ketogenic diets (, , ). As with epilepsy, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) has been shown to provide the same benefits as the classic ketogenic diet. However, the MAD offers greater flexibility, which may result in better compliance and fewer side effects (, , ). In a study of 10 children with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, those who followed the MAD experienced improvements in seizures. At six months, 3 out of 6 became seizure-free (). Both the classic ketogenic diet and more flexible MAD have been shown to improve seizures and other symptoms in children with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) most commonly results from a blow to the head, a car accident or a fall in which the head strikes the ground. It can have devastating effects on physical function, memory and personality. Unlike cells in most other organs, injured brain cells often recover very little, if at all. Because the body’s ability to use sugar following head trauma is impaired, some researchers believe the ketogenic diet may benefit people with TBI (, ). Rat studies suggest that starting a ketogenic diet immediately after brain injury can help reduce brain swelling, increase motor function and improve recovery. However, these effects appear to occur mainly in younger rather than older rats (, , ). That said, controlled studies in humans are needed before any conclusions can be reached. Animal studies show that a ketogenic diet improves outcomes in rats fed a ketogenic diet after traumatic brain injury. However, there are currently no quality human studies on this. Multiple sclerosis (MS) damages the protective covering of nerves, which leads to communication problems between the brain and body. Symptoms include numbness and problems with balance, movement, vision and memory. One study of MS in a mouse model found that a ketogenic diet suppressed inflammatory markers. The led to improvements in memory, learning and physical function (). As with other nervous system disorders, MS appears to reduce the cells’ ability to use sugar as a fuel source. A 2015 review discussed ketogenic diets’ potential to assist with energy production and cell repair in MS patients (). Additionally, a recent controlled study of 48 people with MS found significant improvements in quality of life scores, cholesterol and triglycerides in the groups who followed a ketogenic diet or fasted for several days (). Studies about the potential benefits of a ketogenic diet for treating MS are promising. However, more human studies are needed. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in the Western world. It is strongly linked to type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity, and there’s evidence that on a very low-carb, ketogenic diet (, , ). In a small study, 14 obese men with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD who followed a ketogenic diet for 12 weeks had significant decreases in weight, blood pressure and liver enzymes (). What’s more, an impressive 93% of the men had a reduction in liver fat, and 21% achieved complete resolution of NAFLD. Ketogenic diets may be very effective at reducing liver fat and other health markers in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive form of dementia characterized by plaques and tangles in the brain that impair memory. Interestingly, Alzheimer’s disease appears to share features of both epilepsy and type 2 diabetes: seizures, the inability of the brain to properly use glucose and inflammation linked to insulin resistance (, , ). Animal studies show that a ketogenic diet improves balance and coordination but doesn’t affect the amyloid plaque that is a hallmark of the disease. However, supplementing with ketone esters appears to reduce amyloid plaque (, , ). In addition, supplementing people’s diets with ketone esters or to increase ketone levels has been shown to improve several Alzheimer’s disease symptoms (, , ). For example, one controlled study followed 152 people with Alzheimer’s disease who took an MCT compound. After 45 and 90 days, this group showed improvements in mental function, while the placebo group’s function declined (). Controlled studies testing the modified Atkins diet and MCT oil in people with Alzheimer’s disease are currently in progress or in the recruiting stage. Several symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease have been shown to improve with ketogenic diets in animal research. Human studies suggest supplementing with MCT oil or ketone esters may be beneficial. Migraine headaches typically involve severe pain, sensitivity to light and nausea. Some studies suggest migraine headache symptoms often improve in people who follow ketogenic diets (, , ). One observational study reported a reduction in migraine frequency and pain medication use in people following a ketogenic diet for one month (). An interesting case study of two sisters following a cyclical ketogenic diet for weight loss reported that their migraine headaches disappeared during the 4-week ketogenic cycles but returned during the 8-week transition diet cycles (). However, high-quality studies are needed to confirm the results of these reports. Some studies suggest that migraine headache frequency and severity may improve in people following a ketogenic diet. Ketogenic diets are being considered for use in several disorders due to their beneficial effects on metabolic health and the nervous system. However, many of these impressive results come from case studies and need validation through higher-quality research, including randomized controlled trials. With respect to cancer and several other serious diseases on this list, a ketogenic diet should be undertaken in addition to standard therapies under the supervision of a doctor or qualified healthcare provider. Also, no one should consider the ketogenic diet a cure for any disease or disorder on its own. Nonetheless, the ketogenic diets’ potential to improve health is very promising.

05d7038c-0ea2-41f7-b439-f1a80b6ae343,"The ketogenic diet has gained popularity as a natural way to lose weight and improve health. The diet is very low in carbohydrates, high in fat and moderate in protein. While the diet is considered safe for most people, it’s associated with some unpleasant side effects. The keto flu, also called the carb flu, is a term coined by followers to describe the symptoms they experience when beginning the diet. This article investigates what the keto flu is, why it happens and how to ease its symptoms. The keto flu is a collection of symptoms experienced by some people when they first start the keto diet. These symptoms, which can feel similar to the flu, are caused by the body adapting to a new diet consisting of very little carbohydrates. Reducing your carb intake forces your body to burn ketones for energy instead of glucose. Ketones are byproducts of fat breakdown and become the main fuel source when following a ketogenic diet. Normally, fat is reserved as a secondary fuel source to use when glucose is not available. This switch to burning fat for energy is called . It occurs during specific circumstances, including starvation and fasting (). However, ketosis can also be reached by adopting a very low-carb diet. In a , carbohydrates are typically reduced to under 50 grams per day (). This drastic reduction can come as a shock to the body and may cause withdrawal-like symptoms, similar to those experienced when weaning off an addictive substance like caffeine (). The keto flu is a term used to describe flu-like symptoms associated with beginning the very low-carb ketogenic diet. Switching to a very low-carb diet is a major change, and your body may need time to adapt to this new way of eating. For some people, this transition period can be especially difficult. Signs of the keto flu may start popping up within the first few days of cutting back on carbs. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and vary from person to person. While some people may transition to a ketogenic diet without any side effects, others may experience one or more of the following symptoms (): These symptoms are commonly reported by those who have just begun the ketogenic diet and can be distressing. Symptoms typically last about a week, though some people may experience them for a longer period of time. While these side effects may cause some dieters to throw in the towel, there are ways to reduce them. When beginning a ketogenic diet, some people may experience symptoms, including diarrhea, fatigue, muscle soreness and sugar cravings. Luckily, there are ways to reduce its flu-like symptoms and help your body get through the transition period more easily. is necessary for optimal health and can also help reduce symptoms. A keto diet can cause you to rapidly shed water stores, increasing the risk of dehydration (). This is because glycogen, the stored form of carbohydrates, binds to water in the body. When dietary carbohydrates are reduced, glycogen levels plummet and water is excreted from the body (). Staying hydrated can help with symptoms like fatigue and muscle cramping (). Replacing fluids is especially important when you are experiencing keto-flu-associated diarrhea, which can cause additional fluid loss (). While exercise is important for and keeping body weight in check, strenuous exercise should be avoided when experiencing keto-flu symptoms. Fatigue, muscle cramps and stomach discomfort are common in the first week of following a ketogenic diet, so it may be a good idea to give your body a rest. Activities like intense biking, running, weight lifting and strenuous workouts may have to be put on the back burner while your system adapts to new fuel sources. While these types of exercise should be avoided if you are experiencing the keto flu, light activities like walking, yoga or leisurely biking may improve symptoms. Replacing dietary electrolytes may help reduce keto-flu symptoms. When following a ketogenic diet, levels of insulin, an important hormone that helps the body absorb glucose from the bloodstream, decrease. When insulin levels decrease, the kidneys release excess sodium from the body (). What’s more, the keto diet restricts many foods that are high in , including fruits, beans and starchy vegetables. Getting adequate amounts of these important nutrients is an excellent way to power through the adaptation period of the diet. Salting food to taste and including potassium-rich, keto-friendly foods like green leafy vegetables and avocados are an excellent way to ensure you are maintaining a healthy balance of electrolytes. These foods are also high in , which may help reduce muscle cramps, sleep issues and headaches (). Fatigue and irritability are common complaints of people who are adapting to a ketogenic diet. Lack of sleep causes levels of the stress hormone to rise in the body, which can negatively impact mood and make keto-flu symptoms worse (, ). If you are having a difficult time falling or staying asleep, try one of the following tips: : is a stimulant that may negatively impact sleep. If you drink caffeinated beverages, only do so in the morning so your sleep is not affected (). : Shut off cell phones, computers and televisions in the bedroom to create a dark environment and promote restful sleep (). : Adding Epsom salt or lavender essential oil to your bath is a relaxing way to wind down and get ready for sleep (). : Waking at the same time every day and avoiding oversleeping may help normalize your sleep patterns and improve sleep quality over time (). Transitioning to a very low-carb diet can cause you to crave foods that are restricted on the ketogenic diet, such as cookies, bread, pasta and bagels. However, eating , the primary fuel source on the ketogenic diet, will help reduce cravings and keep you feeling satisfied. In fact, research shows that low-carb diets help reduce cravings for sweets and high-carb foods (). Those having a difficult time adapting to the ketogenic diet may have to eliminate carbohydrates gradually, rather than all at once. Slowly cutting back on carbs, while increasing fat and protein in your diet, may help make the transition smoother and decrease keto-flu symptoms. You can combat the keto flu by staying hydrated, replacing electrolytes, getting plenty of sleep, avoiding strenuous activities, eating enough fat and cutting out carbs slowly over time. People adapt to ketogenic diets differently. While some may experience weeks of keto-flu symptoms, others may adjust to the new diet with no adverse side effects. The symptoms people experience are tied to how their bodies adjust to a new fuel source. Usually, carbs provide the body with energy in the form of glucose. When carbs are substantially reduced, the body burns ketones from fat instead of glucose. Those who typically consume lots of carbs, especially refined carbs like pasta, sugary cereal and soda, may have a more difficult time when beginning the ketogenic diet. Thus, the transition to a high-fat, very low-carb diet may be a struggle for some, while others are able to switch between fuel sources easily with little to no keto-flu symptoms. The reason some people adapt to ketogenic diets easier than others is unknown, but genetics, electrolyte loss, dehydration and carbohydrate withdrawal are believed to be the driving forces behind the keto flu. Luckily, the uncomfortable symptoms of the keto flu only last about a week for most people. However, some people may have a more difficult time adapting to this high-fat, low-carb diet. For these individuals, symptoms may last several weeks. Fortunately, these symptoms will gradually decrease as your body gets used to converting ketones into energy. While keto-flu symptoms are commonly reported by those shifting to a ketogenic diet, if you are feeling particularly unwell and experiencing symptoms like prolonged diarrhea, fever or vomiting, it’s best to contact your doctor to rule out other causes. Some people may experience keto-flu symptoms due to genetics, electrolyte loss, dehydration and carbohydrate withdrawal. The keto flu usually lasts for about a week, but some may experience symptoms for over a month. Although the ketogenic diet may be helpful for many people, it’s not suitable for everyone. For example, the ketogenic diet may not be appropriate for pregnant or breastfeeding women, children and teens, unless it’s being used therapeutically under medical supervision. Furthermore, this diet should be avoided by those with certain health conditions like kidney disease, liver disease or pancreatic conditions. Also, those with who are interested in following a ketogenic meal plan should consult their doctor to determine if this diet is safe and suitable for their specific needs. Lastly, this diet may not be appropriate for individuals who are hypersensitive to dietary cholesterol, who account for around one-quarter of the world’s population (). The ketogenic diet may not be safe for pregnant women, children, people with kidney, liver or pancreatic disease and those who are sensitive to dietary cholesterol. The keto flu is a collection of symptoms associated with the body adapting to a ketogenic diet. Nausea, constipation, headaches, fatigue and sugar cravings are common in some people who are adapting to a high-fat, low-carb diet. Staying hydrated, replacing lost electrolytes, getting enough rest and ensuring you are consuming proper amounts of fat and carbohydrates are ways to reduce keto-flu symptoms. A ketogenic diet is a very low-carb diet with numerous health benefits. Here are 16 healthy and nutritious foods you can eat on this diet. Ketosis is a metabolic state that can be caused by a low-carb or ketogenic diet. Here are 10 signs and symptoms that you're in ketosis. Ketogenic diets have many powerful health benefits, but some people have trouble getting into ketosis. Here are 7 effective tips to get into ketosis. Ketosis is a natural metabolic state that occurs on a very low-carb diet.

abc1d0da-3835-4590-a5f4-fd69aa00e8cd,"The ketogenic diet has gained popularity as a natural way to lose weight and improve health. The diet is very low in carbohydrates, high in fat and moderate in protein. While the diet is considered safe for most people, it’s associated with some unpleasant side effects. The keto flu, also called the carb flu, is a term coined by followers to describe the symptoms they experience when beginning the diet. This article investigates what the keto flu is, why it happens and how to ease its symptoms. The keto flu is a collection of symptoms experienced by some people when they first start the keto diet. These symptoms, which can feel similar to the flu, are caused by the body adapting to a new diet consisting of very little carbohydrates. Reducing your carb intake forces your body to burn ketones for energy instead of glucose. Ketones are byproducts of fat breakdown and become the main fuel source when following a ketogenic diet. Normally, fat is reserved as a secondary fuel source to use when glucose is not available. This switch to burning fat for energy is called . It occurs during specific circumstances, including starvation and fasting (). However, ketosis can also be reached by adopting a very low-carb diet. In a , carbohydrates are typically reduced to under 50 grams per day (). This drastic reduction can come as a shock to the body and may cause withdrawal-like symptoms, similar to those experienced when weaning off an addictive substance like caffeine (). The keto flu is a term used to describe flu-like symptoms associated with beginning the very low-carb ketogenic diet. Switching to a very low-carb diet is a major change, and your body may need time to adapt to this new way of eating. For some people, this transition period can be especially difficult. Signs of the keto flu may start popping up within the first few days of cutting back on carbs. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and vary from person to person. While some people may transition to a ketogenic diet without any side effects, others may experience one or more of the following symptoms (): These symptoms are commonly reported by those who have just begun the ketogenic diet and can be distressing. Symptoms typically last about a week, though some people may experience them for a longer period of time. While these side effects may cause some dieters to throw in the towel, there are ways to reduce them. When beginning a ketogenic diet, some people may experience symptoms, including diarrhea, fatigue, muscle soreness and sugar cravings. Luckily, there are ways to reduce its flu-like symptoms and help your body get through the transition period more easily. is necessary for optimal health and can also help reduce symptoms. A keto diet can cause you to rapidly shed water stores, increasing the risk of dehydration (). This is because glycogen, the stored form of carbohydrates, binds to water in the body. When dietary carbohydrates are reduced, glycogen levels plummet and water is excreted from the body (). Staying hydrated can help with symptoms like fatigue and muscle cramping (). Replacing fluids is especially important when you are experiencing keto-flu-associated diarrhea, which can cause additional fluid loss (). While exercise is important for and keeping body weight in check, strenuous exercise should be avoided when experiencing keto-flu symptoms. Fatigue, muscle cramps and stomach discomfort are common in the first week of following a ketogenic diet, so it may be a good idea to give your body a rest. Activities like intense biking, running, weight lifting and strenuous workouts may have to be put on the back burner while your system adapts to new fuel sources. While these types of exercise should be avoided if you are experiencing the keto flu, light activities like walking, yoga or leisurely biking may improve symptoms. Replacing dietary electrolytes may help reduce keto-flu symptoms. When following a ketogenic diet, levels of insulin, an important hormone that helps the body absorb glucose from the bloodstream, decrease. When insulin levels decrease, the kidneys release excess sodium from the body (). What’s more, the keto diet restricts many foods that are high in , including fruits, beans and starchy vegetables. Getting adequate amounts of these important nutrients is an excellent way to power through the adaptation period of the diet. Salting food to taste and including potassium-rich, keto-friendly foods like green leafy vegetables and avocados are an excellent way to ensure you are maintaining a healthy balance of electrolytes. These foods are also high in , which may help reduce muscle cramps, sleep issues and headaches (). Fatigue and irritability are common complaints of people who are adapting to a ketogenic diet. Lack of sleep causes levels of the stress hormone to rise in the body, which can negatively impact mood and make keto-flu symptoms worse (, ).

If you drink caffeinated beverages, only do so in the morning so your sleep is not affected (). : Shut off cell phones, computers and televisions in the bedroom to create a dark environment and promote restful sleep (). : Adding Epsom salt or lavender essential oil to your bath is a relaxing way to wind down and get ready for sleep (). : Waking at the same time every day and avoiding oversleeping may help normalize your sleep patterns and improve sleep quality over time (). Transitioning to a very low-carb diet can cause you to crave foods that are restricted on the ketogenic diet, such as cookies, bread, pasta and bagels. However, eating , the primary fuel source on the ketogenic diet, will help reduce cravings and keep you feeling satisfied. In fact, research shows that low-carb diets help reduce cravings for sweets and high-carb foods (). Those having a difficult time adapting to the ketogenic diet may have to eliminate carbohydrates gradually, rather than all at once. Slowly cutting back on carbs, while increasing fat and protein in your diet, may help make the transition smoother and decrease keto-flu symptoms. You can combat the keto flu by staying hydrated, replacing electrolytes, getting plenty of sleep, avoiding strenuous activities, eating enough fat and cutting out carbs slowly over time. People adapt to ketogenic diets differently. While some may experience weeks of keto-flu symptoms, others may adjust to the new diet with no adverse side effects. The symptoms people experience are tied to how their bodies adjust to a new fuel source. Usually, carbs provide the body with energy in the form of glucose. When carbs are substantially reduced, the body burns ketones from fat instead of glucose. Those who typically consume lots of carbs, especially refined carbs like pasta, sugary cereal and soda, may have a more difficult time when beginning the ketogenic diet. Thus, the transition to a high-fat, very low-carb diet may be a struggle for some, while others are able to switch between fuel sources easily with little to no keto-flu symptoms. The reason some people adapt to ketogenic diets easier than others is unknown, but genetics, electrolyte loss, dehydration and carbohydrate withdrawal are believed to be the driving forces behind the keto flu. Luckily, the uncomfortable symptoms of the keto flu only last about a week for most people. However, some people may have a more difficult time adapting to this high-fat, low-carb diet. For these individuals, symptoms may last several weeks. Fortunately, these symptoms will gradually decrease as your body gets used to converting ketones into energy. While keto-flu symptoms are commonly reported by those shifting to a ketogenic diet, if you are feeling particularly unwell and experiencing symptoms like prolonged diarrhea, fever or vomiting, it’s best to contact your doctor to rule out other causes. Some people may experience keto-flu symptoms due to genetics, electrolyte loss, dehydration and carbohydrate withdrawal. The keto flu usually lasts for about a week, but some may experience symptoms for over a month. Although the ketogenic diet may be helpful for many people, it’s not suitable for everyone. For example, the ketogenic diet may not be appropriate for pregnant or breastfeeding women, children and teens, unless it’s being used therapeutically under medical supervision. Furthermore, this diet should be avoided by those with certain health conditions like kidney disease, liver disease or pancreatic conditions. Also, those with who are interested in following a ketogenic meal plan should consult their doctor to determine if this diet is safe and suitable for their specific needs. Lastly, this diet may not be appropriate for individuals who are hypersensitive to dietary cholesterol, who account for around one-quarter of the world’s population (). The ketogenic diet may not be safe for pregnant women, children, people with kidney, liver or pancreatic disease and those who are sensitive to dietary cholesterol. The keto flu is a collection of symptoms associated with the body adapting to a ketogenic diet.

It’s commonly used as a low calorie sweetener and thickener in candies, ice cream, baked goods, and other processed foods like energy and protein bars.

Most carbs are almost completely digested by the time they reach the end of your small intestine, but other carbs like sugar alcohols and fiber are only partially digested in your small intestine before moving into your colon (). In fact, maltitol absorption in the small intestine ranges from 5–80% (). Furthermore, maltitol’s (GI) stands at 35, which is much lower than that of regular table sugar, which has a whopping GI of 65.

However, if you’re simply substituting maltitol in place of regular sugar in a recipe, you can use roughly the same amount of maltitol as you would sugar. Maltitol is safe for the keto diet when used in moderation, though it may not be as ideal as other sugar alcohols.

c705406b-87a7-4bb1-9c5e-35dc98c08bb8,"Why Is Keto Ranked Low and DASH Ranked High on New Diet List? — A new list puts the Keto and Whole30 diets at the bottom while placing the DASH and Mediterranean diets at the top. What experts think about the discrepancy. Have you resolved to eat healthy in 2018? Some approaches to eating may be more sustainable or healthier than others. In its latest annual assessment of the year’s “Best Diets Overall,” U.S. News & World Report ranked the Whole30 and Keto diets at the bottom of the bunch. Of the 40 diets assessed, the Whole30 diet was ranked in the bottom three. The Keto diet was tied for last place with the Dukan diet. In contrast, the DASH and Mediterranean diets were tied for first place. According to the news service’s , the rankings were made by a panel of nutritionists, dietary consultants, and doctors that specialize in diabetes, heart health, and weight loss. “Whether you’re trying to lose weight or manage a chronic disease like diabetes, the 2018 Best Diets rankings are designed to help consumers identify the right diet for their specific needs,” Angela Haupt, assistant managing editor of health at U.S. News & World Report, said. The organization also released rankings of the best commercial diets, weight-loss diets, plant-based diets, and several other categories of eating plans. The DASH and Mediterranean diets have been ranked consistently high by the U.S. News & World Report for several years. The DASH diet was designed to prevent and lower high blood pressure, a risk factor for heart disease and stroke. The Mediterranean has also been associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease as well as reduced incidence of cancer. Both diets consist of eating plans that emphasize vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products. Similarly, both diets limit saturated fats and refined sugars. “I think the great thing about the DASH diet — and this is actually going to be true for the top three or four diets — is that there’s a tremendous amount of evidence behind it for its ability to lower chronic disease,” Kristin Kirkpatrick, MS, RD, LD, a licensed, registered dietitian who is manager of wellness nutrition services at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute, told Healthline. “It’s also very sustainable,” Kirkpatrick added. “I’m talking about the ability of someone to stay on it for longer than 30 days.” Similarly, Katie Ferraro, MPH, RD, CDE, a registered dietitian and assistant clinical professor at the University of San Diego and the University of California San Francisco, highlighted the reduced incidence of chronic illness associated with the DASH and Mediterranean diets. “If you look at those diets, the best ones overall are going to help you prevent a majority of chronic diseases, and one thing they have in common is a heavy reliance on produce,” Ferraro told Healthline. “One of the things that I love about the DASH diet is that it’s between 7 and 10 servings of fruits and vegetables per day,” she added. “You’re so busy eating fruits and vegetables that you don’t have room to eat a bunch of crappier food.” While Kirkpatrick and Ferraro agreed that the DASH and Mediterranean diets would be healthy choices for many people, they noted that no single diet is perfect for everyone. For example, both of the top-ranked diets are high in carbohydrates, which might not be ideal for some people who are trying to lose weight or manage insulin resistance. “If I look at something like the Mediterranean diet, for some type 2 diabetics, their carbs tend to go way too high. It doesn’t always help them,” Kirkpatrick said. Dr. Priyanka Wali, a board-certified physician in California, expressed even stronger reservations about the suitability of a Mediterranean diet for people with diabetes. “If someone has a history of diabetes, they should be on a very carbohydrate-restricted diet,” she told Healthline. “I could never in good conscience tell someone who has diabetes to eat brown rice, which is part of the Mediterranean diet,” she continued, “because brown rice, regardless of the glycemic index, is loaded with carbs. And if you have diabetes, you’re very sensitive to carbohydrate intake.” Compared to the DASH and Mediterranean diets, the Whole30, Dukan, and Keto diets are more restrictive in terms of the foods they limit. This can make them harder to follow on a long-term basis. “It’s too restrictive, and in that sense, it’s not sustainable,” Ferraro said about the Whole30 diet. “Maybe you could get through this for 30 days, but if you think about all the data we have on behavior change and the effect on weight loss, you need to initiate lifestyle change if you want to achieve long-term results,” she continued. Ferraro and Kirkpatrick suggested that the Keto diet may also be difficult for many people to follow, due in part to the extreme restrictions it puts on carbohydrate intake. Both also raised concerns about the high fat content of the Keto diet as well as the lack of high-quality evidence about its use outside of certain subsets of patients. Studies have found that a ketogenic diet is for controlling seizures in patients with epilepsy. But less research has been conducted on many other groups of people for whom a ketogenic diet might appeal. “I found this when I spoke with physicians around the country. They’re dying to get the evidence, but we don’t have it yet,” Kirkpatrick said. “If you’re a type 2 diabetic, is the Keto diet going to reverse it? It might, but we don’t have enough studies to show that yet,” she continued. In contrast, Wali expressed more support for the Keto diet in people with diabetes and other conditions associated with insulin resistance. “I think it’s actually a very important tool, specifically for people who have medical issues like diabetes, prediabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, and fatty liver. Those are all indications that you basically have insulin resistance, meaning that your body’s hormone levels are imbalanced as a result of your diet,” Wali said. Wali noted that other factos can also contribute to insulin resistance, including genetic predisposition, sleep patterns, and stress. She said many of her patients have successfully followed a ketogenic diet for years. To support its use, she pointed to a review article in 2015 in the journal Nutrition, which found that carbohydrate restriction reduces high blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes. Another recent review in BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care found that low to moderate carbohydrate diets have a greater effect on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes than high carbohydrate diets. “But again, that’s not to say Keto’s for the world because not everybody has those conditions. Some people can eat a ton of carbs and don’t have any adverse effects,” Wali added. Kirkpatrick, Ferraro, and Wali provided different perspectives on the U.S. News and World Report’s diet rankings. Ferraro suggested that the ranking can provide useful guidance to patients and providers. In contrast, Wali argued “the idea of ranking diets is actually quite bogus.” However, all agreed on one point: There is no one-size-fits-all approach to healthy eating. They suggested that it’s best to limit sugar and other refined carbohydrates. Beyond that, they encouraged readers to make an appointment with their doctor or dietitian to develop an eating plan that works for them. This plan should take into account their individual medical histories, risk factors for chronic illness, food preferences, and goals. — The Keto Diet Is Gaining Popularity, But Is It Safe?

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of type 1 diabetes and, much less commonly, of type 2 diabetes. DKA happens when your blood sugar is very high and acidic substances called ketones build up to dangerous levels in your body. Ketoacidosis shouldn’t be confused with , which is harmless. Ketosis can occur as a result of an extremely low carbohydrate diet, known as a , or . DKA only happens when you don’t have enough insulin in your body to process high levels of glucose in the blood. It’s less common in people with because insulin levels don’t usually drop so low; however, it can occur. DKA may be the first sign of , as people with this disease can’t make their own insulin. Symptoms of DKA can appear quickly and may include: DKA is a medical emergency. Call your local emergency services immediately if you think you are experiencing DKA. If left untreated, DKA can lead to a coma or death. If you use , make sure you discuss the risk of DKA with your healthcare team and have a plan in place. If you have type 1 diabetes, you should have a supply of home urine . You can buy these in drug stores or . If you have type 1 diabetes and have a blood sugar reading of over 250 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) twice, you should test your urine for ketones. You should also test if you are sick or planning on exercising and your blood sugar is 250 mg/dL or higher. Call your doctor if moderate or high levels of ketones are present. Always seek medical help if you suspect you are progressing to DKA. The treatment for DKA usually involves a combination of approaches to normalize and insulin levels. If you’re diagnosed with DKA but haven’t yet been diagnosed with diabetes, your doctor will create a diabetes treatment plan to keep ketoacidosis from recurring. Infection can increase the risk of DKA. If your DKA is a result of an infection or illness, your doctor will treat that as well, usually with . At the hospital, your physician will likely give you fluids. If possible, they can give them orally, but you may have to receive . Fluid replacement helps treat , which can cause even higher blood sugar levels. Insulin will likely be administered to you intravenously until your blood sugar level falls below 240 mg/dL. When your blood sugar level is within an acceptable range, your doctor will work with you to help you avoid DKA in the future. When your insulin levels are too low, your body’s can also become abnormally low. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help your body, including the heart and nerves, function properly. Electrolyte replacement is also commonly done through an IV. DKA occurs when blood sugar levels are very high and insulin levels are low. Our bodies need insulin to use the available glucose in the blood. In DKA, glucose can’t get into the cells, so it builds up, resulting in high blood sugar levels. In response, the body starts breaking down fat into a useable fuel that doesn’t require insulin. That fuel is called ketones. When too many ketones build up, your blood becomes acidic. This is diabetic ketoacidosis. missing an insulin injection or not injecting enough insulin a clog in one’s (for people who are using one) Who is at risk for developing diabetic ketoacidosis? have had some form of trauma, either emotional or physical Although DKA is less common in people who have type 2 diabetes, it does occur. Some people with type 2 diabetes are considered “ketone prone” and are at a higher risk of DKA. Some medications can increase the risk of DKA. Talk to your doctor about your risk factors. Testing for ketones in a sample of urine is one of the first steps for diagnosing DKA. They will likely also test your blood sugar level. Other tests your doctor may order are: basic bloodwork, including potassium and sodium, to assess metabolic function arterial blood gas, where blood is drawn from an artery to determine its acidity if ill, a chest X-ray or other tests to look for signs of an infection, such as pneumonia There are many ways to prevent DKA. One of the most important is of your diabetes: Follow your meal plan and stay hydrated with water. Test your blood sugar consistently. This will help you get in the habit of making sure your numbers are in range. If you notice a problem, you can talk to your doctor about adjusting your treatment plan. Although you can’t completely avoid illness or infection, you can take steps to help you remember to take your insulin and to help prevent and plan for a DKA emergency: Set an alarm if you take it at the same time every day, or download a medication reminder to help remind you. Pre-fill your syringe or syringes in the morning. That will help you easily see if you missed a dose. Talk to your doctor about adjusting your insulin dosage levels based on your activity level, illnesses, or other factors, such as what you’re eating. Develop an emergency or “sick day” plan so you will know what to do if you develop DKA symptoms. Test your urine for ketone levels during periods of high stress or illness. This can help you catch mild to moderate ketone levels before they threaten your health. Seek medical care if your blood sugar levels are higher than normal or ketones are present. Early detection is essential. DKA is serious, but it can be prevented. Follow your treatment plan and be proactive about your health. Tell your doctor if something isn’t working for you or if you’re having trouble. They can adjust your treatment plan or help you come up with solutions for better managing your diabetes.

86822b36-d8ef-45e5-a922-27208ecf1d01,"— The ketogenic diet involves dramatically decreasing your intake of carbs and instead getting most of your calories from fat. It can help children with epilepsy manage their seizures, and has also been linked to weight loss, better blood sugar control, and lower cholesterol levels (, , ). Since the keto diet limits carbs, smoothies that contain high-carb ingredients like fruits, yogurt, honey, and milk don’t usually fit into this style of eating. This can be an issue for those who rely on smoothies for a quick and healthy breakfast or snack. Fortunately, there are still smoothies with low-carb and nutritious ingredients that you can enjoy while following the keto diet. Here are the 10 best keto smoothie recipes that are low in carbs and high in fat. Berries, including strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries, are lower in carbs than most other fruits. They’re also rich in fiber, an indigestible carb that promotes digestive health (, , ).

7437f5d0-8d24-4ed0-8634-056e89695bef,"How Low Carb and Ketogenic Diets Boost Brain Health — — Low carb and ketogenic diets have many health benefits. For example, it’s well known that they can lead to weight loss and help manage diabetes. However, they’re also beneficial for certain brain disorders. This article explores how low carb and ketogenic diets affect the brain. Although there’s a lot of overlap between and diets, there are also a few important differences. Ketones may or may not rise to high levels in the blood. Ketones are molecules that can partly replace carbs as an energy source for the brain. Carb intake is limited to 50 grams or fewer per day. On a standard low carb diet, the brain will still largely depend on glucose, the sugar found in your blood, for fuel. However, the brain may burn more ketones than on a regular diet. On a ketogenic diet, the brain is mainly fueled by ketones. The liver produces ketones when carb intake is very low. Low carb and ketogenic diets are similar in many ways. However, a ketogenic diet contains even fewer carbs and will lead to a significant rise in blood levels of ketones, which are important molecules. You may have heard that your brain needs 130 grams of carbs per day to function properly. This is one of the about what constitutes a healthy carb intake. In fact, a 2005 report by the National Academy of Medicine’s Food and Nutrition Board states: “The lower limit of dietary carbohydrates compatible with life apparently is zero, provided that adequate amounts of protein and fat are consumed” (). Although a zero carb diet isn’t recommended because it eliminates , you can definitely eat much less than 130 grams per day and maintain good brain function. It’s a common myth that you need to eat 130 grams of carbs per day to provide the brain with energy. How low carb and ketogenic diets supply energy for the brain Low carb diets provide your brain with energy via processes called ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis. Glucose is usually the brain’s main fuel. Your brain, unlike your muscles, can’t use fat as a fuel source. However, the brain can use ketones. When glucose and insulin levels are low, your liver produces ketones from fatty acids. Ketones are actually produced in small amounts whenever you go for many hours without eating, such as after a full night’s sleep. However, the liver increases its production of ketones even more during or when carb intake falls below 50 grams per day (). When carbs are eliminated or minimized, ketones can provide up to 75% of the brain’s energy needs (). Although most of the brain can use ketones, there are portions that require glucose to function. On a very low carb diet, some of this glucose can be supplied by the small amount of carbs consumed. The rest comes from a process in your body called gluconeogenesis, which means “making new glucose.” In this process, the liver creates glucose for the brain to use. The liver makes the glucose using amino acids, the building blocks of protein (). The liver can also make glucose from glycerol. Glycerol is the backbone that links fatty acids together in triglycerides, the body’s storage form of fat. Thanks to gluconeogenesis, the portions of the brain that need glucose get a steady supply, even when your carb intake is very low. On a very low carb diet, up to 75% of the brain can be fueled by ketones. The rest can be fueled by glucose produced in the liver. is a disease characterized by seizures linked to periods of overexcitement in brain cells. It can cause uncontrolled jerking movements and loss of consciousness. Epilepsy can be very difficult to treat effectively. There are several types of seizures, and some people with the condition have multiple episodes every day. Although there are many effective antiseizure medications, these drugs are unable to effectively manage seizures in about 30% of people. The type of epilepsy that’s unresponsive to medication is called refractory epilepsy (). The ketogenic diet was developed by Dr. Russell Wilder in the 1920s to treat drug-resistant epilepsy in children. His diet provides at least 90% of calories from fat and has been shown to mimic the beneficial effects of starvation on seizures (). The exact mechanisms behind the ketogenic diet’s antiseizure effects remain unknown (). Low carb and ketogenic diet options to treat epilepsy There are four types of carb-restricted diets that can treat epilepsy. Here are their typical macronutrient breakdowns: 2–4% of calories from carbs, 6–8% from protein, and 85–90% from fat (). 10% of calories from carbs with no restriction on protein in most cases. The diet starts by allowing 10 grams of carbs per day for children and 15 grams for adults, with potential slight increases if tolerated (). Medium-chain triglyceride ketogenic diet (MCT diet): Initially 10% carbs, 20% protein, 60% medium-chain triglycerides, and 10% other fats (). 10–20% of calories from carbs, around 20–30% from protein, and the rest from fat. Limits carb choices to those with a glycemic index (GI) under 50 (). The classic ketogenic diet (KD) has been used in several epilepsy treatment centers. Many studies have found improvement in over half of study participants (, , , , ). In a 2008 study, children treated with a ketogenic diet for 3 months had a 75% decrease in baseline seizures, on average (). According to a 2009 study, around one-third of children who respond to the diet have a 90% or greater decrease in seizures (). In a 2020 study on refractory epilepsy, children who adopted the classic ketogenic diet for 6 months saw their seizure frequency decrease by 66% (). Although the classic ketogenic diet can be very effective against seizures, it requires close supervision by a neurologist and . Food choices are also quite limited. As such, the diet can be difficult to follow, particularly for older children and adults (). In many cases, the modified (MAD) has proven to be as effective or nearly as effective for managing childhood epilepsy as the classic ketogenic diet, with fewer side effects (, , , , ). In a randomized study of 102 children, 30% of those who followed the modified Atkins diet experienced a 90% or greater reduction in seizures (). Although most studies have been done in children, some adults with epilepsy have also seen good results with this diet (, , ). In an analysis of 10 studies comparing the classic ketogenic diet to the modified Atkins diet, people were much more likely to stick to the modified Atkins diet (). The medium-chain triglyceride ketogenic diet in epilepsy The medium-chain triglyceride ketogenic diet (MCT diet) has been used since the 1970s. are saturated fats found in and . Unlike long-chain triglyceride fats, MCTs can be used for quick energy or ketone production by the liver. MCT oil’s ability to increase ketone levels with less restriction on carb intake has made the MCT diet a popular alternative to the other low carb diets (, , ). One study in children found that the MCT diet was as effective as the classic ketogenic diet in managing seizures (). The low glycemic index treatment (LGIT) is another dietary approach that can manage epilepsy despite its very modest effect on ketone levels. It was first introduced in 2002 (). In a 2020 study of children with refractory epilepsy, those who adopted the LGIT diet for 6 months experienced significantly fewer side effects than those who adopted the classic ketogenic diet or modified Atkins diet (). Various types of low carb and ketogenic diets are effective at reducing seizures in children and adults with drug-resistant epilepsy. Although few formal studies have been done, it appears that low carb and ketogenic diets may be beneficial for people with . Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of . It’s a progressive disease where the brain develops plaques and tangles that cause memory loss. Many researchers believe it should be considered because the brain’s cells become insulin-resistant and are unable to use glucose properly, leading to inflammation (, , ). In fact, metabolic syndrome, a precursor of type 2 diabetes, also increases the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (, ). Experts report that Alzheimer’s disease shares certain features with epilepsy, including brain excitability that leads to seizures (, ). In a 2009 study of 152 people with Alzheimer’s disease, those who received an MCT supplement for 90 days had much higher ketone levels and a significant improvement in brain function compared with a control group (). In a small 2018 study that lasted 1 month, people who took 30 grams of MCT a day saw their brain ketone consumption increase significantly. Their brains used twice as many ketones than they did before the study (). Animal studies also suggest that a ketogenic diet may be an effective way to fuel a brain affected by Alzheimer’s (, ). As with epilepsy, researchers aren’t certain of the exact mechanism behind these potential benefits against Alzheimer’s disease. One theory is that ketones protect brain cells by reducing reactive oxygen species. These are metabolism byproducts that can cause inflammation (, ). Another theory is that a diet high in fat, including saturated fat, can reduce the harmful proteins that accumulate in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s (). On the other hand, a recent review of studies concluded that a high intake of saturated fat was strongly associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s (). Research is still in its early stages, but ketogenic diets and MCT supplements may help improve memory and brain function in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Although these haven’t been studied as much, low carb and ketogenic diets may have several other benefits for the brain: Older adults at risk for Alzheimer’s disease have shown improvement in memory after following a very low carb diet for 6–12 weeks. These studies were small, but the results are promising (, ). Feeding older and obese rats a ketogenic diet leads to improved brain function (, ). causes low blood sugar and can lead to brain damage. This condition has been successfully treated with a ketogenic diet (). Researchers report that low carb or ketogenic diets may provide relief to people with (, ). One small, randomized control trial compared the ketogenic diet with a low fat, high carb diet. People who adopted the ketogenic diet saw a much greater improvement in pain and other nonmotor symptoms of (). Low carb and ketogenic diets have many other health benefits for the brain. They may help improve memory in older adults, relieve migraine symptoms, and reduce symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, to name a few. Potential problems with low carb and ketogenic diets There are certain conditions for which a low carb or ketogenic diet isn’t recommended. They include pancreatitis, liver failure, and some rare blood disorders (). If you have any sort of health condition, speak with your doctor before starting a ketogenic diet. People respond to low carb and ketogenic diets in many different ways. Here are a few potential adverse effects: Children may experience and elevated triglyceride levels. However, this may be temporary and doesn’t appear to affect heart health (, ). are uncommon but have occurred in some children undergoing ketogenic diet therapy for epilepsy. The kidney stones are usually managed with potassium citrate (). is very common with ketogenic diets. One treatment center reported that 65% of children developed constipation. It’s usually easy to treat with stool softeners or dietary changes (). Children with epilepsy eventually discontinue the ketogenic diet once seizures have resolved. One study looked at children who spent a median duration of 1.4 years on the ketogenic diet. Most of them didn’t experience any negative long-term effects as a result (). A very low carb ketogenic diet is safe for most people, but not everyone. Some people may develop side effects, which are usually temporary. When transitioning to a low carb or ketogenic diet, you may experience some adverse effects. You may develop or feel tired or lightheaded for a few days. This is known as the “” or “low carb flu.” Here are some suggestions for getting through the adaptation period: Drink at least 68 ounces (2 liters) of a day to replace the water loss that often occurs in the initial stages of ketosis. Add 1–2 grams of salt each day to replace the amount lost in your urine when carbs are reduced. Drinking will help you meet your increased sodium and fluid needs. Eat foods high in and to prevent muscle cramps. Avocado, Greek yogurt, tomatoes, and fish are good sources. Don’t exercise heavily for at least 1 week. It may take a few weeks to become fully keto-adapted. Don’t push yourself in your workouts until you feel ready. Adapting to a very low carb or ketogenic diet takes some time, but there are a few ways to ease the transition. According to the available evidence, ketogenic diets can have powerful benefits for the brain. The strongest evidence has to do with treating drug-resistant epilepsy in children. There’s also preliminary evidence that ketogenic diets may reduce symptoms of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Research is ongoing about its effects on people with these and other brain disorders. Beyond brain health, there are also many studies showing that low carb and ketogenic diets can cause weight loss and help manage diabetes. These diets aren’t for everyone, but they can provide for a lot of people. — — The ketogenic diet is a proven way to lose weight and improve health.

Ketogenic Diet for Beginners Made Easy: The Ultimate Guide to “Keto” How to Know Keto Is Working (aka You’re in Ketosis) Keto Diet: to Lose Weight, Balance Hormones, Boost Brain Health, and Reverse Disease” (February 2019, published by Little, Brown Spark)and the recent Unlike many fad diets that come and go with very limited rates of long-term success, the ketogenic diet (or ) has been practiced for more than  (since the 1920s) and is based upon a solid understanding of physiology and nutrition science. The keto diet works for such a high percentage of people because it targets several key, underlying causes of weight gain — including hormonal imbalances, especially insulin resistance coupled with high blood sugar levels, and the cycle of restricting and “binging” on empty calories due to hunger that so many dieters struggle with. In fact, these are some of the direct benefits of the keto diet. Rather than relying on counting calories, limiting portion sizes, resorting to extreme exercise or requiring lots of willpower, this low-carb diet takes an entirely different approach to weight loss and health improvements. It works because it changes the very “fuel source” that the body uses to stay energized: namely, from burning glucose (or sugar) to dietary fat, courtesy of keto diet recipes and the keto diet food list items, including high-fat, low-carb foods. Making that switch will place your body in a state of “,” when your body becomes a fat burner rather than a sugar burner. Fortunately, if you’re new to this type of eating plan, a keto diet for beginners, or , is surprising simple to follow. Here’s how to do the keto diet: Increase your consumption of healthy fats, which help create satiety. Without glucose coursing through your body, it’s now forced to burn fat and produce ketones instead. Once the blood levels of ketones rise to a certain point, you officially reach ketosis. This state results in consistent, fairly quick weight loss until your body reaches a healthy and stable weight. What is the ketogenic diet exactly? The classic that was originally for patients with epilepsy by researchers working at Johns Hopkins Medical Center. Researchers found that fasting — avoiding consumption of all foods for a brief period of time (such as with intermittent fasting), including those that provide carbohydrates — the amount of seizures patients suffered, in addition to having other positive effects on body fat, blood sugar, cholesterol and hunger levels. () Unfortunately, long-term fasting is not a feasible option for more than a few days, therefore the keto diet was developed to mimic the same . Essentially, the keto diet for beginners works by “tricking” the body into acting as if its fasting (while reaping intermittent fasting benefits), through a strict elimination of glucose that is found in carbohydrate foods. Today the standard keto diet goes by several different names, including the “low-carbohydrate” or “very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet”(LCKD or VLCKD for short). At the core of the classic keto diet is severely restricting intake of all or most foods with sugar and starch (carbohydrates). These foods are broken down into sugar (insulin and glucose) in our blood once we eat them, and if these levels become too high, extra calories are much more easily stored as body fat and results in unwanted weight gain. However, when glucose levels are cut off due to low-carb intake, the body starts to burn fat instead and produces ketones that can be measured in the blood (using urine strips, for example). Keto diets, like most , work through the elimination of glucose. Because most folks live on a high carb diet, our bodies normally run on glucose (or sugar) for energy. We cannot make glucose and only have about 24 hours’ worth stored in our muscle tissue and liver. Once glucose is no longer available from food sources, we begin to burn stored fat instead, or fat from our food. Therefore, when you’re following a ketogenic diet plan for beginners, your body is burning fat for energy rather than carbohydrates, so in the process most people lose weight and excess body fat rapidly, even when consuming lots of fat and adequate calories through their daily food intake. Another major benefit of the keto diet is that there’s no need to count calories, feel hungry or attempt to burn loads of calories through hours of intense exercise. In some ways, it’s similar to the , which similarly boosts the body’s fat-burning abilities through eating only low-carb foods, along with getting rid of foods high in carbs and sugar. Removing glucose from carbohydrate foods will cause the body to burn fat for energy instead. The major differences between the classic keto and the Atkins diet is the former emphasizes healthier keto fats, less overall protein and no processed meat (such as bacon) while having more research to back up its efficacy. In fact, those differences with Atkins outline some of the popular keto diet myths, such as it being another high-protein plan, recommending any type of fat and that barely any science research backs up the benefits. These are nutrition lies, plain and simple. So is the keto diet healthy? If it’s done Atkins style? No. But if relying on healthy fats, greens and organic meats? Very much so. What does “keto” stand for exactly? Keto is short for , which is the result of following the standard ketogenic diet, which is why it’s also sometimes called “” or “ketosis diet plan.” Following a ketogenic diet puts your body into a state of “ketosis,” which is a metabolic state that occurs when most of the body’s energy comes from ketone bodies in the blood, rather than from glucose from carbohydrate foods (like grains, all sources of sugar or fruit, for example). This is in contrast to a glycolytic state, where blood glucose (sugar) provides most of the body’s fuel (or energy). This state can also be achieved by multiple days of total fasting, but that isn’t sustainable beyond a few days. (It’s why some keto diet plans for beginners combine  for greater weight loss effects.) Although dietary fat (especially saturated fat) often gets a bad name, provoking fear of weight gain and heart disease, it’s also your body’s second preferred source of energy when carbohydrates are not easily accessible. So many people ask, does the keto diet work? Yes, of course, but only if you can get your body into ketosis. Here’s how you get your body into ketosis and start burning body fat for fuel in a keto diet for beginners: Consumption of glucose from carbohydrate foods — grains, starchy vegetables, fruit, etc. — is cut way down. This forces your body to find an alternative fuel source: fat (think avocados, coconut oil, salmon). Meanwhile, in the absence of glucose, the body also starts to burn fat and produces ketones instead. Once ketone levels in the blood rise to a certain point, you enter into a state of ketosis. This state of high ketone levels results in quick and consistent weight loss until you reach a healthy, stable body weight. Wondering how many carb foods you can eat and still be “in ketosis”? The traditional ketogenic diet, created for those with epilepsy consisted of getting about 75 percent of calories from sources of fat (such as oils or fattier cuts of meat), 5 percent from carbohydrates and 20 percent from protein. For most people a less strict version (what I call a “modified keto diet”) can still help promote weight loss in a safe, and often very fast, way. In order to transition and remain in this state, aiming for about 30–50 net grams is typically the recommended amount of total carbs to start with. This is considered a more moderate or flexible approach but can be less overwhelming to begin with. Once you’re more accustomed to “eating keto,” you can choose to lower carbs even more if you’d like (perhaps only from time to time), down to about 20 grams of net carbs daily. This is considered the standard, “strict” amount that many keto dieters aim to adhere to for best results, but remember that everyone is a bit different. Of the many benefits of a keto diet, weight loss is often considered No. 1., as it can often be substantial and happen quickly (especially for those who start out very overweight or obese). The 2013 study published in the found that those following a keto diet “achieved better long-term body weight and cardiovascular risk factor management when compared with individuals assigned to a conventional low-fat diet (i.e. a restricted-energy diet with less than 30 percent of energy from fat).” () A 2014 keto diet review published in the International Journal of Environmental Research & Public Health states: One of the most studied strategies in the recent years for weight loss is the ketogenic diet. Many studies have shown that this kind of nutritional approach has a solid physiological and biochemical basis and is able to induce effective weight loss along with improvement in several cardiovascular risk parameters. () In part, keto diet weight loss is a real thing because high-fat, low-carb diets can both help diminish hunger and boost weight loss through their hormonal effects. As described above, when we eat very little foods that supply us with carbohydrates, we release less insulin. With lower insulin levels, the body doesn’t store extra energy in the form of fat for later use, and instead is able to reach into existing fat stores for energy. Keto diets are high in healthy fats and protein also tend to be very filling, which can help of empty calories, sweets and junk foods. () For most people eating a healthy low-carb diet, it’s easy to consume an appropriate amount of calories, but not too many, since things like sugary drinks, cookies, bread, cereals, ice cream or other desserts and snack bars are off-limits. Often caused by lymph node removal or damage due to cancer treatment, lymphedema occurs because there’s a blockage in the lymphatic system and results in the swelling in leg or arm. A involved patients who suffered from obesity and lymphedema and who embarked on a 18-week ketogenic diet. Weight and limb volume was significantly reduced. () Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder, and it affects women of reproductive age. Symptoms include obesity, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. A took 11 women through 24 weeks of a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (20 grams or less per day). Among the five who completed the study, they lost 12 percent of their weight on average and reduced fasting insulin by 54 percent. Additionally, two women who previously experienced infertility problems became pregnant. () This process of burning fat provides more benefits than simply helping us to shed extra weight — it also helps control the release of hormones like insulin, which plays a role in development of diabetes and other health problems. When we eat carbohydrates, insulin is released as a reaction to elevated blood glucose (an increase in sugar circulating in our blood) and insulin levels rise. Insulin is a “storage hormone” that signals cells to store as much available energy as possible, initially as glycogen (aka stored carbohydrates in our muscles) and then as body fat. The keto diet works by eliminating carbohydrates from the your daily intake and keeping the body’s carbohydrate stores almost empty, therefore preventing too much insulin from being released following food consumption and creating normal blood sugar levels. This can help reverse “insulin resistance,” which is the underlying problem contributing to diabetes symptoms. In studies, low-carb diets have shown , postprandial glycemia and insulin secretion. () Therefore, diabetics on insulin should contact their medical provider prior to starting a ketogenic diet, however, as insulin dosages may need to be adjusted. Related: Keto Diet and Diabetes— Do They Work Well Together? The keto diet can of heart disease markers, including high cholesterol and triglycerides. () In fact, the keto diet is unlikely to negatively impact your cholesterol levels despite being so high in fat. Moreover, it’s capable of risk factors, especially in those who are obese. () , for example, found that adhering to the ketogenic diet and keto diet foods list for 24 weeks resulted in decreased levels of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and blood glucose in a significant percentage of patients, while at the same time increasing the level of HDL cholesterol. () suggest that keto diets may “starve” cancer cells. A highly processed, pro-inflammatory, low-nutrient foods can feed cancer cells causing them to proliferate. What’s the connection between high-sugar consumption and cancer? The regular cells found in our bodies are able to use fat for energy, but it’s believed that cancer cells cannot metabolically shift to use fat rather than glucose. () There are — such as two conducted by the Department of Radiation Oncology at the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center for the University of Iowa, and the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, for example — that show the ketogenic diet is an effective treatment for cancer and other serious health problems. () Therefore, a keto diet that eliminates excess refined sugar and other processed carbohydrates may be effective in reducing or fighting cancer. It’s not a coincidence that some of the best cancer-fighting foods are on the keto diet food list. Over the past century, ketogenic diets have also been used as natural remedies to treat and even help reverse neurological disorders and cognitive impairments, including epilepsy, Alzheimer’s symptoms, manic depression and anxiety. Research shows that cutting off glucose levels with a very low-carb diet makes your body produce ketones for fuel. This change can help to reverse neurological disorders and cognitive impairment, including inducing seizure control. The brain is able to use this alternative source of energy instead of the cellular energy pathways that aren’t functioning normally in patients with brain disorders. A for drug-resistant epilepsy is called the medium-chain triglyceride ketogenic diet, in which is extensively used because it’s more ketogenic than long-chain triglycerides. () Another dietary therapy for epilepsy called Low Glycemic Index Treatment (LGIT) was developed in 2002 as an alternative to the keto diet. LGIT the total amount of carbohydrates consumed daily, and focuses on carbohydrates that have a low glycemic index.) () Clinical in Alzheimer’s patients fed a ketogenic diet, and this was marked by improved mitochondrial function. () In fact, a study pointed to emerging data that suggested the therapeutic use of ketogenic diets for multiple neurological disorders beyond epilepsy and Alzheimer’s, including headaches, neurotrauma, Parkinson’s disease, sleep disorders, brain cancer, autism and multiple sclerosis. () The report goes on to say that while these various diseases are clearly different from each other, the ketogenic diet appears to be so effective for neurological problems because of its “neuroprotective effect” — as the keto appears to correct abnormalities in cellular energy usage, which is a common characteristic in many neurological disorders. In mouse models, a study that a keto diet could slow disease progression for both ALS and Huntington’s diseases. In fact, more than one animal study has a potential benefits of the low-carb, high-fat diet or intermittent fasting in delaying weight loss, managing glucose and protecting neurons from injury. (, ) Interestingly, it’s also been shown to slow disease progression in mouse models of both ALS and Huntington’s diseases. Researchers believe that the ketogenic diet can also help patients with schizophrenia to normalize the pathophysiological processes that are causing symptoms like delusions, hallucinations, lack of restraint and unpredictable behavior. One study found that the keto diet lead to elevated concentrations of kynurenic acid (KYNA) in the hippocampus and striatum, which promotes neuroactive activity. Some to the elimination of gluten as a possible reason for improved symptoms, as researchers observed that patients with schizophrenia tended to eat more carbohydrates immediately before a psychotic episode. ( Although the exact role of the keto diet in mental and brain disorders is unclear, there has been proof of its efficacy in patients with schizophrenia. And, to boot, it works to reverse many conditions that develop as a side effect of conventional medications for brain disorders, like weight gain, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risks. More research is needed to understand the role of the ketogenic diet in treating or improving schizophrenia, as the current available studies are either animal studies or case studies, but the benefits of a low carbohydrate, in neurology is promising. Related: Can the Ketogenic Diet Treat Depression and Anxiety, Even Schizophrenia? Now, there’s even evidence that a low-carb, high-fat regimen (as the keto diet is) helps you live longer, compared to a low-fat diet. In a study by the medical journal that studied more than 135,000 adults from 18 countries, high carbohydrate intake was associated with higher risk of total mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to lower total mortality. Total fat and types of fat were not associated with cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction or cardiovascular disease mortality. In fact,  an  with the risk for suffering from a stroke, meaning the more saturated fat someone is consuming on a daily basis, the more protection against having a stroke they seemed to have. () The keto diet also appears to help induce , which helps clear damaged cells from the body, including senescent cells that serve no functional purpose but still linger inside tissues and organs. In animal studies when rats are put on the ketogenic diet, that reduce brain injury during and after seizures. () In fact, inducing autophagy is now a popular for helping remove signs of aging poorly and keto is one way to get there. The exact ratio of recommended macronutrients (or your “macros”) in your daily regimen (grams of carbs vs. fat vs. protein) will differ depending on your specific goals and current state of health. Your age, gender, level of activity and current body composition can also play a role in determining your carb versus fat intake. Historically, a targeted keto diet consists of limiting carbohydrate intake to just 20–30 net grams per day. “Net carbs” is the amount of carbs remaining once dietary fiber is taken into account. Because fiber is indigestible once eaten, most people don’t count grams of fiber toward their daily carb allotment. In other words, total carbs – grams of fiber = net carbs. That’s the carb counts that matter most. On a “strict” (standard) keto diet, fats typically provides about 70 percent to 80 percent of total daily calories, protein about 15 percent to 20 percent, and carbohydrates just around 5 percent. However, a more “moderate” approach to the keto diet is also a good option for many people that can allow for an easier transition into very low-carb eating and more flexibility (more on these types of plans below). What can you eat on a keto diet? Here are some good keto rules for how to do the keto diet regardless of the plan you follow: Something that makes the keto diet different from other low-carb diets is that it does not “protein-load.” Protein is not as big a part of the keto diet as fat is. Reason being: In small amounts, the body can change protein to glucose, which means if you eat too much of it, especially while in the beginning stages, it will slow down your body’s transition into ketosis. Protein intake should be between one and 1.5 grams per kilogram of your ideal body weight. To convert pounds to kilograms, divide your ideal weight by 2.2. For example, a woman who weighs 150 pounds (68 kilograms) should get about 68–102 grams of protein daily. Your “macros” are your grams of fat, protein and net carbs (not to be confused with calorie counting!). Tracking your macros and net carbs can be tricky, so I advise you download a keto app that includes a keto diet calculator. It will help keep you on track. 3. Consider using some keto supplements for greater success A popular keto supplement are exogenous ketones (popularly called “keto diet pills”) that may help you achieve results earlier as well as remain in that state. (Don’t confuse exogenous ketones with raspberry ketones, as the latter don’t raise ketone levels in the body or mimic endogenous ketones, so you wouldn’t use raspberry ketones in your regimen.) Also, consider supplementing with the amino acid leucine, as it can be broken down directly into acetyl-CoA, making it one of the most important ketogenic amino acids in the body. While most other amino acids are converted into glucose, the acetyl-CoA formed from leucine can be used to make ketone bodies. It’s also present in keto friendly foods like eggs and cottage cheese. It’s important to also drink lots of water, the most important of all . Getting enough water helps keep you from feeling fatigued, is important for digestion and aids in hunger suppression. It’s also needed for detoxification. Aim to drink 10–12 eight-ounce glasses a day. Lastly, no cheat days and not even cheat meals on the keto diet! Why?! Because a meal with far too many carbs will take you right out of ketosis and put you back at square one. That being said, if you do succumb and indulge in a cheat meal, expect a return of some of the keto flu symptoms … but also be comforted by the knowledge that if you’re reached ketosis in the past, your body will be able to get back soon again and perhaps more quickly than originally. Related:  What is the keto diet again? And and healthy? Well, with a diet this popular, many versions and keto meal plans tend to emerge, so the answer to both questions somewhat depends on what version of the ketogenic plan you try. At present, we’re at nine types of the keto diet! Wondering how many carb foods you can eat and still be “in ketosis”? The traditional ketogenic meal plan created for those with epilepsy and is very strict with its percentages of macronutrients. But there are several other types of keto diet plans out there as well.  consists of getting about 75 percent of calories from sources of fat (such as oils or fattier cuts of meat), 5 percent from carbohydrates and 20 percent from protein.  this keto meal plan reduces carbohydrates to 30 percent of their total calorie intake, while increasing fat and protein to 40 percent and 30 percent respectively.  If you find it difficult to stick to a very low-carb diet every day, especially for months on end, you might want to consider a instead. Carb cycling increases carbohydrate intake (and sometimes calories in general) only at the right time and in the right amounts, usually about 1–2 times per week (such as on weekends). This eating plan simply tells you to follow the keto diet BUT allows you to add carbs around workouts. So on the days you exercise, you will be eating carbohydrates. Designed to treat cancer, this ketogenic meal plan restricts calories as well as carbohydrates. Some studies indicate that calorie restriction and ketosis may . This version of the keto diet is often followed by folks who want to preserve their muscle mass like bodybuilders and older people. Rather than protein making up 20 percent of the diet, here it’s 30 percent. Meanwhile, fat goes down to 65 percent of the diet and carbs stay at 5 percent. (Caution: folks with kidney issues shouldn’t up their protein too much.)  Yes, both are possible. Instead of animal products, plenty of low-carb, nutrient-dense vegan and/or vegetarian foods are included. Nuts, seeds, low-carb fruits and veggies, leafy greens, healthy fats and fermented foods are all excellent choices on a plant-based keto diet. There’s also a similar plan called ketotarian, which combines keto with vegetarian, vegan and/or pescatarian diets for supposedly greater health benefits. “Dirty” is the apt term, as these version of keto follows the same strict percentages (75/20/5 of fat/protein/carbs) but rather than focusing on healthy versions of fat like coconut oil and wild salmon, you’re free to eat naughty but still keto friendly foods like bacon, sausage, pork rinds, diet sodas and even . I do NOT recommend this. Last but not least, the Lazy keto diet often gets confused with dirty keto … but they’re different, as the “lazy” refers to simply not carefully tracking the fat and protein macros (or calories, for that matter). Meanwhile, the one aspect that remains strict? Not eating over 20 net carb grams per day. Some people find this version less intimidating to start with or end with … but I will caution that your results will be less impressive. Related: Paleo vs Keto — Differences and What They Have in Common How to Know Keto Is Working (aka You’re in Ketosis) In the absence of glucose, which is normally used by cells as a quick source of energy, the body starts to burn fat and produces ketone bodies instead (it’s why the keto diet is often referred to as the ketone diet). Once ketone levels in the blood rise to a certain point, you enter into a state of ketosis — which usually results in quick and consistent weight loss until you reach a healthy, stable body weight. See this , a before and after trying keto for 30 days. To sum up a complex process, you reach this fat-burning state when the the liver breaks down fat into fatty acids and glycerol, through a process called beta-oxidation. There are three primary types of ketone bodies that are water-soluble molecules produced in the liver: acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetone. The body then further breaks down these fatty acids into an energy-rich substance called ketones that circulate through the bloodstream. Fatty acid molecules are broken down through the process called ketogenesis, and a specific ketone body called acetoacetate is formed and which supplies energy. The end result of the “ketone diet” is staying fueled off of circulating high ketones (which are also sometimes called ketone bodies) — which is what’s responsible for altering your metabolism in a way that some people like to say turns you into a “fat-burning machine.” Both in terms of how it feels physically and mentally, along with the impact it has on the body, being in ketosis is very different than a “glycolytic state,” where blood glucose (sugar) serves as the body’s energy source. So, is ketosis bad for you? Absolutely not. If anything, it’s the reverse. Many consider burning ketones to be a much “cleaner” way to stay energized compared to running on carbs and sugar day in and day out. And remember, this state is not to be confused with ketoacidosis, which is a serious diabetes complication when the body produces excess ketones (or blood acids). The goal is to keep you in this fat-burning metabolic state, in which you will lose weight until you reach your ideal set point. Some research suggests this may be a novel approach to reverse diabetes naturally.

Regarding specific foods to include on a ketogenic diet, plus those to eliminate, here is an outline of what you might choose to grocery shop for: Eat lots of different vegetables, especially: leafy greens, mushrooms, tomatoes, carrots, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, spinach, kale, sea veggies, peppers, etc. Some of these should that help keep your net carbs low. Healthy food choices that are high in protein but low-carb or no-carb include: grass-fed meat, pasture-raised poultry, cage-free eggs, bone brothwild-caught fish, organ meatsand raw dairy products, such as raw goat cheese. If you’re vegan or vegetarian, never fear, as a vegetarian or vegan keto diet is very doable. , which are also low-carb or no-carb, include: olive oil, coconut oil, grass-fed butter, palm oil, nuts and seeds. Minimal fruits but berries and avocado (yes, it’s a fruit) are definitely allowed. Want some sweet without the carbs or artificial sweeteners? Go with stevia and monk fruit. Avoid processed and ultra-processed foods high in calories and bankrupt in terms of nutrients: those made with white flour or wheat flour products, added table sugar, conventional dairy, bread and other processed grains like pasta, sweetened snacks like cookies and cakes, most boxed cereals, sweetened drinks, ice cream and pizza. Remember, the ketogenic diet will actually change your metabolism, put you into ketosis and turn you from a sugar burner to a fat burner. Those are significant changes for your body, and you’re bound to notice some symptoms of the so-called keto flu.  and side effects can include feeling tired, having difficulty sleeping, digestive issues like constipation, weakness during workouts, being moody, losing libido and having bad breath. Fortunately, these side effects don’t affect everyone and often only last for 1–2 weeks. (And yes, you CAN .) Overall, symptoms go away as your body adjusts to being in ketosis. If a ketogenic diet is being used for a , close medical monitoring is necessary. If you’re very active and without much body fat, consider trying carb cycling or at least eating a modified keto diet that does not severely restrict carb intake. Ketogenic diets were originally developed to help improve symptoms of epilepsy (specifically in children who didn’t improve from other treatments), but today very low-carb diets are used to help adults, too, including those suffering from many other chronic health problems like obesity, cancer and diabetes. Does the keto diet work? Yes! Rapid and reliable weight loss will occur in even a keto for beginners diet, due to lowered insulin levels and the body being forced to burn stored body fat for energy.

62f3f396-5b46-47fa-ae08-a3624a62387a,"The ketogenic diet is one of the most popular low-carb diets on the planet. It helps your body switch its main fuel source from glucose — a type of sugar — to ketones — compounds made by breaking down fat that serve as an alternative fuel source (). A ketogenic diet not only helps you lose weight but is also linked to numerous benefits, such as increased levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and reduced blood sugar, insulin, and triglyceride levels (, ). However, some people find that it takes them much longer to enter ketosis than others. What’s more, many struggle to enter ketosis in the first place. This article tells you how long it takes to enter ketosis and why you may not be there — yet. To reap the benefits of a ketogenic diet, your body must enter a state called . This is a metabolic state in which your body converts fat into molecules called ketones, which it uses as its main source of energy when glucose — a type of sugar —is limited (). The best way to reach ketosis is to drastically reduce your intake of carbs. In your digestive tract, carbs are broken down into sugar molecules — such as glucose — so they can travel across the bloodstream and be used for energy. If your body has excess glucose, it can be stored in your liver and muscles in its storage form, glycogen. By drastically to under 50 grams per day, your body is forced to use up its glycogen stores for energy — and eventually, switch to using ketones as fuel (). The time it takes to enter ketosis varies from person to person (, ). In general, it takes 2–4 days if you eat 20–50 grams of carbs per day. However, some people may find it takes a week or longer to reach this state (, , ). Some factors that can affect how long it takes to enter ketosis include your typical daily carb intake, your daily fat and protein intake, exercise, your age, and your metabolism. For example, people who typically consume a high-carb diet before starting a keto diet may take longer to enter ketosis than those who generally eat a low-to-moderate carb diet. This is because your body needs to deplete its glycogen stores before entering ketosis (). It typically takes 2–4 days to enter ketosis if you eat fewer than 50 grams of carbs per day. However, some people may take longer depending on factors like physical activity level, age, metabolism, and carb, fat, and protein intake. As your body transitions into ketosis, you may experience several symptoms — sometimes known as the “.” These include headaches, fatigue, nausea, bad breath, and increased thirst, (). While these symptoms may give you an indication that your body is transitioning, the best way to tell whether you’re in ketosis is to test your body’s ketone levels. Testing your body’s ketone levels is the best way to . There are three types of ketones — acetoacetate, acetone, and beta-hydroxybutyrate — that you can measure through your urine, breath, and blood, respectively. Acetoacetate levels can be measured through your urine with a ketone urine strip, which turns various shades of pink or purple depending on the ketone level of your urine. Darker colors typically mean that your urine contains higher levels (, ). Urine testing strips are a cheap and simple way to tell whether you’re in ketosis. However, they aren’t as accurate as other tools. Acetone levels can be measured with a ketone breath meter, such as a Ketonix. This meter flashes a color to let you know whether you’re in ketosis and how high your ketone levels are. Studies show that ketone breath meters are fairly accurate (). Beta-hydroxybutyrate levels are measured using a blood ketone meter, which works similarly to a glucometer — a tool that measures blood glucose levels at home. To use a blood ketone meter, simply use the small accompanying pin to prick your finger and draw blood, then let the top of the strip come in contact with your blood (). A blood ketone level above 0.5 mmol indicates that your body is entering ketosis. That said, a blood ketone range of 1.5–3.0 mmol per liter is ideal for maintaining ketosis (, ). While blood ketone meters are effective at measuring ketones, the strips — in contrast to urine testing strips — are quite expensive. should give you an accurate idea of whether you’re in ketosis. This lets you know whether you need to make adjustments to enter or stay in this state. You can tell whether you’re in ketosis by looking for symptoms or testing your ketone levels with a breath meter, urine sticks, or a blood ketone meter. There are many reasons why some people take longer to enter ketosis than others. In most cases, it’s due to unintentionally eating more carbs than recommended for a . Eating too many carbs can stop your body from producing ketones. It’s worth noting that some people can enter ketosis while eating a higher number of carbs (up to 90 grams per day), while others need to eat fewer — as low as 25 grams per day (). Therefore, you may need to further reduce your carb intake if you’re struggling to enter ketosis. Another is not eating enough fat on a ketogenic diet. In general, people should aim to consume 65-90% of their daily calories from fat, 10-30% from protein, and less than 5% from carbs (). Also, eating too much protein on a keto diet may make it harder to enter ketosis, as it may encourage your body to use gluconeogenesis — a process that converts amino acids from protein into sugar. Too much sugar can stop your body from producing ketones (). Aside from diet, lifestyle factors — including exercise, sleep, and stress — can affect the time it takes to enter ketosis. For example, exercise helps your body empty its carb stores faster. Thus, people who exercise more may enter ketosis faster (, ). If you struggle to get into ketosis, check whether you’re making any of these mistakes. It may take you longer to enter ketosis if you eat too many carbs, don’t eat enough fat, don’t exercise enough, or don’t get enough sleep. If you struggle to get into ketosis, here are a that can help you get there faster: This should encourage your body to produce ketones. People who struggle to enter ketosis may need to stick to the lower end of the scale (). This helps to ensure you eat 20–50 grams of carbs per day and don’t underestimate your carb intake. While there are many keto-friendly restaurants, eating out makes it harder to track your carbs. It’s easy to overlook condiments, but many sauces and dressings are high in carbs. Aim to get at least 70% of your calories from healthy fats, such as nuts, nut butter, extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, avocados, meats, eggs, and fatty fish like salmon. A short-term, high-fat fast — such as — can help you get into ketosis faster, as it’s very low in carbs and high in fat. Fasts like intermittent fasting may help your body shift its fuel source from carbs to fat while maintaining its energy balance (). MCTs are a type of fat that’s rapidly absorbed by your body and easily converted into ketones (, ). Physical activity can deplete your body’s glycogen stores, which encourages your liver to increase its production of ketones. Studies show that working out in a fasted state can help increase ketone levels (, ). Testing ketone levels helps give you an idea of whether you’re in ketosis — which lets you adjust your diet accordingly. Following some of the tips listed above — such as tracking your carb intake or trying a short-term fast — may help you reach ketosis. In general, it should take you 2–4 days to enter ketosis. However, some people may find they need a week or longer. The time it takes depends on various factors, such as your age, metabolism, , and current carb, protein, and fat intake. The best way to tell whether you’re in ketosis is to measure your ketone levels using either a breath, urine, or blood ketone measuring tool. If you struggle to enter ketosis, try , ramping up your exercise, or following a few of the other tips provided above. Ketosis is a metabolic state that can be caused by a low-carb or ketogenic diet.

Hint: It Can Help You Burn Fat & Suppress Your Appetite 3. Improvements in Blood Sugar Control & Heart Health 5. Reduced Risk for Other Chronic Diseases (Especially Neurological) We’ve longed been told that calorie restriction, increasing exercise and reducing dietary fat intake are the keys to weight loss. But, if you’ve ever attempted to control your weight by subsisting on fewer calories — especially from mostly bland “diet foods”— you’re already probably aware that this typically produces minimal results and is extremely hard to stick with long-term or consistently. Considering the high rates of obesity now facing most developed nations — along with an increased risk for health conditions like diabetes or heart problems as a result — researchers have been anxiously working on how to suppress appetite and achieve weight loss in a healthy, sustainable manner. The has emerged over the past several decades as one potential answer to this large-scale weight loss problem. () While there are some differences in opinion, depending on who you ask, regarding the best approach to very , studies consistently show that the ketogenic diet (also called the keto diet) produces not only substantial weight loss for a high percentage of people who adhere to it, but also other important health benefits such as reductions in seizures, markers of diabetes and more. The keto diet revolves around eating foods that are , consuming only moderate protein and severely restricting the number of carbs eaten each day. Even if you don’t have much weight to lose, entering into a state of ketosis can be helpful for other reasons — such as for improved energy levels, mental capabilities and mood stabilization. Ketosis is the result of following the ketogenic diet, which is why it’s also sometimes called “the ketosis diet.” Ketosis takes place when glucose from (like grains, all sources of sugar or fruit, for example) is drastically reduced, which forces the body to find an alternative fuel source: fat. Although dietary fat (especially ) often gets a bad name, provoking fear of weight gain and heart disease, it’s also your body’s second preferred source of energy when carbohydrates are not easily accessible. Because it also requires drastic carbohydrate restriction, complete or intermittent fasting can also induce states of ketosis. () However, total fasting, which would result in a level of ketosis comparable to the ketogenic diet, isn’t easy to maintain beyond a few days. In the absence of glucose, which is normally used by cells as a quick source of energy, the body starts to burn fat and produces ketones instead. Once ketone levels in the blood rise to a certain point, you enter into a state of ketosis— which usually results in quick and consistent weight loss until you reach a healthy, stable body weight. Let’s go through that again, step by step. What is ketosis? Here’s how it works: 1. Consumption of glucose from carbohydrate foods — grains, starchy vegetables, , etc. — is cut way down. 2. This forces your body to find an alternative fuel source: fat (think avocados, coconut oil, salmon). 3. Meanwhile, in the absence of glucose, the body also starts to burn fat and produces ketones instead. 4. Once ketone levels in the blood rise to a certain point, you enter into a state of ketosis. 5. This state results in quick and consistent weight loss until you reach a healthy, stable body weight. To sum up a complex process, ketosis happens when the the liver breaks down fat into fatty acids and glycerol, through a process called beta-oxidation. There are three primary types of ketone bodies that are water-soluble molecules produced in the liver: acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetone. The body then further breaks down these fatty acids into an energy-rich substance called ketones that circulate through the bloodstream. Fatty acid molecules are broken down through the process called ketogenesis, and a specific ketone body called acetoacetate is formed which supplies energy. The end result is staying fueled off of circulating ketones (which are also sometimes called ketone bodies) — which is what’s responsible for in a way that some people like to say turns you into a “fat-burning machine.” The goal of the ketogenic diet is to keep you in this fat-burning metabolic state of ketosis. This is achieved by following a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet that includes only moderate amounts of protein. Foods like bread, cereal, processed snacks and sugary drinks are therefore off the table, while fattier foods like butter, grass-fed beef, fish and also non-starchy veggies take center stage, providing the majority of daily calories (as much as 70–80 percent). How long does it take to get into ketosis? This will depend on a few factors, including how strictly you limit your carb intake and also certain variables that are mostly out of your control, like your genetics, medical history, body composition and energy needs. If you’re consistently eating from , you should be able to see results and improvements within a short couple of weeks. Beginning the ketogenic diet is different than making most other dietary changes, including many popular low-carb diets, because it involves actually changing your metabolism is pretty significant ways. Most people find that if they ease into the diet, giving themselves about 3–4 weeks to adjust, they experience fewer negative symptoms associated with the early stages. While entering into ketosis it’s common to notice certain signs and symptoms of your body changing. These have been nicknamed by some “the .” While implementing the ketogenic diet can be challenging at first, commonly causing some side effects that can last for 1–2 weeks (or potentially more), these typically go away with time. Symptoms usually decrease as your body get’s more accustomed to being in ketosis, but in the meantime you might find that you experience: Feeling tired and having low energy despite sleeping well Digestive issues like or bloating due to water retention (especially after higher carb days) Feeling weaker during workouts and not recovering well Most of these side effects happen completely “in your head” — they’re literally caused by your brain. See, every healthy cell in your body  brain cells can derive energy from one of three sources: glucose, ketone bodies and fatty acids (for a short period of time). However, your brain can’t utilize fatty acids since they don’t cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). When you’ve restricted glucose intake and before your liver starts producing ample ketone bodies, your brain thinks it’s running out of energy, leading to at least a few days of uncomfortable keto flu side effects. (2) Now that you’re aware of what the initial phase might feel like, here’s the good news: You’re also likely to notice improvements in several health markers, as well as appetite suppression due to keto diet. Below are some positive signs that you’re transitioning effectively into ketosis: Weight loss (this can happen quickly due to losing both water and fat) Reduced hunger and cravings. You might notice you’re able to “fast” for longer and feel less desire to eat many times per day. In fact, appetite suppression is one of the most meaningful signs of ketosis and often very obvious. Potentially improved energy, concentration and mental performance (especially after some time has passed). Initially the opposite might occur, but then you should notice no afternoon “energy dips” and, instead, more sustained energy. According to most experts on the ketogenic diet, technically is defined by serum ketone levels (the amount of ketones in the blood) that fall between 0.5 to 3.0 mM.() Some believe that 1.5 – 3 mmol/L is “,” which might contribute to the most weight loss. Every person is a bit different in terms of what exact macronutrient ratio will keep them in this range, while also allowing them to feel their best in terms of energy levels and other symptoms. You can experiment with different carb amounts while testing to see how this affects your ketone levels, aiming to remain in nutritional ketosis (0.5 to 3.0 mM), as long as you feel well doing so. Try to test at the same time each day for consistency and avoid testing right after exercise. You can know for sure that you’re in ketosis by measuring ketones in the blood, breath or urine. Several options for doing this include: Using a blood ketone meter: These use test trips and provide precise measurements of levels of BHB ketones in your blood. They can be purchased online and sometimes are a bit costly, but are a reliable way to know you’re consuming the right macronutrient ratio to remain in the correct metabolic state. Performing urine strip tests: You can measure ketone levels by using inexpensive urine strips, which is cost efficient and simple to do. However, the downside is that only acetoacetate ketone levels are revealed, not levels of BHB. Two popular types are called Ketostix and Uriscan. Using a breathalyzer: These measure the ketone called acetone and don’t require strips, however they may not be as accurate as blood tests. The ketogenic diet approach to eating is one that can often be maintained and incorporated into a lifestyle, while the same can hardly ever be said for diets that restrict calories and fat, because they simply leave you feeling too hungry. When you eat more food than your body needs, it’s converted to triglycerides and stored inside your fat cells. The more often you keep consuming large amounts of glucose through carbohydrate foods, the less your body needs to tap into existing sources (your fat cells or stored glycogen in your liver and muscles) for energy, so your newly added fat cells remain intact and, therefore, weight loss is much more difficult. On a keto diet, carbs provide only about 5 percent of daily calories, compared to anywhere between 40–60 percent on a “standard diet.” Reducing carbohydrate consumption this drastically means that the majority of empty calories from must be eliminated from your diet, including things like white bread and rolls, pasta, rice or other grains, sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts, etc. These are the same foods that tend to cause fluctuating , cravings for more carbs and sugar, low energy and contribute to overeating in general. With their absence, the body starts burning its own excess fat stores instead, promoting weight loss in a very high percentage of people. () In contrast to most other diet plans, remaining in ketosis doesn’t require counting calories, measuring portions or dealing with hunger pangs for the sake of eating as little as possible. In fact, most people feel satisfied and energized while in ketosis and find that they can go for longer periods without the need to eat (which is why is commonly practiced with a keto diet). Compared to meals that mostly contains carbs, high-fat, moderate protein meals are very filling and do a great job of controlling hunger hormones, often for many hours. This results in less need for snacking or grazing throughout the day, especially on junk foods or sweets. Clinical results suggest both direct and indirect actions of ketones via modifications of various hunger-related hormones concentrations. While it’s not completely clear how ketosis reduces appetite, studies have found that ketosis is effective at lowering food intake and regulating appetite by altering levels of the hunger hormones including cholecystokinin (CCK) and ghrelin. At the same, ketone bodies seem to affect the hypothalamus region in the brain, positively impact leptin signals, and avoid slowing down the metabolism like most other diets do. () 3. Improvements in Blood Sugar Control & Heart Health Aside from its benefits related to weight loss, the keto diet can also drastically improve other health conditions tied to factors like poor blood sugar management, overeating and poor gut health. These contribute to common health problems such as: High blood pressure and unhealthy Indigestion, including IBS symptoms or acid reflux () The keto diet has also been used for decades to help control seizures and symptoms of epilepsy in both children and adults () How can ketosis help reduce your risk various health concerns? It comes down to the benefits of stabilizing your blood sugar and decreasing glucose intake and usage. As glucose enters your blood, your pancreas sends out insulin to pick up the sugar and carry it to your cells so they can use it as energy. However, when your cells have used or stored all the glucose that they can, what remains is converted into glycogen to be stored in the liver and muscles OR converted into triglycerides, the storage form of fat. Not only do most people find that excess weight quickly drops off while on the keto diet, but many also experience improvements in terms of sustaining higher levels of energy. After a period of time, your body becomes adapted to instead of glucose. Your muscles begin to learn to convert acetoacetate into a ketogenic substance called beta-hydroxybutyrate, or BHB. BHB then becomes the new preferred ketogenic source of energy, including to fuel all brain activity. What is not needed is expelled from the body as waste. Another process also happens during ketosis that helps keep your body energized, and it’s called gluconeogenesis. This occurs when glycerol (created during beta-oxidation) get’s converted into glucose that your body can use for energy. Protein in your diet can also be converted to glucose in small amounts. So as you can see, essentially your body is able to create its own source of necessary glucose without getting it from carbohydrate foods. The human body is very efficient, and it knows just how to convert other macronutrients (protein and fat) into useable molecules that can be dispersed throughout the body as needed. 5. Reduced Risk for Other Chronic Diseases (Especially Neurological) There’s strong evidence that a keto diet can help treat or manage serious diseases including epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and certain types of cancer. Studies show the diet helps to reduce disruptions in nerve and neural activity in the brain. While it’s still not entirely clear how the keto diet helps treat these conditions, most experts believe that drastically cutting off glucose supply and entering ketosis helps elicit biochemical changes that prevent and eliminate short-circuits in the brain’s signaling system that are responsible for cellular damage, seizure and tumor growth. Other mechanisms that have been suggested include: changes in ATP production making neurons more resilient in the face of metabolic demands, altered brain pH affecting neuronal activity, direct inhibitory effects of ketone bodies or fatty acids on ion channels, alterations in amino acid metabolism, and changes in synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. () Inducing ketosis requires severely limiting your carbohydrate consumption, this way you cut off supply of glucose to your cells. In addition to severely restricting carbs, you also need to limit your protein consumption, since protein can be converted into glucose in small amounts. This is the exact reason that most low-carb diets (such as or the diet) do not result in ketosis, because they allow a high intake of protein that keeps supplying the body with enough energy that it doesn’t need to burn fat. If you intend to follow a “strict” ketogenic diet, aim to get 60–80 percent of your daily calories from sources of fat. Between 15–25 percent of calories should be from protein sources, and only about 5–10 percent from carbohydrates. Based on the fact that most authorities recommend getting 45–65 percent of your calories from carbohydrates and only 20– 35 percent of your calories from fat, this will likely be very different than what you’re used to. For optimal results and the quickest improvements in terms of blood sugar and weight loss, it’s recommended you aim to eat between 20–30 grams of net carbs (total grams of carbs minus grams of fiber) a day. It’s usually best to include more carbs to begin with during your transition into ketosis, in order to help you adjust and avoid strong side effects (more on this below). Aim for around 50–60 grams net carbs daily in the beginning while you work towards decreasing to 20–30 grams if you wish. Keep in mind that the ketogenic diet takes into account , not simply total grams. Net carbohydrates are the amount of carbohydrates left over after you subtract grams of fiber from total grams of carbohydrates. For example, if vegetables you’re eating have 5 grams of carbohydrates total, but 3 grams come from , the total number of is only 2 grams, which is the number you add to your daily total. To figure out how many calories you need from , first figure out how many calories you should be eating in total for weight maintenance or loss. You can use an online calculator, such as the one created by the  to help determine your energy/calorie needs. Then split up your calorie intake into fats, proteins and carbs. Make sure to and also increase your intake of electrolytes, especially potassium from things like leafy greens and avocado. Exercise might also help you get into ketosis faster, although in the initial stages this may be hard due to low energy levels. Remember that as your body changes — for example, you lose weight or increase muscle mass — your calorie needs and macronutrient ranges may also need to change. Always monitor your own biofeedback to make sure you’re fueling your body in the best way possible. Before starting the ketogenic diet, it’s always best to consult with your physician if you have a history of existing health conditions including , kidney disease or damage, heart problems, a hormonal imbalance, or history with an eating disorder. The ketogenic diet may not be safe for people with certain metabolic conditions or health conditions, especially: One particular concern to be aware of is the, which especially applies to diabetics. Ketoacidosis is a dangerous metabolic state in which excessive amounts of ketones are produced. In mostly healthy individuals, ketosis is regulated by insulin, which is the hormone that controls the creation of ketone bodies and regulates the flow of fatty acids into the blood. People with do not produce enough insulin, so their bodies are unable to regulate ketones, which can lead to a dangerous environment. Always consult with your doctor if you have diabetes before changing your diet, and look out for warning signs of ketoacidosis including: excessive thirst, increased urination, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, weakness, fatigue and confusion. Ketosis is the result of following the ketogenic diet (sometimes called “the ketosis diet”). While entering into ketosis it’s common to notice certain signs and symptoms of your body changing, which can be both pleasant or uncomfortable. These include reduced appetite/suppressed hunger, weight loss, changes in energy levels and sleep, bad breath, digestive issues or moodiness. The unwanted side effects of ketosis (nicknamed “the keto flu”) usually go away within a couple of weeks and can commonly be managed by eating more fat, drinking enough water, getting more electrolytes, resting and being patient during the transition.

Between 15–25 percent of calories should be from protein sources, and only about 5–10 percent from carbohydrates. Based on the fact that most authorities recommend getting 45–65 percent of your calories from carbohydrates and only 20– 35 percent of your calories from fat, this will likely be very different than what you’re used to. For optimal results and the quickest improvements in terms of blood sugar and weight loss, it’s recommended you aim to eat between 20–30 grams of net carbs (total grams of carbs minus grams of fiber) a day. It’s usually best to include more carbs to begin with during your transition into ketosis, in order to help you adjust and avoid strong side effects (more on this below). Aim for around 50–60 grams net carbs daily in the beginning while you work towards decreasing to 20–30 grams if you wish. Keep in mind that the ketogenic diet takes into account , not simply total grams. Net carbohydrates are the amount of carbohydrates left over after you subtract grams of fiber from total grams of carbohydrates. For example, if vegetables you’re eating have 5 grams of carbohydrates total, but 3 grams come from , the total number of is only 2 grams, which is the number you add to your daily total. To figure out how many calories you need from , first figure out how many calories you should be eating in total for weight maintenance or loss. You can use an online calculator, such as the one created by the  to help determine your energy/calorie needs. Then split up your calorie intake into fats, proteins and carbs. Make sure to and also increase your intake of electrolytes, especially potassium from things like leafy greens and avocado. Exercise might also help you get into ketosis faster, although in the initial stages this may be hard due to low energy levels. Remember that as your body changes — for example, you lose weight or increase muscle mass — your calorie needs and macronutrient ranges may also need to change. Always monitor your own biofeedback to make sure you’re fueling your body in the best way possible. Before starting the ketogenic diet, it’s always best to consult with your physician if you have a history of existing health conditions including , kidney disease or damage, heart problems, a hormonal imbalance, or history with an eating disorder. The ketogenic diet may not be safe for people with certain metabolic conditions or health conditions, especially: One particular concern to be aware of is the, which especially applies to diabetics. Ketoacidosis is a dangerous metabolic state in which excessive amounts of ketones are produced. In mostly healthy individuals, ketosis is regulated by insulin, which is the hormone that controls the creation of ketone bodies and regulates the flow of fatty acids into the blood. People with do not produce enough insulin, so their bodies are unable to regulate ketones, which can lead to a dangerous environment. Always consult with your doctor if you have diabetes before changing your diet, and look out for warning signs of ketoacidosis including: excessive thirst, increased urination, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, weakness, fatigue and confusion. Ketosis is the result of following the ketogenic diet (sometimes called “the ketosis diet”). While entering into ketosis it’s common to notice certain signs and symptoms of your body changing, which can be both pleasant or uncomfortable. These include reduced appetite/suppressed hunger, weight loss, changes in energy levels and sleep, bad breath, digestive issues or moodiness. The unwanted side effects of ketosis (nicknamed “the keto flu”) usually go away within a couple of weeks and can commonly be managed by eating more fat, drinking enough water, getting more electrolytes, resting and being patient during the transition.

3b66abd2-1660-4d8c-a55d-29c8b2604329,"— The keto diet follows a very low carb, high fat eating pattern aimed at achieving weight loss or other health benefits (). Typically, strict versions of the diet forbid legumes given their generally higher carb contents. While edamame beans are legumes, their unique nutritional profile may make you wonder whether they’re keto-friendly. This article explores whether edamame can fit into your keto diet. The is very low in carbs, high in fat, and moderate in protein. This eating pattern causes your body to switch into ketosis, a metabolic state in which your body burns fat — instead of carbs — to make ketone bodies and use them as fuel (, ). To do so, the ketogenic diet typically limits carbs to no more than 5–10% of your daily calorie intake, or a maximum of about 50 grams per day (). For context, 1/2 cup (86 grams) of cooked black beans has 20 grams of carbs. Given that legumes like black beans are a carb-rich food, they’re not considered keto-friendly (). You’ll need to sustain this low carb intake to maintain . Getting too many carbs in your diet will flip your body back into carb-burning mode. Those who follow the diet are attracted to its ability to cause rapid weight loss, as well as its association with other health benefits, such as improved blood sugar control and reduced seizures among those with epilepsy (, , ). However, more research is needed on the long-term effects of the diet on overall health. The keto diet is very low carb and fat-rich. It flips your body into ketosis, which is maintained with a carb intake of no more than 5–10% of your daily calorie intake. The diet has been linked to several health benefits. Edamame beans are immature that are typically steamed or boiled in their green shell (). They’re considered a legume, a category that also includes beans, lentils, and chickpeas. Legumes, including soy-based foods, are usually thought of as being too carb-rich to be part of a keto diet. However, edamame beans are unique. They have ample amounts of dietary fiber — which helps compensate for their overall carb content (). This is because dietary fiber is a type of carb that your body doesn’t digest. Instead, it moves along your digestive tract and adds bulk to your stool. A 1/2-cup (75-gram) serving of shelled edamame has 9 grams of carbs. Yet, when you subtract its 4 grams of dietary fiber, it yields just 5 grams of net carbs (). The term refers to the carbs that remain after subtracting dietary fiber from total carbs. While edamame can be added to your keto diet, keep your portion size to a modest amount of 1/2 cup (75 grams) to help sustain ketosis. Edamame beans are legumes, which are generally excluded from the keto diet. However, they’re high in dietary fiber, which helps compensate for some of the carbs. Modest portions of these beans are fine on a keto diet. Various factors may influence edamame’s designation as keto-friendly. For instance, preparation is something to consider. Edamame can be steamed, boiled, or fried — in or out of its pod. While its fuzzy outer pod is inedible, its bright-green beans are often shelled and eaten on their own. They can also be puréed or incorporated whole into a range of foods, like and grain bowls, which may or may not be keto-friendly. Keep in mind that what you’re eating alongside your edamame will contribute to the number of carbs you’re getting in that meal. Taking this into account will aid your efforts to maintain ketosis. The shells of edamame are often topped with salt, seasoned mixes, or glazes. These preparations, especially those that incorporate sugar or flour, may add to the overall carb count. Not all preparations of edamame are keto-friendly. These beans can be added to dishes that take you over your keto carb limit or may be topped with carb-rich ingredients. There are many benefits to including edamame in your keto diet. Edamame beans have a , which means they don’t spike your blood sugar like some other carbs might. This is due to their high fiber and protein contents (, ). A 1/2 cup (75 grams) of edamame packs 8 grams of protein, a nutrient that’s important for tissue repair and several other vital functions (, , , ). What’s more, edamame delivers other important nutrients, including iron, folate, vitamins K and C, and potassium, some of which may be lacking in a keto diet (). While is important for red blood cell formation, vitamin K aids proper clotting. Vitamin C is also crucial for health, specifically for its role in immune function and wound repair (, , ). It can be hard to get enough micronutrients on a strict keto diet, as such a diet cuts out some vegetables, as well as many fruits and grains. In modest portions, edamame can be a great addition to your keto diet. In modest portions, edamame can keep you in ketosis while delivering essential nutrients, such as fiber, iron, protein, folate, and vitamins C and K. The keto diet is high fat and very low in carbs. It flips your metabolism into ketosis, a state in which your body burns fat instead of carbs for fuel. To maintain ketosis, your carb intake needs to remain very low — often 50 grams of carbs or less per day. Typically, legumes are too carb-rich to be included in the keto diet. While edamame is a legume, its unique nutritional profile places it in a keto gray area. While strict keto dieters may find its carb content too high, others may find that it can occasionally be included in their keto diet in modest portions. Keep in mind that there are plenty of reasons to include beans in a keto diet, such as their high fiber and protein contents. They also pack important vitamins and minerals that optimize your overall health. — Edamame beans are whole, immature soybeans that are healthy and easy to eat.

97430cf0-57b6-4948-a625-3b5eee12aa81,"The ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet that has been linked to many health benefits, including weight loss and preventing age-related mental decline (). As this diet grows in popularity, a number of keto-friendly supplements have become available to consumers. Exogenous ketone supplements are claimed to provide the benefits of a ketogenic diet even when the consumer is not following one. Prüvit Keto OS is a brand of these supplements marketed for their ability to increase energy, boost athletic performance and reduce appetite. This article reviews Prüvit Keto OS supplements and explores the evidence behind exogenous ketones. Keto OS supplements are made by Prüvit, a self-proclaimed worldwide leader in ketone technology. Keto OS, which stands for “Ketone Operating System,” is an exogenous ketone drink offered in a variety of flavors. It comes as a powder in both bulk containers and “on-the-go” (OTG) packets and is meant to be dissolved in cold water. Prüvit recommends that a heaping scoop of Keto OS be mixed with 12 to 16 ounces of cold water and taken once a day for therapeutic benefits or twice a day for “optimal performance.” Ketones, or “ketone bodies,” are compounds produced by the body as an alternate energy source when glucose (blood sugar) is unavailable to use for fuel (). Examples of times when the body produces ketones include starvation, prolonged fasting and . In these situations, the body goes into a metabolic state called and becomes very efficient at burning fat for energy. In a process called ketogenesis, the liver takes fatty acids and converts them to ketones for the body to use as energy. During times of low blood sugar availability, these ketones become the main energy source for tissues able to break them down, including brain and muscle tissue. The ketones made during ketogenesis are acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetone (). These are ketones made naturally by the body through the process of ketogenesis. These are ketones supplied to the body by an external source like a nutritional supplement. Most exogenous ketone supplements, including Keto OS, use beta-hydroxybutyrate as their exogenous ketone source because it is used most efficiently by the body (). There are two forms of exogenous ketone supplements: This is the form found in most ketone supplements available on the market, including Keto OS. Ketone salts contain ketones that are most commonly bound to sodium, calcium or potassium to increase uptake. Ketone esters are primarily used in research and are not currently available to consumers. This form consists of pure beta-hydroxybutyrate without other additives. Aside from beta-hydroxybutyrate, Prüvit Keto OS supplements contain caffeine, MCT (medium-chain triglyceride) powder, malic acid, ascorbic acid and the natural, zero-calorie sweetener Stevia. Prüvit Keto OS supplements are gluten-free but do contain milk ingredients. Prüvit Keto OS is an exogenous ketone supplement that provides consumers with an immediate source of ketones. The type of ketone found in Prüvit OS supplements is called beta-hydroxybutyrate. Prüvit claims that Keto OS supplements allow consumers to reach a state of nutritional ketosis within 60 minutes of consuming them. This may be attractive to those who are turned off by the hard work and dedication it takes to get the body into a state of ketosis through a ketogenic diet, which can take weeks. The standard ketogenic diet is typically composed of 5% carbohydrates, 15% protein and 80% fat. It can be hard to follow for a prolonged period of time. Exogenous ketone supplements were created to provide people with a shortcut to reach ketosis and experience its related benefits without having to follow a strict diet or partake in fasting. In contrast to the slow rise of ketones associated with following a ketogenic diet, drinking an exogenous ketone supplement like Keto OS results in a rapid rise in blood ketones (). After being ingested, beta-hydroxybutyrate is absorbed into the bloodstream and then converted into an effective energy source for the body. The appeal of exogenous ketones is that they raise ketone levels even when the consumer is not in a state of ketosis before ingesting them. It has been purported that reaching nutritional ketosis through supplementation can deliver the same benefits as reaching ketosis through a ketogenic diet or by fasting. include weight loss, increased energy and mental clarity. Exogenous ketone supplements deliver an instant supply of ketones to the body without the need to reach ketosis through diet or fasting. While the ketogenic diet has been extensively researched and its benefits substantiated, research on exogenous ketones is in its early stages. However, there are several studies on the potential benefits of exogenous ketones that have had promising results. Due to the body’s increased need for glucose (blood sugar) during intense training, the glucose-sparing qualities of exogenous ketones may be helpful for athletes. Low levels of muscle glycogen (the storage form of glucose) have been shown to inhibit athletic performance (). In fact, “hitting the wall” is a common term used to describe the fatigue and energy loss related to the depletion of muscle and liver glycogen reserves (). Some studies have demonstrated that providing athletes with exogenous ketone supplements may improve athletic performance. One study of 39 high-performance athletes found that drinking 260 mg of ketone esters per pound of body weight (573 mg/kg) during exercise improved athletic performance. The athletes in the study who consumed the ketone drink traveled an average of 1/4 mile (400 meters) farther over a half hour than those who consumed a drink containing carbohydrates or fat (). Exogenous ketones may also help you recover more quickly after intense workouts by promoting the replenishment of muscle glycogen. However, exogenous ketones may not be effective for athletes who participate in exercises that require short bursts of energy like sprinting. This is because these exercises are anaerobic (without oxygen) in nature. The body needs oxygen to break down ketones (). Additionally, the exogenous ketone supplements currently available on the market contain ketone salts, which are less potent than the ketone esters used in current studies. The ability of the ketogenic diet to reduce appetite and help with weight loss has been demonstrated in many studies (). The elevation of ketones in the blood associated with the ketogenic diet has been linked to a reduction in appetite (, , ). Supplementing with exogenous ketones may be an effective way to reduce appetite, as well. Ketones can suppress appetite by impacting the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that regulates food intake and energy balance (). One study of 15 people found that those who consumed 0.86 calories of ketone esters per pound (1.9 calories/kg) of body weight had significantly less hunger and desire to eat, compared to those who consumed a carbohydrate drink. What’s more, hormones that increase appetite like and insulin were significantly lower in the group that consumed the ketone ester drink (). Ketones have been shown to be an effective alternative fuel source for the brain in times of low glucose availability. There is also evidence that ketone bodies help reduce neurological damage by blocking inflammasomes, a group of protein complexes that cause inflammation in the body (). Supplementing with exogenous ketones has helped improve mental function in many studies, particularly in people with Alzheimer’s disease (). Brain glucose uptake is impaired in people with Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment. Thus, it has been suggested that the gradual depletion of brain glucose can contribute to the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (). One study followed 20 adults with Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment. Increasing their blood levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate by supplementing with MCT oil — a type of saturated fat that promotes ketone production — led to a greater , compared to a placebo (). Several studies on rats and mice with Alzheimer’s disease have found that supplementing with ketone esters led to improvements in memory and learning, plus helped reduce anxiety-related behavior (, , ). Exogenous ketones have also been found to help reduce neurological damage related to epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease (, , ). Reaching a state of ketosis has been associated with weight loss, better appetite control and protection from chronic diseases like diabetes (, ). However, by following a ketogenic diet or fasting can be difficult for many people. Exogenous ketone supplements can help you get there more quickly. Prüvit Keto OS supplements contain both beta-hydroxybutyrate and MCT powder. Supplementing with both beta-hydroxybutyrate and MCTs has been shown to effectively raise levels of ketones in the blood without the need for dietary change (). However, it’s important to note that ketone salts, which are the kind of ketones found in Keto OS, are much less effective at raising ketone levels than ketone esters. In several studies, supplementing with ketone salts resulted in beta-hydroxybutyrate levels of less than 1 mmol/L, while taking ketone esters raised blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations to 3 to 5 mmol/L (, , ). Even though the benefit may be small, exogenous ketone salt supplements like Keto OS do provide a quick boost of ketones. Recommendations for blood ketone levels vary depending on your goal, but most experts recommend a range between 0.5–3.0 mmol/L. Those beginning a ketogenic diet sometimes find exogenous ketones to be helpful not only in raising ketone levels but also in reducing symptoms of “keto flu.” These include nausea and fatigue, which sometimes occur in the first weeks of the diet as the body adjusts. Exogenous ketone supplements may help boost athletic performance, reduce appetite and prevent mental decline. They may also be beneficial for people trying to reach ketosis more quickly. Although there have been some benefits associated with taking ketone supplements, there are possible risks and unpleasant effects, as well. One of the most common side effects of these supplements is stomach upset, including diarrhea, pain and gas (). When following a ketogenic diet, elevated ketone levels in the body can cause bad breath. This can also happen when taking supplements (). Ketone supplements can significantly reduce blood sugar levels, making it important for those with diabetes to consult their doctor before use. Prüvit recommends two servings of Keto OS per day for “optimal performance.” Following this recommendation, two weeks’ worth of Prüvit Keto OS will cost around $182. Though ketone salts are much more tolerable to drink than ketone esters, the main complaint of Keto OS consumers is that the supplement has an unpleasant taste. Additionally, the long-term effects of combining a non-ketogenic diet with exogenous ketone supplements are unknown. More research is needed before potential benefits and risks can be fully understood. Research on exogenous ketone supplements is limited at this time, and studies on their potential benefits are ongoing. As more information is discovered through scientific studies, the applications and limitations of exogenous ketones will be better understood. Potential risks of consuming exogenous ketones include stomach upset, low blood sugar levels and bad breath. Additionally, exogenous ketones are expensive and scientific studies on their efficacy and safety are limited. Using exogenous ketones, especially by people not following a ketogenic diet, is a new trend. Some evidence shows that these supplements can boost athletic performance, increase mental performance and decrease appetite, but studies providing conclusive results on the benefits of these supplements are limited. Hopefully, as the use of exogenous ketones continues to be explored, the potential benefits and risks of using these supplements will be better established. For people who are already following a ketogenic diet and want to reach ketosis a bit quicker or for athletes looking for a performance boost, an exogenous ketone supplement like Keto OS may be beneficial. However, due to the limited information on the effectiveness and safety of these supplements as well as the high cost, it may be a good idea to hold off on investing in Keto OS supplements until more scientific studies prove their benefits. Additionally, most of the studies examined the benefits of ketone esters, not the ketone salts that are found in supplements, like Keto OS, available to consumers. Although there are some ketone ester products being developed for public consumption, there aren’t any available at this time. Since little is known about the effects that exogenous ketones may have on different people, it’s always best to consult your doctor before taking these supplements. Exogenous ketone supplements like Keto OS are relatively new products that need to be researched further before conclusive benefits and risks can be confirmed. The use of exogenous ketones by the general public is a recent phenomenon. Although there is some evidence that exogenous ketones may be useful in neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s disease, studies on their use in other areas are limited. A few studies suggest these supplements may benefit appetite suppression and athletic performance, but more research is needed before a conclusion can be made. Due to the high cost and overall taste of Prüvit Keto OS supplements, it may be best to purchase a few packets to try before investing in several weeks’ worth of supplements. There may be some benefits to taking Prüvit Keto OS supplements, but the jury is still out on whether supplementing with exogenous ketones really translates to better health.

ab3b0c36-2acb-497d-b4c8-fa81fd8dd44b,"— — Menopause is a biological process marked by the cessation of menses and a natural decline in reproductive hormones in women. It can be accompanied by symptoms like hot flashes, sleep problems, and mood changes (). Modifying your diet under the guidance of a healthcare professional is a simple strategy that may help balance your hormone levels and alleviate certain symptoms of menopause. In particular, the ketogenic diet is a high fat, very low carb diet that’s often recommended to provide relief from menopause symptoms. However, it may also be associated with several side effects and not a great fit for everyone. This article reviews how the ketogenic diet may affect menopausal women. The ketogenic diet may be associated with several benefits, specifically during menopause. Menopause can cause several changes in hormone levels. In addition to altering levels of sex hormones like estrogen and progesterone, menopause can decrease , which can impair your body’s ability to use insulin effectively (). Insulin is a hormone that’s responsible for transporting sugar from your bloodstream into your cells, where it can be used as fuel (). Some research suggests that the ketogenic diet may improve insulin sensitivity to promote better (). One study found that following a ketogenic diet for 12 weeks improved insulin levels and insulin sensitivity in women with endometrial or ovarian cancer (). However, it’s unclear whether the diet would offer similar health benefits for menopausal women without these types of cancer. Another review reported that reducing carb consumption may decrease insulin levels and improve hormonal imbalances, which could be especially beneficial during menopause (). What’s more, studies suggest that insulin resistance may be linked to a higher risk of hot flashes, which are a common side effect of menopause (, ). is a symptom of menopause that’s often attributed to alterations in hormone levels and a slower metabolism. In addition to experiencing a decrease in calorie needs during menopause, some women undergo height loss, which could contribute to an increase in body mass index (BMI) (). Although research on the ketogenic diet specifically is limited, some studies have found that decreasing carb intake may help prevent . For example, one study in over 88,000 women found that following a low carb diet was linked to a decreased risk of postmenopausal weight gain. Conversely, following a low fat diet was tied to an increased risk of weight gain among participants (). However, it’s important to note that the reduced-carb diets included in this study contained significantly more carbs than a standard ketogenic dietary pattern. Many women experience increased hunger and during the transition into menopause (). Several studies have found that the ketogenic diet may decrease hunger and appetite, which could be especially beneficial during menopause (). According to one 95-person study that included 55 women, following the ketogenic diet for 9 weeks increased levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which is a hormone that regulates appetite. Interestingly, this increase was observed in the female participants (). Similarly, another small study noted that a low calorie ketogenic diet decreased appetite and levels of , a hormone that stimulates appetite (). However, more studies are needed to evaluate how the ketogenic diet may affect cravings and appetite in menopausal women specifically. Some research suggests that the ketogenic diet may improve insulin sensitivity, prevent weight gain, and decrease appetite and cravings. While the ketogenic diet may offer several benefits for women during menopause, there are some to consider. Menopause is associated with an increased risk of (). Some studies have associated the keto diet with increased LDL (bad) cholesterol and endothelial dysfunction, which involves a narrowing of the blood vessels on the surface of the heart. Both of these may further increase heart disease risk in menopausal women. Also, in one small study in healthy women in their 20s, following a ketogenic diet for 3 weeks was associated with a 39% increase in LDL (bad) cholesterol (). Though all participants had normal LDL levels at the start of the study, after 3 weeks on the ketogenic diet, 59% had LDL levels higher than the target for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (). What’s more, studies including people with high cholesterol, overweight, and obesity have shown decreased blood vessel health after following a ketogenic diet (, ). In one meta-analysis investigating the impact of low carb diets on blood vessel health, researchers found a 1% decrease in flow-mediated dilation, a test of blood vessel health, following at least 3 weeks on a low carb diet (). This reduction of flow-mediated dilation is associated with a 13% increased risk of future cardiovascular events like heart attack or stroke (). However, some studies have found low carb diets improve other cardiovascular risk factors by decreasing body weight, body mass index (BMI), percent body fat, blood pressure, and triglyceride levels, particularly in individuals with overweight or obesity (). Additionally, restricting your carb intake to the low levels required of a ketogenic diet may make it difficult to meet your recommended intakes for certain nutrients. In one study on the nutritional quality of the ketogenic diet, participants did not meet recommended daily allowances and adequate intakes for calcium, folate, magnesium, manganese, potassium, thiamin, and vitamins D and E (). Several studies show people following a ketogenic diet tend to consume less fiber (, , ). is beneficial for gut health, weight management, and immune function, protects against cardiovascular disease, and decreases your risk of type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancers (). Research also shows that ketogenic diets tend to contain more , which is associated with increased LDL (bad) cholesterol (, , ). However, consumption of some other micronutrients, such as vitamins A, B12, C, D, and K, as well as choline and selenium, may increase on a ketogenic diet (, ). The ketogenic diet can also cause the , which is a term used to describe the set of symptoms that occur as your body transitions into ketosis, a metabolic state in which your body burns fat for fuel instead of sugar. The keto flu could worsen certain symptoms of menopause, including fatigue, hair loss, sleep problems, and mood changes (, ). Still, keto flu symptoms typically resolve within a few days to a few weeks and can be minimized by staying hydrated and getting plenty of electrolytes (). Keep in mind that there’s currently a lack of research on the potential health effects of following a ketogenic diet for long time periods. Finally, although the diet may result in temporary weight loss, many people often regain some weight back once they resume a normal diet (). Be sure to consult a healthcare professional before making any changes to your diet to prevent any adverse effects on your health and ensure that you’re meeting your nutritional needs. The keto diet may increase LDL (bad) cholesterol and endothelial dysfunction, both of which may raise your heart disease risk. Also, following a keto diet may lead to micronutrient deficiencies, decreased fiber intake, and increased saturated fat intake. The may offer benefits for women during menopause, including increased insulin sensitivity, decreased weight gain, and reduced cravings.

3a523d2b-89d1-4dfc-8b38-ac5621bb8ffa,"Low-Carbohydrate and Very-Low-Carbohydrate Diets in Patients With Diabetes Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC Department of Internal Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC Duke Diet and Fitness Center, Department of Medicine, Duke University Health System, Durham, NC Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Durham, NC Corresponding author: Jennifer D. Merrill, Low-carbohydrate diets have been advocated as an effective method for promoting weight loss in overweight and obese individuals and preventing and treating type 2 diabetes. This article reviews the differences between various low-carbohydrate eating plans and discusses the benefits and drawbacks of such a diet based on available evidence. It also offers practical pointers for clinicians. Obesity is a growing epidemic; almost 40% of adults worldwide are overweight, and more than 650 million people are obese. This number has tripled since 1975 (). The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes has paralleled the increase in obesity. Elevated body weight increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and mortality (,). The development and progression of obesity and type 2 diabetes can be delayed with exercise, diet, and weight loss of 5–10% (–). Because type 2 diabetes is largely a lifestyle-mediated chronic disease, there has been growing emphasis on dietary modifications and on determining the optimal eating plan for combatting obesity, diabetes, and their comorbidities. Guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommend that overweight adults with type 2 diabetes reduce energy intake to promote weight loss (–). Macronutrient distribution should be tailored to patients’ eating patterns, preferences, and metabolic goals. Very-low-carbohydrate diets were the mainstay of diabetes therapy before the development of exogenous insulin, with a goal of minimizing glucosuria (,). In the late 1940s, high-fat diets were found to correlate with high cholesterol levels, leading to the promotion of low-fat diets (LFDs) rather than low-carbohydrate diets (LCDs) for people with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), including those with diabetes (). However, the obesity and diabetes epidemics continued to progress. In the 1970s, studies linked high-carbohydrate diets to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, and the paradigm began to shift from LFDs to LCDs (,). The article reviews the recent literature on LCDs for patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese. After about 4 days without carbohydrate consumption, glycogen is depleted and the body begins breaking down protein and fat for energy. Hormone-sensitive lipase is thought to be responsible for fatty acid release (). From partial degradation of long-chain fatty acids, the liver generates ketone bodies (acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate [BHB], and acetone) (). Ketones are taken up by tissues in need of energy, converted first to acetyl-CoA and then to adenosine triphosphate (). Skeletal muscle, the myocardium, and the liver can use fatty acids for energy, but almost all tissues can also use ketones. The central nervous system depends on ketones during glucopenia because fatty acids do not cross the blood-brain barrier (,). Ketogenesis requires glucopenia because glucose is a potent stimulator of insulin secretion, and insulin suppresses fatty acid release. Therefore, ketogenesis is abruptly stopped by administering insulin or glucose (,). Ketone catabolism releases more energy than pyruvate in glycogenolysis because ketones are more reduced. At best, 185.7 kcal/mol can be liberated from pyruvate, but 243.6 kcal/mol can be liberated from BHB—31% more calories (). This energy difference has been observed in vitro using rat heart models, and human studies have echoed this finding (). Serum levels of BHB reach 1–2 mmol/L after 2 days of fasting or 90 minutes of intense exercise (,) and increase to 6–8 mmol/L with prolonged starvation (). BHB may stay consistently above 2 mmol/L on a ketogenic diet (). Ketosis can be measured by blood BHB levels and in the urine as acetoacetate (,). Although ketosis at moderate levels (typically defined as up to 3 mmol/L), deemed “nutritional ketosis,” does not appear to be intrinsically harmful, clinicians often avoid ketosis because, at higher levels, it can signal dangerous states such as diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis, in which metabolic acidosis occurs (). However, research indicates that ketone bodies may serve as more than an alternative fuel source; there is emerging evidence supporting their signaling properties and physiologic impact, which may include reducing inflammation and improving insulin sensitivity (). A typical American diet consists of 2,200 kcal/day, with roughly 35% from fat, 15% from protein, and 50% (∼275 g) from carbohydrate (). Dietary approaches for weight loss commonly emphasize one of the following: decreased carbohydrate intake, decreased fat intake, or decreased calories/portions () (). This review focuses on the approaches that reduce carbohydrate intake, especially those that emphasize maintaining nutritional ketosis. Common Calorie and Macronutrient Content in Various Dietary Approaches There are a wide variety of LCDs, which typically consist of 60–130 g/day carbohydrate (26–45% of daily caloric intake) but do not seek to promote ketosis (). Popular LCDs include the South Beach Diet and the Zone Diet (,). Ketogenic diets were originally used in the early 20th century to combat epilepsy in children but have since been adapted for weight management. Typically, very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKDs) are characterized by reducing dietary carbohydrate intake to 20–50 g/day (<26% of a 2,000-kcal/day diet) (). This goal is based on reducing carbohydrate to produce ketosis (). Many of these eating plans include an induction phase, and most do not advocate calorie restriction, operating on the premise that higher percentages of protein and fat in the diet, and potentially circulating ketones, promote satiety (–). Examples of ketogenic eating plans include the Atkins (), Protein Power (), and Sugar Busters () diets. In research and clinical practice, ketosis can be measured as BHB in blood on fingerstick or acetoacetate in urine (). Ketone meters are available for home use to monitor ketones and have also been used to monitor adherence in studies (,). Variations of the Atkins diet are commonly used in research and practice, so it is described in more detail below. This VLCKD was first popularized by R.C. Atkins in the 1972 book and was later updated in (,). The eating plan begins with an induction phase that limits carbohydrates to 20 g/day for 2 weeks and allows meat, poultry, fish/shellfish, eggs, 1 cup of vegetables, and 1 cup of salad vegetables per day but avoids fruit, bread, grains, starchy vegetables, and dairy products other than cheese, cream, and butter. Induction is meant to rapidly deplete glycogen stores and thus induce fat oxidation (). Carbohydrates are added gradually while maintaining ketosis until the carbohydrate level that can maintain the goal weight is identified (). The diet emphasizes urine ketone examination to identify a level of carbohydrates that will maintain ketosis. Initially described in the 1960s, the Mediterranean diet has since been linked to lower mortality () and improved A1C and fasting blood glucose (FBG) in patients with diabetes (). Low-carbohydrate Mediterranean diet (LCMD) plans focus on consuming an abundance of plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, cereals, potatoes, beans, nuts, and seeds), moderate fish and poultry, fat principally from olive oil, low levels of saturated fat, and limited sweets and red meat (). They often incorporate breads, cereals, and potatoes but are still lower in carbohydrate than the typical American diet or LFDs. LCMDs emphasize the types of proteins and fat found in the Mediterranean diet while reducing carbohydrates by varying amounts to <50% of daily intake, resulting in weight loss, A1C and triglyceride reductions, and increased HDL cholesterol (,). In 1984, O’Dea () studied 10 Aboriginal people with type 2 diabetes who lived for a 7-week period as hunter-gathers. Fasting glucose, postprandial glucose clearance, insulin response to glucose, and triglyceride levels all improved (). Although no standard definition exists, Paleolithic-style diets encourage the consumption of foods that were prevalent before the agricultural revolution, including grass-fed meat, wild fish, fruits, vegetables, and nuts, and avoidance of processed foods, refined sugars, legumes, dairy products, grains, and cereals (). A Paleolithic diet is typically lower in carbohydrate than the typical American diet or LFDs. A systematic review () evaluated the effects of LCDs (<45% of total energy) on glycemic control in eight studies of adults and children with type 1 diabetes. The heterogeneity and small size of the studies precluded overall conclusions, but statistically significant improvements in A1C were seen in three of the eight studies. Studies by O’Neill et al. () and Nielson et al. () found the largest absolute average decrease in A1C, each with reductions of 1.3%, representing roughly a 17–19% reduction from baseline. The remaining five studies showed stable glucose levels. Two studies lacked standardized insulin protocols, which is a potential confounder. Insulin dose reduction in patients with type 1 diabetes lowers the risk for complications of hyperinsulinemia, including hypoglycemia, weight gain, and metabolic syndrome (,). In the systematic review (), LCDs reduced total daily insulin dose in all five studies that reported medication use, although in only two studies did the reduction reach statistical significance. Ireland et al. () found the daily insulin dose decreased by an average of 5.1 units/day with an average intake of 87 g/day carbohydrate over a 2-week study period. Krebs et al. () found an average reduction in total insulin dose of 22.2 units/day over a 12-week study period using an eating plan averaging 100 g/day carbohydrate. Dietary fat and protein also cause postprandial hyperglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes (). High-fat, high-protein meals require more than double the amount of insulin than lower-fat, lower-protein meals with the same carbohydrate content (). The ADA recommends that patients with type 1 diabetes who have mastered carbohydrate counting learn to incorporate estimates of dietary fat and protein into their insulin dosing (). Boden et al. () studied 10 obese patients with type 2 diabetes who consumed an Atkins-modeled diet for 2 weeks in a strictly supervised setting. Mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels decreased from 7.5 mmol/L (135 mg/dL) on the first day to 6.3 mmol/L (113 mg/dL) on the final day. Mean 24-hour serum insulin levels were significantly lower at the end of the VLCKD. Insulin sensitivity improved by 75% when measured via euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp; mean A1C improved from 7.3 to 6.8% in 14 days. This study used gold-standard methods to highlight the immediate metabolic impact of a ketogenic eating pattern in people with type 2 diabetes. In a single-arm pilot study by Yancy et al. (), patients with type 2 diabetes who consumed <20 g/day carbohydrate for 16 weeks reduced mean fasting glucose by 17% and A1C from 7.5 to 6.3%. In a study by Westman et al. (), adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes were randomized to a <20 g VLCKD or a reduced-calorie, low-glycemic-index diet (LGID) with a 500 kcal/day deficit over 24 weeks. Although both groups experienced improved glycemic control, a greater improvement was seen in the VLCKD group, with a mean change in A1C of −1.5% versus −0.5% in the low-calorie LGID group. In a 3-month study by Saslow et al. () comparing a VLCKD to a low-fat moderate-carbohydrate (150 g) calorie-restricted diet (MCCR), A1C remained stable in the MCCR group but declined significantly by 0.4% in the VLCKD group. Several recent studies have followed patients on a VLCKD over 1 year. Davis et al. () randomized a group of overweight adults with type 2 diabetes to a VLCKD (2-week restriction to 20–25 g carbohydrate and then reintroduction of 5 g carbohydrate and per week while maintaining ketosis) and an LFD modeled after the Diabetes Prevention Program (fat intake 25% of daily energy) (). Dietary intake was measured by 24-hour recall at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months, and participants were encouraged to keep food logs. The LFD and VLCKD groups had similar reductions in A1C in the first 3 months. Neither group maintained these improvements at 1 year, but dietary changes were also not maintained according to self-reported dietary intake. Mayer et al. () compared overweight and obese adults with type 2 diabetes on a VLCKD (initially <20 g/day carbohydrate without calorie restriction) versus peers on an LFD with orlistat (fat <30% of energy, saturated fat <10% of energy, and an energy deficit of 500–1,000 kcal). Patients following the VLCKD had an improvement in A1C of 0.7% compared with an increase of 0.2% in patients on the LFD. Saslow et al. () randomized overweight patients with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes to a VLCKD (20–50 g carbohydrate with a goal BHB of 0.5–3 mmol/L) or an MCCR (45–50% of calories from carbohydrate) over 1 year. Participants attended 19 classes over the 12-month study period and were taught behavioral strategies and mindful eating. Adherence was assessed with 24-hour dietary recall obtained at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. The VLCKD group had a greater reduction in A1C than the MCCR group (decreased from 6.6 to 6.1% vs. from 6.9 to 6.7%, = 0.007), despite greater reductions in diabetes medications. Hallberg et al. () conducted a study of overweight and obese adults with type 2 diabetes who self-selected to follow a VLCKD and were closely followed by a telemedicine platform used to upload weight, blood glucose, and BHB levels with daily feedback from the care team. These participants were compared with patients receiving usual care. Blood BHB was monitored daily using a home meter. The carbohydrate goal was individualized to maintain nutritional ketosis (goal BHB 0.5–3.0 mmol/L) but typically was <30 g/day. BHB measurement confirmed continued nutritional ketosis with a threefold elevation above baseline at 70 days and a twofold elevation at 1 year. There was a decrease in A1C of 17%, from 7.6 to 6.3%, with an improvement in fasting glucose of 22% from baseline. Adherence was a strength of this study; 83% of participants remained in the intensive intervention arm at 1 year, but it was not a randomized study. DIRECT (Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial) () randomized participants to a VLCKD (2-month induction of <20 g/day carbohydrate with potential to increase to 120 g without limitation in calories or other macronutrients), the Mediterranean diet (1,500 kcal/day for women and, 1,800 for men with <35% from fat), and an LFD (1,500 kcal/day for women and 1,800 for men, with 30% of calories from fat and 10% from saturated fat) in obese patients and evaluated glycemic control in a subgroup of participants with diabetes. Participants met with a dietitian 18 times during the 2-year study period, and adherence was assessed with a food questionnaire at 6, 12, and 24 months with two repeated 24-hour dietary recalls in a subgroup of participants. FPG decreased at 12 months by 18.1 mg/dL in the VLCKD group and by 23.4 mg/dL in the Mediterranean diet group but increased by 3 mg/dL in the LFD group. At 24 months, the LFD group had an increase in FPG of 12.1 mg/dL from baseline compared with an increase of 1.2 mg/dL in the VLCKD group and a decrease of 32.8 mg/dL in the Mediterranean diet group. A1C had decreased at 24 months by 0.4 ± 1.3% in the LFD group, 0.5 ± 1.1% in the Mediterranean diet group, and 0.9 ± 0.8% in the VLCKD group. The changes were significant ( <0.05) only in the VLCKD group. Tay et al. () compared A1C effects in obese individuals on a VLCKD that was high in unsaturated fat and low in saturated fat (14% carbohydrates [<50 g daily increased to 70 g after 2 months], 28% protein, 58% total fat) or an isocaloric, high-carbohydrate LFD (53% carbohydrate, 17% protein, <30% total fat) consistent with the current dietary guidelines. Adherence to the VLCKD was assessed with plasma BHB, which increased to three times that of the LFD group and then decreased toward baseline over the study period. Over 2 years, the study noted similar improvements in body weight, FBG, and A1C. The VLCKD group experienced reduced glycemic variability and had more favorable lipoprotein profile changes. However, the study was limited by a 53% attrition rate in both groups. Athinarayanan et al. () published a 2-year follow-up to the study by Hallberg et al. () in which participants’ biomarkers were monitored via telemedicine and carbohydrate intake was adjusted to maintain nutritional ketosis consistent with patients’ personal health goals. At 2 years, A1C improved by an average of 0.9% from baseline in the VLCKD arm; fasting glucose declined by 29.1 mg/dL for the VLCKD arm and increased by a mean of 21.7 mg/dL in the usual care arm. At 2 years, 74% of participants in the intervention arm and 78% of those in the control arm remained enrolled in the study, and BHB remained 50% higher than baseline in participants pursuing ketosis. McKenzie et al. () studied patients on individualized diets designed to maintain nutritional ketosis, with most patients eating <30 g/day carbohydrate. Over the 10-week study period, 51% of patients were able to decrease their insulin dose, with 36% discontinuing insulin entirely. A striking 90% of patients discontinued sulfonylureas, 86% discontinued a sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, 57% discontinued a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, and 75% decreased doses of a thiazolidinedione. Another 38% discontinued a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, with 44% using a decreased dose and 26% using an increased dose at the end of the study period. This study highlights the necessity of frequent medication adjustments in the early stages of a VLCKD. Intermediate-Term Medication Reduction (3–6 Months) The majority of the 21 participants in the 16-week study by Yancy et al. () had diabetes medications either discontinued ( = 7) or reduced ( = 10) on a VLCKD. In the study by Westman et al. () of obese adults with type 2 diabetes randomized to a VLCKD and an LGID over 24 weeks, 95.2% of the VLCKD participants had an elimination or reduction in diabetes medication, compared with 62.1% of the LGID participants. Four individuals in the VLCKD group and one in the LGID group who were taking at least 20 units of insulin at baseline no longer required insulin at the study’s conclusion. Two of the 13 patients in the MCCR arm of the 3-month study by Saslow et al. () were able to reduce, but not stop, diabetes medications, whereas two of 11 patients in the VLCKD arm were able to stop diabetes medications entirely. Several long-term studies have noted significant reductions in diabetes medications with a VLCKD. Although changes in A1C were not significantly different, Davis et al. () found that insulin doses decreased by a mean of 10 units in the VLCKD arm but increased by a mean of 4 units in the LFD arm. Mayer et al. () found that the LCD led to a greater reduction in antihyperglycemic medications using a medication effect score based on medication potency and total daily dose; 70.6% of those in the LCD group compared with 30.4% of those in the LFD group decreased their medication effect score by ≥50%. In the study by Tay et al. (), more than twice the number of VLCKD participants had a reduction of ≥20% in medication effect score compared with LFD participants. Finally, Hallberg et al. () found that 40% of patients with type 2 diabetes who started a 1-year VLCKD study period on insulin were able to eliminate this medication. The remaining insulin users decreased their daily insulin dose from a mean of 105.2 to 53.8 units. Diabetes remission is difficult to define because glycemic control exists along a continuum (). Yancy et al. (), Hallberg et al. (), and Athinarayanan et al. () defined remission as an A1C <6.5% while off medication or on metformin alone. In the 48-week study by Yancy et al. () comparing group medical visits emphasizing weight loss using a VLCKD (20–30 g/day carbohydrate without caloric restriction) compared with standard group visits emphasizing medication intensification, 11.5% of participants in the weight management group achieved remission compared with no patients in the standard visit group. In the 2-year study by Athinarayanan et al. (), 53% of participants on the VLCKD achieved sustained A1C <6.5% off of all medications except metformin compared with no patients in the control arm. Furthermore, 6.7% of participants on the VLCKD had complete diabetes remission, defined as normoglycemia of at least 1 year’s duration without medication and an A1C <5.7% on two separate occasions, compared with no patients in the usual care group. A 4-year study by Esposito et al. () showed that an LCD can help with diabetes remission in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes who have never been exposed to diabetes medications. Remission was defined as patients transitioning from meeting diabetes criteria to either meeting prediabetes criteria (“partial remission”) or normalization (“complete remission”), as defined by FBG and A1C levels. In comparing an LCMD (<50% carbohydrate) to an LFD, the LCMD participants were significantly more likely to have partial or complete remission than those in the LFD group. There are no studies of long of enough duration to examine the effect of LCDs on prolonged diabetes remission >5 years as defined by a 2009 ADA consensus statement (). The impact of LCDs on weight has been studied in the short term, but studies longer than 2 years are limited. Yancy et al. () found an average weight loss of 6.6% from original body weight for patients adhering to a VLCKD for 16 weeks; interestingly, weight change did not predict change in A1C. In a study by Hussain et al. (), in which patients were given the opportunity to choose between a low-calorie eating plan or a VLCKD, those with diabetes lost significantly more weight over the 24-week period on the VLCKD than on the low-calorie diet (−12 vs. −7% of original body weight). Hallberg et al. () also found a 12% mean weight loss on the VLCKD over the 1-year period of their study. Some studies have shown significant weight loss favoring the VLCKD over other eating plans (,,), but others have not shown a difference (,). None of the comparison diets have demonstrated greater weight loss. Tay et al. () found that both a VLCKD and an LFD combined with exercise led to weight loss, although there was no significant difference in weight loss between the two eating plans. In a meta-analysis (), LCDs (<130 g/day carbohydrate) for patients with type 2 diabetes significantly reduced body weight compared with baseline, but results were mixed as to whether greater weight loss was achieved compared with other eating plans. To our knowledge, there have been no human studies looking at the impact of VLCKDs on microvascular complications of diabetes. A study of mouse models with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes () showed that albuminuria was reversed by maintaining the ketogenic diet for 2 months. Histologic evidence of nephropathy was only partially reversed. Another study () transitioned mice who had developed evidence of impaired glucose tolerance from a high-fat diet to a ketogenic diet. The mice fed a high-fat diet developed increased sensitivity to painful stimuli, which improved after transition to a ketogenic diet. The mice on a ketogenic diet also had increased neurite outgrowth. This study indicates that a ketogenic diet may help reverse small-fiber neuropathy and distal symmetric sensorimotor poly-neuropathy in diabetes and prediabetes. The presence of microvascular complications such as nephropathy is often an exclusion criterion in human studies of LCDs. Several studies of VLCKDs did not report worsening of serum creatinine (,,,), and a case report noted reversal of nephropathy and stabilization of retinopathy in a patient who lost 19 kg and experienced a 2% decrease in A1C on a VLCKD (). We were unable to find any evidence that LCDs and VLCKDs worsen microvascular complications of diabetes. LCDs and VLCKDs can have significant effects on serum lipids, even in the short term. In a monitored study of an Atkins-type diet (), serum triglyceride levels decreased by 35%, and LDL cholesterol decreased by 10% at the end of the 2-week VLCKD period compared with baseline. A meta-analysis of nine studies () including 734 patients with type 2 diabetes on diets containing <130 g/day carbohydrate for study periods ranging from 3 months to 2 years found a significant reduction in serum triglyceride levels and an increase in serum HDL cholesterol, but no significant change in total or LDL cholesterol. In a 1-year study of a VLCKD (), the average 10-year risk for atherosclerotic CVD decreased by 11.9%. The effects of LCDs and VLCKDs on LDL cholesterol levels may be variable, with some patients developing increased LDL cholesterol (). Therefore, serum lipids should be monitored in patients using an LCD, and management of lipid levels should be individualized. In the study by Westman et al. () comparing a VLCKD and an LGID, both groups had a significant decrease in blood pressure from baseline, but there was no difference between groups. Davis et al. () and Guldbrand et al. () found similar results with insignificant blood pressure variations between randomized LFD and LCD groups over 1 year. It appears that a VLCKD lowers blood pressure in people with diabetes, but not more than other weight loss strategies. There are limited randomized controlled trials of LCDs and VLCKDs lasting longer than 2 years. These two eating plans can be high in red meat and low in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which has prompted concern about cardiovascular effects. Several observational studies have evaluated the impact of low dietary carbohydrate intake on mortality. Two cohort studies (,) reported that lower dietary carbohydrate and higher protein intake were associated with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Each study evaluated a few hundred deaths and did not evaluate the sources of dietary protein and fat. Fung et al. () analyzed two large cohorts and found a modest increased risk for all-cause mortality in individuals who consumed animal-based diets with low carbohydrate content but not vegetable-based diets. This finding is consistent with the results reported in an analysis of the Iowa Women’s Health Study (). It is unclear whether people who reported lower carbohydrate intake in these studies were specifically following LCDs. Furthermore, these observational studies were dependent on self-reported information, so interpretation of results is limited by potential confounding and self-report bias. A study comparing a VLCKD and an LFD in patients with obesity (rather than diabetes) () found that adverse effects occurred more commonly in the VLCKD group. These side effects included constipation (68%), headache (60%), halitosis (38%), muscle cramps (35%), diarrhea (23%), weakness (25%), and rash (13%). Other studies in patients with diabetes have not reported adverse effects (,). Clinical experience suggests that adequate fluid and sodium intake can be preventive with regard to side effects (). Sparse literature is available in adults with diabetes, but nephrolithiasis has been reported at rates of 3–10% in children being treated with a VLCKD for refractory seizures (–). This effect tends to occur 14–24 months after diet initiation. Studies of children who presented with nephrolithiasis have noted low serum bicarbonate and hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia, and hyperuricosuria (,). Fluid liberalization and urinary alkalinization helps prevent further stone formation and are viable treatment options (). Nephrolithiasis has not been mentioned frequently as a side effect of VLCKDs in adults, and we were unable to find case reports, although articles in the lay press mention a potential risk of this condition. The most commonly reported adverse effect in adults is hypoglycemia resulting from inadequate reduction of insulin or antihyperglycemic medications (,). However, Yancy et al. () found a 50% decrease in hypoglycemic events in patients on a VLCKD who underwent protocolized medication reduction compared with peer control subjects who received medication intensification to improve glycemic control. It therefore appears that hypoglycemia can be avoided with careful medical management. Given the risk of hypoglycemia from VLCKDs in patients with type 2 diabetes, some studies decreased doses of insulin by half and discontinued sulfonylureas at the initiation of the eating plan (,). There have been case reports of the development of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis in patients who use an SGLT2 inhibitor and follow a VLCKD, likely resulting from increased lipolysis and ketone formation (,). For this reason, the National Lipid Association recommends against concurrent use of a VLCKD and an SGLT2 inhibitor (). Most clinicians discontinue SGLT2 inhibitors at the initiation of a VLCKD; however, some patients may tolerate concomitant VLCKD and SGLT2 inhibitor without incident. Patients with diabetes who are taking medications known to increase the risk of hypoglycemia or SGLT2 inhibitors who are undertaking a VLCKD should have close medical supervision with an emphasis on frequent blood glucose monitoring and proactive (and ongoing) adjustment of diabetes medications. Strategies for Increasing and Monitoring Dietary Adherence The studies that show long-term clinically significant weight loss, medication reductions, and improvement in glycemic control are those that also closely monitored adherence to the eating plan (,,). A study of adults using long-term nutritional ketosis for seizure reduction in epilepsy found that blood BHB levels correlate better than urine ketones with a reduction in seizure frequency (). There is concern among some experts that LCDs are potentially deficient in vitamins E, A, thiamin, B6, folate, calcium, magnesium, iron, potassium, and dietary fiber based on the foods allowed, but studies documenting such deficiencies are lacking (). Many protocols address this concern by encouraging attention to well-balanced micronutrients and a daily multivitamin supplement. Cardiac complications have not been well described in the literature. A pediatric case series found prolonged QTc developed after diet initiation in 3 of 20 patients. This finding correlated with low serum bicarbonate and high BHB. Three patients had cardiac chamber enlargement; one patient with severe dilated cardiomyopathy and prolonged QTc had reversal of these conditions with diet discontinuation (). A prospective cohort study with a 20-year follow-up showed an increased risk of incident atrial fibrillation with lower self-reported carbohydrate intake (). We have not found evidence of arrhythmia in the randomized trials of LCDs and VLCKDs. A global trend has emerged toward using low-carbohydrate dietary interventions to treat diabetes and obesity, especially given the documented benefits with regard to weight, insulin, and medication reduction. Patients with type 2 diabetes often present with long-term complications, including nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, established CVD, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Many of the studies of LCDs, however, excluded patients with these common comorbid conditions, so caution should still be used when using these eating plans in the setting of these complications. Furthermore, the safety and efficacy of these eating plans has not been studied in pregnant patients or patients with a history of disordered eating, so the safety of such diets in these populations is uncertain. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate the effects of LCDs in these circumstances. Finally, challenges with sustained adherence are important considerations for any long-term dietary interventions in diabetes and obesity. LCDs and VLCKDs can be attractive options for treating patients with diabetes and obesity. These eating plans are associated with at least as much weight loss as other diet strategies, but have the added benefit of being associated with significant reductions in the need for insulin and other diabetes medications. Patients attempting a low-carbohydrate dietary strategy should be closely followed so their medication regimen can be appropriately decreased as needed. This dietary strategy appears to be safe and effective in most patients; however, more studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of LCDs and VLCKDs on microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes.

4a93b018-735e-4a36-9c9e-403ca6a58115,"— A key part of following a ketogenic, or keto, diet is reducing your sugar intake. This is necessary for your body to enter ketosis, a state in which your body burns fat rather than sugar for energy (). However, that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy sweet-tasting foods. Sugar alcohols are sweeteners that have tastes and textures similar to those of sugar, but fewer calories and a less significant effect on blood sugar levels (). As a result, they can be a satisfying option for individuals looking to reduce their sugar intake, such as those following a keto diet. This article explains whether sugar alcohols are keto-friendly, as well as which ones may be better options for you. Sugar alcohols occur naturally in some fruits and vegetables. However, most are commercially manufactured in a lab (). While there are many types of sugar alcohols, common ones you may see on food labels include (, , ): Often made by fermenting the glucose found in cornstarch, has 70% of the sweetness of sugar but 5% of the calories. Isomalt is a mixture of two sugar alcohols — mannitol and sorbitol. Providing 50% fewer calories than sugar, it’s most commonly used to make sugar-free hard candies and 50% as sweet. Maltitol is processed from the sugar maltose. It’s 90% as sweet as sugar with almost half the calories. Commercially produced from glucose, sorbitol is 60% as sweet as sugar with about 60% of the calories. One of the most common sugar alcohols, is as sweet as regular sugar but has 40% fewer calories. Due to their low calorie contents, sugar alcohols are frequently used to sweeten sugar-free or diet products like gum, yogurts, ice cream, coffee creamers, salad dressings, and protein bars and shakes (). Sugar alcohols are often commercially manufactured as a low calorie way to sweeten food products. Common ones you may see on ingredient lists include erythritol, isomalt, maltitol, sorbitol, and xylitol. When you eat sugar, your body breaks it down into smaller molecules. These molecules are then absorbed into your bloodstream, which causes your blood sugar levels to rise (). In contrast, your body cannot fully break down and absorb carbs from sugar alcohols. As a result, they cause a much smaller rise in blood sugar levels (). One way to compare the effects of these sweeteners is their (GI), which is a measure of how quickly foods can raise your blood sugar (). Here are the GI values of common sugar alcohols (): Overall, most sugar alcohols have negligible effects on your blood sugar levels. To compare, white table sugar (sucrose) has a glycemic index of 65 (). Given that your body can’t fully break down sugar alcohols, they cause a much less significant rise in your blood sugar levels than sugar does. Sugar intake is limited on a keto diet, as eating it causes your blood sugar levels to rise. This is an issue, as raised blood sugar levels can make it difficult for your body to remain in , which is key for reaping the benefits of the keto diet (, ). Given that sugar alcohols have a much less significant effect on blood sugar levels, they’re commonly found in keto-friendly products. Furthermore, since they aren’t fully digestible, keto dieters often subtract the sugar alcohols and fiber from the total number of carbs in a food item. The resulting number is referred to as (). Still, due to the variation in GIs of different types of sugar alcohols, some are better for the keto diet than others. Erythritol is a good , as it has a glycemic index of 0 and works well in both cooking and baking. Plus, due to its small particle size, erythritol tends to be better tolerated than other sugar alcohols (, ). Still, xylitol, sorbitol, and isomalt are all suitable on a keto diet. You may simply want to scale back your intake if you notice any gastrointestinal side effects. One sugar alcohol that appears to be less keto-friendly is maltitol. Maltitol has a lower GI than sugar. However, with a GI of up to 52, it’s likely to have a more significant effect on your blood sugar levels than other sugar alcohols (, ). As such, if you’re on a keto diet, you may want to limit your intake of maltitol and choose a sugar alternative with a lower GI. Given that they negligibly affect blood sugar levels, most sugar alcohols are considered to be keto-friendly. Maltitol has a more pronounced effect on blood sugar and should be limited on a keto diet. When consumed in normal amounts through food, are considered safe for most individuals. However, they do have the potential to cause digestive issues, especially in larger amounts. Side effects like bloating, nausea, and diarrhea have been observed when intake of sugar alcohols exceeds 35–40 grams per day (, , ). Additionally, individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may experience negative side effects with any amount of sugar alcohols. As a result, if you have IBS, you may want to avoid sugar alcohol completely (, ). Consuming large amounts of sugar alcohols may cause digestive side effects, such as diarrhea and nausea. While most people can tolerate small amounts well, those with IBS may want to avoid sugar alcohols altogether. Sugar alcohols are low calorie sweeteners that generally have little to no effect on your blood sugar levels. As a result, they’re a popular keto-friendly option for sweetening foods and beverages. Just keep in mind that some may be better choices than others. For example, maltitol has a much greater effect on blood sugar levels than erythritol, which has a GI of 0. The next time you’re looking to add sweetener to your coffee or make homemade , try using a sugar alcohol like erythritol or xylitol. Just be sure to consume these sweeteners in moderation to avoid any potential digestive distress. — The Ketogenic Diet: A Detailed Beginner’s Guide to Keto The ketogenic diet (keto) is a low-carb, high-fat diet that causes weight loss and provides numerous health benefits.

2ad30080-d58c-4701-a079-ddd9473d0323,"— Often used to toast special occasions, champagne is a type of sparkling white wine. Generally, it’s sweet and associated with a high sugar content. Given that the keto diet calls for a very low carb intake — usually between 25–50 grams per day — you may wonder whether champagne fits into this sugar-restricting lifestyle (). This article determines whether you can continue to enjoy an occasional glass of champagne while following the keto diet. Champagne is a type of sparkling from the Champagne region of France. It’s made following a specific set of rules called the Appellation d’Origine Controlée (AOC) (). The AOC regulations are a designation of origin system, meaning that they link the wine to its geographical region of origin. They also monitor every aspect of the production process to maintain the region’s wine reputation. For example, they determine which varieties of grapes may be used — mainly Pinot noir, Pinot Meunier, and Chardonnay — which have to be grown in the same area. Also, the wine has to be bottled within the region. Therefore, sparkling wines produced in other areas or countries cannot be called champagne. To know if champagne is keto-friendly, you must first understand how it’s made (): The are pressed twice to extract the juice, which is rich in sugar. are added to the juice to prevent unwanted bacterial growth. Then, solid particles, such as the grape’s skin or seeds, are left to settle to the bottom for easier removal. At this stage, yeast ferments the grape’s natural sugars and turns them into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This is an optional step in which malic acid breaks down into lactic acid. It’s preferred when looking for butter notes in the wine. This step is vital, as it rids the wine of impurities and dead yeast cells, producing a clear base wine. The base wine is combined with other wines from different years or grape varieties. The wine is then left to chill at 25°F (-4°C) for at least 1 week to prevent the formation of crystals. This step transforms still champagne into a sparkling one by mixing it with more yeast and a sweet solution called dosage, which is made out of . The extra yeast and sugar allow for the secondary fermentation. Bottled champagne is left to mature at 54°F (12°C) for a minimum of 15 months and up to 2 years or longer. Great champagnes may even spend decades in maturation. After maturation, the bottles are moved to loosen the sediment of dead yeasts. Then, they’re disgorged, which removes the sediment, once again producing a clear wine. This stage determines the style or type of champagne. At this point, more dosage may be added to perfect the flavor — though this isn’t always done. Lastly, a cork covered with a metal cap and held with a wire cage seals the bottle. The champagne may again be left to age before being sold. As you can see, it’s a thorough process that calls for added sugars, which may take up a big chunk of your daily carb allotment. However, most of the grape’s natural sugars are fermented into alcohol during the primary fermentation, and the extra yeast does the same to the dosage added during the second fermentation, leaving little to no sugar residue (). Therefore, if the winemaker doesn’t add a lot more dosage during the dosage stage, you may still be able to fit a glass into your keto diet. Champagne is a type of sparkling wine produced in the Champagne region of France following a specific set of rules. Its processing calls for added sugars, some of which are fermented by yeast, while others may remain in the final product. Given champagne’s sweet taste and added sugars, you may think that it’s a high carb wine. However, a 5-ounce (150-mL) serving generally provides just 3 to 4 grams of carbs, with only 1.5 grams from sugar (). Still, its carb content varies greatly depending on the type. The dosage stage determines the kind of champagne that’s being produced, as well as its final carb content (). Here’s a list of the different types of champagne, along with their estimated carb content per 5-ounce (150-mL) serving (): As for Brut nature, Pas dosé, and Dosage zéro, these don’t contain any dosage, meaning that their sugar content ranges from 0 to 0.5 grams. The restricts your daily carb intake to a maximum of 50 grams per day, and sometimes even as low as 25 grams per day (). That said, you may drink a glass of champagne while staying within the limits, as long as you keep other carb sources under control throughout the day. However, keep in mind that these grams of carbs will add up with every glass you drink. Therefore, be sure to in moderation — up to one drink (5 ounces) for women and two drinks for men per day — and try to stick to those with the lowest sugar counts (). Lastly, watch out for added ingredients, such as fruit juices used to make champagne cocktails, which may greatly increase the carb content of your drink. For example, mimosas are made by mixing champagne with orange juice. Champagne is a low carb wine with a carb content ranging from 3 to 4 grams per 5-ounce (150-mL) serving. Therefore, it’s a keto-friendly drink, as long as you keep within your daily carb limit. Champagne is generally a low carb wine. Therefore, if it fits into your daily carb allotment and you watch your serving size, it may be considered keto-friendly. However, given that its carb content may vary depending on the type, stick to those with a lower carb content, such as Brut, Extra Brut, or Brut Nature. Still, remember that you should always drink alcohol in moderation to avoid its negative health effects. Plus, despite its lower carb content, drinking too much champagne may end up taking your body out of . — Keto Diet and Alcohol: The Best and Worst Drinks to Choose The keto diet may aid weight loss and improve health, but you may wonder how to fit alcohol into this way of eating.

83f839c8-80c0-453c-af01-ce2413846634,"— — Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States (). Researchers estimated that 606,520 Americans would die from cancer in 2020. That means more than 1,600 deaths a day, on average (). Cancer is most commonly treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Many different diet strategies have been studied, but none has been particularly effective. Interestingly, some early research suggests that a very low carb ketogenic diet may help (, , ). You should never, ever delay or avoid conventional medical treatment of cancer in favor of an alternative treatment such as the ketogenic diet. You should discuss all treatment options with your healthcare provider. is a very low carb, high fat diet that shares many similarities with , like the Atkins diet. It involves significantly reducing your intake of carbs and replacing them with fat and protein. This change leads to a metabolic state called . After several days, fat becomes your body’s primary energy source. This causes a substantial increase in the levels of compounds called ketones in your blood (). In general, a ketogenic diet provides 70% of calories as fat, with 20% of calories from protein and 10% of calories from carbs (). There are many versions of the ketogenic diet, though. Some versions are even higher in fat. The ketogenic diet is a very low carb, high fat diet. Fat intake may be 70% of total calorie intake, if not higher. Many cancer therapies are designed to target the biological differences between cancer cells and normal cells. Nearly all cancer cells share one common trait: They feed off carbs or blood sugar in order to grow and multiply (, , ). When you follow a ketogenic diet, some of the standard metabolic processes are altered, and your blood sugar levels go way down (, ). Basically, this is claimed to “starve” the cancer cells of fuel. As in all living cells, the long-term effect of this “starvation” may be that the cancer cells will grow more slowly, decrease in size, or possibly even die. It seems possible that a ketogenic diet could help reduce the progression of cancer because it causes (, , ). A ketogenic diet can lower blood sugar levels. This may help reduce tumor growth and even starve cancer cells of energy. Other benefits of a ketogenic diet to treat cancer Several other processes may explain how a ketogenic diet can aid cancer treatment. Firstly, reducing carbs can quickly lower calorie intake, reducing the energy available to the cells in your body. In turn, this may slow tumor growth and the cancer’s progression. In addition, ketogenic diets can provide other benefits. is an anabolic hormone. This means that insulin makes cells, including cancerous cells, grow when it’s present. Therefore, may slow tumor growth (, ). Cancer cells can’t use ketones as fuel. Research in animals shows that ketones may reduce tumor size and growth (). Beyond lowering blood sugar, the ketogenic diet may also help treat cancer via other mechanisms. These include lowering calories, reducing insulin levels, and increasing ketones. The effects of a ketogenic diet on cancer in animals Researchers have studied the ketogenic diet as an alternative cancer therapy for decades. Until recently, most of these studies were done in animals. A large number of these animal studies have shown a ketogenic diet can reduce tumor growth and improve survival rates (, , ). One study of mice with metastatic cancer tested a ketogenic diet with or without oxygen therapy. When compared with a standard diet, the ketogenic diet resulted in a significant decrease in tumor growth (). The ketogenic diet also increased mean survival time by 56.7% (the equivalent of around 17 days). This number increased to 77.9% (or around 24 days) when combined with oxygen therapy (). Another study found that using a very low carb diet to restrict levels prevented the growth of in mice with lung cancer or esophageal cancer. Study subjects received only 0.1% of their calories from carbs (). The diet was even more effective at preventing tumor growth when it was combined with the diabetes drug canagliflozin. The ketogenic diet alone didn’t help to shrink existing tumors, and neither did the chemotherapy drug cisplatin. However, combining these two methods was effective at helping to shrink tumors (). Some members of the same research team had previously determined that squamous cell cancers were more reliant on glucose for their energy needs than other cancers, such as (). In some cases, following the ketogenic diet made the anticancer drugs phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors (PI3K inhibitors) work more effectively. This effect was partly attributed to the fact that the ketogenic diet reduces insulin levels (). In animals, the ketogenic diet seems to be a promising alternative treatment for cancer. Despite the promising evidence in animals, research in humans is only just emerging and largely limited to case studies. Currently, the limited research seems to show that a ketogenic diet may reduce tumor size and the progression rate of certain cancers (). Much of the research on cancer looks at , which are particularly aggressive . A 2010 case study marked the first time that research was published on the effects of treating a glioblastoma with a combination of standard therapy and a restricted ketogenic diet. The case study followed a 65-year-old woman. Following surgery, she received a very low calorie ketogenic diet. During this time, the tumor’s progression slowed. However, 10 weeks after returning to a normal diet, she experienced a significant increase in tumor growth (). Results from later research are also promising. Almost all of the later research has concluded that a ketogenic diet leads to reduced glucose levels. In addition, the studies showed that a ketogenic diet is safe and may help to enhance the effects of traditional cancer treatments (, , ). In another study, 3 out of 5 people with a glioma experienced complete remission after adopting a ketogenic diet combined with radiation or chemotherapy. The other two participants, though, experienced a progression in the disease after they stopped the ketogenic diet (). Similar case reports from 1995 examined the reactions to a ketogenic diet in two girls who were undergoing treatment for advanced brain cancer. Researchers found that glucose uptake was decreased in the tumors of both girls. One of the girls reported improved quality of life and remained on the diet for 12 months. During that time, her disease showed no further progression (). Following a ketogenic diet for 12 weeks significantly increased the physical function of women with or cancer. Some participants in the study followed the high fiber, low fat American Cancer Society (ACS) diet instead. The women who followed the ketogenic diet were more likely to report that they could readily complete activities such as climbing stairs or moving a table (, ). They also experienced other benefits, such as increased energy and decreased cravings for starchy foods and “fast food fats” like pizza (). The ketogenic diet may also help improve the body composition of people with various types of cancer. In a study of 81 people, researchers observed benefits such as reduced fat mass in people with rectal or breast cancer and the preservation of skeletal muscle mass. Study participants experienced these benefits even though they were also undergoing radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of both. These standard cancer treatments have been known to negatively affect body composition and appetite (). One quality-of-life study investigated the effects of a ketogenic diet in 16 people with advanced cancer. Several people dropped out of the study because they didn’t enjoy the diet or due to personal reasons. Two people died early. Out of the 16 participants, 5 remained on the ketogenic diet for the entire 3-month study period. They reported improved emotional well-being and reduced insomnia, without any negative side effects caused by the diet. Some parameters, such as fatigue and pain, remained the same or worsened over time. Because the study participants all had advanced disease, this outcome was expected (). Although the ketogenic diet showed benefits for quality of life, the relatively low compliance rate indicates that it may be hard to get people to stick with the diet. A few small studies and case reports in humans suggest that a ketogenic diet may help slow the progression of cancer. However, a lot more research is needed. Some mechanisms suggest that a ketogenic diet may help prevent the development of cancer in the first place. Primarily, it may reduce several of the main risk factors for cancer. is a hormone that’s important for cell development. It also reduces programmed cell death. This hormone plays a role in the development and progression of cancer (). The ketogenic diet reduces IGF-1 levels, thereby decreasing the direct effects insulin has on cell growth (). This may reduce tumor growth and cancer risk over the long term (). Can help blood sugar levels and management of diabetes Other evidence suggests that people with elevated blood sugar levels and diabetes have an increased risk of developing cancer (, ). Research shows that a ketogenic diet at lowering blood sugar levels and managing diabetes, at least in the short term (, ). Some people may find it challenging to adhere to the diet over a long period of time, though. More studies on the long-term safety of the diet are also needed. Since a ketogenic diet is a , it may also help reduce the risk of cancer by fighting obesity (). The ketogenic diet reduces IGF-1 levels, blood sugar levels, and the risk of diabetes and obesity. These factors may lead to a reduced risk of developing cancer in the first place. It’s important to note that no major cancer group recommends the ketogenic diet for either cancer prevention or cancer treatment, despite the promising research. The ketogenic diet has its benefits, but it comes with risks, too. For instance, the diet is very high in fat. In addition, many foods allowed on the diet, such as , have been shown to increase the risk of some cancers (). The diet is very limiting in terms of , such as whole grains, fruits, and some vegetables. It can also be challenging for those undergoing traditional cancer therapies to consume enough calories while on the diet. Low carb diets, such as ketogenic diets, often result in weight loss (, ). Compliance is poor, which makes the diet challenging for people with cancer. The restrictive nature of the diet can sometimes be too much for a person with cancer, especially when food can be a source of comfort (, ). The diet isn’t appropriate for everyone and could even cause harm. If you’d like to explore the ketogenic diet, speak with a medical professional first. They can help you decide whether the diet’s right for you in the first place and work with you along the way. A ketogenic diet provides . According to animal studies and some preliminary research in humans, it may also help treat or prevent cancer. However, it’s important to keep in mind that the current research is still emerging. You should never, ever avoid conventional cancer treatment in favor of an alternative treatment like the ketogenic diet. Your best bet is still to follow the advice of your oncologist. Mainstream medical treatments are very effective at treating many common types of cancer. That said, perhaps a ketogenic diet could be a good choice as an adjuvant therapy, meaning that it’s used in addition to the conventional treatments. — — 15 Health Conditions That May Benefit From a Ketogenic Diet A ketogenic diet is good for much more than just losing weight.

a32463ee-7221-454c-9244-4123e64eccd8,"Lazy keto is a popular variation of the very-low-carb ketogenic, or keto, diet. It’s often used for weight loss, and, as the name suggests, it’s designed to be easy to follow. The classic ketogenic diet involves carefully calculating your intake of calories, carbs, fat, and protein to achieve ketosis, a metabolic state in which your body burns mostly fat (). However, lazy keto is far less strict, as you only have to pay attention to your carb intake. This article explains lazy keto, including its benefits, downsides, and foods to eat and avoid. Lazy keto is a less restrictive version of the traditional high-fat, very-low-carb ketogenic diet. The originated in the 1920s as a medical approach to treating epilepsy. Recently, variations of this diet, including lazy keto, have become mainstream strategies for weight loss (, ). Traditional keto diets require you to closely track your macronutrient intake and follow a strict, very-low-carb, high-fat eating pattern that includes only moderate amounts of protein (, ). The intention is to induce , a metabolic state in which your body burns fat as its primary source of fuel (). Like most variations of the ketogenic diet, lazy keto dramatically restricts your carb intake. Typically, carbs are restricted to around 5–10% of your total daily calories — or around 20–50 grams per day for most people (). However, you don’t have to worry about tracking calories, protein, or fat on lazy keto. Lazy keto is a simple variation of the ketogenic diet. It restricts carbs, but there are no rules regarding your intake of calories, fat, or protein. Studies on various versions of the ketogenic diet suggest that they may offer many potential benefits, though lazy keto has not been studied specifically. For example, several studies suggest that keto diets may , potentially even more so than low-fat diets (, , ). However, this effect is probably not unique to keto diets. Studies show that any diet that reduces calorie intake and is followed long term will likely lead to weight loss over time (, , ). Even though lazy keto doesn’t have any rules about calorie restriction, studies suggest keto diets may suppress appetite and food cravings. This may make it easier to reduce your calorie intake without feeling hungry (, ). Additionally, research suggests that keto diets may help improve blood sugar control in those with type 2 diabetes and reduce risk factors for heart disease (, , ). However, findings are mixed, and the lazy keto diet has not been studied specifically. Keep in mind that the are often attributed to being in ketosis. Studies ensure that this metabolic state is achieved by monitoring participants’ diets very closely, as well as by measuring their levels of ketones, which are compounds produced by your body when ketosis is reached and maintained (). Since tracking your calories, protein, and fat intake and measuring ketones isn’t required on lazy keto, dieters can’t know whether they’re truly in ketosis. Though research on lazy keto is limited, it may offer the same potential benefits as the traditional keto diet, including weight loss, decreased hunger, improved blood sugar control, and possibly a reduced risk of heart disease. Like the traditional keto diet, lazy keto may lead dieters to experience the when they are first transitioning to a keto diet. This includes symptoms of nausea, headache, fatigue, constipation, and dizziness (). Lazy keto also has several other pitfalls worth noting. Lazy keto is appealing to many because it’s less restrictive and easier to follow than the traditional ketogenic diet. The goal of lazy keto is to induce a metabolic state called ketosis, in which your body mainly burns fat for fuel. Researchers attribute many of the potential health benefits of ketogenic diets to this metabolic state (). However, while on this simplified version of the keto diet, you may not enter a state of ketosis, which has several . , not only do you have to severely restrict your carb and fat intake but also monitor your protein intake. That’s because your body can convert protein into glucose — a carbohydrate — in a process called gluconeogenesis (, ). Eating too much protein on lazy keto could prevent ketosis altogether. Solely focusing on your carb intake, as you would on lazy keto, ignores the importance of and diet quality. A well-balanced diet that includes a wide variety of foods can supply your body with all the nutrients it needs for overall health (). Unfortunately, like the traditional keto diet, lazy keto limits many nutrient-rich food groups like fruits, starchy vegetables, grains, and legumes. This may make it difficult to obtain essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Also, it can be difficult to meet all of your nutrient requirements when you reduce your calorie intake, which is likely if you’re using lazy keto to induce weight loss (). Therefore, it’s very important to focus on consuming — not just decreasing your carb intake. No studies have been conducted on lazy keto specifically. Long-term studies on similar diets, such as the classic ketogenic diet and modified Atkins diet, are also limited (). There are concerns that lazy keto — and high-fat diets in general — may harm heart health over time, despite the weight loss they may induce (, ). One review of 19 studies compared low-carb, high-fat diets with balanced weight loss diets. It found they had similar weight loss benefits and were equally effective at decreasing risk factors for heart disease after 1–2 years (). Another analysis found that low-carb, high-fat diets resulted in greater weight loss than low-fat diets in the long-term (). However, the researchers also found that high-fat diets were associated with higher cholesterol levels, which may increase your risk of heart disease (). That said, the you eat on a high-fat diet may make a big difference. Research shows that choosing sources of healthy, unsaturated fats, such as fatty fish, nuts, and olive oil, while following a keto diet may help prevent increases in risk factors for heart disease (, , ). In addition, the long-term effects of following ketogenic diets are unknown due to a lack of long-term studies. It’s unclear if keto diets are safe or beneficial to follow over years or decades. Lazy keto ignores the importance of your overall diet quality and may not induce the metabolic state of ketosis. The long-term effects of keto diets are poorly studied, and more research is needed. On lazy keto, are encouraged without consideration for their protein and fat contents. Below are some examples of foods to eat on lazy keto: beef, pork, chicken, turkey, and salmon, trout, tuna, shrimp, lobster, and crab fried, scrambled, hard-boiled, and most other types of peanuts, tree nuts, sunflower seeds, and nut and seed butters butter, cream, and most cheeses leafy greens, broccoli, tomatoes, onions, and extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, flaxseed oil, and others berries, such as strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries, in small portions Choose low-carb foods, such as meat, fish, poultry, eggs, nuts, seeds, oils, high-fat dairy products, and low-carb vegetables. Below are some foods that are limited or completely avoided on lazy keto: potatoes, sweet potatoes, peas, and corn bananas, apples, oranges, and most other fruits all types of beans, lentils, soybeans, and chickpeas milk and yogurt, especially flavored yogurts cookies, cakes, ice cream, candy, and most other desserts fruit juices, sports drinks, and sodas Avoid high-carb foods, such as grains, starchy vegetables, fruits, legumes, certain dairy products, and sugary foods and beverages. Lazy keto may be an option for those looking for a quick, short-term . However, the long-term effects of keto diets — especially lazy keto — are currently unclear due to lack of research (). Given that the diet restricts many healthy foods, it may be difficult to obtain all the nutrients you need, which could lead to and poor health over time. Though studies suggest keto diets may aid blood sugar control, those with type 2 diabetes should approach lazy keto with caution. Reducing your carb intake can lead to dangerously low blood sugar levels if your medications aren’t adjusted (). Overall, make sure to consult a healthcare provider, such as a registered dietitian, before you try lazy keto. They can help you implement the diet safely and effectively and ensure that you are meeting all your nutrient needs. Lazy keto may help you lose weight in the short term, but it’s less suited for long-term health. Professional guidance is recommended. Lazy keto is an appealing option for those who find the traditional keto diet too restrictive. While it limits carbs, there are no rules regarding your intake of calories, protein, or fat. Overall, lazy keto may offer the same potential benefits as the traditional keto diet, at least in the short term. These include decreased appetite, quick weight loss, and better blood sugar control in those with type 2 diabetes. That said, there are potential downsides to ignoring your intake of calories, fat, and protein. For one, you may not achieve the metabolic state of ketosis, to which many of the traditional keto diet’s benefits are attributed. Also, lazy keto has not been well studied and ignores the importance of overall diet quality.

If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. In the world of weight loss diets, there are two contenders that people mention over and over again for their effectiveness: the ketogenic diet and WW (formerly known as Weight Watchers). While the two approaches couldn’t be more different, both have amassed followings because of their results. Many people have reported weight loss success on both the points-based WW program and the low carb, high fat ketogenic, or keto, diet. This article reviews how each program works, the benefits and downsides of both, and which is better for weight loss. approximately $12–$34 per month, plus cost of groceries all paid levels of the program offer some degree of support allows all foods; subscription cost may affect long-term sustainabilitystrictly limits sugar and other carbs, including many everyday foods considered healthy, thus may be difficult to adhere to over the long term; no subscription cost some studies have found WW programs led to weight loss, but WW funded some of this researchsome studies have found keto diets led to more weight loss than low calorie diets It is important to note that the grocery budget for each diet can vary based on the individual and their food preferences. WW is a popular commercial diet program that has been around for decades. It’s built around the concept of moderation and portion size, and it allows followers to include any type of food they want in their diet. WW assigns you a daily SmartPoints allotment and places you in one of three color-coded programs based on your weight loss needs. Here’s a brief overview of the colors: more SmartPoints allowed per day, with 100+ ZeroPoint foods, mostly fruits and vegetables moderate number of SmartPoints allowed per day, with 200+ ZeroPoint foods, including fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins fewer SmartPoints allowed per day, with 300+ ZeroPoint foods, including fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains Typically, the foods that are lower in SmartPoints tend to be lower in calories, fat, and sugar and higher in and protein. High-point foods are typically high in calories, fat, or sugar — like french fries, ice cream, or fatty meats. So, while you can include high-point foods, they’ll quickly use up your daily SmartPoints allotment. WW is also a paid program. There are different tiers based on the level of support they provide. With purchase, you gain access to the WW tracking app and all of its included tools. weekly virtual or in-person workshops and Digital Only benefitsunlimited access to a personal WW coach and Digital Only benefits Yes, WW does appear to be effective for weight loss. Several studies have found that WW helps people lose weight. However, it’s important to note that WW funded many of these studies directly or indirectly, which may have influenced results (). In one WW-funded study of 279 people, researchers found that those using the WW program lost more than double the weight of a control group in 3 months. The WW participants were also more likely to have maintained their weight loss 1 year later (). Another large WW-funded study including over 29,000 people found that, on average, participants lost about 6 pounds (3 kg) in 12 weeks. Approximately two-thirds of participants were able to lose at least 5% of their body weight (). WW is a paid diet program based on the principles of moderation and portion control. It uses a points-based system to encourage healthier diet choices. It appears to be effective for weight loss, though WW funded many of the studies. The is a low carb, high fat, moderate protein diet that people originally used to help manage epilepsy. People now use it for a variety of other purposes, including weight loss and blood sugar management. Unlike WW, it is not a commercial diet program and is instead an eating pattern. On keto, your body enters a state called — in which you burn fat, rather than carbs, as your primary source of fuel. This offers a number of potential metabolic advantages for people who are trying to lose weight (): better blood sugar control and lower insulin levels maintenance of metabolic rate (calories burned at rest) The keto diet is low in carbs and sugars, so when you’re on it you need to avoid foods like: Yes, like WW, keto does appear to be effective for short-term weight loss. Several studies have investigated the success of a keto diet for weight management. A study including 89 people with and obesity found that participants following a keto diet lost significantly more weight and had higher reductions in their waist circumference after 4 months than people following a standard low calorie diet (). In fact, over 90% of the participants in the keto group lost at least 5% of their body weight during the study, and over 80% lost at least 10% (). Another review of studies including around 1,500 people that compared a keto diet with a low fat diet found that the weight losses of those in the keto group were significantly greater than those of the low fat group, at least until a 2-year follow-up (). Keto is a low carb, high fat diet that makes it easier for you to burn your own stored body fat for fuel. It may result in significantly more weight loss compared with a standard low calorie diet. WW and keto each boast benefits beyond weight loss. has been around for a long time and has a proven track record of success. One of the benefits of the WW program is that it provides a method of practicing moderation and portion control that’s simpler than calorie counting. It may also help you learn to make better food choices over time. Even if you choose to stop the program, you can still use the principles you learn from WW to make better food choices. WW also provides a built-in support network, even with its least expensive Digital Only plan. This plan provides access to a members-only virtual community. Meanwhile, higher-priced plans offer even more accountability and support options, including online or in-person meetings and unlimited one-on-one coaching. One of the key benefits that many keto dieters report is how fast they’re able to lose weight on the diet. This may be due to several factors (). Being in ketosis seems to have an appetite-suppressing effect, making it easier for a person to eat fewer calories (). Additionally, the keto diet may reduce your insulin levels. Insulin is the hormone that signals your body to store excess blood sugar as fat. So, when insulin levels are lower, it may be easier for your body to burn its own stored fat (). It also regulates your blood sugar levels, which may help rein in hunger and food cravings. There are also some case reports of people with type 2 diabetes drastically increasing their blood sugar control and reducing their need for insulin and diabetes medications after starting a keto diet (, , ). WW provides interpersonal support to its participants and encourages moderation and portion control. Keto may help improve blood sugar levels and reduce your appetite, making it easier to lose weight. One of the major downsides of WW is the price. Although it’s relatively inexpensive if you break it down per week, the costs can add up — especially if you’re on one of the more expensive plans and you want to stay on the program for a longer period of time. Additionally, the SmartPoints system may inadvertently discourage you from consuming foods that are otherwise healthy, simply because they’re high in calories or fat. The keto diet has . It’s a major shift from the typical diet most people eat, and for that reason it can be difficult to sustain long term. It may be particularly challenging to maintain during holidays or while vacationing. The keto diet also excludes many otherwise healthy foods, like: Finally, there are some long-term safety concerns with the keto diet that scientists haven’t fully studied yet. These include its potential to increase your cholesterol levels, which may increase your risk of heart disease (). WW is a paid program, so the costs can add up if you’re on it long term. On the other hand, keto may be difficult to maintain because it’s restrictive, and there are some potential long-term health concerns that scientists haven’t fully investigated yet. Both WW and keto diets may help you achieve short-term weight loss. Which diet is better for you depends on your individual needs. find the built-in structure and support of the WW program necessary to keep you motivated On the other hand, keto may be a better option if you: have type 2 diabetes or other blood sugar management concerns find it easier to make healthier decisions when your food options are limited are OK dieting independently or building your own support network WW and keto each have their pros and cons. WW may be a better fit for some people, while keto will be a better fit for others. It depends on your personal needs and preferences. WW and keto are two very different diets. WW is a structured, paid diet program based on moderation, portion control, and the WW SmartPoints system. It offers built-in social support at all paid levels of the program. Keto, on the other hand, is a low carb, high fat diet that aims to get you into ketosis, thereby making it easier for you to burn your own stored body fat as energy. Both diets are effective for , but for many reasons one may be a better fit for you than the other. — Weight Watchers Diet Review: Does It Work for Weight Loss?

50097154-662f-4637-9145-b90c0422d00f,"Do Exogenous Ketone Supplements Work for Weight Loss? The ketogenic or keto diet is a very low-carb, high-fat diet. Being on the diet for several days puts your body into ketosis, a nutritional state characterized by raised blood ketones and weight loss (). While the diet may provide benefits, it cana also be difficult to follow consistently. Some suggest that ketone supplements can mimic ketosis and raise blood ketone levels without changing your diet. However, that’s not exactly how your body interprets it. This article tells you whether exogenous ketone supplements can help you shed extra pounds. If you follow a standard high-carb diet, your body’s cells typically rely on glucose for fuel. Glucose comes from the carbs in your diet, including sugars and starchy foods like bread, pasta and some vegetables. If you restrict those foods, as with a , you force your body to look for alternative fuel sources. Your body then turns to fat for fuel, which produces ketone bodies when broken down in excess. This shift in metabolism puts your body in a state of . Most people naturally experience a mild state of ketosis during periods of fasting or strenuous exercise (, ). The two main ketone bodies produced during ketosis are acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Acetone is a third, less abundant, ketone body (). These ketone bodies replace glucose as fuel and provide your brain, heart and muscles with energy. It’s thought that the ketone bodies themselves may be responsible for the weight loss associated with a ketogenic diet (). Ketosis is a process in which your body produces high numbers of ketones and uses them for energy instead of glucose from carbs. Ketone bodies can be produced in your body (endogenously) or come from a synthetic source outside your body (exogenously). Thus, ketones found in supplements are exogenous ketones. These supplements contain only the beta-hydroxybutyrate ketone. The other primary ketone body, acetoacetate, is not chemically stable as a supplement. These are ketones bound to a salt, typically sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium. They’re most often found in powder form and mixed with liquid. These are ketones linked to another compound called an ester and packaged in liquid form. Ketone esters are used primarily in research and aren’t as readily available for purchase as ketone salts (). Both forms of ketone supplements have been shown to increase blood ketone levels, mimicking what happens in ketosis when you follow a ketogenic diet (, , , ). In one study, supplementing with approximately 12 grams (12,000 mg) of ketone salts increased participants’ blood ketone levels by over 300% (). For reference, most available ketone supplements contain 8–12 grams of ketones per serving. This elevation in blood ketone levels following supplementation is beneficial for people who want to without necessarily having to follow the diet (). That said, supplementing with ketones is thought to have many of the same health benefits as a ketogenic diet, including weight loss. People also take ketone supplements along with a ketogenic diet, especially when first beginning the diet. This reduces the time it takes to reach ketosis and lessens the unpleasant effects that may come from transitioning from a standard, higher-carb diet to a ketogenic one. The symptoms that often accompany the transition to a ketogenic diet, more commonly known as the “,” include constipation, headache, bad breath, muscle cramps and diarrhea. There’s limited research to suggest that ketone supplements can reduce these symptoms (). Taking exogenous ketone supplements increase ketone levels in your body, imitating the state of ketosis achieved through a ketogenic diet. Ketone supplements have been shown to decrease appetite, which may help you lose weight by eating less. In one study in 15 people of normal weight, those drinking a beverage containing ketone esters experienced 50% less hunger after an overnight fast than those drinking a sugary beverage (). This appetite-suppressing effect was attributed to lower levels of the hunger hormone between two and four hours after drinking the ketone ester drink (). However, ketone supplements may not affect appetite as much in people who have had a meal beforehand. Studies have observed higher blood ketone levels in those who didn’t eat a meal before taking a ketone supplement compared to those who did (, , ). And since it’s the elevated ketones that are associated with reduced appetite and lower ghrelin levels, ketone supplements may only be beneficial during a fast, such as upon rising in the morning, rather than after a meal that contains carbs (). In other words, taking a ketone supplement after a carb-containing meal will still raise blood ketone levels but not as high as if you fasted, suggesting that your body is using fewer ketones as fuel since there is more available glucose from the carbs (). One small study found that exogenous ketone supplements reduced appetite for over four hours, which may be promising for weight loss. However, additional studies are needed before ketone supplements can be recommended for appetite control. The Case Against Exogenous Ketones for Weight Loss Despite the potential appetite-curbing effects of ketone supplements, their potential weight loss benefits are unknown. Therefore, ketone supplements cannot be recommended for weight loss at this time. In fact, some evidence suggests that they may even hinder it. The purpose of the is to produce ketones from stored fat as an alternative fuel source. But if your ketone blood levels become too high, your blood can become dangerously acidic. To prevent this, healthy people have a feedback mechanism that slows down production of ketones if they become excessively high (, , , ). In other words, the higher your blood ketone levels are, the less your body produces. As a result, taking ketone supplements may prevent body fat from being used as fuel, at least in the short term (, ). Your body can use ketones as a fuel source, meaning they have calories. They contain about four calories per gram, the same number of calories as carbs or protein. A single serving of exogenous ketone salts typically contains less than 100 calories, but to maintain a state of ketosis, you’ll need several servings each day. That’s because the effect of ketone supplements lasts only a few hours and thus requires repeated doses throughout the day to maintain a state of ketosis (, ). Not to mention, at upwards of $3 per serving, they can become costly, too (). Ketone supplements themselves are not ketogenic because they prevent your body from producing its own ketones. They’re also a source of calories, which, depending on how many servings you have, may not be worthwhile for weight loss. Exogenous ketone supplements are generally considered to be a safe and effective way to increase , but the long-term effects are unknown (). Reported side effects are more common with ketone salts than ketone esters and include nausea, diarrhea and stomach discomfort (, , ). Ketone supplements reportedly have a poor aftertaste as well (). Moreover, achieving ketosis with ketone salts is not recommended due to the high amounts of minerals you’d ingest (). However, to maintain ketosis, you’ll need to take a dose every two to three hours, doubling or tripling these numbers. Manufacturers of ketone supplements recommend taking up to three servings per day. But while ketone supplements can still help you maintain ketosis even after a meal, the rise in levels of blood ketones is much less than if you were in a fast or didn’t consume a carb-containing meal (). The side effects associated with ketone supplements range from stomach discomfort to diarrhea. Because these supplements are also bound to salts, consuming too much is not recommended. Ketone supplements are claimed to put your body into ketosis without having to follow a ketogenic diet. One study found that exogenous ketone supplements may decrease appetite for over four hours when taken in a fasted state, but other research suggests that they may hinder weight loss efforts. Until more research is available, there’s no real support for using ketone supplements as a weight loss aid.

1b79d857-47f7-45af-949a-b078f610d8e8,"— Researchers are studying the effects of this ingredient to see if it can help people live longer. What if all the supposed benefits of the ketogenic diet could be distilled into a single pill? Researchers are working hard to find out just that. A lot has been said about the ketogenic diet in recent months — and for much more than just weight loss. But, for the sheer volume of headlines, there seems to be one glaring omission from many of them: beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), the potential miracle molecule at the center of it all. In two this month, the ketogenic diet was linked to several properties beyond just losing a few pounds. Mice fed a ketogenic diet experienced increased lifespan as well as better cognitive and motor functioning. That has led to speculation that the ketogenic diet might even be an avenue for Alzheimer’s research and brain health in general. The results “clearly demonstrate that lifespan is increased in mice consuming a ketogenic diet” compared with a control group, researchers wrote. They believe this increase is due to a high concentration of BHB in the bloodstream brought on by the ketogenic diet. “BHB has direct activities relevant to aging,” the researchers wrote. Dr. Eric Verdin, who serves as the president and CEO of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, helped author that research. “BHB has the potential to induce a protective state in the cells and make them more resistant to oxidative stress, and that’s on the heel of this, that we said: Let’s try to increase BHB levels so that we can see if it has a lifespan effect,” he told Healthline. BHB is one of three ketones the body produces during states of fasting or through low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets. In both contexts, the body naturally changes its primary source of energy from glucose (provided by carbohydrates) to stored fat. Fat is broken down and BHB is formed. It provides an alternate energy source for every part of the body, including the brain. Of the three ketone bodies produced during ketosis (BHB, acetone, and acetoacetate), BHB is present in significantly higher quantities in the blood. In his research, Verdin discovered that BHB is more than just an energy source for the body. “The classic view of BHB was that it was an alternate nutrient that happens during fasting… It is also a signaling molecule. It triggers all kinds of things in cells that are protective,” he said. “That brought a whole new dimension to the whole problem and forced people to start thinking that maybe there is something more to BHB being just a nutrient.” But Verdin only came to that conclusion in 2013. That’s why there’s an abundant amount of literature on the supposed benefits of the ketogenic diet, but significantly less on the role BHB plays in them. In fact, Verdin was merely hypothesizing that BHB would have a role in increasing lifespan in 2013. This year, his research using the ketogenic diet in mice finally supported that idea. However, the claimed benefits of the ketogenic diet in humans — not mice — are still problematic. While anecdotal evidence supports many claims about it, there’s still much research to be done. The impracticality of the diet also makes it difficult for longer studies. Nutritionists tend to dislike the diet. They frequently speak out against it, mainly because it’s just too difficult to pull off for many people. Difficult diets can lead to yo-yo dieting, the repeated stopping and starting of a diet. This cycle of rapid weight loss and weight gain can harm the body. There are also psychological elements built in to dieting, and subsequent feelings of failure if it can’t be accomplished. That’s what makes the prospect of a BHB pill or supplement so intriguing. “Imagining that everyone is going to go on a ketogenic diet is very unlikely. I’ve done it myself, and it is hard as a diet to sustain for a long period of time,” said Verdin. “The interest for us in BHB is [if] can we recapitulate all the beneficial effects that we are seeing from the ketogenic diet simply by administering BHB as a food or as a drug, whatever you want to call it.” Another expert contacted by Healthline says the benefits of the ketogenic diet could be more complex than just increasing BHB levels. “Decreased glucose is also a hallmark of the ketogenic diet… The key may be increased BHB, it may be decreased glucose, it may be both effects — or it may be a critical ratio between the two changes,” said Susan A. Masino, PhD, a professor of applied science at Trinity College in Connecticut. Verdin cautions that all of this is still well within the world of speculation and far from being proven in humans. Following their studies in mice, Verdin and his team must now be able to show that they can duplicate the same beneficial effects on cognition, memory, and lifespan using a supplement rather than diet. “There is no evidence to date that the ketogenic diet will increase your lifespan or healthspan in humans. We need to do the experiments,” said Verdin. Verdin’s team needs to figure out exactly what the threshold — the quantity of BHB in the bloodstream — is before those effects happen. If you’ve spent any time in a health store, you may have already noticed keto and BHB supplements on shelves. Researchers aren’t the only ones aware of the public’s interest in ketosis. Those supplements, usually sold as “keto salts” or something similar, are supposed to help speed you into ketosis and all its myriad health benefits. The problem, as it so often is with supplements, is that there’s little — or perhaps nothing — to substantiate their claims. “Many of these products, you would have to eat so much of them to get your ketone body levels in an area that is significant,” said Verdin. “They probably don’t give you the ketone levels necessary to give you a biological effect.” And, since the supplements are most often sold as a salt, consuming too much could lead to the detrimental effects of consuming too much salt, like high blood pressure. So, while the keto supplements on shelves today probably aren’t worth their salt, a real, clinically studied BHB supplement in the future could be. Masino points out its potential, , which is currently the in the United States and affecting roughly 5 million people. found that individuals with Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairments that were fed certain saturated fats to promote ketone production had greater memory improvement than a control group. Since then, have also looked at the ketogenic diet as a remedy for Alzheimer’s. Epilepsy, lifespan, cognitive ability, and Alzheimer’s are all part of a growing list of conditions that BHB appears to affect beneficially. But demonstrating its effectiveness in humans, particularly in a supplement form, is still a long way off. Nonetheless, both Verdin and Masino are optimistic. They do caution the public in getting too excited about the next miracle supplement, though. “A BHB pill should be added to a healthy diet — not taken as a shortcut,” said Masino. “I’m completely excited about [BHB] and its potential,” said Verdin. “There is a lot of skepticism about whether the metabolism of mice applies to humans, but the effects we are seeing are robust, so I predict that they will apply to humans.” — The Ketogenic Diet: A Detailed Beginner’s Guide to Keto The ketogenic diet (keto) is a low-carb, high-fat diet that causes weight loss and provides numerous health benefits.

e2f2ece5-de02-4e38-8865-1af19c501aea,"15 Health Benefits of Low-Carb & Ketogenic Diets (I Love No. 9) Remember in the 90s when low-carb diets were getting all the media attention? At the time, for a lot of people, , questioning whether low-carb was healthy at all. Concerns were raised over whether a high-fat, low-carb ketogenic diet could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Since then, however, low-carb diets have been studied extensively. Not only is low-carb great for losing weight, but it turns out it is the diet you can eat, including benefits for your cardiovascular health! Low-carb might have been a fad in the 90s, but it isn't 'just another fad diet.' It works. ﻿15 Health Benefits of Low-Carb & Ketogenic Diets﻿ 1. Low-Carb Increases Your HDL ('Good') Cholesterol Levels 2. With Low-Carb, You Can Control Your LDL Cholesterol 8. Suppress Your Appetite, So You Are Less Tempted to Overeat 12. Low-Carb Diets Can Be Used to Effectively Treat Epilepsy 13. Low-Carb May Also Have Benefits for Patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease 14. When You Eat a Higher-Protein Diet, You Enjoy All the Added Benefits of Protein for Your Health. Want to use this infographic on your blog? Just copy and paste the code below! The following are the scientifically-proven weight loss and health benefits of low-carb ketogenic diets: 1. Low-Carb Increases Your HDL ('Good') Cholesterol Levels If you have concerns about your cardiovascular health or you are just a health-conscious person, you probably have heard of HDL vs. LDL cholesterol. HDL stands for 'High-Density Lipoprotein,' and is often referred to as 'good' cholesterol, whereas LDL stands for 'Low-Density Lipoprotein,' and is typically called 'bad cholesterol.' Neither term refers directly to cholesterol itself, so the phrases 'HDL cholesterol' and 'LDL cholesterol' are misnomers. Rather, HDL and LDL are names for the specific types of lipoproteins which ferry cholesterol around your bloodstream. LDL moves cholesterol from your liver to other body systems HDL transports cholesterol from areas throughout your body back to your liver Once at your liver, cholesterol can either be used again, or it can be excreted as waste Increasing your HDL levels decreases your risk of heart disease (, , , ). Interestingly enough, one of the best ways you can boost your HDL levels is by eating fat in your , not less (, , ). This may seem counterintuitive to you if you have heard time and again throughout your life, as so many of us have that fat is terrible for your cardiovascular system. : Eating a low-carb, high-fat ketogenic diet is an excellent way to increase your HDL levels and prevent heart disease (, , ) 2. With Low-Carb, You Can Control Your LDL Cholesterol As mentioned previously, HDL is typically referred to as ""good"" cholesterol, while LDL is usually called ""bad"" cholesterol. Elevated LDL levels are associated with a heightened risk of heart disease, but studies have discovered that there are different sizes of LDL particles and that the smallest LDL particles are the ones that increase the risk of heart attack. The larger LDL particles do not seem to significantly increase the risk of heart disease (, , ). ﻿﻿﻿﻿ help you out with your LDL cholesterol in a couple of ways. Eating low-carb both reduces the of LDL in your bloodstream, and raises the of the particles (, , , ). : Low-carb both raises your 'good' HDL cholesterol and controls your 'bad' LDL cholesterol, leading to vast improvements in your cardiovascular health. If you are following your cardiovascular health markers, you are looking at your HDL and LDL cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and triglycerides. It is well-known that higher levels of triglycerides in your bloodstream are associated with an increased risk of heart disease (). You might assume that intuitively, triglycerides would increase the more fat you eat, but ironically this is not the case at all. Many studies demonstrate that eating more increases your triglyceride levels more than anything, so eating fewer carbs can your triglyceride levels (, , , , ). : Eating low-carb is an excellent way to lower your triglyceride levels! This is yet another way low-carb contributes to excellent cardiovascular health. It is a well-known fact that chronic high blood pressure can lead to hypertensive heart disease (). High blood pressure is also a factor which can increase your risk for kidney failure or stroke. High blood pressure is extremely common, so much so it is nearly ubiquitous. , around 1 in 3 American adults suffer from high blood pressure. That is 70 million people. Even young people and children can suffer from high blood pressure. If you are looking for a long-term diet to decrease your blood pressure, low-carb is an ideal choice. Studies demonstrate that low-carb can help to lower chronically high blood pressure, lowering your risk for related diseases (, , ). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that controlling your insulin levels can reduce blood pressure (). Low-carb diets help to control insulin levels (). : Eating a low-carb diet controls your insulin levels, which in turn can help you to reduce your blood pressure. Insulin is an important hormone which controls what your body does with glucose (store it or burn it). When you are healthy, and your insulin is working properly, you do not experience spikes in your blood glucose levels or subsequent 'sugar crashes.' If however, you have , your cells do not properly read the messages that insulin is sending, which can result in blood sugar problems. These problems may even take the form of type 2 diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, your body cannot properly produce the right amount of insulin. This leads to a vicious cycle since you now have an even harder time regulating your blood sugar. This brings us back to carbohydrates. When you eat carbs, your body has to break them down. Carbs are composed of sugars, so they convert to glucose in your digestive system. By eating fewer carbs, you are giving your body less glucose to process. That is why a low-carb diet is so excellent for regulating insulin levels and controlling type 2 diabetes (, , , , ). In fact, are so effective at managing insulin levels that many people with who switch to low-carb can reduce their medications or even stop taking them altogether (, ). : Because low-carb is so great for controlling insulin levels and reducing blood sugar spikes and subsequent crashes, it is an effective natural treatment for type 2 diabetes. We have all heard that we carry extra baggage around in the form of stored water, especially if we are dehydrated. Is this the reason that the scale sometimes reads a few pounds higher than you expect it to? Water weight is a confusing topic because there are forms it can take: Chronic water retention, which is a long-term condition resulting from kidney or hormones malfunctioning Your kidney is involved with both types of water weight. Your kidney is responsible for deciding whether to hold onto the water or flush it out. So you want your kidney to be functioning at its best. There is an important relationship between your kidneys, sodium, and insulin. Sometimes when you have a salty meal, your kidneys will decide to hold onto more water to dilute the sodium content. Insulin plays a key role in blood pressure and nutrient reabsorption. You need your insulin levels to be healthy for your kidney to properly regulate your salt and water levels (, ). In other words, when your insulin levels are properly regulated, your kidney function improves. With the kidney performing more efficiently, your body retains for a briefer period of time. This prevents bloating and may also prevent chronic water retention. The result is that you can shed more of your excess water weight, dropping a few pounds. As previously discussed, low-carb diets are excellent for regulating your insulin levels (, , , , ). This means that low-carb diets are perfect for shedding excess water weight. : If you want to lose weight fast and are carrying around extra baggage in the form of water weight, low carb can help you shed those pounds quickly. If you are concerned about your heart health, you may be familiar with (and even worried about) what is known as 'metabolic syndrome.' Metabolic syndrome is not just one disorder, but a set of risk factors, which combined significantly raise your risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Low levels of HDL-cholesterol (the 'good' cholesterol) Because more and more people are obese, metabolic syndrome is becoming a particularly pervasive problem in today’s world. In fact, metabolic syndrome is so common that researchers believe it may soon overtake smoking as the number one cause of heart disease. Researchers also emphasize that you can treat metabolic syndrome through lifestyle changes. A is the perfect example of a lifestyle change which can treat and possibly even cure metabolic syndrome. Remember, we have already demonstrated that a low-carb diet can raise your HDL cholesterol, lower triglycerides, control blood sugar levels, and reduce high blood pressure. Next, we are going to address how low-carb helps to control body weight, and may even help you burn fat in the abdominal area. All five risk factors of metabolic syndrome improve significantly on a low-carb diet. : Since low-carb combats all of the risk factors which are part of metabolic syndrome, it is one of the best ways you can prevent cardiovascular disease and associated disorders. 8. Suppress Your Appetite, So You Are Less Tempted to Overeat One of the ways in which a low-carb diet helps you to lose weight is by controlling your appetite. Hunger is one of the reasons it is typically hard to diet, especially if you are sticking with a typical crash diet which involves giving up a lot of proteins and fats. No one likes being hungry all the time, so this is a common reason why dieting fails. Imagine if you could that would help you without being hungry all the time. You are eating more fats and proteins when you reduce your carbohydrate intake on a low-carb diet. * For a ketogenic diet, protein would be moderate and the fat portion higher. For example, the ranges could be 5-10% carbs, 15-30% protein and 60-75% (or even more) fat. By eating more fat (moderate protein) on a low-carb ketogenic diet, your body adjusts to predominately burn fat () for energy. Having access to your body fat for energy, you won't feel the need to snack on carbohydrate foods to top up your blood glucose levels (). Sugar is also highly addictive and may even be more addictive than cocaine (). This causes you to snack more on sugary foods. On a low-carb diet, you eat fewer carbs and hence less sugar so you won't be tempted to snack because of addiction. As a result, you will end up eating fewer calories (yes, even with all those fats) on a low-carb diet than you would if you were eating a low-fat diet. Hunger is one of the reasons that dieters on low-fat plans need to actively restrict calories. On a low-carb diet, do not be surprised if you feel so satisfied after and between meals that you do not even need to count calories to stay on track. : Low-carb helps you to lose weight by controlling your appetite and curbing the urge to overeat. The same study above that demonstrated that low-carb diets improve satiety () also demonstrated another benefit. It turns out that low-carb diets not only help you feel full but also regulate your mood. This means that if you struggle with depression, anxiety, or other mood disorders, you may feel more level-headed, relaxed, and balanced when you eat a low-carb diet. If you suffer from chronic depression or anxiety, you know that these disorders not only reduce your quality of life on activities and relationships but that they can also produce physical symptoms in your body. Over time, these ongoing side-effects can reduce your overall health. For example, depression is strongly linked to cardiovascular disease (). Boosting your mood is thus yet another way in which a low-carb diet protects your overall well-being. Ultimately this includes your physical as well as your psychological health. : Many dieters on low-carb report improvements to their mood. This increase in mental well-being can lead to an increase in physical health. If you want to burn fat quickly, what do you typically do? Many people resort to crash diets. Crash diets, however, are unhealthy, and their weight loss effects are temporary. After you return to a regular diet, that weight comes back fast. A much better way to lose weight fast and is a low-carbohydrate diet. Why does a low-carb diet lead to more rapid weight loss than a low-fat diet? A low-carb diet helps you to shed excess water weight (see point #6). On a low-carb diet, you experience lower insulin levels, which means your kidneys start purging excess sodium. Low-carb is extremely effective for weight loss as a result (, ). Research has demonstrated that a low-carb diet may be very effective for weight loss for at least six months (). Why not longer? The study above states that 'adherence was poor and attrition was high in both groups.' In other words, many study participants gave up after that time period. As a result, studies still need to conduct longer-term studies to know just how effective low-carb may be over the long run. It is entirely possible that low-carb continues to burn fat quickly for longer than six months and anecdotal testimonials suggest this is so. In either case, low-carb is not a crash diet and is sustainable over the long-term if you stick with it. Doing so will give you the best results in the short-term and the long-term, both in terms of and overall health. : Dieters on low-carb find that it is an effective diet for fast weight loss. It is also healthy and easy to maintain for the long-term, which will help you to continue to meet your weight loss goals over the years to come. Earlier we talked about risk factors for metabolic syndrome, one of which is belly fat. While fat distribution patterns may differ from person to person, many of us remember having a 'pear' shape when we were younger, where fat tended to settle around our hips. But as you get older, it is common for your fat to instead gather at your waistline. shows that belly fat is worse for you than other fat distribution patterns.  This is true not only for people who are overweight but for people who have a normal weight as well. Belly fat is visceral fat. This is a type of fat which accumulates around vital organs like the liver. If you have a lot of fat in the abdominal cavity, you can develop a number of different health problems, including metabolic dysfunction, insulin resistance, and inflammation (). You already know that low-carb diets can result in greater fat loss than low-fat diets. But it turns out that they can also lead to a greater percentage of fat loss in the abdominal area (). That means that if you want to get rid of that 'apple' shape, a low-carb diet is one of the best approaches you can take. Once you , you reduce your chances of developing insulin resistance and other diseases. Even if you are not overweight, if you have belly fat which you have been struggling to burn, low-carb is a great approach. Many people believe that they can 'target' fat loss using exercise. This is a myth. : Belly fat increases your risk for disease, but low carb helps you burn away the fat and the risk. 12. Low-Carb Diets Can Be Used to Effectively Treat Epilepsy While most of the research and interest in low-carb diets centers around benefits for weight loss and cardiovascular health, there are other advantages as well. If you have epilepsy, a low-carb diet may help you to reduce your symptoms. The ketogenic diet (KD), which is high in fat, low in carbohydrates, and moderate in protein, has been used as a treatment option for epilepsy in children since 1921. The premise is that the brain can use ketones that are formed on a low carbohydrate diet for energy rather than depend on glucose. In 1998, Blue Cross Blue Shield ran a meta-analysis of 19 different studies on 1084 pediatric patients with epilepsy to evaluate the effectiveness of this low-carb diet. Blue Cross Blue Shield discovered that 16% of patients became seizure-free, while 32% experienced a 90% or greater reduction in seizures. For 56%, seizures dropped by half or greater (). While most research on the low-carb diet and epilepsy centers around children (), research on this promising treatment is also being conducted on adults. : If you are looking for a natural treatment for epilepsy, low-carb ketogenic diet may reduce your symptoms. 13. Low-Carb May Also Have Benefits for Patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease The benefits of low-carb diets for epilepsy are also emphasized in yet another study (). This research also indicates that low-carb may be useful in treating 'a broad range of neurological disorders characterized by the death of neurons.' In particular, research has focused on Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. The study above suggests that a ketogenic diet low in carbohydrates could thwart Alzheimer’s disease by delivering more fatty acids than you would get from a regular or high-carb diet. Studies have also demonstrated that taking in higher amounts of unsaturated may help prevent the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease (). A study of 5395 participants found that higher saturated fat consumption reduced the risk of dementia by 9% (). A study that included 937 elderly people over the course of 3.7 years found that those who consumed (): The most carbohydrate had an 89% increased risk of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The most protein had a 21% reduced risk of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The most fat had a 44% reduced risk of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The study reveals that a low carb high fat ketogenic diet reduces the risk of cognitive impairment. : A ketogenic diet like low carb which is high in essential fatty acids may not only help to fight cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer's Disease but may help prevent Parkinson's Disease as well. 14. When You Eat a Higher-Protein Diet, You Enjoy All the Added Benefits of Protein for Your Health. When you eat a diet which is low in carbohydrates, you typically replace those carbs with fats and proteins. Proteins are essential for human health. In fact, if you ignore water, around 75% of your body weight is . Proteins have numerous functions and benefits in the human body: Protein is essential for the process of DNA replication. Enzymes are composed of proteins. Enzymes are responsible for breaking down and releasing to your body. That means that when you eat a diet high in protein, you get more out of all the nutrition you consume. Many types of tissue in your body are made up of protein, including muscles and skin. Protein is vital to immune system function (, ) Protein helps you to feel full and provides you with energy throughout the day. , helping you burn more calories throughout the day (, , ) Since protein makes up the majority of your body tissue mass (not accounting for water), it is vital to all of your body functions. : Low carb diets tend to be high in protein, which is good for your whole body. If you are working out while you are dieting and trying to bulk out, you may have struggled to do so while eating a low-fat, low-protein, high-carb diet. While dramatic increases in protein are not necessary if you do only mild to moderate exercise, that all changes if you are working out extra hard. High protein consumption can prevent the loss of lean muscle mass while dieting (). Additionally, proteins are the building blocks for health muscle tissue. For that reason, eating more protein in your diet provides your body with the nutrition it needs to repair and grow muscle mass. That means that if you eat a low-carb diet which is high in protein while working out, you can build muscle more efficiently. : If you want to get lean muscle, low-carb is the perfect diet to support your workouts. Low Carb Has Numerous Health Benefits: The Evidence Is There Now you know exactly why so many dieters swear by low-carb. Getting used to a ketogenic diet requires an initial adjustment phase, but as you can see, it can be well worth it. Stick with a low-carb diet over the long-term and turn it into a lifestyle choice, and you will be able to take advantage of the full benefits for weight loss, cardiovascular health, neuron function, and more.

3849c175-494d-44eb-810c-8397bdcd2fda,"Popcorn is a snack made from dried corn kernels that are heated to produce edible puffs. Plain, air-popped popcorn can be a nutritious snack and is a good source of vitamins, minerals, carbs, and fiber. However, since it contains carbs, you may wonder whether popcorn can fit into a low-carb, high-fat ketogenic diet. This article provides an overview of popcorn’s nutrition, the ketogenic diet, and whether or not the two can coexist. Popcorn refers to the puffs that form when kernels are heated, causing the water inside of them to expand and the kernels to explode. It’s a popular snack that has been enjoyed for thousands of years and is thought to have originated in the Americas. In fact, some studies suggest that people in Peru ate popcorn over 6,000 years ago (). Today, people all over the world eat popcorn. It can be made on the stove, in an air popper, or your microwave. It’s also sold already popped. Popcorn is commonly served with melted butter and salt but can be flavored with , spices, cheese, chocolate, or other seasonings, too. Popcorn is a favorite snack made from dried corn kernels that have been heated. It can be eaten plain, topped with melted butter, or tossed in seasonings. Though most think of corn as a vegetable, popcorn is considered a whole grain. Popcorn kernels are harvested when the corn plant is mature and all parts of the grain are intact. has been linked to a lower risk of heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and overall mortality (, , ). This is because whole grains are rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds that provide many health benefits (, ). Like other whole grains, popcorn is highly nutritious — 3 cups (24 grams) of air-popped popcorn contain (): Since it’s high in , popcorn is very filling without having a lot of calories. It’s also rich in minerals, including magnesium, phosphorous, zinc, and manganese (). What’s more, popcorn offers antioxidants like polyphenols that help prevent cellular damage caused by molecules called free radicals. In particular, polyphenols may offer protective effects against cancer and other chronic diseases (, , ). Popcorn is a highly nutritious whole grain that’s rich in micronutrients and antioxidants. A 3-cup (24-gram) serving of popcorn packs 4 grams of fiber for less than 20 grams of carbs and only 90 calories. The ketogenic diet recommends dramatically reducing your intake of carbs and replacing them with fat. This leads to a metabolic state known as ketosis, during which your body uses byproducts from the breakdown of fat — called ketones — for energy in the absence of carbs (, ). The ketogenic diet is commonly used to help children with epilepsy manage their seizures. It’s also been linked to health benefits like , as well as improved insulin sensitivity, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes (, , , ). To achieve ketosis, you typically need to eat less than 50 grams of carbs per day — though some people may have to reduce carbs even more (). As a result, low-carb foods like eggs, meats, fatty fish, avocados, olive oil, nuts, and seeds, as well as non-starchy vegetables like cauliflower, broccoli, and bell peppers, form the basis of a keto diet. According to most keto experts, the carb limit refers to , which are calculated by subtracting the grams of fiber from the total grams of carbs in a serving of food (). Based on this logic, whole grains and other fiber-rich carbs contain fewer net carbs than foods without as much fiber, such as refined grains. The ketogenic diet involves reducing carb intake and increasing fat consumption so that your body burns fat for energy. It’s been linked to weight loss, better blood sugar control, and a reduced incidence of epileptic seizures. Depending on your , popcorn may be able to fit into a keto diet. A typical serving of air-popped popcorn is 3 cups (24 grams) and contains 4 grams of fiber and 18 grams of carbs — or 14 grams of net carbs (). Popcorn can easily fit into a keto diet with a daily limit of 50 grams of net carbs and can even be included in more restrictive versions of the keto diet. Not to mention, if you’re following a keto diet to lose weight, popcorn only has 90 calories per serving. However, a 3-cup (24-gram) serving would take up a large part of your daily carb allotment. If you want to enjoy popcorn on a keto diet, consider limiting other high-carb foods, so you don’t exceed your net carb limit. Bread, chips, sweets, and other refined grains are high in carbs and contain little to no fiber. On the other hand, popcorn and other whole grains have more fiber and fewer net carbs (). Therefore, eating popcorn instead of high-carb, low-fiber foods on a keto diet can help satisfy a desire for carbs without going overboard. Still, it’s important to be aware of portions when eating popcorn on a keto diet since it can be easy to overconsume. To help keep portion size in check and feel more satisfied, you can add fat from , butter, or olive oil to popcorn. Making popcorn at home instead of buying pre-popped varieties can also help you control how much you eat and what you add to it. To make popcorn at home, heat 1 tablespoon of coconut oil or butter in a large pot over medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons of popcorn kernels. Cover the pot with a lid while the kernels pop. After popping stops, remove from heat and season with oil or butter and salt. Depending on what other carb-rich foods you eat, popcorn can fit into a keto diet. Limit high-carb foods that are low in fiber and add a healthy fat to popcorn to avoid overeating. Popcorn is a nutritious whole-grain snack loaded with fiber. It’s filling but low in calories and contains more nutrients and fewer net carbs than other popular snacks like chips and crackers. Overall, can be a healthy addition to a — especially if you limit other high-carb foods. Popcorn Nutrition Facts: A Healthy, Low-Calorie Snack?

fbae1f08-845d-43a6-9646-2e2541966bbc,"Xylitol is a natural carbohydrate classified as a sugar alcohol. It is found in most plants, including many fruits and vegetables, and occurs naturally in human bodies - the body produces about 5 to 15 grams a day. It was discovered by a German chemist named Emil Fischer in 1891 and has been used as a sweetening agent since the 1960s. Xylitol is considered a “sugar-free” sweetener, but differs from artificial sweeteners like aspartame and Splenda® because it is all-natural. It is almost identical in sweetness to table sugar (sucrose), but has 40 percent fewer calories. It also has a lower glycemic index than sucrose (7 compared to 65), meaning it is absorbed more slowly from the intestines into the blood, thus preventing a rapid rise in blood sugar levels. In addition, according to Drugs.com, it does not depend on insulin to be metabolized. According to The American Journal Clinical Nutrition, xylitol is a suitable component of the diet for diabetic patients. However, Web MD says there is insufficient evidence for xylitol as a sugar substitute for people with diabetes, and according to Maria Collazo-Clavell, M.D., a member of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American College of Endocrinology, the American Diabetes Association and The Endocrine Society (Mayo Clinic), diabetics should be cautious with sugar alcohols like xylitol because they can increase blood sugar levels. If you are diabetic, it is best to consult your health care provider before using. In a University of Michigan study involving more than 1,200 children, chewing gum with xylitol dramatically reduced new cavities, and also helped reverse the process of decay in existing cavities. When oral bacteria metabolizes sucrose, it breaks down into acids causing cavities. Xylitol, on the other hand, produces almost no acid because bacteria does not metabolize it efficiently. Web MD says 1 to 20 grams of xylitol, from products such as chewing gum, candies and foods, is needed per day to significantly reduce the rate of cavity formation in children and adults. Xylitol may also help in the prevention of in young children. According to two double-blind studies, the occurrences of infections were reduced by 40 percent in children given xylitol chewing gum (Drugs.com). Dietary xylitol increases calcium absorption in the intestines. When added to calcium supplements and given to rats deficient in calcium, it was shown to accelerate bone repair and improve the bioavailability of calcium salts (Drugs.com). Xylitol was approved in 1963 as a dietary sweetener by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is considered safe in the amounts found in foods. It also appears to be safe for most adults in amounts up to 50 grams per day, and for most children in amounts up to 20 grams per day. Because sugar alcohols do not fully break down during digestion, diarrhea can occur with high doses. It is used as a sweetener for diabetics in many countries. However, as mentioned earlier, it is best to talk to your health care provider before using if you have diabetes. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should also consult their health professional before using. Extremely high doses of xylitol over a long period of time, more than three years, may possibly cause tumors. Is xylitol safe for pets to eat? According to Carlye Rose, DVM, DABVP, it can be dangerous to dogs. Unlike humans, xylitol does not absorb slowly in dogs. In fact, it absorbs rapidly and acts as a strong promoter of insulin release, resulting in hypoglycemia. Symptoms include vomiting, loss of coordination and seizures, which may be seen within 30 minutes after ingestion. Doses as low as 0.1 grams per kilograms can cause hypoglycemia, and doses exceeding 0.5 grams per kilograms can put a dog at risk for hepatotoxicity and possibly death. It is not clear at this time how xylitol affects cats or other pets. However, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) advises not giving xylitol to any animal. As a sugar substitute, xylitol is equal to table sugar in measurements, although it may slightly vary depending on the recipe. However, you cannot use it in recipes that require yeast to make dough rise because it cannot be metabolized by yeast, and you cannot use it in recipes that require sugar to be caramelized because it does caramelize like table sugar.

12fc52f3-8ec6-49ac-aabd-54da085f22d5,"What Is the Keto Headache, and How Do You Treat It? — The ketogenic diet is a popular eating pattern that replaces most of your carbs with fat. Though this diet appears to be effective for weight loss, many people experience uncomfortable side effects when first starting the diet. Headaches are one of the most common symptoms. If you’re considering keto, you may wonder how best to stave off these headaches. This article explores the causes of headaches on the keto diet and offers tips for preventing and treating them. Several factors may cause keto headaches, which typically occur when you’re beginning the diet. Glucose, a type of carb, is the main source of fuel for your body and brain. The keto diet drastically reduces your carb intake, replacing it with fat. This shifts your body into , a metabolic state in which you burn fat as your primary source of energy (). When you start the diet, your body begins relying on ketone bodies instead of glucose, which can cause your blood sugar levels to drop. In turn, this may lead to low blood sugar. This transition into ketosis may stress your brain, which could result in mental fatigue, or , as well as headaches (, ). Dehydration is one of the most common side effects of the keto diet. It occurs because people tend to urinate more frequently as they shift into ketosis. During this transition, your body depletes its stored form of carbs, called glycogen. Given that the glycogen in your body is bound to water molecules, it releases water when it’s used up (). Furthermore, your body produces less insulin — a hormone that helps absorb glucose from your blood — on keto because you consume fewer carbs. A drop in insulin levels can affect , such as potassium and sodium, which play key roles in hydration. For example, your kidneys release excess sodium when insulin levels fall, promoting dehydration (). Collectively, these factors can contribute to headaches. Aside from headaches, include dry mouth, dizziness, and impaired vision (). Several other factors may increase your risk of headaches on the keto diet. These include the overuse of medications, diuretics, and other drugs that promote dehydration, as well as your age and lifestyle factors like , stress, and skipping meals (). Low blood sugar levels and dehydration are two significant drivers of keto headaches. Multiple other medicinal and lifestyle factors may likewise increase your headache risk. Many people experience side effects beyond headaches on the keto diet, including muscle cramps, constipation, fatigue, and dizziness. These symptoms are collectively known as (). In most instances, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances can worsen these symptoms, making prevention especially important. Ensuring proper hydration and eating plenty of nutritious foods can help minimize your risk of dehydration. In turn, this can alleviate headaches — and prevent them from occurring in the first place. As the initial phases of keto involve water loss, it’s important to drink adequate fluids. Aim for at least 68 ounces (2 liters) of water each day. Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it makes you urinate more often and may increase your risk of dehydration (). Cucumbers, zucchini, lettuce, celery, cabbage, and raw tomatoes have a , which can help you stay hydrated. Some of them are also good sources of electrolytes. Keto-friendly foods like avocados, spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes are high in potassium. Similarly, almonds, kale, pumpkin seeds, and oysters are and suitable for keto (, ). Consider lightly salting your food to reduce your risk of an electrolyte imbalance. Taking an electrolyte supplement may minimize your risk of dehydration and keto flu symptoms. Refrain from intense workouts during the initial days of keto, as they can stress your body and increase your likelihood of headaches. If you continue to experience headaches after several days or weeks on the keto diet, consult a health professional to ensure that an underlying medical condition isn’t to blame. Minimizing your risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances is key to combatting headaches on the keto diet. Among other steps, you can try drinking plenty of water, eating water-rich foods, limiting alcohol, and salting your foods. Though is a great tool for weight loss, it may cause several side effects when you’re first starting out. Headaches are one of the most common side effects of this diet, and they’re typically triggered by dehydration or low blood sugar levels. Nonetheless, you can protect against keto headaches by and keeping a close eye on your electrolyte levels, among other tactics. If your headaches persist beyond a few days or weeks, talk to a healthcare professional. — Although the ketogentic diet is linked to weight loss and other benefits, it also carries several risks.

adf77b1d-0d3e-4f12-9183-2cbdd805840e,"Ketosis vs. Ketoacidosis (DKA): What Is the Difference? Let’s break it down so that you can understand exactly what ketosis is and how it differs from ketoacidosis. Many people who believe that ketosis is dangerous are mixing it up with another state called ""ketoacidosis."" Profit motives tend to muddy up the works when it comes to getting clear, factual information about your health. Well, there are a lot of individuals and companies which all have their own goals and motivations. Here’s the thing though … that is all misinformation. You then Googled something like, ""low carb dangerous"" and found a list of link-bait articles informing you that low-carb is a ketogenic diet, and ketosis is a dangerous metabolic state which can be fatal. And then maybe someone said something to you like, ""What are you thinking? ."" If you are thinking about , maybe you have mentioned it to some of your family or friends. By the time you finish reading this article, you will understand why low-carb a safe . ​Can Ketosis Ever Lead to Ketoacidosis or Otherwise Harm Your Health? Want to use this infographic on your blog? Just copy and paste the code below! Most of us get the majority of our daily fuel from glucose. Ketosis is a metabolic state where you get most of your daily fuel from fat instead of carbs. Your body becomes ketogenic when it has limited access to glucose and needs to turn to another energy source for primary fuel. If you eat a very , you are restricting the glucose available to your body, which causes your body to turn to . Note that not produce a ketogenic state. It depends on how much you restrict your carbohydrate intake. If you are eating between 20-50 grams of carbohydrates per day, you will generally go into a ketogenic state. If you eat more than that, you may never actually establish ketosis. While you are eating fewer carbs, your insulin levels decrease (). Low-carb causes your body to release . These fatty acids travel to your liver, where they are oxidized. Oxidized fatty acids are converted into molecules called ""ketones."" Your body and brain can use ketones for energy. :  ​Ketosis is a metabolic state where your body’s primary source of fuel is fat instead of carbohydrates. On a very low-carb diet, you enter a state of ketosis. There are several reasons why people think ketosis is a dangerous state. The first reason is simply that the word """" is easy to mix up with the word ""ketoacidosis."" The second reason is that they believe that your brain is literally unable to function if you are not eating carbohydrates. The vast majority of your brain does require glucose as fuel. Some cells do, which is not a problem - more on that in just a moment. As it turns out, most of your brain cells can switch from getting energy from glucose to getting it from ketones (, , ). In fact, this happens naturally when people are starving. After only three days of starvation, the brain gets 25% of its energy from ketones. During long-term starvation, this number rises to around 60% (, ). What about those few cells still depending on glucose? No problem. During ketosis, your body engages in a process called . This process allows it to manufacture that little bit of glucose your brain cells need to function. The third reason that some people think that ketosis is dangerous is simply because of the presence of ketones. Ketoacidosis is characterized by extremely high levels of ketones, far more than what is observed in ketosis. Your body manufactures them because they are useful. It is all a matter of balance - more on that in the next section. : Some people worry that ketosis does not supply the brain with fuel, but this is simply not the case. The brain gets everything it needs to function. While ketosis does lead to the production of ketones, this does not mean that you are in a state of ketoacidosis. Ketosis is a separate, safe, stable metabolic state. Now let’s talk about ketoacidosis, a state you do want to be in. Ketoacidosis is typically associated with type I diabetes (sometimes type II), which is why it is also called ""diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)."" This happens when patients do not receive sufficient insulin. At this point, their bodies enter a state equivalent to starvation. Ironically, this can happen even when patients have plenty of glucose available in their blood. They are unable to metabolize it. At this point, the body attempts to adapt to survive and begins manufacturing ketones. The idea of course is for the body to use the ketones for energy. The problem is that the patient still cannot produce insulin. Ketosis is regulated by insulin. This prevents your body from going overboard with ketone production. In ketoacidosis, the insulin isn’t there to signal the body to stop producing the ketones. Together with high blood sugar, this can cause the pH level of the blood to become imbalanced. When the pH of blood gets too low, it becomes dangerously acidic, thus the name ""ketoosis."" The reason for this is the fact that ketones themselves are acidic. This acidic state can produce a range of dangerous symptoms. The first sign of ketoacidosis is when your blood sugar reaches over 240 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L), or you show signs of high blood sugar, such as feeling really thirsty, peeing a lot or dry mouth (). Ketoacidosis can ultimately lead to coma and even death. In fact, diabetic ketoacidosis is the number one cause of death among diabetics under the age of 24 (). The mortality rate for those who suffer ketoacidosis is 2 to 5% (). Ketoacidosis can result from a number of situations, but none of them include a safe, healthy low-carb diet. You can develop ketoacidosis if you are literally starving, or if you seriously over-exercise. It can result from alcoholism as well, and may also be associated with the use of XTC while over-exercising (this has been documented with some ravers). ""But wait,"" you may be thinking, ""if ketones are acidic, doesn’t that mean that a ketogenic state is also acidic?"" While this is true, the safe state of ketosis is far less acidic than the state of ketoacidosis. For comparison, nutritional ketosis produces beta-hydroxybutyrate levels between about 0.5 and 3.0 mM. Contrast this with levels of 15-25 mM for ketoacidosis (, ). : Ketoacidosis and ketosis are two completely different states. Ketoacidosis occurs when your body lacks the insulin to regulate ketone production, leading to acidic blood.  So long as you have the insulin you need, you should not be risking ketoacidosis. Your body is very smart. On a low-carb diet, your insulin regulates the process of ketone production, and your ketogenic state remains healthy and stable. So far we have focused on explaining why ketosis isn’t bad for you. But now let’s take a moment to explore what it is for you. Research supports ketosis as a treatment for a broad array of health conditions (), including: Ketosis also has great benefits for patients suffering from epilepsy. For a child or adult suffering from epilepsy, eating LCHF can help to control seizures. According to the , around half of children who go on the ketogenic diet for epilepsy see a 50% or more reduction in their seizures. While most studies have focused on children (), the diet also has promising results for adults suffering from epilepsy (). This study mentions that the biggest obstacle to this treatment for adults is the high rate of attrition. Some patients find the too restrictive. While there are many apparent obstacles to low-carb, there are also solutions which can help dieters to stick with their new habits (more on this in a future article). So if you have epilepsy or any of the other health conditions listed, or believe you may be at risk, you are actually doing your body a favor by switching to a ketogenic state. On top of that, a ketogenic diet is excellent for weight loss (, , , ). As another bonus, you may feel fewer cravings while you are on a ketogenic diet. Ketosis may increase satiety (, ). For a more detailed look at the health benefits, check out ​what I wrote on the . Ketosis isn’t just a harmless metabolic state, it is a beneficial one. Switching to a ketogenic diet may help you treat or prevent a number of different diseases. ​Can Ketosis Ever Lead to Ketoacidosis or Otherwise Harm Your Health? Are there any documented cases of people developing ketoacidosis while on a low-carb diet? There are, but they are very rare, and there must be another risk factor present. There have been several cases of women breastfeeding on a low-carb diet developing ketoacidosis (, , ). The reality is though, the cases above are debatable. In one of them for example, the woman in question stated that she was suffering from severe loss of appetite, and ""barely consumed any food at all."" In other words, she may very well have been starving. The media of course got hold of this story and chose to emphasize her low-carb, high-fat diet instead of the fact that . With that in mind, you should of course proceed with caution if you decide to do low-carb high fat (LCHF) while or breastfeeding - it is always best to play it safe. But there is no reason to be afraid that a LCHF ketogenic diet will lead to ketoacidosis. You may think that you shouldn’t be experimenting with reducing your blood glucose levels. But low-carb has helped many patients with type 1 diabetes (, , ). Remember, it is high blood sugar plus high ketones in the blood that leads to ketoacidosis. Reducing blood sugar will not worsen the problem. However, diabetics should consult the doctor on their medication adjustments while on a ketogenic diet. Are there any other documented harmful effects? Some children with epilepsy have developed kidney stones while on a ketogenic diet (, , ). Again, ketosis leading to ketoacidosis is extremely rare, and should not happen in a healthy, non-breastfeeding person with sufficient insulin. Harmful effects of ketosis are incredibly rare and have so far only been reported in highly specific situations. You may want to avoid ketosis if you are breastfeeding, but there is no reason to panic about it. It is common for people switching to a low-carb diet to develop what is known colloquially as “low-carb flu.” This is a temporary state which typically lasts for a few weeks while your body adjusts to a ketogenic state. This state is characterized by symptoms such as fatigue, headache, and gastrointestinal disturbances (). Again, this state is nothing to be concerned about. Your body is undergoing a major metabolic shift, and it is normal for that process to be accompanied by some discomfort. Once your body adjusts, the symptoms should pass. Many people quit before they get to this point, and declare that low-carb was “bad” for them. Note that ketosis is not an optimum state for everyone - some people never take to it. But most do, so if you give it a chance and get through ""low-carb flu,"" you will probably come out the other side feeling better than ever. There are things you can do to shorten your experience of low-carb flu and reduce its intensity. and get extra electrolytes. Salt deficiency can cause low-carb flu symptoms, as can dehydration. You will be shedding excess water weight during this time, so it is important to replenish. Be sure you are getting sufficient energy. Remember, this is a diet, not simply “low-carb.” Fat is going to be your primary fuel source when you are ketogenic, so be sure you are eating enough of it. This is a tough psychological transition for many people who have been brought up to believe that fat is evil. Get your exercise. It is the last thing you will probably feel like doing, but it will increase your (, ). This in turn will help your body to adapt faster to a ketogenic state. Low-carb flu is a real, but it is a transitional state and does not indicate anything wrong in your body. It is neither unhealthy nor unsafe. A lot of people avoid trying a low-carb diet because they are afraid of ketosis, and that is a tragedy. Ketosis is the same thing as ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a dangerous, unstable metabolic state; ketosis is safe, natural healthy, and stable. So if you do decide to give low-carb a try, you should soon be feeling and functioning better than you ever have before. And remember, if you still feel unsure about ketosis, you can always try a low-carb diet that isn’t ketogenic!

However, they are still controversial. Before the discovery of insulin in 1921, doctors tried numerous types of diets, including diets with less than 10 grams of carbohydrate per day, to try to manage blood glucose levels in their patients with diabetes. For people with milder diabetes (the terms and were not yet used), a diet that was very low in carbohydrate and high in fat and calories could result in reasonably good health, sometimes for many years. But this diet was not helpful for people (particularly children) with severe diabetes. For them, it was found that cutting back severely on all food kept them alive longer, but their quality of life was low due to constant hunger and emaciation. Once injectable insulin was available, carbohydrate — and food generally — could be consumed in greater amounts. Over the years, recommendations from various health organizations have called for consuming a larger percentage of daily intake from carbohydrate based on research suggesting that high intakes of dietary cholesterol and saturated fat may lead to . Since people with diabetes are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, many dietitians and doctors began recommending low-fat, higher-carbohydrate diets for these patients. Currently, for example, , which is based on the is promoted as a healthy meal-planning tool for people with and without diabetes. The advise consuming 45 percent to 65 percent of one’s calories from carbohydrate (225–325 grams of carbohydrate on a 2,000-calorie diet). But individuals with diabetes have impaired carbohydrate metabolism and may struggle to achieve blood glucose and goals when following this advice. Up until recently, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) did not recommend carbohydrate-restricted diets, saying there was not enough evidence to support their safety or efficacy. In 2008, however, based on a study comparing a low-fat diet to a low-carbohydrate diet, the ADA changed its position, stating that either diet may be used for weight management purposes for up to one year and, more recently, two years. And in October 2013, the ADA issued a position statement on nutrition recommendations for people with diabetes in which carbohydrate restriction was listed as one of several eating patterns that could be used for diabetes management. Currently, however, many dietitians and recommend that their patients with diabetes base their meals on MyPlate, which specifies that half the plate contain higher-carbohydrate foods (fruits and grains), along with additional carbohydrate from a serving of dairy (unless cheese is selected as the dairy choice). Among the reasons dietitians give for not recommending low-carbohydrate diets are that such diets are too restrictive and difficult to maintain long term, that they are nutritionally inferior to higher-carbohydrate meal plans, or that they are dangerous because of the high fat content and reliance on (by-products of fat metabolism) as a source of energy. Some dietitians also feel strongly that people with diabetes should be able to eat the same foods as healthy people — including cake and other desserts on occasion — as long as they take enough insulin or oral diabetes medicine to prevent high blood glucose levels. What level of carbohydrate classifies a diet as low carbohydrate? Although there is no formal definition, an eating plan is generally considered “low carbohydrate” if it contains less than 130 grams per day, which is the amount of glucose needed to meet the brain’s energy needs. Fortunately, glucose is not the only fuel the brain can use. Most of the brain can also use ketone bodies, which, as mentioned earlier, are by-products of fat metabolism, as an alternative source of energy (as can many other tissues in the body). When carbohydrate intake is decreased, the liver responds by increasing ketone production. In addition to ketones, most organs can also use fatty acids for energy in place of glucose. For the few structures that cannot use ketones or fatty acids, the liver can make glucose from amino acids and other molecules in a process called gluconeogenesis, or “creating new glucose.” However, even very-low-carbohydrate diets typically provide a small amount of glucose. In most of the studies that have been conducted on carbohydrate restriction for diabetes, subjects consumed about 20–50 grams of carbohydrate per day. Nutritional ketosis, or the state of having elevated blood ketone levels, should not be confused with , a serious and potentially fatal condition that can occur in people with diabetes, particularly Type 1, in response to illness or other stressors. In diabetic ketoacidosis, the level of ketones in the blood is much higher than in nutritional ketosis, and blood glucose level is also extremely elevated as a result of insufficient insulin. Since carbohydrate is the nutrient primarily responsible for raising blood glucose, it follows that decreasing the amount eaten may lead to lower postmeal blood glucose levels among people with diabetes and (a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes). Indeed, Eric Westman, MD, and William Yancy, MD, of Duke University have conducted studies on very-low-carbohydrate diets in people with Type 2 diabetes in which as many as 95 percent of participants were able to discontinue or reduce their doses of oral diabetes medicines and insulin due to significant improvements in blood glucose control. There is research supporting carbohydrate restriction in the management of Type 1 diabetes as well. A team of researchers in Sweden led by Dr. Jorgen V. Nielsen found lower A1Cs, fewer incidents of (low blood glucose), and more favorable lipid (blood fat) profiles in subjects with Type 1 diabetes following a low-carbohydrate diet for up to four years. There are some early animal studies suggesting that certain — primarily — may be reversed with a very-low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein diet. Most low-carbohydrate diets contain more saturated fat than the ADA’s recommendation of less than 7 percent of total calories, and in the past this was thought to increase cardiovascular disease risk. But looking at new studies and revisiting older research suggests that saturated fat has been unfairly linked to heart disease. A recent review of 23 studies found no correlation between saturated fat intake and heart attacks, and other research indicates that rather than saturated fat plays the largest role in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. There is a growing body of research suggesting that restricting carbohydrate not only improves blood glucose control but also results in a more favorable lipid profile despite a higher percentage of calories from fat and saturated fat. Many people with diabetes, particularly those with Type 2, struggle to maintain a healthy body weight. Following a lower-carbohydrate diet often results in weight loss in addition to improvement in blood glucose control. In studies conducted within the past 10 years, carbohydrate-restricted diets have been found to be at least as effective as low-fat diets, if not more so, for weight loss. Richard K. Bernstein, MD, is a well-known advocate of carbohydrate restriction. Diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 1946 at age 12, he developed a very-low-carbohydrate diet in the early 1970s after years of struggling with large blood glucose fluctuations, vision problems, early kidney disease, and (nerve damage). He found that by consuming 30 grams of carbohydrate per day — 6 grams for breakfast and 12 grams each for lunch and dinner — and consequently needing only small amounts of insulin to “cover” such small amounts of carbohydrate, his blood glucose could kept in the normal range. Dr. Bernstein has continued to follow this regimen for the past 40 years and prescribes it to the patients he treats with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes at his practice in New York City. In his book he writes, “If the kinds of foods you’re eating give you consistently unpredictable blood glucose levels, then it will be impossible to normalize blood sugars.” To prevent such unpredictability, Dr. Bernstein recommends that dietary carbohydrate come only from nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, and other slow-digesting carbohydrate sources. Steven Parker, MD, is the author of Conquer Diabetes and Prediabetes: The Low-Carb Mediterranean Diet and owner of the . Both the book and website provide low-carbohydrate and ketogenic versions of the traditional Mediterranean diet. Parker’s low-carbohydrate version contains 60–100 grams of carbohydrate per day, and his ketogenic version 20–40 grams. The ketogenic version is so named because while some people develop higher blood ketone levels with a “regular” low-carbohydrate diet, many people need to keep their carbohydrate intake under 50 grams per day to see higher ketone levels. Dr. Parker does not treat people with diabetes on an outpatient basis, but he discusses low-carbohydrate eating plans with the patients he encounters in his job as a hospitalist in Scottsdale, Arizona. He believes carbohydrate restriction can play a valuable role in blood glucose control. And although he recognizes the effectiveness of Dr. Bernstein’s plan, Dr. Parker recommends 60–80 grams of net carbohydrate per day for long-term management because he feels it is more acceptable and easier to maintain. (Parker defines net carbohydrate as total carbohydrate minus grams of fiber.) Helen Hilts, MD, has been prescribing a low-carbohydrate diet to her patients with diabetes for several years. She is the medical director of the DiabeVita medical practice in Scottsdale, Arizona. After being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes nine years ago, she began following a very-low-carbohydrate diet based on her own research as well as a mentorship with Dr. Bernstein. “I have a few hundred patients who have followed a very-low-carbohydrate diet for at least two years,” she says. “I recommend no more than 30–45 grams of carbs a day, and those only come in low-carbohydrate vegetables, Greek yogurt, nuts, small portions of berries or tomatoes, etc. No roots, fruits, grains, or liquid milk.” Dr. Hilts follows the same eating plan and maintains an A1C under 5 percent without medication. “I see more doctors and diabetes educators reluctantly accepting very-low-carb as viable because they have seen such good results in their patients,” she says, noting that cardiologists seem to accept carbohydrate restriction faster than endocrinologists. “They understand carbohydrates’ effects on insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, lipids, and the metabolic syndrome.” After being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 1998, Keith Runyan, MD, had a difficult time controlling his blood glucose levels on the low-fat diet he was advised to follow. While preparing for his first Ironman triathlon in 2011, he began researching dietary strategies to keep his blood glucose stable for long periods. By February 2012, he had devised the very-low-carbohydrate, high-fat, whole-foods–based diet that he continues following today. Dr. Runyan says that he no longer has large blood glucose fluctuations and that hypoglycemia is now a very rare occurrence for him. In addition, he reports having better energy levels during endurance exercise, as well as overall. He recommends this way of eating for the patients with diabetes, obesity, and kidney disease seen in his St. Petersburg, Florida, medical office. It is important to speak with your physician or medical provider before starting a low-carbohydrate diet and to follow up frequently, particularly if you take insulin or insulin-stimulating oral medicines. These include (glipizide, glyburide, and glimepiride) and (repaglinide and nateglinide), along with combination medicines that contain these drugs. Once you have your health-care provider’s OK to try a low-carbohydrate meal plan, how low should you go? Even among advocates of carbohydrate restriction, there is no universal agreement as to the ideal amount of carbohydrate to consume. Most would agree that this varies somewhat from person to person. Generally speaking, most people on carbohydrate-restricted diets consume somewhere in the range of 30–100 grams of carbohydrate daily. How to count the fiber in the carbohydrate foods you consume is another area of debate. Some experts recommend counting all the fiber as digestible carbohydrate, while other recommend subtracting grams of indigestible fiber. Because certain types of fiber may have a small impact on blood glucose, while others do not, counting half the grams of fiber you consume as carbohydrate may be the most accurate method. To get all of the nutrients you need, it’s important to have a balance of fat, protein, and carbohydrate from plant and animal sources. Aim for whole foods rather than processed foods whenever possible. A typical dinner meal might consist of 4–6 ounces of grilled meat or fish, 2 cups of vegetables sauteed in olive oil, and half a cup of raspberries with whipped cream and chopped nuts for dessert. Typically people report being less hungry on a carbohydrate-restricted meal plan due to the satiety (feeling of fullness) provided by higher levels of fat and protein, but if hunger strikes between meals, a handful of nuts or a piece of string cheese are good, low-carbohydrate options. In the initial stage of a very-low-carbohydrate diet, dietary sodium needs are increased because the kidneys excrete larger amounts of this mineral. Therefore, the addition of 1–2 cups of broth (providing 1,000–2,000 milligrams of sodium) is recommended for people consuming less than 60 grams of carbohydrate per day, along with at least 64 ounces (8 cups) of water. However, increasing sodium and fluid may not be safe for people who are taking a diuretic drug for the treatment of or . People in this situation should speak with their doctor before increasing their sodium and fluid intake. To reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when adopting a low-carbohydrate diet, insulin or insulin-stimulating medicines will need to be reduced. Any medication adjustment should be done in coordination with a doctor, nurse practitioner, or other health-care professional. While it is important to be followed by a doctor or other medical professional, there are several websites that provide information as well as moral support to people with diabetes who chose to consume a carbohydrate-restricted diet, including and . Following a low-carbohydrate diet can result in improved blood glucose control for some, but it may not be right for all people with diabetes or prediabetes. Some people may find it too difficult to adhere to on a consistent basis. , an online diabetes community, provides a forum for its thousands of members to discuss various issues related to diabetes. Carbohydrate restriction is a perennial topic, with some members reporting that it is the only way they are able to control their blood glucose, and others stating that they actually do better with higher carbohydrate intake. Diabetes is an individualized disease, and a way of eating that works for one person may not work as well for another. Having a number of dietary options, including carbohydrate restriction, gives you the opportunity to try different approaches and find out what works well for you.

Thyroid disorders are very common in the general U.S. population, affecting up to 27 million Americans, although half that number remains undiagnosed. It is second only to as the most common condition to affect the endocrine system — a group of glands that secrete hormones that help regulate growth, reproduction, and nutrient use by cells. As a result, it is common for an individual to be affected by both thyroid disease and diabetes. Since the thyroid gland plays a central role in the regulation of metabolism, abnormal thyroid function can have a major impact on the control of diabetes. In addition, untreated thyroid disorder can increase the risk of certain and can aggravate many diabetes symptoms. Luckily, abnormal thyroid function can easily be diagnosed by simple blood tests, and effective treatment is available. For all of these reasons, periodic screening for thyroid disorder should be considered in all people with diabetes. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the neck, just below the Adam’s apple and above the collarbone. It produces two hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which enter the bloodstream and affect the metabolism of the , liver, muscles, and other organs. The thyroid gland operates as part of a feedback mechanism involving the hypothalamus, an area of the brain, and the pituitary gland, which is located within the brain. First, the hypothalamus sends a signal to the pituitary through a hormone called TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone). When the pituitary gland receives this signal, it releases TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) to the thyroid gland. Upon receiving TSH, the thyroid responds by producing and releasing the two thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). The pituitary gland “monitors” the level of thyroid hormone in the blood and increases or decreases the amount of TSH released, which in turns regulates the amount of thyroid hormone produced. Thyroid hormone regulates the way the body uses energy. It works by attaching to specific proteins called receptors that are present in cells throughout the human body. Therefore, thyroid hormone exerts wide-ranging effects in regulating the function of virtually every organ. Consequently, any changes in the blood level of thyroid hormone can affect many body systems and cause a wide range of symptoms. The extent to which each organ is affected varies widely between individuals, which is why thyroid dysfunction causes very different symptoms in different people. In general, the severity of symptoms of abnormal thyroid function depends on the severity of the actual condition, the length of time it has been present, and the person’s age. As a result, it is difficult to correctly diagnose thyroid disorder based only on symptoms. Fortunately, precise measurement of thyroid function is now possible with the TSH blood test, a test that directly measures the amount of TSH produced by the pituitary gland. There are two basic disorders of the thyroid: hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid gland, and hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid gland. The most common disorder of the thyroid is an underactive thyroid gland, or hypothyroidism. Some studies have shown that up to 10% of women and 3% of men in the United States have hypothyroidism and receive thyroxine replacement therapy. Although hypothyroidism can occur at any age and in either sex, it is most common in older women. It is estimated that up to 1 in 5 women over the age of 65 may have hypothyroidism. At the other end of the age range, 1 out of every 4,000 babies in the United States is born without a properly functioning thyroid (congenital hypothyroidism). (For more information about populations in which thyroid disorders are more likely, see ) The symptoms and effects of hypothyroidism can vary greatly depending on the age and sex of the affected individual. The lack of thyroid hormone in an infant with untreated congenital hypothyroidism may cause cretinism, a condition resulting in severe growth delay and mental retardation. Routine screening for hypothyroidism in all newborns by a heel prick blood test has decreased the incidence of cretinism. In older children, signs of hypothyroidism can include unexplained daytime fatigue, changes in school grades, difficulty concentrating, and inattentiveness in school. Sometimes, however, an unexplained change in growth rate is the only evidence of thyroid failure in children. In women of reproductive age, hypothyroidism can impair fertility and increase the risk of miscarriage during the second trimester. Other symptoms may include a goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland), fatigue, weight gain, mood swings, , dry skin, brittle hair, fluid retention, muscle weakness, and constipation. In the elderly, the symptoms can be very vague and are often mistaken for depression or dementia, since thyroid failure can cause sleep disturbance and poor memory. Worldwide, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is dietary iodine deficiency. However, since iodine has been added to salt and other foods in the United States, hypothyrodism caused by iodine deficiency is very rare among Americans. The most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States is an inherited autoimmune condition called Hashimoto thyroiditis, which affects up to 14 million people. Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body’s natural defenses against “foreign” or invading organisms begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. These natural defenses use proteins called antibodies. Hashimoto thyroiditis produces antibodies that damage the thyroid tissue, resulting in thyroid failure. Other common causes of hypothyroidism include the surgical removal of the thyroid, exposure to radiation such as radioactive iodine therapy, or external radiation used to treat some forms of cancer. Certain drugs such as lithium carbonate (for treatment of bipolar disorder) and amiodarone (brand names Cordarone, Nexterone, Pacerone, a drug prescribed for certain heart conditions) can cause hypothyroidism. Rarely, abnormalities of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland may result in hypothyroidism. Overactive thyroid, or hyperthyroidism, is less common than hypothyroidism. It tends to affect all age groups equally, but it is nine times more common in women. Like hypothyroidism, the symptoms of hyperthyroidism are varied and can be vague, particularly if the disease progresses slowly over a prolonged period. In children, it can result in accelerated growth, hyperactivity, loss of concentration, poor handwriting, and short-term memory loss. In young women, it may result in absent or irregular periods, recurrent miscarriages, and infertility. In older women, hyperthyroidism can cause hot flashes, mood swings, sweating, and weight changes, symptoms that may be confused with signs of menopause. Other typical symptoms of hyperthyroidism include irritability, fast heart rate, weight loss despite increased appetite, frequent bowel movements, insomnia, decreased energy level, and shaky hands. In addition, a goiter may be present. (To learn more about symptoms of thyroid disorders, see ) The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in people under age 40 is Graves disease, a type of autoimmune thyroid disease. In this case, the antibodies stimulate the thyroid to enlarge and overproduce thyroid hormone. Some people with Graves disease develop eye problems that can cause the eyes to protrude and that may threaten vision. Other causes of hyperthyroidism include thyroid nodules, which are overactive (usually noncancerous) growths in an otherwise normal thyroid gland, and thyroiditis, or inflammation of the thyroid gland. (See for more information about thyroid disorders.) People with diabetes have an increased risk of developing thyroid disorder. In the general population, approximately 6% of people have some form of thyroid disorder. However, the prevalence of thyroid disorder increases to over 10% in people with diabetes. Since people with one form of autoimmune disorder have an increased chance of developing other autoimmune disorders, people with Type 1 diabetes have a higher risk of autoimmune thyroid disorder. Up to 30% of women with Type 1 diabetes have some form of autoimmune thyroid disease. Postpartum thyroiditis, a form of autoimmune thyroid disease that causes thyroid dysfunction within a few months after delivery of a child, is three times more common in women with diabetes. Although Type 2 diabetes is not an autoimmune disorder, there have been many reports showing a higher occurrence of thyroid diseases, particularly hypothyroidism, among people with Type 2 diabetes. The association between Type 2 diabetes and thyroid disorder, however, remains unexplained. Since normal thyroid function is essential to regulate energy metabolism, abnormal thyroid function may have profound effects on blood glucose control in diabetes. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can affect the course of diabetes, but their effects are somewhat different. Hyperthyroidism is typically associated with worsening blood glucose control and increased insulin requirements. The excessive thyroid hormone causes increased glucose production in the liver, rapid absorption of glucose through the intestines, and increased (a condition in which the body does not use insulin efficiently). It may be important to consider underlying thyroid disorder if a person has unexplained weight loss, deterioration in blood glucose control, or increased requirements. Sometimes hyperthyroidism may even unmask latent diabetes. Having diabetes increases a person’s risk for heart disease, and many people with diabetes have a heart condition such as coronary heart disease or heart failure. Since hyperthyroidism causes rapid heart rate and increases the risk of abnormal heart rhythm, it may also bring on angina (chest pain), worsen heart failure or interfere with the treatment of heart failure, as well as further increase the risk of other heart problems. Prolonged, untreated hyperthyroidism can cause excessive bone loss, leading to , or bone thinning. Osteoporosis raises the risk of bone fractures, making falling much more dangerous. People with diabetes who have peripheral are at an increased risk for falls due to poor foot sensation and sometimes loss of or loss of the stimuli that tell the brain where a body part is in space, in relation to other objects. Therefore, the combination of hyperthyroidism and diabetes, particularly when neuropathy is present, increases the risk of fractures that may result in disability, especially in the elderly. Hypothyroidism rarely causes significant changes in blood glucose control, although it can reduce the clearance of insulin from the bloodstream, so the dose of insulin may be reduced. More important, hypothyroidism is accompanied by a variety of abnormalities in blood lipid levels. This includes increased total and LDL (low-density lipoprotein or “bad”) cholesterol levels, and increased levels. The abnormal lipid pattern typical of Type 2 diabetes (low HDL, or “good” cholesterol; high triglycerides; and a high proportion of small, dense LDL particles) is usually worsened by hypothyroidism. These changes further raise the already high risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and among people with diabetes. Pregnancy-related thyroid dysfunction is three times more common in women with diabetes and should be anticipated in every pregnant woman with Type 1 diabetes. Postpartum thyroiditis may cause fluctuating thyroid hormone levels in the months following delivery. In addition to symptoms such as fatigue, depression (the “baby blues”), irritability, and heart palpitations, blood glucose control and insulin requirements may be affected during this period of thyroid dysfunction and profound reproductive hormonal changes. Continued monitoring of thyroid function is necessary in all women who experience postpartum thyroiditis, since roughly one-third will develop permanent hypothyroidism within three to four years and will require thyroxine replacement. Women who have diagnosed hypothyroidism and already take thyroxine before pregnancy often need to increase the dose of thyroxine during pregnancy. Adequate thyroxine replacement is vital for the baby’s neurological development. Women with active Graves disease may enter a period of remission during pregnancy, when the disease becomes less active, but they can expect a recurrence following delivery. If hyperthyroidism is poorly controlled during pregnancy, the risk of maternal complications such as preeclampsia (a serious condition characterized by high blood pressure) and fetal problems such as prematurity increases. The maintenance of normal thyroid function and is therefore of utmost importance during pregnancy to ensure a successful outcome. As mentioned earlier, the diagnosis of abnormal thyroid function based solely on symptoms can be difficult. In people with diabetes, it may be even more difficult because of the complex interrelationships of thyroid function and diabetes. Both chronically high blood glucose and hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss despite good appetite, weakness, and fatigue. Likewise, severe can produce symptoms such as swelling, weight gain, and hypertension, which may be confused with hypothyroidism. The most reliable method used to diagnose thyroid disease is the simple, relatively inexpensive, yet highly sensitive TSH blood test. This test measures directly the amount of TSH produced by the pituitary gland. Since the pituitary is the first organ to recognize abnormal thyroid function, testing its function is the most sensitive way to monitor thyroid function. In addition to diagnosis, the TSH test is also used to monitor and adjust the dosage of thyroxine therapy. Before the introduction of the TSH test in the late 1960s, blood tests for thyroid function measured only the levels of the thyroid hormones, T3 and T4. However, these hormone levels can appear relatively normal even when the thyroid is not functioning normally, because the pituitary gland will compensate for thyroid dysfunction. When the thyroid starts to fail (a sign of early hypothyroidism), the pituitary responds by producing higher levels of TSH to stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormones, thereby maintaining normal circulating T3 and T4 levels. Conversely, when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone (a sign of early hyperthyroidism), the pituitary responds by producing less TSH, thereby reducing T3 and T4 production from the thyroid. Therefore, prior to any changes in the thyroid hormone levels, there is a detectable change in the TSH level, which indicates abnormal thyroid function. A normal TSH level ranges from 0.4 mU/ml to 4.0 mU/ml (microunits per milliliter). A below-normal TSH level indicates hyperthyroidism, and an above-normal TSH level indicates hypothyroidism. An elevated TSH level accompanied by normal thyroid hormone levels is known as subclinical hypothyroidism. People with subclinical hypothyroidism often do not have any symptoms. However, they do face the increased risks of cardiovascular disease associated with hypothyroidism, due to the abnormalities in blood lipid levels. Some doctors have even suggested that a TSH level in the upper-normal range (2.5–4.0 mU/ml) should be considered as evolving thyroid failure. Thyroid antibodies that are produced in autoimmune thyroid diseases can also be measured by blood testing. The presence of these antibodies can help determine the underlying cause of thyroid disorder. The most specific antibody test is called the anti-TPO antibody test. Nearly all thyroid diseases are treatable. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism often require long-term or lifelong treatment, depending on the specifics of the diagnosis. The treatment for hypothyroidism is to replace the missing thyroid hormone. The most common form of thyroid hormone is a synthetic derivative, levothyroxine, which is usually taken as one pill daily. This is a simple yet very effective treatment of hypothyroidism. Once the treatment is started, TSH testing every two or three months is necessary to adjust to the correct dose. When a stable dose is achieved, annual TSH testing is generally adequate for monitoring purposes. The symptoms of hypothyroidism may take several months of therapy to resolve. Often, lifelong treatment is necessary. Natural thyroid extract derived from animal sources is a less commonly used form of thyroid replacement and has the disadvantage of inconsistent dosage that varies from one batch of pills to another. Certain supplements, including supplements, calcium supplements, and that contain iron or calcium, can interfere with the absorption of thyroxine. For this reason, these pills should be taken at least two hours apart from thyroxine. In addition, it’s a good idea to let your physician know of any supplements or other medicines you take in addition to levothyroxine. There are several options for treatment of hyperthyroidism, with the choice dependent on the cause of the disorder; it must be individually determined. Long-term oral antithyroid medicines such as methimazole (Tapazole) and propylthiouracil (PTU) are effective in controlling the production of thyroid hormone. Regular blood test monitoring is necessary throughout the course of treatment. Radioactive iodine therapy is the most common treatment used in the United States for hyperthyroidism. It has a very high cure rate but often results in permanent hypothyroidism. Surgery offers an alternative, particularly in people with very large goiters. All these treatments are effective in controlling or curing hyperthyroidism. Abnormal thyroid function can have a major impact on diabetes control and increase a person’s risk of developing diabetic complications. Because of the complications that can result from untreated thyroid disorder, regular screening is recommended to allow early detection and treatment. For people with Type 1 diabetes, annual screening is advisable. For people with Type 2 diabetes, screening should be done at the time of diagnosis and then repeated every five years thereafter. The frequency of screening should increase with advancing age, since the incidence of thyroid disorder increases with age. For people over the age of 60, annual screening is recommended.

The thyroid gland operates as part of a feedback mechanism involving the hypothalamus, an area of the brain, and the pituitary gland, which is located within the brain. First, the hypothalamus sends a signal to the pituitary through a hormone called TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone). When the pituitary gland receives this signal, it releases TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) to the thyroid gland. Upon receiving TSH, the thyroid responds by producing and releasing the two thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). The pituitary gland “monitors” the level of thyroid hormone in the blood and increases or decreases the amount of TSH released, which in turns regulates the amount of thyroid hormone produced. Thyroid hormone regulates the way the body uses energy. It works by attaching to specific proteins called receptors that are present in cells throughout the human body. Therefore, thyroid hormone exerts wide-ranging effects in regulating the function of virtually every organ. Consequently, any changes in the blood level of thyroid hormone can affect many body systems and cause a wide range of symptoms. The extent to which each organ is affected varies widely between individuals, which is why thyroid dysfunction causes very different symptoms in different people. In general, the severity of symptoms of abnormal thyroid function depends on the severity of the actual condition, the length of time it has been present, and the person’s age. As a result, it is difficult to correctly diagnose thyroid disorder based only on symptoms. Fortunately, precise measurement of thyroid function is now possible with the TSH blood test, a test that directly measures the amount of TSH produced by the pituitary gland. There are two basic disorders of the thyroid: hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid gland, and hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid gland. The most common disorder of the thyroid is an underactive thyroid gland, or hypothyroidism. Some studies have shown that up to 10% of women and 3% of men in the United States have hypothyroidism and receive thyroxine replacement therapy. Although hypothyroidism can occur at any age and in either sex, it is most common in older women. It is estimated that up to 1 in 5 women over the age of 65 may have hypothyroidism. At the other end of the age range, 1 out of every 4,000 babies in the United States is born without a properly functioning thyroid (congenital hypothyroidism). (For more information about populations in which thyroid disorders are more likely, see ) The symptoms and effects of hypothyroidism can vary greatly depending on the age and sex of the affected individual. The lack of thyroid hormone in an infant with untreated congenital hypothyroidism may cause cretinism, a condition resulting in severe growth delay and mental retardation. Routine screening for hypothyroidism in all newborns by a heel prick blood test has decreased the incidence of cretinism. In older children, signs of hypothyroidism can include unexplained daytime fatigue, changes in school grades, difficulty concentrating, and inattentiveness in school. Sometimes, however, an unexplained change in growth rate is the only evidence of thyroid failure in children. In women of reproductive age, hypothyroidism can impair fertility and increase the risk of miscarriage during the second trimester. Other symptoms may include a goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland), fatigue, weight gain, mood swings, , dry skin, brittle hair, fluid retention, muscle weakness, and constipation. In the elderly, the symptoms can be very vague and are often mistaken for depression or dementia, since thyroid failure can cause sleep disturbance and poor memory. Worldwide, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is dietary iodine deficiency. However, since iodine has been added to salt and other foods in the United States, hypothyrodism caused by iodine deficiency is very rare among Americans. The most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States is an inherited autoimmune condition called Hashimoto thyroiditis, which affects up to 14 million people. Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body’s natural defenses against “foreign” or invading organisms begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. These natural defenses use proteins called antibodies. Hashimoto thyroiditis produces antibodies that damage the thyroid tissue, resulting in thyroid failure. Other common causes of hypothyroidism include the surgical removal of the thyroid, exposure to radiation such as radioactive iodine therapy, or external radiation used to treat some forms of cancer. Certain drugs such as lithium carbonate (for treatment of bipolar disorder) and amiodarone (brand names Cordarone, Nexterone, Pacerone, a drug prescribed for certain heart conditions) can cause hypothyroidism. Rarely, abnormalities of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland may result in hypothyroidism. Overactive thyroid, or hyperthyroidism, is less common than hypothyroidism. It tends to affect all age groups equally, but it is nine times more common in women. Like hypothyroidism, the symptoms of hyperthyroidism are varied and can be vague, particularly if the disease progresses slowly over a prolonged period. In children, it can result in accelerated growth, hyperactivity, loss of concentration, poor handwriting, and short-term memory loss. In young women, it may result in absent or irregular periods, recurrent miscarriages, and infertility. In older women, hyperthyroidism can cause hot flashes, mood swings, sweating, and weight changes, symptoms that may be confused with signs of menopause. Other typical symptoms of hyperthyroidism include irritability, fast heart rate, weight loss despite increased appetite, frequent bowel movements, insomnia, decreased energy level, and shaky hands. In addition, a goiter may be present. (To learn more about symptoms of thyroid disorders, see ) The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in people under age 40 is Graves disease, a type of autoimmune thyroid disease. In this case, the antibodies stimulate the thyroid to enlarge and overproduce thyroid hormone. Some people with Graves disease develop eye problems that can cause the eyes to protrude and that may threaten vision. Other causes of hyperthyroidism include thyroid nodules, which are overactive (usually noncancerous) growths in an otherwise normal thyroid gland, and thyroiditis, or inflammation of the thyroid gland. (See for more information about thyroid disorders.) People with diabetes have an increased risk of developing thyroid disorder. In the general population, approximately 6% of people have some form of thyroid disorder. However, the prevalence of thyroid disorder increases to over 10% in people with diabetes. Since people with one form of autoimmune disorder have an increased chance of developing other autoimmune disorders, people with Type 1 diabetes have a higher risk of autoimmune thyroid disorder. Up to 30% of women with Type 1 diabetes have some form of autoimmune thyroid disease. Postpartum thyroiditis, a form of autoimmune thyroid disease that causes thyroid dysfunction within a few months after delivery of a child, is three times more common in women with diabetes. Although Type 2 diabetes is not an autoimmune disorder, there have been many reports showing a higher occurrence of thyroid diseases, particularly hypothyroidism, among people with Type 2 diabetes. The association between Type 2 diabetes and thyroid disorder, however, remains unexplained. Since normal thyroid function is essential to regulate energy metabolism, abnormal thyroid function may have profound effects on blood glucose control in diabetes. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can affect the course of diabetes, but their effects are somewhat different. Hyperthyroidism is typically associated with worsening blood glucose control and increased insulin requirements. The excessive thyroid hormone causes increased glucose production in the liver, rapid absorption of glucose through the intestines, and increased (a condition in which the body does not use insulin efficiently). It may be important to consider underlying thyroid disorder if a person has unexplained weight loss, deterioration in blood glucose control, or increased requirements. Sometimes hyperthyroidism may even unmask latent diabetes. Having diabetes increases a person’s risk for heart disease, and many people with diabetes have a heart condition such as coronary heart disease or heart failure. Since hyperthyroidism causes rapid heart rate and increases the risk of abnormal heart rhythm, it may also bring on angina (chest pain), worsen heart failure or interfere with the treatment of heart failure, as well as further increase the risk of other heart problems. Prolonged, untreated hyperthyroidism can cause excessive bone loss, leading to , or bone thinning. Osteoporosis raises the risk of bone fractures, making falling much more dangerous. People with diabetes who have peripheral are at an increased risk for falls due to poor foot sensation and sometimes loss of or loss of the stimuli that tell the brain where a body part is in space, in relation to other objects. Therefore, the combination of hyperthyroidism and diabetes, particularly when neuropathy is present, increases the risk of fractures that may result in disability, especially in the elderly. Hypothyroidism rarely causes significant changes in blood glucose control, although it can reduce the clearance of insulin from the bloodstream, so the dose of insulin may be reduced. More important, hypothyroidism is accompanied by a variety of abnormalities in blood lipid levels. This includes increased total and LDL (low-density lipoprotein or “bad”) cholesterol levels, and increased levels. The abnormal lipid pattern typical of Type 2 diabetes (low HDL, or “good” cholesterol; high triglycerides; and a high proportion of small, dense LDL particles) is usually worsened by hypothyroidism. These changes further raise the already high risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and among people with diabetes. Pregnancy-related thyroid dysfunction is three times more common in women with diabetes and should be anticipated in every pregnant woman with Type 1 diabetes. Postpartum thyroiditis may cause fluctuating thyroid hormone levels in the months following delivery. In addition to symptoms such as fatigue, depression (the “baby blues”), irritability, and heart palpitations, blood glucose control and insulin requirements may be affected during this period of thyroid dysfunction and profound reproductive hormonal changes. Continued monitoring of thyroid function is necessary in all women who experience postpartum thyroiditis, since roughly one-third will develop permanent hypothyroidism within three to four years and will require thyroxine replacement. Women who have diagnosed hypothyroidism and already take thyroxine before pregnancy often need to increase the dose of thyroxine during pregnancy. Adequate thyroxine replacement is vital for the baby’s neurological development. Women with active Graves disease may enter a period of remission during pregnancy, when the disease becomes less active, but they can expect a recurrence following delivery. If hyperthyroidism is poorly controlled during pregnancy, the risk of maternal complications such as preeclampsia (a serious condition characterized by high blood pressure) and fetal problems such as prematurity increases. The maintenance of normal thyroid function and is therefore of utmost importance during pregnancy to ensure a successful outcome. As mentioned earlier, the diagnosis of abnormal thyroid function based solely on symptoms can be difficult. In people with diabetes, it may be even more difficult because of the complex interrelationships of thyroid function and diabetes. Both chronically high blood glucose and hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss despite good appetite, weakness, and fatigue. Likewise, severe can produce symptoms such as swelling, weight gain, and hypertension, which may be confused with hypothyroidism. The most reliable method used to diagnose thyroid disease is the simple, relatively inexpensive, yet highly sensitive TSH blood test. This test measures directly the amount of TSH produced by the pituitary gland. Since the pituitary is the first organ to recognize abnormal thyroid function, testing its function is the most sensitive way to monitor thyroid function. In addition to diagnosis, the TSH test is also used to monitor and adjust the dosage of thyroxine therapy. Before the introduction of the TSH test in the late 1960s, blood tests for thyroid function measured only the levels of the thyroid hormones, T3 and T4. However, these hormone levels can appear relatively normal even when the thyroid is not functioning normally, because the pituitary gland will compensate for thyroid dysfunction. When the thyroid starts to fail (a sign of early hypothyroidism), the pituitary responds by producing higher levels of TSH to stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormones, thereby maintaining normal circulating T3 and T4 levels. Conversely, when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone (a sign of early hyperthyroidism), the pituitary responds by producing less TSH, thereby reducing T3 and T4 production from the thyroid. Therefore, prior to any changes in the thyroid hormone levels, there is a detectable change in the TSH level, which indicates abnormal thyroid function. A normal TSH level ranges from 0.4 mU/ml to 4.0 mU/ml (microunits per milliliter). A below-normal TSH level indicates hyperthyroidism, and an above-normal TSH level indicates hypothyroidism. An elevated TSH level accompanied by normal thyroid hormone levels is known as subclinical hypothyroidism. People with subclinical hypothyroidism often do not have any symptoms. However, they do face the increased risks of cardiovascular disease associated with hypothyroidism, due to the abnormalities in blood lipid levels. Some doctors have even suggested that a TSH level in the upper-normal range (2.5–4.0 mU/ml) should be considered as evolving thyroid failure. Thyroid antibodies that are produced in autoimmune thyroid diseases can also be measured by blood testing. The presence of these antibodies can help determine the underlying cause of thyroid disorder. The most specific antibody test is called the anti-TPO antibody test. Nearly all thyroid diseases are treatable. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism often require long-term or lifelong treatment, depending on the specifics of the diagnosis. The treatment for hypothyroidism is to replace the missing thyroid hormone. The most common form of thyroid hormone is a synthetic derivative, levothyroxine, which is usually taken as one pill daily. This is a simple yet very effective treatment of hypothyroidism. Once the treatment is started, TSH testing every two or three months is necessary to adjust to the correct dose. When a stable dose is achieved, annual TSH testing is generally adequate for monitoring purposes. The symptoms of hypothyroidism may take several months of therapy to resolve. Often, lifelong treatment is necessary. Natural thyroid extract derived from animal sources is a less commonly used form of thyroid replacement and has the disadvantage of inconsistent dosage that varies from one batch of pills to another. Certain supplements, including supplements, calcium supplements, and that contain iron or calcium, can interfere with the absorption of thyroxine. For this reason, these pills should be taken at least two hours apart from thyroxine. In addition, it’s a good idea to let your physician know of any supplements or other medicines you take in addition to levothyroxine. There are several options for treatment of hyperthyroidism, with the choice dependent on the cause of the disorder; it must be individually determined. Long-term oral antithyroid medicines such as methimazole (Tapazole) and propylthiouracil (PTU) are effective in controlling the production of thyroid hormone. Regular blood test monitoring is necessary throughout the course of treatment. Radioactive iodine therapy is the most common treatment used in the United States for hyperthyroidism. It has a very high cure rate but often results in permanent hypothyroidism. Surgery offers an alternative, particularly in people with very large goiters. All these treatments are effective in controlling or curing hyperthyroidism. Abnormal thyroid function can have a major impact on diabetes control and increase a person’s risk of developing diabetic complications. Because of the complications that can result from untreated thyroid disorder, regular screening is recommended to allow early detection and treatment. For people with Type 1 diabetes, annual screening is advisable. For people with Type 2 diabetes, screening should be done at the time of diagnosis and then repeated every five years thereafter. The frequency of screening should increase with advancing age, since the incidence of thyroid disorder increases with age. For people over the age of 60, annual screening is recommended.

2db227a9-2121-40bb-b45e-ffd2316ab2f2,"— Low-carb and diets are extremely popular. These diets have been around for a long time, and share similarities with (). Research has shown that lower-carb diets can and improve various health markers (). However, the evidence on muscle growth, strength and performance is mixed (, , ). This article takes a detailed look at low-carb/ketogenic diets and physical performance. The guidelines for a vary between studies and authorities. In research, low-carb is usually classified as less than 30% of calories from (, ). Most average low-carb diets consist of 50–150 grams of carbs per day, a fairly high amount of and a moderate-to-high fat intake. Yet for some athletes, “low-carb” can still mean over 200 grams of carbs per day. In contrast, a well-formulated ketogenic diet is more restrictive, usually consisting of only 30–50 grams of carbs per day, combined with a very high fat intake (). This extremely low carb intake helps you achieve ketosis, a process where ketones and fat become the main sources of energy for the body and brain (). There are several versions of the ketogenic diet, including: This is an extremely low-carb, moderate-protein, high-fat diet. It typically contains 75% fat, 20% protein and 5% carbs (). This diet involves periods of higher-carb refeeds, such as 5 ketogenic days followed by 2 high-carb days. This diet allows you to add carbs, usually around periods of intense exercise or workouts. The pie charts below show the typical nutrient breakdown of a low-fat Western diet, a low-carb diet and a typical ketogenic diet: In most low-carb and ketogenic diets, people restrict food sources like , rice, beans, , sweets, and . An alternative approach is , where high-carb periods or refeeds are included regularly in a low-carb or ketogenic diet. A low-carb diet usually consists of a higher protein intake with less than 30% of calories from carbs. Ketogenic diets are very high in fat, moderate in protein and contain almost no carbs. During a low-carb or ketogenic diet, the body becomes more efficient at using fat as fuel, a process known as fat adaptation. The drastic reduction in carbs causes a rise in ketones, which are produced in the liver from fatty acids (). Ketones can provide energy in the absence of carbs, during a prolonged , during long exercise periods or for people with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (, , ). Even the brain can be partly fueled by ketones (). The remaining energy is provided by gluconeogenesis, a process where the body breaks down fats and proteins, converting them into carbs (glucose) (). Ketogenic diets and ketones have many beneficial properties. They are even being used to , neurological diseases, cancer and risk factors for heart and respiratory diseases (, , ). The fat adaptation on a ketogenic diet can be very powerful. One recent study in ultra-endurance athletes found that a ketogenic group burned up to in a 3-hour exercise session (). Yet although low-carb and ketogenic diets provide , there is an ongoing debate about how these diets affect exercise performance (, ). In the absence of carbs, your body burns fat for energy. This mainly occurs by increased fat oxidation and the production of ketones. Dietary carbs are broken down into glucose, which turns into blood sugar and provides the main fuel for moderate and high-intensity exercise (). For several decades, research has repeatedly shown that eating carbs can help with exercise performance, especially endurance exercise (). Unfortunately, the human body can only store enough carbs (glycogen) for around 2 hours of exercise. After this time, fatigue, tiredness and decreased endurance performance may occur. This is known as “hitting the wall” or “bonking” (, , ). To counter this, most endurance athletes now consume a diet, “carb up” the day before a race and consume carb supplements or food during exercise. However, low-carb diets don’t contain a lot of carbs, and therefore don’t help optimize the reserves of stored glycogen in the muscles. Stored carbs provide an efficient energy source for exercise lasting up to 2 hours. After this time, energy output and endurance performance usually decrease. Research has been done on the use of fat as fuel in sports performance (). During exercise, fat provides more energy at lower intensities and carbs provide more energy at higher intensities. This is known as the “crossover effect,” which is illustrated below (): Recently, researchers wanted to see if a low-carb diet could alter this effect (, ). Their study found that ketogenic athletes burned mostly fat at up to 70% of max intensity, vs only 55% in the high-carb athletes. In fact, the ketogenic athletes in this study burned the most fat in a research setting (). Yet despite these positive findings, fat may be unable to produce energy fast enough to meet the demands of the muscles of elite athletes (, , ). Therefore, more research is needed in an athletic population before any firm recommendations can be made. Nevertheless, studies have found that low-carb diets can help prevent tiredness during prolonged exercise. They may also help you and improve health, without compromising low-to-moderate intensity exercise performance (, , ). Furthermore, these diets can teach your body to burn more fat, which may help you preserve muscle glycogen during exercise (). A low-carb diet is likely to be just fine for most people exercising at low-to-moderate intensities. However, more research is needed for high-level athletes. As of now, no research has shown that low-carb or ketogenic diets are better for high-intensity, strength or power-based sports. This is because carbs aid muscle growth and high-intensity exercise performance in several ways: Carbs may help with recovery after exercise (). Carbs also produce , which helps with nutrient delivery and absorption (). Carbs play an important role in the anaerobic and ATP energy systems, which are the primary fuel sources for high-intensity exercise (). Carbs and insulin help reduce muscle breakdown, which may improve net protein balance (, ). Carbs also improve neural drive, resistance to fatigue and mental focus during exercise (). However, this doesn’t mean your diet must be very high in carbs, like a typical Western diet. A moderate-carb or carb cycling diet may work well for most sports./p> In fact, a moderate-carb, higher-protein diet seems to be optimal for muscle growth and body composition for people who are lean and active (). Carbs play an important role in muscle growth and high-intensity exercise performance. There is no research showing low-carb diets to be superior for this. Several studies have looked into the effects of low-carb diets on high-intensity endurance exercise. One study found no difference between the ketogenic and high-carb groups for high-intensity sprints. Yet the ketogenic group did get less tired during low-intensity biking, which is probably because the body used more fat for fuel (). Other studies have shown that people on low-carb diets can spare muscle glycogen and use more fat as fuel, which could be beneficial for ultra-endurance sports (). Nevertheless, these findings have less relevance for athletes performing high-intensity exercise or workouts of less than 2 hours. The research is also mixed in obese populations, with some studies showing benefits in lower-intensity aerobic exercise, while others show a negative effect (, ). Some studies have found that individual response may vary as well. For example, one study found that some athletes achieved better endurance performance, while others experienced drastic decreases (). At the present time, the research does not show that a low-carb or ketogenic diet can improve high-intensity sports performance, compared to a higher-carb diet. Yet for lower-intensity exercise, a low-carb diet can match a conventional high-carb diet and even help you use more fat as fuel (). Low-carb and ketogenic diets do not seem to benefit high-intensity exercise performance. However, these diets seem to match high-carb diets when it comes to lower-intensity exercise. One beneficial aspect of a low-carb or ketogenic diet is that it teaches the body to burn fat as fuel (). For endurance athletes, research has shown that this can help preserve glycogen stores and keep you from “hitting the wall” during endurance exercises (, ). This helps you rely less on carbs during a race, which could be important for athletes who struggle to digest and consume carbs during exercise. It may also be beneficial during ultra-endurance events where access to food is limited (). Additionally, several studies have shown that low-carb and ketogenic diets can help people lose weight and improve overall health (, ). Fat loss can also improve your fat to muscle ratio, which is extremely important for exercise performance, especially in weight-dependent sports (, ). Exercising with low glycogen stores has also become a popular training technique, known as “train low, compete high” (). This can improve fat utilization, mitochondria function and enzyme activity, which have a beneficial role in health and exercise performance (). For this reason, following a low-carb diet for a short period of time — such as during an “off season” — may aid long-term performance and health. Low-carb diets may be useful for some types of endurance exercise. They can also be used strategically to improve body composition and health. Low-carb or ketogenic diets can be a good choice for healthy people who are mostly exercising and lifting to stay healthy. However, there is currently no solid evidence that they improve performance over higher-carb diets in athletes. That being said, the research is still in its infancy, and some early results suggest that they can be a good choice for low-intensity exercise or ultra-endurance exercise.

In the United Kingdom, about 4% of people with type 1 diabetes develop DKA each year, while in the condition affects about 25% of type 1 diabetics a year. DKA was first described in 1886 and, until the introduction of insulin therapy in the 1920s, it was almost universally fatal. The risk of death with adequate and timely treatment is around 1–4%. The symptoms of an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis usually evolve over a period of about 24 hours. Predominant symptoms are and vomiting, pronounced thirst, and that may be severe. In severe DKA, breathing becomes rapid and of a deep, gasping character, called """". The abdomen may be tender to the point that a may be suspected, such as , or .

Small children with DKA are relatively prone to , also called cerebral edema, which may cause headache, coma, loss of the , and can progress to death. It occurs in about 1 out of 100 children with DKA and more rarely occurs in adults. DKA most frequently occurs in those who know they have diabetes, but it may also be the first presentation in someone who had not previously been known to be diabetic. There is often a particular underlying problem that has led to the DKA episode; this may be intercurrent illness (, , , a ), , inadequate insulin administration (e.g. defective insulin pen device), (heart attack), or the use of . Young people with recurrent episodes of DKA may have an underlying , or may be using insufficient insulin for fear that it will cause . Diabetic ketoacidosis may occur in those previously known to have diabetes mellitus type 2 or in those who on further investigations turn out to have features of type 2 diabetes (e.g. , strong ); this is more common in African, African-American and Hispanic people. Their condition is then labeled ""ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes"". Drugs in the class ( inhibitors), which are generally used for type 2 diabetes, have been associated with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars may not be significantly elevated (""euglycemic DKA""). While this is a relatively uncommon adverse event, it is thought to be more common if someone receiving an SGLT2 inhibitor who is also receiving insulin has reduced or missed insulin doses. Furthermore it can be triggered by severe acute illness, dehydration, extensive exercise, surgery, low-carbohydrate diets, or excessive alcohol intake. SGLT2 inhibitors should be stopped before surgery and only recommenced when it is safe to do so. SGLT2 inhibitors may be used in people with type 1 diabetes, but the possibility of ketoacidosis requires specific risk management. Specifically, they should not be used if someone is also using a or . Diabetic ketoacidosis arises because of a lack of insulin in the body. The lack of insulin and corresponding elevation of leads to increased release of glucose by the (a process that is normally suppressed by insulin) from via and also through . High glucose levels spill over into the urine, taking water and solutes (such as and ) along with it in a process known as . This leads to , dehydration, and . The absence of insulin also leads to the release of free from (), which are converted through a process called , again in the liver, into ketone bodies ( and ). β-Hydroxybutyrate can serve as an energy source in the absence of insulin-mediated glucose delivery, and is a protective mechanism in case of starvation. The ketone bodies, however, have a low and therefore turn the blood acidic (). The body initially the change with the , but this system is quickly overwhelmed and other mechanisms must work to compensate for the acidosis. One such mechanism is to lower the blood levels (a form of compensatory ). This hyperventilation, in its extreme form, may be observed as . In various situations such as infection, insulin demands rise but are not matched by the failing pancreas. Blood sugars rise, dehydration ensues, and increases further by way of a . As a result of the above mechanisms, the average adult with DKA has a total body water shortage of about 6 liters (or 100 mL/kg), in addition to substantial shortages in sodium, , , , and . Glucose levels usually exceed 13.8 mmol/L or 250 mg/dL. (the conjugate base of β-hydroxybutyric acid, drawn above) despite chemically containing a carboxylate group instead of a ketone, is the principal ""ketone body"" in diabetic ketoacidosis. DKA is common in type 1 diabetes as this form of diabetes is associated with an absolute lack of insulin production by the . In type 2 diabetes, insulin production is present but is insufficient to meet the body's requirements as a result of end-organ insulin resistance. Usually, these amounts of insulin are sufficient to suppress ketogenesis. If DKA occurs in someone with type 2 diabetes, their condition is called ""ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes"". The exact mechanism for this phenomenon is unclear, but there is evidence both of impaired insulin secretion and insulin action. Once the condition has been treated, insulin production resumes and often the person may be able to resume diet or tablet treatment as normally recommended in type 2 diabetes. The clinical state of DKA is associated, in addition to the above, with the release of various such as and as well as , the latter of which leads to increased markers of , even in the absence of . Cerebral edema, which is the most dangerous DKA complication, is probably the result of a number of factors. Some authorities suggest that it is the result from overvigorous fluid replacement, but the complication may develop before treatment has been commenced. It is more likely in those with more severe DKA, and in the first episode of DKA. Likely factors in the development of cerebral edema are dehydration, acidosis and low carbon dioxide levels; in addition, the increased level of inflammation and may, together with these factors, lead to decreased blood flow to parts of the brain, which then swells up once fluid replacement has been commenced. The swelling of brain tissue leads to raised ultimately leading to death. Diabetic ketoacidosis may be diagnosed when the combination of (high blood sugars), ketones in the blood or on and acidosis are demonstrated. In about 10% of cases the blood sugar is not significantly elevated (""euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis""). A pH measurement is usually performed to detect acidosis either on blood from a or artery. Subsequent venous pH measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may also be taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones can be measured in the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need for admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise. In addition to the above, blood samples are usually taken to measure and (measures of , which may be impaired in DKA as a result of dehydration) and electrolytes. Furthermore, markers of infection (, ) and ( and ) may be measured. Given the need to exclude infection, and urinalysis are usually performed. If cerebral edema is suspected because of confusion, recurrent vomiting or other symptoms, may be performed to assess its severity and to exclude other causes such as . Diabetic ketoacidosis is distinguished from other diabetic emergencies by the presence of large amounts of ketones in blood and urine, and marked metabolic acidosis. (HHS, sometimes labeled ""hyperosmolar non-ketotic state"" or HONK) is much more common in type 2 diabetes and features increased (above 320 mosm/kg) due to profound dehydration and concentration of the blood; mild acidosis and ketonemia may occur in this state, but not to the extent observed in DKA. There is a degree of overlap between DKA and HHS, as in DKA the osmolarity may also be increased. is not always the result of diabetes. It may also result from and from ; in both states the glucose level is normal or low. may occur in people with diabetes for other reasons, such as with or . The categorizes DKA in adults into one of three stages of severity: blood pH mildly decreased to between 7.25 and 7.30 (normal 7.35–7.45); serum decreased to 15–18 mmol/l (normal above 20); the person is alert pH 7.00–7.25, bicarbonate 10–15, mild drowsiness may be present pH below 7.00, bicarbonate below 10, stupor or coma may occur A 2004 statement by the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society (for children) uses slightly different cutoffs, where mild DKA is defined by pH 7.20–7.30 (bicarbonate 10–15 mmol/l), moderate DKA by pH 7.1–7.2 (bicarbonate 5–10) and severe DKA by pH<7.1 (bicarbonate below 5). Attacks of DKA can be prevented in those known to have diabetes to an extent by adherence to ""sick day rules""; these are clear-cut instructions to person on how to treat themselves when unwell. Instructions include advice on how much extra insulin to take when sugar levels appear uncontrolled, an easily digestible diet rich in salt and carbohydrates, means to suppress fever and treat infection, and recommendations when to call for medical help. People with diabetes can monitor their own ketone levels when unwell and seek help if they are elevated. The main aims in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis are replacing the lost fluids and electrolytes while suppressing the high blood sugars and ketone production with insulin. Admission to an (ICU) or similar high-dependency area or ward for close observation may be necessary. The amount of fluid replaced depends on the estimated degree of dehydration. If dehydration is so severe as to cause (severely decreased with insufficient blood supply to the body's organs), or a depressed level of consciousness, rapid infusion of (1 liter for adults, 10 ml/kg in repeated doses for children) is recommended to restore circulating volume. Slower rehydration based on calculated water and sodium shortage may be possible if the dehydration is moderate, and again saline is the recommended fluid. Very mild ketoacidosis with no associated vomiting and mild dehydration may be treated with oral rehydration and subcutaneous rather than intravenous insulin under observation for signs of deterioration. (0.9% saline) has generally been the fluid of choice. There have been a few small trials looking at balanced fluids with few differences. A special but unusual consideration is , where the blood pressure is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the (which requires the insertion of a in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure. Some guidelines recommend a bolus (initial large dose) of insulin of 0.1 unit of insulin per kilogram of body weight. This can be administered immediately after the potassium level is known to be higher than 3.3 mmol/l; if the level is any lower, administering insulin could lead to a dangerously low potassium level (see below). Other guidelines recommend delaying the initiation of insulin until fluids have been administered. It is possible to use rapid acting for mild or moderate cases. In general, insulin is given at 0.1 unit/kg per hour to reduce the blood sugars and suppress ketone production. Guidelines differ as to which dose to use when blood sugar levels start falling; some recommend reducing the dose of insulin once glucose falls below 16.6 mmol/l (300 mg/dl) but other recommend infusing glucose in addition to saline to allow for ongoing infusion of higher doses of insulin. Potassium levels can fluctuate severely during the treatment of DKA, because insulin decreases potassium levels in the blood by redistributing it into via increased sodium-potassium pump activity. A large part of the shifted extracellular potassium would have been lost in urine because of osmotic diuresis. (low blood potassium concentration) often follows treatment. This increases the risk of . Therefore, continuous observation of the heart rate is recommended, as well as repeated measurement of the potassium levels and addition of potassium to the intravenous fluids once levels fall below 5.3 mmol/l. If potassium levels fall below 3.3 mmol/l, insulin administration may need to be interrupted to allow correction of the hypokalemia. The administration of solution to rapidly improve the acid levels in the blood is controversial. There is little evidence that it improves outcomes beyond standard therapy, and indeed some evidence that while it may improve the acidity of the blood, it may actually worsen acidity inside the body's cells and increase the risk of certain complications. Its use is therefore discouraged, although some guidelines recommend it for extreme acidosis (pH<6.9), and smaller amounts for severe acidosis (pH 6.9–7.0). Cerebral edema, if associated with coma, often necessitates admission to intensive care, , and close observation. The administration of fluids is slowed. The ideal treatment of cerebral edema in DKA is not established, but intravenous and (3%) are used—as in some other forms of cerebral edema—in an attempt to reduce the swelling. Resolution of DKA is defined as general improvement in the symptoms, such as the ability to tolerate oral nutrition and fluids, normalization of blood acidity (pH>7.3), and absence of ketones in blood (<1 mmol/l) or urine. Once this has been achieved, insulin may be switched to the usual subcutaneously administered regimen, one hour after which the intravenous administration can be discontinued. In people with suspected ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, determination of antibodies against and may aid in the decision whether to continue insulin administration long-term (if antibodies are detected), or whether to withdraw insulin and attempt treatment with oral medication as in type 2 diabetes. Generally speaking, routine measurement of as a measure of insulin production is not recommended unless there is genuine doubt as to whether someone has type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs in 4.6–8.0 per 1000 people with diabetes annually. Rates among those with type 1 diabetes are higher with about 4% in United Kingdom developing DKA a year while in the condition affects about 25% a year. In the United States, 135,000 hospital admissions occur annually as a result of DKA, at an estimated cost of $2.4 billion or a quarter to a half the total cost of caring for people with type 1 diabetes. There has been a documented increasing trend to hospital admissions. The risk is increased in those with an ongoing risk factor, such as an eating disorder, and those who cannot afford insulin. About 30% of children with type 1 diabetes receive their diagnosis after an episode of DKA. Lower socio‐economic status and higher area‐level deprivation are associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in people with diabetes mellitus type 1. Previously considered universally fatal, the risk of death with adequate and timely treatment is around 1–4%. Up to 1% of children with DKA develop a complication known as . Rates of cerebral edema in US children with DKA has risen from 0.4% in 2002 to 0.7% in 2012. Between 2 and 5 out of 10 children who develop brain swelling will die as a result. The first full description of diabetic ketoacidosis is attributed to , a German pathologist working in , United Kingdom. In his description, which he gave in an 1886 lecture at the in London, he drew on reports by as well as describing the main ketones, acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, and their chemical determination. The condition remained almost universally fatal until the in the 1920s; by the 1930s, mortality had fallen to 29 percent, and by the 1950s it had become less than 10 percent. The entity of cerebral edema due to DKA was described in 1936 by a team of doctors from Philadelphia. Numerous research studies since the 1950s have focused on the ideal treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis. A significant proportion of these studies have been conducted at the and . Treatment options studied have included high- or low-dose intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular (e.g. the "" regime"") insulin, phosphate supplementation, need for a loading dose of insulin, and appropriateness of using bicarbonate therapy in moderate DKA. Various questions remain unanswered, such as whether bicarbonate administration in severe DKA makes any real difference to the clinical course, and whether an insulin loading dose is needed in adults. The entity of ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes was first fully described in 1987 after several preceding case reports. It was initially thought to be a form of , and went through several other descriptive names (such as ""idiopathic type 1 diabetes"", ""Flatbush diabetes"", ""atypical diabetes"" and ""type 1.5 diabetes"") before the current terminology of ""ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes"" was adopted.

6bbff7cc-ae30-4663-9e79-1b8b90ad466a,"Join the Masterclass to Take Immediate Control of Your Diabetes Health Start feeling better, gain energy, lose weight, and reduce your medication costs quickly Article written and reviewed by  Both Robby and I were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when we were young (he at age 12, myself at age 22), and together we’ve been living with diabetes for over 35 years. In that time, we’ve experienced the struggle many others like us have faced, the struggle of trying to manage our condition and live happy, fulfilling lives while surrounded by incomplete, confusing, and often contradicting information. We’ve suffered through long years of fear, vulnerability, and hopelessness, where we felt crippled, where we thought it would be possible to be active, energized, and normal again. But we’ve also experienced the that changing our diets has given us, the control it’s returned to our lives. As Robby and I began to discover a diet that for us, our lives were transformed. I was able to be active again, to play soccer and ride my bike and work out, things I hold dear to my heart. Robby rediscovered his natural energy and vigor for life, and saw chronic conditions he’d been battling for decades completely disappear. To learn more about our personal stories, listen to this fantastic episode of the . Your diet can when you are living with diabetes. And once Robby and I discovered that fact, we founded Mastering Diabetes to share our knowledge with others. We don’t say this lightly, and we don’t take our recommendations to others lightly. Yes, Robby and I found a method that worked for us, but we didn’t stop there. The Mastering Diabetes Method is a result of dozens of years of research, supported by thousands of evidence-based, peer-reviewed sources. We are STICKLERS for the science, and make sure that everything we share, every piece of advice, is true and supported by multiple sources. In a world of confusing, often contradicting information surrounding diabetes health, that is our promise to you. In this article, we’ll take a look at the health benefits of a low-fat, plant-based, whole-food diet, especially for those living with insulin resistance, prediabetes, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes. We’ll also look at some other commonly recommended diets for people with diabetes, and discuss their comparative effects on your: The Low-Fat, Plant-Based, Whole-Food Nutrition to Maximize Insulin Sensitivity Diabetes Diet Food List: What To Eat And What To Avoid Monitor your Health like the Stock Market, and Look for Good Changes Recently, many doctors have begun to follow a treatment methodology utilizing to improve blood glucose control. Some of these recommendations, like and other refined ingredients, can and for long-term complications. However, there are also some with this common model, which often focuses on . In a broad sense, your body derives energy from three sources: carbohydrate, fat, and protein. From this perspective, most diets are easy to understand, especially when it comes to diabetes and insulin resistance. In this article, we’ll touch on the most common recommendation — high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets — and explain why the research actually shows that for people with diabetes, the best option is actually almost the opposite. These diets, which include ‘Keto’, ‘Paleo’, and the Atkins diet, are some of the most popular diets on the planet, and they are often highly recommended for those with diabetes. However, despite the fact that these diets can provide short-term results, over time they can actually result in increased insulin use, oral medication use, and A1c over time. The main issue with these low-carbohydrate diets is that they ignore the underlying causes of high blood glucose levels (insulin resistance), and instead prescribe a ‘quick fix’. In many cases, a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet results in , , reduced fasting insulin and glucose, , weight loss, and increased HDL cholesterol in the . However, a high-fat, low carbohydrate diet actually , and can cause long-term negative effects including: The Low-Fat, Plant-Based, Whole-Food Nutrition to Maximize Insulin Sensitivity To find a long-term solution, the research instead points to a , one that is high in whole carbohydrates. This diet matches the immediate results of increased insulin sensitivity from ketogenic diets, and results in: Making it easier to precisely control your blood glucose (by 52% on average) And minimizing your risk for many chronic diseases The crucial difference with the low-fat, plant-based, whole-food diet is that these benefits are sustainable in the long-term. One possibility that the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet hasn’t become as popular is due to the confusion between plant-based, whole carbohydrates, and artificial or refined carbohydrates. A diet that is high in artificial sweeteners, refined foods, and simple carbohydrates like added sugars spike your glucose and negatively , and we recommend removing them from your plate and your pantry entirely. Making this distinction can be daunting, which is why we have a very simple, easy-to-follow set of reference guidelines. Following this diet is actually very simple, following a clear “” categorization for foods. All fruits (with a few exceptions like avocado, durian, and dates) In this diet, you can eat green light foods , which means as much as you want! No portion control needed. These are unrefined whole foods with a high nutrient density that have been consistently proven to reverse insulin resistance. These yellow light foods are okay to include in small quantities, because they are slightly processed or have higher fat content. If you’re living with diabetes or insulin resistance, they shouldn’t be daily staples, but are still a “healthy” choice. We recommend removing red light foods from your cabinet, your fridge, and your plate. These foods are documented by evidence-based research to cause insulin resistance, and increase your blood glucose (fasting and post-meal). They also promote chronic diseases not only for those with diabetes, but for anyone. You can find a thriving community involved in the low-fat, plant-based, whole-food diet right here at Mastering Diabetes. Thousands of people have already regained control of their blood glucose, reduced or reversed insulin resistance, lost weight, and improved their energy and overall health just by changing their diet. For example, Affaf was able to regain control of her life after years on the “blood glucose rollercoaster,” in what she calls a total . After following the low-carbohydrate diet to the T and exercising frequently, Regina was still gaining weight and had an A1c over 12.0%. After switching to a low-fat, plant-based, whole-food diet, Regina by her next doctor’s visit. We’ve spent years researching and refining these guidelines, and we’re constantly updating them to stay in line with our lived experience, that of our community, and the most up-to-date research available. Diabetes Diet Food List: What To Eat And What To Avoid The benefits of the green-yellow-red light system are that you have a quick reference for healthy foods that make your food choices simple. If they’re green, you can eat as much as you want. If yellow, they’re probably best in moderation. And reds we recommend removing from your plate and your pantry. One of the best parts of following this system is that you naturally integrate foods that provide a wide variety of health benefits, like high fibers, nutrients, minerals, and a wide variety of protective effects that help your entire body. Looking to make this a reality, to feel better, have more energy, and get your health under control, but a bit daunted by the shift? We get it. For most of us, this can be a big transition, especially if you’ve grown up on a standard American diet. That’s why our coaches are here to help. Here at Mastering Diabetes, we have a that can help you every step along the way, from understanding how to pick foods and ingredients based on this system, to meal planning and more. There’s a lot of information out there about a lot of different diets for healthy eating, all designed to help maintain healthy blood pressure, blood glucose, weight, and other biomarkers. In this section, we’re taking a moment to focus on some other diets you may encounter, as well as some commonly asked questions about keeping a balanced diet for diabetes. The ketogenic diet, more commonly known as ‘Keto’, is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet that emphasizes unrefined products. Similar diets include the Atkins diet. While placing the focus on natural sources of nutrition is always good, and the ketogenic diet can have excellent short term benefits, in the long term this diet for insulin resistance and your diabetes health in the long-term. If you’d like to read more about exactly why this emphasis on minimizing carbs is bad in the long run, you can dive deeper into the science in this article about ketosis and ketogenic diets. The ‘paleo’ diet is an umbrella term for diets emphasizing raw, organic, and natural products that would have been available during the paleolithic era. Often referred to as the ‘caveman’ diet, paleo is another diet that . By focusing on eliminating refined products, and more carefully aligning your diet with what humans have evolved to eat are both beneficial. However, even within these ‘paleo’ guidelines, there is often a high proportion of meats and fats, which can drastically increase your insulin resistance in the long-term. There are a wide variety of dietary balances that can classify as ‘paleo’, and while can be very advantageous for your diabetes health, others can be disastrous. The focus on natural products is good, but strictly focusing on ‘paleo’ guidelines is not ideal for diabetes health. The Mediterranean diet is modeled after the diet followed in the eponymous region, which is often associated with longevity. This diet emphasizes minimal consumption of meats, with an emphasis on fruits, vegetables, berries, and intact whole foods. Research has shown that the Mediterranean diet has been proven to reduce chronic disease, and is vastly when compared to the standard American diet. The Mediterranean diet is essentially a milder form of the LFPBWF diet, which emphasizes the same plant-based, low-fat diet, but also includes some red light foods in moderation. The Mediterranean diet is certainly better for diabetes health than the standard American diet or ketogenic diets, and may be an option if you’re looking to diabetes, or gradually improve your diabetes health. However, if you’re looking to most effectively reverse insulin resistance, the presence of red light foods like meats and seafood may be counterproductive. The vegan diet has a significant overlap with the low-fat, plant-based, whole-food diet in that it eliminates two major areas of the red light foods: meat and dairy products. In addition, if you follow the low-fat, plant-based, whole-food diet strictly, you will by default be following vegan guidelines. However, there are two issues with vegan diets: they often include synthetic, processed, and refined foods, which we categorize as yellow-light foods, and they can neglect the importance of reducing fats. The emphasis on plants is very valuable for your diabetes health, but including synthetic, packaged food, and not focusing on the balance of carbohydrates and fats can negatively affect your diabetes health. The gluten-free diet is another diet that align with low-fat, plant-based, whole-food diets, but in and of itself does not align with ideal diabetes health. For example, it is possible to be gluten-free and also focus on low-fat, plant-based, whole-foods. However, focusing on gluten-free foods for diabetes health allows for processed foods, meats, artificial sweeteners, and other foods that can spike your insulin, which is counterproductive. If you are gluten-free, you can very easily make that diet align with the principles of a low-fat, plant-based, whole-food diet. However, a gluten-free diet will not in and of itself provide better diabetes health. A better question is you drink diet soda when living with diabetes? Though diet sodas may not directly spike your blood glucose, the artificial sweeteners in diet sodas can , and have been linked to . If you’d like to learn more, you can read our article on diet soda and intermittent fasting, which explains the and how it can interfere with your diabetes health. The Glycemic Index is a reference that tries to describe how dense in sugars and other nutrients a certain food is. However, we don’t recommend following it closely when dealing with diabetes, as many plants like banana, watermelon, and sweet potatoes are high on the glycemic index but will still help your insulin sensitivity. General a reference for how dense in sugars and other factors. To learn more about the glycemic index, and how it doesn’t quite fit with plant-based nutrition for diabetes, you can read . The best diet for your diabetes health in both the short term and the long term is a low-fat, plant-based, whole-food diet. However, it’s only truly valuable if you can find a way to stick to it, and make it an enjoyable part of life. That’s why we have a number of different and an extensive , to help you understand how low-fat, plant-based, whole-food can change your life. Yes! If you’re living with prediabetes, , , or suspect that you may be , these conditions can be entirely reversed through your diet. And if you’re living with , you can control your insulin resistance, stay in range, and reduce your all-round medication. It’s easy to get caught up in the way we used to think as kids, that fruits and vegetables were just the lame ‘healthy’ stuff we had to eat. But in fact, plants and herbs have some of the most complex, intricate flavors on the planet. Monitor your Health like the Stock Market, and Look for Good Changes When living with diabetes, it can be easy to get caught up in the small ups and downs of each day. When making big changes, there might be rocky days. That’s why we recommend you look at the overall trends, from day to day, week to week, month to month, and even year to year. We find that this can remove the stress of 24/7 monitoring. And instead, look at the wins! Days where you have more energy, new personal bests on your blood glucose, less medication. These are all huge milestones to celebrate. Speaking of celebrating, one major part of green-light foods is that you can eat them . That means no more frustrating portion control, no more waiting hungrily from meal to meal. With the green light foods, eat as much and as much as you want! Remember, proper nutrition is a marathon, not a sprint, and everyone has times when they make exceptions to their diet. These guidelines offer a powerful way to take control of your diabetes health, and they’ll still do that even after a ‘cheat’ meal on a special occasion. The important thing is to keep your focus on the results you’re seeing in your body, and keep working! Another thing that can make a major difference when shifting diets is involving friends and making it fun. You’re not in this alone, and working with friends and family to prepare food and plan meals can be an excellent source of support. You can also find a thriving community here at Mastering Diabetes of people just starting, in the rhythm, and with years of experience with low-fat, plant-based, whole-food nutrition. One of the hardest parts of shifting to a low-fat, plant-based, whole-food diet can be sticking to it, especially when you’re busy. High-fat, high-sugar meals and snacks are synthesized to maximize taste and convenience, and fill US stores and restaurants. Meal planning at the beginning of the week can make a major difference here, helping you plan and prepare ahead of time so when work and life get in the way, you can keep your nutrition on track. We have some great resources to help you with meal planning in our . Getting your diet under control doesn’t have to be a solo effort.

It is a chronic disease that has no cure. Therefore it comes to no surprise that this disease has acquired countless number of attentions. Unfortunately, 5.4 million people in the United State are unaware that they have this disease. Until they do, they have already developed life-threatening complications. This may include blindness, kidney diseases, nerves diseases, heart diseases, strokes, and amputations. It is no wonder that diabetes is known as the silent killer. Diabetes is condition where the body does not produce or properly use insulin, which is a type of hormone that converts sugar, starches, and other types of foods into the energy that humans need everyday. It controls the blood sugar level and without it, death is inevitable. There are two major types of diabetes: Type I, and Type II. Type I is where the body does not produce any insulin also known as insulin dependent or immune-medicated diabetes. It is a disease that destroys the cells in the pancreas that produces insulin. Type II, is where the body can't make enough or properly use insulin, also known as non-insulin dependent. Other specific type of diabetes may have its origin from certain genetic syndromes, surgery, drugs, malnutrition inflection and other illness. The cause of this disease remains a mystery. Genetics, environmental factors, lack of exercise, plays an important role in the cause of diabetes. Diabetes can cause different types of problems depending on which types of diabetes they have. For Type I diabetes, two problems may occur: ketoacidosis, and hyperglycemia. In ketoacidosis, your body produces ketones. This occurs when your blood glucose level increases too high. The productions of ketones have its unpleasant results. Ketones can cause you to vomit, have trouble breathing, become dehydrated, have dry itchy skin, and/or go into a coma.

We are a group of 14 year olds trying to make a better community. We are here to speak to you about our future. Have you ever come home with the stench of smoke clinging to your clothes? Or inhaled a cloud of smoke as a group of smokers passed, causing you to cough and choke? Neither experiences are pleasant and this is why smoking should be banned in public areas. Smoking is a dangerous habit that not only affects the smoker, but those around him or her. Banning the smoking in public will keep non-smokers safer. People who smoke subject themselves to deadly diseases by choice. Why should non-smokers be forced to be around it? Let’s hand it over to Fred who will now tell you how our world needs our help and that smoking should be banned. Main speaker: I’m here to tell you people that smoking should be banned. Every day in Great Britain about 450 children start smoking, 1 in 4 which turns into regular smokers by the age of 15 and every year 106, 000 people die from the effect of cigarettes. Would you want your child to become addicted to smoking? Watching people smoking disgusts me.

Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of heart disease in the United States. The following is the definition provided by the American Heart Association: Atherosclerosis (ath""er-o-skleh-RO'sis) comes from the Greek words athero (meaning gruel or paste) and sclerosis (hardness). It's the name of the process in which deposits of fatty substances, cholesterol, cellular waste products, calcium and other substances build up in the inner lining of an artery. This buildup is called plaque. It usually affects large and medium-sized arteries. Some hardening of arteries often occurs when people grow older (AHA, 2005). Atherosclerosis is different from Arteriosclerosis, though the two are oftentimes concurrently present as a result of heart disease and are likewise confused. Arteriosclerosis is defined by the Well-Net group as: ...during which the arteries of the cardiovascular system develop areas which become hard and brittle. Vessels become thickened.

Hyperglycemia itself is a hyperosmotic state. It’s possible that this high blood suger could try to pull fluids from cells, creating an almost isotonic state in the early stages of DKA.

1f986f61-daed-4dd4-8e20-80680fbe4dc1,"— Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, or Coke Zero, aims to recreate the taste of the original Coca-Cola Classic without the sugar or calories. It’s formulated to mimic the distinctive Classic Coke flavor — unlike Diet Coke, which has a unique flavor of its own. If you follow the very low carb, high fat keto diet, you may wonder whether Coke Zero can be a part of your routine. This article explores whether you should avoid Coke Zero on the keto diet. The keto diet aims to flip your metabolism into , a metabolic state in which your body burns fat instead of carbs for energy. This is achieved by maintaining a very low carb diet comprising 20–50 grams of carbs per day, as well as a high fat intake (, , ). For context, one 12-ounce (355-mL) can of sugar-sweetened Coca-Cola Classic has 39 grams of carbs, whereas Coke Zero has none (, ). Consuming too many carbs on the keto diet can take you out of ketosis and back into breaking down carbs for energy. The high fat, very low carb keto diet aims to flip your metabolism into burning fat for fuel instead of carbs. To maintain ketosis, you typically cannot eat more than 20–50 grams of carbs daily. Given that the goal of the keto diet is to keep your carb count low, typically between 20–50 grams per day, keeping track of your carb intake is crucial to staying in ketosis. Coke Zero obtains its flavor from a combination of flavorings and . Artificial sweeteners are substituted for table sugar and aim to deliver sweetness to a food product. Specifically, Coke Zero utilizes acesulfame potassium (Ace-K) and aspartame. While these don’t provide carbs or calories, they have been associated with negative health outcomes, such as an increased risk of diabetes and weight gain (, ). Also, keep in mind that Coke Zero contains 34 mg of caffeine per 12-ounce (355-mL) serving — about 36% of the amount of caffeine found in a regular 8-ounce (240-mL) cup of coffee (, ). While can give you an energy boost, it may dehydrate you if you consume it in large quantities. That’s because it’s a diuretic, meaning it stimulates your need to urinate. However, you would need to consume more than 500 mg per day to see a dehydrating effect — that’s nearly fifteen 12-ounce (355-mL) cans of Coke Zero (, , ). Do keep in mind that some people may be more sensitive to caffeine’s effects. Caffeine could trigger unwanted effects like anxiety, a racing heartbeat, or difficulties sleeping among those who are more sensitive to caffeine (). Furthermore, while it offers some sodium and potassium — 2% of the Daily Value for each — there are much more nutritious sources of these necessary minerals, which are vital for proper heart function, among many other crucial functions (). In addition, some studies have found that cola intake may increase your chances of developing osteoporosis. This might be a concern for those on a keto diet, as getting enough vitamin D and calcium may be a bit more challenging when following this eating pattern. Both of these nutrients are important for osteoporosis prevention (). More research is needed to understand this relationship, particularly in the context of a keto diet. Thus, while Coke Zero can occasionally provide variety as you quench your thirst on the keto diet, the optimal choice is water. While drinking soda, especially , is popular, it’s also controversial. Frequently sipping on artificially sweetened soda is associated with adverse health effects, including kidney issues and the development of diabetes and metabolic syndrome (, , , ). Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of symptoms associated with an increased risk of chronic disease. Finally, those with the genetic condition (PKU) should avoid Coke Zero, as it contains phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is a common amino acid that’s harmful to those with PKU, as it can build up in the body and lead to serious complications, including irreversible brain damage and seizures (, ). Finally, if you take medications for schizophrenia, you should also avoid Coke Zero, as phenylalanine can interact with them (). Coke Zero does not contain carbs or calories, which means it likely won’t knock you out of ketosis. However, given that frequently drinking diet soda is linked to adverse health effects, water is the best choice. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, or , recreates the Classic Coke flavor without any of the sugar or carbs. It does so by substituting sugar with artificial sweeteners. This means you can drink it without knocking yourself out of ketosis. However, the use of artificial sweeteners is controversial and linked to certain health risks. More research is needed in this area, especially in the context of a keto diet. While Coke Zero may be an occasional treat to lend variety to your keto routine, water is always the optimal choice. — Coke Zero, which has recently been rebranded as Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, is marketed as a healthier version of the original sugar-sweetened Coca-Cola… The Ketogenic Diet: A Detailed Beginner’s Guide to Keto The ketogenic diet (keto) is a low-carb, high-fat diet that causes weight loss and provides numerous health benefits.

120d963a-9956-4b60-9c60-90dc4015d23b,"How Much Weight Can You Expect to Lose After 1 Week on Keto? — Though the low carb, high fat keto diet was originally devised to help treat epilepsy, many people are turning to it to lose weight. According to some research, it provides several advantages over other diets, including making it easier to burn your stored body fat, maintain your metabolic rate (the calories you burn at rest), and feel more full on fewer calories (, , ). That said, you may wonder how much weight you can expect to lose in your first week on keto. Many people report extreme weight loss when first starting the diet. However, much of this can be attributed to water losses. This article reviews how much weight you can expect to lose on your first week of keto. On keto, you strictly limit your carb intake, typically to 50 grams or fewer per day of total carbs, or 25 grams or fewer of , which are total carbs minus fiber. For most people, carbs are the body’s primary source of energy. When you limit carbs, your body burns through the carb stores in your muscles and liver — called glycogen — typically within a few days (, ). After this, your body switches to a metabolic state called , in which it uses ketones that are broken down from dietary fat or stored body fat, as its primary source of fuel (, ). This shift, during which you burn through your glycogen stores and switch to using ketones, usually takes less than a week. However, for some people, it may take longer (, ). Many people notice dramatic weight loss during this transition period after first starting the keto diet, but most of this is due to changes in water weight (). When you restrict carbs on keto, your body rapidly burns through glycogen, the stored carbs in your liver and muscles. After your glycogen stores are depleted, you shift to burning fat. Many people notice dramatic weight loss during this transition. The glycogen stored in your muscles and liver is bound with water, typically at a ratio of 3 grams of water for each gram of glycogen (). When you burn through these stored carbs, this water is excreted in your urine or sweat (). As such, after starting keto, you may notice that you have to urinate more often and feel much thirstier than normal. You may also notice large weight losses, which are mostly water-weight losses (, ). Depending on your size and how much you’re carrying, this weight loss can vary. Anecdotally, people report losses within the first week of anywhere from 1 pound (0.5 kg) to 10 or more pounds (5 kg). The larger you are, the more water weight you’re likely to lose after starting keto. Although, it’s unlikely that much of this initial weight loss is fat loss. However, once you enter ketosis, it’s much easier to utilize your own stored fat for energy, which is one reason why the keto diet may be (). When you burn through glycogen, your body releases the water that was bound to it. Much of your early weight loss is probably due to these water losses. Still, you’ll burn more stored body fat once you’re fully in ketosis. Many people use the for weight loss, and there are several reports online of dramatic weight loss shortly after starting the diet. This is likely mostly water weight because as you burn through your carb stores, your body releases the water that was bound to those carbs. Once you’re fully in ketosis, your weight loss will probably slow down, but it’s likely to be more fat than water. — The Ketogenic Diet: A Detailed Beginner’s Guide to Keto The ketogenic diet (keto) is a low-carb, high-fat diet that causes weight loss and provides numerous health benefits.

94de4700-2b1e-4b2b-9b46-30be2a73fe44,"5 Most Common Low-Carb Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them) While low-carb diets are very popular, it’s also easy to make mistakes on them. There are many stumbling blocks that can lead to adverse effects and suboptimal results. To reap all the metabolic benefits of low-carb diets, merely cutting back on the carbs isn’t enough. Here are the 5 most common low-carb mistakes — and how to avoid them. While there is no strict definition of a low-carb diet, anything under 100–150 grams per day is generally considered low-carb. This amount is definitely a lot less than the standard Western diet. You may achieve great results within this carb range, as long as you eat unprocessed, . But if you want to get into — which is essential for a ketogenic diet — then this level of intake may be excessive. Most people will need to go under 50 grams per day to reach ketosis. Keep in mind that this doesn’t leave you with many carb options — except vegetables and small amounts of berries. If you want to get into ketosis and reap the full metabolic benefits of low-carb diets, going under 50 grams of carbs per day may be necessary. Protein is a very important macronutrient which most people don’t get enough of. It can improve feelings of fullness and increase fat burning better than other macronutrients (). Generally speaking, more protein should lead to and improved body composition. However, low-carb dieters who eat a lot of lean animal foods can end up eating too much of it. When you eat , some of its amino acids will be turned into glucose via a process called gluconeogenesis (). This can become a problem on very-low-carb, ketogenic diets and prevent your body from going into full-blown ketosis. According to some scientists, a well-formulated low-carb diet should be high in fat and moderate in protein. A good range to aim for is 0.7–0.9 grams of protein per pound of body weight (1.5–2.0 grams per kg). Excessive protein consumption on a low-carb diet can prevent you from getting into ketosis. Most people get the majority of their calories from dietary carbs — especially sugars and grains. When you remove this energy source from your diet, you must replace it with something else. However, some people believe that cutting out fats on a low-carb diet will make your diet even healthier. This is a big mistake. If you don’t eat carbs, you must add fat to compensate. Failing to do so could lead to hunger and inadequate nutrition. There’s no scientific reason to fear fat — as long as you avoid and choose healthy ones like monounsaturated and omega-3 fats instead. A fat intake around 70% of total calories may be a good choice for some people on low-carb or ketogenic diets. To get fat into this range, you must choose fatty cuts of meat and liberally add to your meals. A very-low-carb diet must be high in fat. Otherwise, you won’t get enough energy or nutrition to sustain yourself. One of the main mechanisms behind low-carb diets is a (, ). Insulin has many functions in your body, such as telling fat cells to store fat and your kidneys to retain sodium (). On a low-carb diet, your insulin levels go down and your body starts shedding excess sodium — and water along with it. This is why people often get rid of excess bloating within a few days of low-carb eating. However, sodium is a crucial electrolyte. Low sodium levels can become problematic when your kidneys dump too much of it. This is one reason people get side effects on low-carb diets, such as lightheadedness, fatigue, , and even constipation. The best way to circumvent this issue is to add more sodium to your diet. You can do this by salting your foods — but if that doesn’t suffice, try drinking a cup of broth every day. Low-carb diets lower insulin levels, making your kidneys excrete excess sodium. This can lead to a mild sodium deficiency. Your body is designed to preferentially burn carbs. Therefore, if carbs are always available, that’s what your body uses for energy. If you drastically cut back on carbs, your body needs to shift to — which either comes from your diet or your body’s stores. It can take a few days for your body to adapt to burning primarily fat instead of carbs, during which you will probably feel a little under the weather. This is called the “” and happens to most people who go on ultra-low-carb diets. If you feel unwell for a few days, you may be tempted to quit your diet. However, keep in mind that it may take 3–4 days for your body to adjust to your new regimen — with full adaptation taking several weeks. Therefore, it’s important to be patient in the beginning and strictly adhere to your diet. On a low-carb diet, it can take a few days to overcome unpleasant symptoms and several weeks for full adaptation. It is important to be patient and not abandon your diet too soon. may offer a potential cure for some of the world’s biggest health problems, including obesity and type 2 diabetes.

62236f17-5d93-43ba-8e78-37b00cab6a98,"— Most people agree that fruits fit perfectly into a healthy lifestyle routine. However, people on a low-carb diet tend to avoid fruits. There are even low-carbers who go to extremes and say that fruit is downright unhealthy. Meanwhile, most health and lifestyle professionals advise people to eat fruit every day. As a result, the question whether fruit is acceptable on a low-carb diet seems to come up all the time. This article takes a close look at the evidence. The primary goal of is carb restriction. This involves limiting the foods that contain the most carbohydrates, including candy, sugary soft drinks and root vegetables like potatoes, as well as grain products like pasta and bread. But , despite the health halo, also tend to be fairly rich in carbohydrates, primarily the simple sugars, glucose and fructose. Here is the net carb (total carbs – fiber) count for a few fruits: Fruits are much higher in carbs than but lower in carbs than foods like bread or pasta. Fruits are generally high in carbs. For this reason, you need to moderate your fruit intake on a low-carb diet. It’s important to keep in mind that not all low-carb diets are the same. There is no clear definition of exactly what constitutes a low-carb diet. Whether any one person can or should include fruit in their diet depends on a lot of things. This includes their current goals, activity levels, current metabolic health and personal preference. A person who aims to eat no more than 100–150 grams of can easily fit in several pieces of fruit per day without going over their limit. However, someone who is on a very low-carb with under 50 grams per day doesn’t really have much room. Instead of spending the entire carb budget on 1 or 2 pieces of fruit, it would be better spent eating plenty of low-carb vegetables, which are much more nutritious, calorie for calorie. While some fruit intake is fine on most low-carb diets, you may need to avoid fruit if you are trying to reach ketosis. Fruits taste sweet because they contain a mixture of fructose and glucose. There has been a lot of talk about the harmful effects of table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup, mainly because they contain so much fructose. Studies show that excess fructose intake is associated with , including obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome (). However, the role of fructose is still controversial, and no strong evidence proves that it’s harmful in normal amounts (). It’s very important to realize that fructose may only be harmful in a certain lifestyle context. For people who are inactive and eat a high-carb Western diet, consuming a lot of fructose may cause harm. But people who are healthy, lean and active can afford to eat some fructose. Instead of being turned into fat, it will go towards replenishing glycogen stores in the liver. If you’re already eating a healthy, real-food based diet with plenty of and fat, small amounts of fructose from fruit won’t cause harm. Fruits also happen to contain fiber, lots of water and significant chewing resistance. It’s almost impossible to overeat fructose simply by eating fruit. The possible harmful effects of fructose apply to fructose from added , not from real foods like fruits. However, is a different story. There’s virtually no fiber in it, no chewing resistance and it may contain nearly the same amount of sugar as a soft drink. Fruit is okay, fruit juice is not. Fruit contains a mixture of fructose and glucose. Excessive fructose intake is considered unhealthy, but this only applies to added sugar in processed food.

Some do it for health reasons such as obesity, diabetes or epilepsy. Others simply feel best eating that way. There is no reason to discourage these people from avoiding fruit. It doesn’t contain any essential nutrients that you can’t get from vegetables. While some low-carbers may do best limiting fruit, the same may not apply to others. Fresh fruits are healthy, unprocessed foods that are rich in fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. Fruits are certainly much healthier options than the processed people are putting in their bodies every day. Daily intake of fruit is generally recommended as part of a healthy diet. However, for those following a low-carb diet, moderation is key.

Its principles were first used more than 20 years ago by Dr. Tran Tien Chanh, who was looking to create a safer and easier weight loss protocol for his patients.

Its advocates claim that this makes it more effective at burning through your body’s fat stores. This diet is said to be based on valid science for weight loss, as it applies the principles of a ketogenic diet alongside healthy lifestyle education. The diet is managed and promoted by a company called Ideal Protein, also known as Laboratoires C.O.P., Inc. Here is a detailed review of the Ideal Protein Diet. The Ideal Protein Diet is a well-researched and -developed diet protocol. However, it’s pricey, relies on packaged or processed foods and drastically reduces calorie intake, which may cause uncomfortable side effects. To get started on the Ideal Protein Diet, you must first contact an authorized clinic or center, as this diet requires one-on-one guidance from a licensed healthcare practitioner or trained coach to assist you in your weight loss goals. There are plenty of sites available across North America, which can be found on Ideal Protein’s website. The Ideal Protein Diet is divided into four unique phases: Phase 1 of the Ideal Protein Diet is known as the weight loss phase. It’s meant to be followed until you reach 100% of your weight loss goal. An Ideal Protein lunch with 2 cups of selected veggies (see below in the chapter “Foods to Eat”). An 8-ounce (225-gram) portion of protein with 2 cups of selected veggies. These Ideal Protein meals can only be purchased through authorized clinics or centers. Most meals provide 20 grams of protein and less than 200 calories per serving. You can eat unlimited raw vegetables from their specified list with lunch and dinner. In addition to the meals, dieters are told to consume the following supplements, which also must be purchased through authorized clinics or centers: 1 multivitamin and 1 potassium supplement. 1 multivitamin, 2 calcium-magnesium supplements and 2 omega-3 supplements. 2 antioxidant supplements and 1/4 teaspoon of Ideal Salt. Since the diet drastically reduces calorie intake, exercise is generally not recommended during the first three weeks, as it may cause unwanted side effects. Phase 2 of the Ideal Protein Diet is known as the 14-day phase. It begins once you reach your weight loss goal. While similar to the weight loss phase, this phase allows you to eat a lunch based on whole foods. It contains 8 ounces (225 grams) of protein with 2 cups of selected veggies. Dinner is similar. The supplements you take here are the same as in phase 1. Phase 3 is the pre-stabilization phase and starts the transition to a maintenance diet. This phase is simple because all you have to do is swap your Ideal Protein food at breakfast for whole foods. It should include a protein, carb and fat option, as well as a piece of fruit. Additionally, you’re no longer required to take the potassium supplement with breakfast. Reintroducing carbs at breakfast is said to help restart your pancreas’s production of and train it to produce the right amount. However, no clinical studies back up this claim. Phase 4 is the last phase of the Ideal Protein Diet. This phase is a maintenance plan that lasts for 12 months. The goal of this phase is to teach you how to while enjoying more dietary freedom. Although this phase lasts 12 months, you are meant to follow its core principles for life. Outside of breakfast, avoid combining foods that are rich in carbs and fats. For instance, if you eat a fat- and protein-based meal for lunch, limit your carb intake. Take your body weight in pounds and cut it in half, then aim to consume that number of grams of protein each day. For instance, a 150-pound person should consume at least 75 grams of protein per day. One day each week, you are allowed to indulge in foods that are normally restricted on the Ideal Protein Diet. Some supplements are recommended during this phase, but they’re optional. The Ideal Protein Diet is a four-phase ketogenic diet that must be undertaken with one-on-one coaching by a licensed healthcare practitioner or trained consultant. The Ideal Protein Diet has several potential benefits that make it popular for weight loss. The Ideal Protein Diet is a modified version of the ketogenic diet. There is strong evidence that following a can promote weight loss. For instance, an analysis of 13 studies showed that a ketogenic diet was more effective than a low-fat diet at promoting weight loss and helping patients keep weight off (). That said, published scientific studies that specifically examine the Ideal Protein Diet are lacking. Such studies are needed before it can be assessed how the Ideal Protein Diet stacks up to a regular ketogenic diet or any other weight loss diet. Diets like the Ideal Protein Diet are attractive for busy people. During the weight loss phase, you will frequently consume premade Ideal Protein foods. The only exception is dinners, for which you must measure your protein and vegetable portions. Consuming mostly premade meals can drastically reduce the amount of time spent shopping, planning and preparing meals, freeing up more time for people who have a hectic schedule. Overall, the Ideal Protein Diet involves significantly less prep work than most diets. The Ideal Protein Diet provides support from a licensed healthcare practitioner or trained consultant, which can aid weight loss and help keep it off. In fact, studies have shown that people are more likely to stick to a weight loss program when they have support throughout the process (, ). What’s more, support helps people stay accountable (). May increase insulin sensitivity and improve blood sugar control Carrying excess fat can raise your risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. As ketogenic diets can help you lose excess fat, they may also reduce risk factors for diabetes and metabolic syndromes, such as insulin resistance — all of which helps . In one study, ketogenic diets reduced insulin resistance by a whopping 75% (). In another study, obese people with type 2 diabetes who followed a low-carb diet experienced a significant decrease in insulin resistance (). During the weight loss phase, the Ideal Protein Diet closely resembles a ketogenic diet. Studies have shown that low-carb and ketogenic diets can improve heart disease risk factors. For instance, a review of studies showed that low-carb diets not only reduced body weight but lowered two heart disease risk factors — total and “bad” LDL cholesterol () In another analysis of studies, obese people who followed a ketogenic diet experienced a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, visceral fat, fasting blood sugars, blood insulin levels and blood (). The Ideal Protein Diet offers several potential benefits, including weight loss, ease of use, professional support, increased insulin sensitivity and reduced heart disease risk. While the Ideal Protein Diet has several potential benefits, it also has a few drawbacks. For people on a budget, the Ideal Protein Diet can be quite expensive. Though Ideal Protein’s website does not list the costs of the diet, partner clinics offer services ranging from $320–450 — and that’s just to get started. The difference in cost depends on how much the clinic charges for an initial consultation. Once started, the Ideal Protein Diet will set you back approximately $15 per day. Many of the prepackaged Ideal Protein foods are highly processed. They contain a variety of oils, and artificial sweeteners that are not naturally present in whole foods. If you avoid prepackaged foods, the Ideal Protein Diet is not a good fit for you. People who love flexibility may struggle with the Ideal Protein Diet, as it severely limits dietary options — especially in its early phases. For instance, during phase 1, dinner is the only meal in which you can prepare your own dishes. Otherwise, you must eat Ideal Protein portions at breakfast, lunch and snack time. What’s more, the diet restricts foods that play a role in healthy weight loss — such as whole grains, nuts, avocados and more. That said, this diet does offer more freedom once you reach the maintenance phase. The Ideal Protein Diet is not suitable for vegans, as its prepackaged foods sometimes contain eggs and dairy products. If you avoid all animal products, a may be more suitable. The Ideal Protein Diet is featured in over 3,500 clinics and centers across the world. However, most of these sites are in North America, making the diet difficult to follow elsewhere. Keep in mind that the diet cannot be followed without a supporting clinic. There is a virtual support center for people in areas where clinics are unavailable. Still, if you go this route, you may need to import meals to your country. Another downside of the Ideal Protein Diet is its drastic reduction in calorie intake. For instance, most of its meals have less than 200 calories, which means you may be consuming under 1,000 total calories per day. Such restricted diets are not recommended — unless advised by a doctor — for children, pregnant or breastfeeding women, adults 65 and older and adults with certain medical conditions. Reducing your calorie intake so sharply may cause side effects, such as: If the Ideal Protein Diet impedes your quality of life, consider going off it. The Ideal Protein Diet has many drawbacks, including cost, highly processed foods, severe dietary restrictions, limited geographic availability and potentially serious side effects. The Ideal Protein Diet is very restrictive during phases 1 (weight loss) and 2 (14-day). For instance, phase 1 requires you to eat three premade Ideal Protein dishes per day. The exception is dinner, for which you are allowed to select a protein option. Here are some protein possibilities for the Ideal Protein Diet: Any , such as anchovy, cod, flounder, hake, tuna, tilapia, mahi-mahi, red snapper, redfish, trout or salmon. However, limit salmon to once a week. Squid, shrimp, oysters, mussels, lobster, crawfish, clams, scampi, scallops or crab. Skinless chicken, turkey, fowl, quail or wild birds. Tenderloin, sirloin, very lean ground beef, rump or other steak cuts. Tenderloin, breast, shoulder, rib, shank, cutlet or other cuts. Venison, bison, kidney, lamb loin, liver, rabbit, ostrich or others. With lunch and dinner, you are also allowed to consume two cups of selected vegetables or an unlimited amount of company-approved raw vegetables. These include: Asparagus, bean sprouts, rhubarb, okra, , zucchini, yellow summer squash, chicory, alfalfa, kale and more. Lettuce, celery, mushrooms, radish, spinach, radicchio and endives. Here are the permitted seasonings and condiments for this diet: Herbs (all), garlic, ginger, vinegar (white and apple cider), tamari, soy sauce, hot sauce, hot mustard, spices ( and carb-free), mint and more. Once you reach phases 3 and 4, you can reintroduce more carb, dairy and fat options, including: bread and whole-grain, sugar-free cereal. Bananas, apples, peaches, cherries, papaya, grapefruit, apricots, plums, tangerine, watermelon, passion fruit, grapes, oranges, kiwifruit and more. The Ideal Protein Diet is quite restrictive and only allows specific foods alongside Ideal Protein meals. The following foods are forbidden during phases 1 and 2 of the Ideal Protein Diet. (other than Ideal Protein brand), rice, legumes, breads and cereals. All root vegetables, including potatoes, and carrots. All dairy, with the exception of 1 ounce (30 ml) of milk in coffee or tea. All junk foods, including candy, chocolate bars and potato chips. Once you reach phase 3, you’re allowed fruit, oils, dairy and complex carbs, such as whole-grain breads. The Ideal Protein Diet prohibits foods such as pasta, root vegetables, fruit, dairy and nuts. However, it allows more flexibility in its later phases. Here is an idea of what one day of each phase of the Ideal Protein Diet might look like. Keep in mind that Ideal Protein recommends the brand Natura for all vitamins, supplements and enzymes. One Ideal Protein food (such as apple-flavored ), one multivitamin, one potassium and 1–2 enzymes. One Ideal Protein food (such as beef stroganoff), two cups of selected vegetables and 1–2 enzymes. Optional raw vegetables. 8 ounces (225 grams) of a protein source, 2 cups of selected vegetables, one multivitamin, two calcium-magnesium supplements, two omega-3 supplements and 1–2 enzymes. Optional raw vegetables. One Ideal Protein food (such as a peanut butter bar), two calcium-magnesium supplements and 1–2 enzymes. Two antioxidant supplements and 1/4 teaspoon Ideal salt. One Ideal Protein food (such as an herbs-and-cheese omelet), one multivitamin, one potassium supplement and 1–2 enzymes. 8 ounces (225 grams) of a protein source, 2 cups of selected vegetables and 1–2 enzymes. Optional raw vegetables. 8 ounces (225 grams) of a protein source, 2 cups of selected vegetables, one multivitamin, two calcium-magnesium supplements, two omega-3 supplements and 1–2 enzymes. Optional raw vegetables. One Ideal Protein food (such as a vanilla peanut bar), two calcium-magnesium supplements and 1–2 enzymes. Two antioxidant supplements and 1/4 teaspoon Ideal salt. One Ideal Protein complete meal or a breakfast containing a protein, a carb, a fat/dairy option and fruit (for example, eggs with cheese, whole-grain bread and an apple). Also, one multivitamin and 1–2 enzymes. 8 ounces (225 grams) of a protein source, 2 cups of selected vegetables and 1–2 enzymes. Optional raw vegetables. 8 ounces (225 grams) of a protein source, 2 cups of selected vegetables, one multivitamin, two calcium-magnesium supplements, two omega-3 supplements and 1–2 enzymes. Optional raw vegetables. One Ideal Protein food (such as peanut soy puffs), two calcium-magnesium supplements and 1–2 enzymes. Two antioxidant supplements and 1/4 teaspoon Ideal salt. Whole-grain bread and with ham or cheese and one multivitamin. Low-carb entrée (such as a chicken salad with white sauce). Low-fat entrée with complex carbs (such as spaghetti bolognese) and one multivitamin. One Ideal Protein food or healthy snack of your choice (such as ) and two calcium-magnesium supplements. Your menu for the Ideal Protein Diet depends on the phase. Keep in mind that this diet includes a variety of supplements that must be taken at different meals. The Ideal Protein Diet is a modified keto diet that adds proven techniques like professional support and healthy eating education to . Though it’s convenient and designed to ensure long-term success, it’s expensive, restrictive, loaded with prepackaged meals and less accessible outside of America. Though the Ideal Protein Diet is based on scientific principles, it’s not supported by published clinical studies. Therefore, its effectiveness is unknown. — The Ketogenic Diet: A Detailed Beginner’s Guide to Keto The ketogenic diet (keto) is a low-carb, high-fat diet that causes weight loss and provides numerous health benefits.

1c697955-ce48-4b8d-8f42-359db13dbf02,"— Millions of people around the world depend on a morning cup of coffee to get their day started. Coffee is not only a great source of caffeine that provides a convenient boost of energy but also has many beneficial antioxidants and nutrients. A recent trend is to add coconut oil to coffee to reap the health benefits of this popular fat, too. However, you may wonder whether this practice is healthy. This article tells you whether you should drink coffee with coconut oil. Coconut oil has become increasingly popular among people following the high-fat, very-low-carb ketogenic diet. Adding it to your coffee can help you reach or maintain ketosis, a metabolic state in which your body uses ketones — molecules produced from fat breakdown — as fuel instead of glucose, a type of sugar (). Maintaining ketosis on a ketogenic diet has been linked to like weight loss, improved blood sugar control, and reduced heart disease risk factors (, , ). Coconut oil can help you stay in ketosis as it’s loaded with fats called (MCTs). Compared to other fats, MCTs are rapidly absorbed and immediately delivered to your liver. Here, they’re either used as a source of energy or converted into ketone bodies (). Interestingly, MCT oils are more easily converted to ketones than long-chain triglycerides, another type of fat found in foods (). Research shows that MCTs can help you stay in ketosis — even if you eat slightly more protein and carbs than recommended on a classic ketogenic diet (). Coconut oil has 4 types of MCTs, and 50% of its fat comes from the MCT lauric acid (). Lauric acid appears to make ketones at a slower but more sustained rate as it’s metabolized more steadily than other MCTs. Therefore, adding coconut oil to your coffee is an effective way to help you stay in ketosis (, ). Coconut oil helps your body make ketones. If you follow a ketogenic diet, adding it to your cup of coffee may help you reach and stay in ketosis. Adding to your coffee is an easy way to reap the health benefits of both. Here are some ways in which adding coconut oil to your coffee may improve health: Studies show that MCTs in coconut oil and caffeine in coffee may , which can increase the number of calories you burn in a day (, , ). Coffee contains caffeine, which can help you feel less tired. Coconut oil packs MCTs, which are transported straight to your liver and can act as a quick source of energy as well (, ). Coconut oil MCTs and coffee compounds like caffeine and chlorogenic acids may help stimulate your bowels and keep your digestive system healthy (, ). Several studies have found that coconut oil can raise levels of HDL cholesterol, which is protective against heart disease (, ). However, adding coconut oil to coffee also has its drawbacks. For starters, many people who add it to their morning coffee use it as a breakfast replacement. Doing so means that you may miss out on many important nutrients that you would get from eating a more . While coconut oil has some nutrients, it won’t have as many as a nutritious breakfast that contains many different food groups. What’s more, coconut oil is high in calories, providing 121 calories per tablespoon (14 grams). Most people who add it to coffee tend to use 2 tablespoons — an extra 242 calories (). If this doesn’t sound like much, note that it would take a 155-pound (70-kg) person nearly 50 minutes of walking at a brisk pace (3.5 miles or 5.6 km per hour) to burn that many calories (). Additionally, while the combined effect of coconut oil and coffee may slightly boost your metabolism, it’s more likely to make you if you don’t account for the added calories. The calories in a few tablespoons of coconut oil are likely to exceed the calories expended due to the small metabolism increase related to the ingestion of the MCTs and caffeine. What’s more, certain medical conditions like gallbladder issues or pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) may make it necessary to limit your fat intake (, ). Coconut oil is much more effective when you use it to replace less healthy fats in your diet, such as those from processed foods, rather than on top of the fats you’re currently consuming. Adding coconut oil to coffee can offer some health benefits. Still, it has potential drawbacks, such as replacing a more nutritious meal and adding too many calories. Plus, certain medical conditions may make it necessary to limit your fat intake. If you want to try coconut oil in your cup of joe, start small by adding 1 tablespoon (14 grams) to hot coffee and stirring it thoroughly to ensure that the oil incorporates well. Some people prefer to blend the oil with in a blender to make a delicious tropical-style beverage. Eventually, you can work your way up to 2 tablespoons (28 grams) of coconut oil if you would like to increase your fat intake. This may be most appropriate for those attempting to reach and maintain ketosis. Avoid adding too much coconut oil too quickly, especially if you follow a low- to moderate-fat diet, as it may cause nausea and laxative-like symptoms. Besides, 2 tablespoons (28 grams) is plenty to reap the health benefits of this tasty, healthy fat (, ). Start by adding 1 tablespoon (14 grams) of coconut oil to your hot coffee. You can slowly work your way up to twice as much. Note that adding too much coconut oil too quickly may cause unpleasant side effects. If you’re watching your calorie or fat intake for medical or personal reasons, avoid putting coconut oil into your coffee. Still, if you follow a or want to include this healthy fat in your diet, then adding it to your coffee can be an easy way to increase your intake. To avoid unpleasant side effects, start slowly and add no more than 1 tablespoon (14 grams) of coconut oil at first. — Bulletproof coffee is a recipe for a morning coffee drink containing butter and MCT oil.

Reviewed By: Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition that usually starts in childhood, but can occur in adults (30 to 40-year-olds). In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas produces very little insulin. Insulin helps cells in the body convert sugar into energy. When the pancreas cannot make enough insulin, sugar starts to build up in the blood, causing life-threatening complications. Individuals with type 1 diabetes must take some form of insulin for the rest of their lives. Unusual thirst is a very common symptom of type 1 diabetes. This condition causes the kidneys to remove excess sugar in the blood by getting rid of more water. The water is removed through urinating, causing dehydration and dehydration causes you to drink more water. Patient with type 1 diabetes develop unintentional weight loss and an increase in appetite because blood sugar levels remain high and the body metabolizes fat for energy. Disrupted glucose metabolism also causes patient to feel a lack of energy and drowsy for extended periods Excess urination also cause weight loss because many calories are leaving the body in urine. The disruption in glucose metabolism in patient with type 1 diabetes causes skin changes. Type 1 diabetics are at a higher risk for bacterial infections and fungal infections. Poor blood circulation in the skin may also occur. Patient with type 1 diabetes are often infected with fungal infections caused by the yeast Candida albicans. Common fungal infections include athlete's foot, vaginal yeast infection in women, jock itch, ringworm, and diaper rashes in babies. Diaper rash caused by the yeast Candida albicans can spread to other areas of the body such as the stomach and legs. Patient with untreated type 1 diabetes can experience serious symptoms such as blurry vision, numbness or tingling in the extremities (especially the feet), loss of consciousness, fatigue, fruity breath, dry mouth, and diabetic coma. In contrast to high sugars in the blood, occasionally patient with type 1 diabetes can get low blood sugars (hypoglycemia) when their blood glucose level falls suddenly. In patient with type 1 diabetes, loss of consciousness, diabetic coma, and in some cases hypoglycemia, are medical emergencies. Some people who are undiagnosed may have no warning signs, yet still can develop diabetic coma or hypoglycemia. The problem with type 1 diabetes is that the person's cells are deprived of the sugar they need for energy. Without the insulin produced by the pancreas, sugar has difficulty entering the body's cells. Consequently, the body cells start burning fat for energy, which causes ketones to build up in the blood. These acids can change the person's blood pH level and can trigger a life-threatening coma. This is termed diabetic ketoacidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency that needs to be treated quickly, usually in a hospital setting. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include the following: What is the Difference Between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes? Type 1 diabetes usually starts in childhood or young adulthood, whereas type 2 diabetes usually starts in adulthood. In patient with type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system attacks and destroys pancreatic cells (Beta cells) that produce insulin. In patient with type 2 diabetes, the pancreas is not attacked and usually produces insulin. However, patient with type 2 diabetes, for numerous reasons, cannot use the available insulin effectively. Patient with type 2 diabetes can have the same symptoms as patient with type 1 diabetes, but patient with type 1 diabetes usually have symptoms occur more rapidly. Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented, but type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with a healthy lifestyle. When the body’s immune system destroys beta cells in part of the pancreas, type 1 diabetes develops. Beta cells in the pancreas produce insulin. Researchers are not sure why a person's immune system attacks its own insulin producing cells. However, researchers and clinicians suspect that genetic susceptibility and environmental factors raise the risk for developing type 1 diabetes. Scientists have identified genes and gene regions that raise the risk of developing type 1 diabetes, but they are not the only factors that cause the disease. Researchers suggest that environmental triggers such as a viral infection or perhaps dietary or pregnancy-related factors may also play a role in developing type 1 diabetes. Although type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, about two-thirds of new cases are diagnosed in individuals under the age of 19. Researchers have noted two peak times for development of type 1 diabetes; the first is in early childhood and the second occurs at puberty. Type 1 diabetes affects males and females equally, and is more common in Caucasians than in other ethnic groups. A family history of type 1 diabetes also increases one’s risk for developing type 1 diabetes. Simple blood tests can indicate the presence of abnormal sugar levels in the blood. If a person has any symptoms of diabetes, a fasting blood sugar test or even a random blood sugar test is usually the first step in diagnosis. A hemoglobin A1c test can reveal average blood sugar levels for the past 2 to 3 months. In most cases these tests are repeated on at least two separate days. Other tests used are the glucose tolerance test or testing for specific antibodies in the blood. Type 1 diabetes damages arteries and makes them susceptible to hardening (atherosclerosis), which can lead to high blood pressure and other heart and circulation problems. Unfortunately, undiagnosed or prolonged high blood sugar levels can result in damage to organ systems in the body over time. Patient with type 1 diabetes have a high risk of vision problems, heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, gum disease, tooth loss, and nerve damage (especially in the hands and feet). Other organs may also be damaged. For patient with diabetes, complications that can damage organs can be prevented or reduced by regulating their blood sugar level. This is done by pricking the finger and putting a drop of blood on a test strip. The strip is then placed in a monitor that reads the glucose level. Close monitoring of glucose levels allows the individual to regulate their blood sugar by either medication if the sugar is high, or taking in sugar if the level is low. If a person with diabetes is able to keep blood sugar levels in or near the normal range, they will decrease the likelihood of developing complications and have more energy and fewer problems related to diabetes. Another device that measures glucose is termed a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM). This system consists of a tiny sensor under the skin to check blood sugar levels. It send the information to a cell phone sized device that records an average glucose value every five minutes for about 72 hours. CGM is now accepted for long term use in some patients with models that turn off insulin infusion when sugars start to drop. Every person with type 1 diabetes needs to take insulin to help their body process sugar in the blood. Most people with type 1 diabetes take insulin in the injectable form and require several shots per day. There are different types of insulin available. Rapid-acting insulin starts to work within a few minutes and lasts for a couple of hours. Regular or short-acting insulin takes about 30 minutes to work and lasts 3-6 hours. Intermediate-acting insulin takes 2-4 hours to work and lasts up to 18 hours. You and your doctor can adjust your insulin shots based on results of blood sugar testing. As previously stated, the goal is to keep glucose levels in the blood within normal range as often as possible. Insulin can be injected using a needle and syringe, a cartridge system, or a pre-filled pen system. Inhaled insulin, insulin pumps, and a quick-acting insulin device can also be used. If injecting insulin into your body the best place is the abdomen, but the arms, thighs, and buttocks are also effective. Insulin is a hormone from the pancreas that allows sugar to enter the cells. Insulin also lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream. Without insulin, sugar is unable to enter the cells. This means that cells that make up muscles and other tissues will not be able to receive their main source of energy. Patient with type 1 diabetes will have a buildup of sugar in the bloodstream, causing life-threatening conditions. Although insulin is a wonderful drug that helps people with diabetes, it needs to be used carefully. If a person takes too much insulin it is possible the blood sugar level will lower into dangerous levels. This situation is termed an insulin reaction (low blood sugar due to excessive insulin). Too much insulin can result in symptoms that may be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how low and how long the low blood sugar levels exist in a person's blood. Some signs and symptoms of low blood sugar include fatigue, excessive yawning, mild confusion, decreased coordination, sweating, muscle twitching, and pale skin. As these symptoms get progressively worse, seizures, loss of consciousness, and even death may occur. People with diabetes, especially type 1 diabetes, are advised to carry about 15 grams of a quick-acting carbohydrate at all times. Quick-acting carbohydrates are foods or drinks containing glucose that is rapidly absorbed into the body and the blood. Examples include a half-cup of fruit juice or a non-diet soda, five Life Savers (small hard candies), two tablespoons of raisins, one cup of milk, or three glucose tablets. These carbohydrates may resolve mild to moderate insulin reactions. For severe reactions, a drug called glucagon should be injected under the skin by a family member or friend familiar with treating severe insulin reactions and the person should be seen by a medical health care professional. Although many people administer insulin through several shots per day, some people may be able to utilize an insulin pump. This pump delivers insulin around-the-clock by pushing insulin through a thin tube inserted into the person's skin. The insulin pump can be programmed to deliver exact amounts of insulin in a continuous dose as well as deliver extra doses certain times, typically when eating. People with diabetes are encouraged to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this insulin delivery system with their doctor. There is a test called the hemoglobin A1c blood test that is used to help determine how well a person is managing their blood glucose levels. This test is taken at the doctor's office and measures how well the blood sugar has been controlled over a 2 to 3 month span. If the results show poor blood sugar control (high A1c levels), it suggests that the person's insulin therapy, dietary habits, and/or physical activity be modified to lower blood sugar levels into a more normal range. Some people with diabetes fail insulin therapy and may have reactions to the insulin that is injected. These people may be candidates for a procedure that some clinicians consider experimental. The procedure is a transfer of healthy insulin-producing cells from a donor into the pancreas of the patient with type 1 diabetes. Although there are benefits to this procedure, there are also drawbacks including medications with serious side effects that must be used to prevent rejection of the donor cells, and the probability that the transplanted cells may only function for a few years. People with type 1 diabetes benefit from exercise, but they need to take precautions to prevent sudden drops in blood glucose levels. Diabetics should check their blood sugars before exercising and may require eating a snack before or during exercise. They may need to adjust their insulin dosage before exercising to ensure they stay within normal ranges of blood glucose. People with type 1 diabetes may also need to check their urine for ketones – ketones suggest that your blood sugar is too high. Strenuous activity needs to be avoided if ketones are detected or if your blood sugar level is either high or low before exercise. People with type 1 diabetes, like everyone else, need to eat a well-balanced diet. This will help their insulin therapy and reduce the chance of diabetic complications. There is no “diabetes diet”. Even a person with type 1 diabetes can eat sweets as long as it is part of a well-balanced diet. That is not to say they can eat anything all the time, but they need to consider how sweets can fit into their well-balanced diet. Type 1 diabetics should also consider the fact that carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels faster than any other food. Food low in carbs, but high in calcium, potassium, fiber, magnesium, and other vitamins are excellent food choices for diabetics. Consider the following guidelines when planning your meals: Healthcare workers such as dietitians can help people with diabetes plan a well-balanced and varied diet. Women with type 1 diabetes need to let their doctors know if they plan to become pregnant. Poor control of their blood sugars may cause complications such as birth defects. Planning ahead, even before conception, to control blood sugar levels can lower the risk of miscarriage and birth defects. During pregnancy, it is important to test blood glucose often and keep your A1c below 7%. Good blood sugar control can reduce other complications during pregnancy such as high blood pressure or retinal damage in the mother. Preeclampsia is a condition that 18%-30% of pregnant women with diabetes develop. Preeclampsia develops after the 20-week mark and is characterized by high blood pressure and proteins in the urine. It is important to treat preeclampsia, if untreated it may harm the baby and put the mother at risk for stroke and seizures. Once the baby is born and if the mother is breastfeeding, it is important for her to check her glucose levels frequently. In the United States, 13,000 children are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes each year. Diagnosis of diabetes in children is a life-changing situation because it affects the whole family. Parents must help children monitor blood sugar and plan family meals that are appropriate for the child with diabetes and other family members. Insulin dosages must be monitored and blood sugar levels need to be checked by the child’s caregivers. Diabetes in children is a 24-hour-a-day problem that needs to be considered when a child is attending school and participating in extracurricular activities. Parents and their children need to make arrangements to follow through with insulin treatments even while the child is at school. These arrangements need to be planned in advance, as not every state or school may participate in the child’s care the same way. Researchers are attempting to develop an artificial pancreas. This device is a combination of an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring system controlled by a computer program. The goal for the system is to release insulin in response to blood sugar levels and to reduce the release of insulin if blood sugar levels drop. The goal is to have a device that mimics the function of a normal pancreas. Some early trials of experimental devices suggest this device may be available in the future.

Diabetes: What Raises and Lowers Your Blood Sugar Level? Reviewed By: There are many different ways that blood sugar (glucose levels in the blood) can be affected and may cause problems with sugar control in people with diabetes. Each person reacts differently to a variety of things that influence blood sugar. People with diabetes should be aware of certain compounds and activities that influence blood sugar levels. One of these compounds is caffeine. Blood sugar levels can rise after drinking coffee, black tea, and caffeinated energy because of their caffeine content. Read on to learn more compounds that may alter blood glucose levels, along with methods people with diabetes can use to see what substances and behaviors influence their own blood sugar levels. A number of foods claim to be ""sugar-free."" But these foods may still raise blood sugar levels because many contain carbohydrates in the form of starch or fiber. Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol and xylitol add sweetness to foods but still may have enough associated carbohydrates to raise blood sugar levels. Foods with high levels of carbohydrates are likely to raise blood sugar levels very high, and eventually high blood sugar levels may cause organ damage over time in people with diabetes. Foods high in fat can cause your blood sugar to stay higher for longer. Pizza, French fries, and most fried foods are high in carbohydrates and fat. So are many Chinese food favorites like egg rolls and the breaded chicken found in sweet and sour chicken. It's a good idea to monitor your blood sugar about two hours after you eat such foods to see how your blood sugar levels are affected. Dehydration can elevate your blood sugar so it is wise to stay well-hydrated. If you are sick, have diarrhea and vomiting for more than two hours, or a prolonged illness lasting more than a few days, the illness may alter your blood sugar. Moreover, blood sugar rises as your body tries to fight any type of illness. Medications such as antibiotics and decongestants may alter your blood sugar. Check your blood sugar levels during these intermittent special situations so you can help determine how your body will react to these illnesses and treatments. Stress may cause your body to release hormones that can make your blood sugar rise. This is more common in people with type 2 diabetes. Practice relaxation techniques with deep breathing and exercise, if you can, to reduce stress. Are bagels better than bread? Well, bagels are better at increasing sugar levels in the blood than bread because bagels are packed with carbohydrates and calories. If you've just got to have a bagel, choose a mini bagel, or a thin bagel. If you love your morning bagel, try and find healthy alternatives by discussing your diet preferences with a health care professional or dietician. Although the main design for sports drinks is to help individuals replenish fluids quickly, many of them contain lots of sugar. For moderate workouts of less than an hour, plain water should replenish your fluids. For more intense workouts, a sports drink may be appropriate, but people with diabetes should check with their doctor to see which sports drinks is best for them. Although fruit is a healthy choice for most of us, people with diabetes should be aware dried fruits contain a large amount of carbohydrates in a small serving size. For example, two tablespoons of dried raisins, cranberries, or cherries have the same amount of carbohydrates as a small piece of fresh fruit. Three dried dates contain 15 g of carbohydrates so eating a handful or two of dried fruits may cause high spikes in blood glucose levels in many people. Steroids, commonly used to treat rashes, arthritis, asthma, and other medical conditions, can cause blood sugar levels to rise. Corticosteroids such as prednisone may trigger the development of diabetes in people with a tendency toward diabetes. Diuretics (water pills) may raise blood sugar levels, while antidepressants may either raise or lower them. If you need to take these medications and have diabetes, carefully monitor your blood glucose levels to see how these medications affect you. Cold medicines often contain the decongestants pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine; they also may contain sugar and/or alcohol. These components may raise your blood sugar levels. However, antihistamines don't cause a problem with blood sugar levels. If you decide to purchase over-the-counter cold medicines, ask the pharmacist about the possible effects it may have on your blood glucose levels. A leisurely day in the sun can have consequences for your blood sugar. Even after you cool down, if you acquired a sunburn you could be raising your glucose levels in the shade. The CDC explains that the lasting pain of a sunburn can cause stress, and that stress can increase your blood sugar. Gum disease (periodontitis) is extremely common. The CDC estimates that half of all American adults over age 30 have it. This gum infection may cause serious glucose changes in your blood, too. It raises blood sugar, and it may leave you more vulnerable to developing type 2 diabetes. Estrogen in birth control pills can affect the way a person with diabetes may respond to insulin. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) advises women with diabetes to use a birth control pill containing norgestimate and a synthetic estrogen. The ADA also says birth control injections and implants are safe for women with diabetes, but suggests they still have some effect on blood sugars. If women elect to use these birth control methods, they should monitor their blood sugar levels, especially for several weeks when these agents are first administered. Women with diabetes should discuss their birth control options with their doctor. Normal activities such as mowing the lawn or cleaning the house count as moderate physical activity for a person with diabetes (and for other people, too!). This type of activity may help lower the blood sugar in a person with diabetes. People with diabetes should participate in mild to moderate physical activity because the activity may lower blood glucose and increase overall fitness. Probiotic foods may help people with diabetes by improving digestion. Yogurt, for example, is reported to contain ""healthy"" bacteria that may help protect against gastrointestinal problems. The best yogurt choice is plain yogurt or ""light yogurt"" with no added sugar or fruit. People with diabetes who switched to a vegan diet (no meat or animal products such as dairy or egg consumed) or entirely plant–based diet, according to some researchers, had a much better blood sugar control and required less insulin. Although the mechanism is not entirely clear, whole grains, fiber, and beans may function by slowing down carbohydrate digestion, thereby producing sugars at a lower rate. People with diabetes should check with their doctor before they make any major changes to their diet. Some studies suggest sprinkling your food with cinnamon may lower blood sugar in individuals with type II diabetes. Study investigators suggest cinnamon can add flavor without adding salt, carbohydrates, or calories. Moreover, cinnamon may improve the body's ability to use insulin. People with diabetes should discuss use of cinnamon with their health care professional before making any dietary changes. To determine how blood sugar fluctuates during a typical 24-hour period it is important to test it regularly. Blood sugar can fall low during sleep for some people with type I diabetes; these people may benefit from a small snack just before bedtime. For other people, blood sugar can rise in the morning even before eating breakfast – this is due in part to changes in hormones or a drop in insulin levels. A good way to determine how your body utilizes glucose is to use a continuous blood glucose monitor on occasion. It can help you determine the blood glucose fluctuations that are normal for you. Most clinicians agree that physical activity almost always can improve an individual's health, whether they have diabetes or have normal blood glucose levels. Unfortunately, when people with diabetes do intense or endurance types of exercise, their blood sugars may spike up and then drop for as long as 24 hours. People with diabetes should check their blood sugar before, during, and after exercises to be sure their blood sugar levels don't go too high or too low. Good blood glucose monitoring, coupled with appropriate treatments, can avoid this blood glucose roller coaster effect of highs and lows. The same roller coaster effect of high and low blood sugar that occurs with exercise can occur when people with diabetes drink alcohol. At first, glucose levels may rise, but then they can fall and remain low as long as 12 hours after drinking. The roller coaster effect can be reduced if the person eats food when drinking alcohol. Alcoholic drinks can also contain a lot of carbohydrates. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) suggests a woman should drink only one alcoholic beverage per day, and they suggest no more than two per day for men. One alcoholic drink is equal to 5 ounces of wine, 12 ounces of beer, or 1.5 ounces of liquor (whiskey or vodka). Being overly hot and sweating makes your blood sugar more difficult to control. Going in and out of air conditioning can have a roller coaster-like effect on your blood glucose levels. Staying in air-conditioned environments during the heat of the day and drinking plenty of water to avoid dehydration is a good way to avoid heat–related problems in controlling your blood sugar. In addition, people with diabetes should know that their medications, the glucose meter, and test strips could be affected by high heat such as the type of heat that can occur in a hot car or on a windowsill in the sun. Keep these items at room temperature. Another roller coaster effect of high and low blood sugar occurs due to hormone changes. Women's blood glucose levels fluctuate during the menstrual cycle and during menopause. Frequent blood sugar level tests can help people with diabetes manage this roller coaster effect due to hormonal changes. Your physician may provide hormone replacement therapy, but should discuss with you the risks and benefits of this therapy and how it may interact with your blood sugar levels. If you are a chocoholic and/or have a huge sweet tooth and have diabetes, you do not have to give these items up forever. The key is to understand that sugar compounds will increase your blood sugar levels more quickly than other carbohydrates, but the total amount of carbohydrate intake is most important. Consequently, if people with diabetes can , they can enjoy their favorite foods as long as they take into account that the overall total carbohydrate intake and calories do not exceed their usual dietary levels. This means a small serving of sweets should be offset by eating other foods that contain no ""sweets."" The glycemic index (GI) of foods is a rating of how individual foods raise blood sugar. The daily carbohydrate total is one way to manage blood glucose levels. Consequently, eating beans and whole grains that have a lower glycemic index than white bread or pasta can help keep blood sugars lower. So, if you want a small amount of high glycemic index foods (a small piece of pie, for example), it would be better to have the rest of the daily carbohydrate total made from low glycemic index foods. The ADA has glycemic index ratings and offers diet suggestions for people with diabetes. Diabetes: What Raises and Lowers Your Blood Sugar Level?

bfb3ea88-8779-4e56-961e-002d07c93e48,"Natural options against weight gain, sugar cravings, and insulin resistance The holidays have come and gone, but many of us may still be battling intense sweet cravings leftover from the season's festivities. Excessive sugar cravings can be a sign that your blood glucose levels are out of balance which, if left unchecked, can lead to insulin resistance and Metabolic Syndrome, also known as ""Pre-Diabetes."" ""The good news is that there are natural solutions to help balance blood glucose, improve metabolism and reduce sugar cravings, while supporting overall health,"" says Dr. Isaac Eliaz M.D., L.Ac. Metabolic Syndrome is characterized by a set of conditions that also mark the development of , giving it the name ""Pre-Diabetes."" Excessive fat around the abdomen (>40 inches for men and >35 inches for women) Low HDL (""good"" cholesterol) and high LDL (""bad"" cholesterol) Hyper-viscous coagulation marked by high fibrinogen - a sticky fibrous coagulant in blood Insulin resistance (your body isn't using insulin or blood sugar properly) The most dominant risk factors are obesity and accompanying insulin resistance, marked by elevated fasting blood glucose levels. Factors contributing to Metabolic Syndrome are poor diet, lack of exercise and chronic stress. Eating foods that are high in sugar and fat causes our insulin levels to spike. Dr. Eliaz says, ""Over time, our cells become less sensitive to insulin and our blood glucose levels rise. This increase in circulating blood glucose causes numerous inflammatory and degenerative conditions. The solution is to focus on foods that are low on the glycemic index."" Emphasize fiber and protein-rich foods, and limit simple carbohydrates and sugars to prevent glucose and insulin levels from spiking - causing insulin resistance - the hallmark of Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes II. According to Dr. Eliaz, regular exercise is also an important component in the prevention of Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes II, as it allows our cells to be more receptive to circulating blood glucose. Healthy stress relief is also critical since stress hormones such as cortisol cause cells and tissues to release extra glucose into the blood stream. Specific botanicals and nutrients can help control Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes II by balancing blood sugar, improving insulin sensitivity, boosting metabolism and curbing sugar cravings: If you're struggling with weight gain, sugar cravings, insulin resistance or any metabolic health issues, these natural options can help protect against and even reverse such concerns over time.

33e2278a-4d48-4310-8686-f35adff1bddd,"Week 7 Assignment 1—Metabolism Ketosis develops in the postabsorptive state. What is ketosis? Why does it develop? What metabolic effects does it have? Ketosis means our bodies are using fat for energy. Ketones (also called ketone bodies) are molecules generated during fat . Most of the fats our bodies break down for energy is converted into ATP, which is the “energy molecule.” Ketones are produced as part of the process. When people eat fewer carbohydrates, more ketones are generated. Some of these ketones (acetoacetate and B-hydroxybutyrate) are used for energy; the heart muscle and kidneys prefer ketones to glucose. Most of the cells in the body can use ketones as part of their energy. However, this is not true for acetone which cannot be used, and is excreted as waste mostly in the urine and breath. Sometimes a metabolic condition develops that causes a distinct odor in the breath. If there is enough acetone in the urine which can be detected with a Ketostix, this detection in the urine is called “ketosis.” Another metabolic condition is Ketoacidosis which can develop in people with Type 1 diabetes which may be confused with normal ketosis. (lowcarbdiet.about.com) What happens during catabolism? How is this related to nitrogen balance? . The body can synthase 100,000 to 140,000 different proteins with various forms functions, and structures. Each of these proteins contains some of the same 20 amino acids. In normal conditions, cellular proteins are recycled in the cytosol, peptide bonds are broken, and the free amino acids are used in new proteins. If other energy sources are inadequate, mitochondria can generate ATP by breaking down amino acids in the TCA cycle.

GFR is equal to the amount secreted divided by the plasma concentration. The GFR is usually reported in milliliters per minute. A more accurate GFR determination can be performed using insulin, which is not metabolized in the body, and is neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the tubules. During a single day, the glomeruli generate about 180 liters (48 gal) of filtrate, nearly 70 times the total plasma volume, 99 percent of which is reabsorbed. This factor makes you appreciate tubular reabsorption! Reference Martini, Frederic H. & Nath, Judi L. Fundamentals of Anatomy & Physiology. 8th Edition. Pearson Learning Solutions, 2008.

The foods we eat that contain carbohydrates cause our blood sugar levels to increase, transporter proteins push the glucose into our muscles, liver cells and fat where our bodies store or end up using the glucose. The cells in our bodies can’t directly use the glucose, so it has to be converted into molecules that cells then use as an energy source.

The smaller valve of km suggest that the affinity of the enzymes is higher. Fatty acids are normally metabolised through citric acid cycle after it is formed into acetyl CoA though, it is used for ketogenesis;β-oxidisation is occur to generate ketone body during glucose supply is insufficient. Ketone bodies are vital in terms of surviving with little or non energy source supply and saving nitorogen loss from the body. Ketone bodies produced in the liver are not used in the liver though it is used as primal energy source in the brain, skeletal muscle, heart and kidneys. However, prolonged ketogenesis can cause ketoacidosis which can expose the body to danger causing dehydration or comatose. Therefore ketone production seems to be controlled by several hormones and enzymes. Sometimes, however, your muscles use the process of fermentation. Can you explain why? Since our muscles generally get their muscles from contracting from the breakdown of glucose, there is another way such as the Lactic Acid Fermentation that is a process of fermentation that can be used. It is used because when our oxygen is low. So when our muscles font get enough oxygen from breathing we use fermentation. When the sugar in the blood is raised, a hormone known as insulin is secreted. The insulin then converts a portion of the glucose into glycogen, which is found in muscle tissue and the liver. If the glycogen storage areas are filled, and there is still more glucose in the blood, that the body does not need, the remaining glucose is then converted into triglyceride. Triglyceride is the main chemical component of adipose tissue- otherwise known as the visible fat on the body ( Dr. Atkins’ 46-50). How does the Atkins’ diet differ from other diets? Even when half of the pancreas is removed, the blood sugar level can still remain normal. The pancreas is also made up of exocrine glands, which produce enzymes for digestion. When the blood sugar levels aren’t normal, it’s a disease called diabetes. Diabetes (diabetes mellitus) is a deficiency of the hormone insulin or the inhibition of its action with the cells. The insulin acts like a bridge between the glucose and the cells. The Role of Advanced Glycation End Products in Diabetes and Heart Disease Just how these processes come about can be explained in the molecular and cellular level by the formation of AGEs. Simple sugars such as glucose and fructose that are usually derived from a sugar-rich diet become attached to nucleic acids and protein molecules to form unstable compounds that eventually accumulate to become destructive, more stable compounds called AGEs. Although AGEs are known to be produced by the body at slow, but constant rates from birth, the process can accelerate with increased consumption of sugars as well as decreased metabolism of these substances. AGEs alter the mechanical properties of cells and tissues by crosslinking intracellular and extracellular proteins. They also bind to cell surface receptors called receptor for AGEs (RAGE), thus interrupting various cellular processes. Cells have receptor sites, like keyholes, that receive insulin. When insulin attaches to a receptor site, a passageway is created that enables glucose to enter the cell. Once glucose is absorbed in this manner, it can be immediately used for the use of energy or it can be stored as glycogen in the liver and muscle cells for future use. Excess glucose is converted into fat. The normal fasting glucose level is 70-100 mg/dl; after meals is 70-140 mg/dl. Our bodies are able to burn both fat and carbohydrates for energy. Reducing carbohydrates and eating more protein and fat, our bodies naturally lose weight by burning stored body fat more efficiently. Since fats and proteins take longer to digest than carbohydrates, one effect of the diet is to prolong the onset of hunger. Our body produces insulin in response to sugar intake. When the body has excess sugar, the production of insulin will increase. The Role of Advanced Glycation End Products in Diabetes and Heart Disease Copyright © 2000-2020. 123Helpme.com.

74f18823-8fd2-4589-91ed-3209abf8b2cf,"— Panera Bread is a popular chain restaurant offering soups, salads, sandwiches, pasta, and pastries. However, if you’re on the very low carb, high fat keto diet, you may wonder whether you can safely eat at Panera. While most menu items are too carb-heavy as is, you can customize several dishes to fit the diet. The following options contain up to 12 grams of net carbs per item and can be worked into a carefully planned keto diet. Panera Bread also has a robust nutrition calculator built into the menu on their website, but the calculator doesn’t allow you to remove bread from sandwiches. Thus, you may need to do your own math to estimate the carb count of other menu items without bread (). Here are 10 of the best keto options at Panera Bread. At Panera Bread, breakfast sandwiches are typically served on a bagel or in a wrap, but it’s simple enough to skip the bread. This light breakfast is perfectly keto-friendly when you remove the bread and tomatoes. In fact, to make it even more filling, you can opt for a regular egg instead of . Order: the Avocado, Egg White, & Spinach, with no tomatoes and no bagel This hearty breakfast option is full of fat and protein to . All you need to do to make it keto is remove the ciabatta bread. Order: the Sausage, Scrambled Egg, & Cheese, with no bread 3. Chipotle Chicken, Scrambled Egg, & Avocado wrap (no tortilla) This wrap — without the , of course — makes a great keto-friendly breakfast with a bit of a kick from Peppadew peppers and chipotle aioli. Order: the Chipotle Chicken, Scrambled Egg, & Avocado wrap, with no tortilla Many Panera sandwiches are keto-friendly if you remove the bread, but you also need to be wary of certain sauces, such as barbecue sauce, and high carb veggies like tomatoes and onions. Furthermore, you can ask your local Panera Bread whether they can turn the sandwich into a lettuce wrap, which will make your breadless sandwich more portable and easier to eat. 4. Roasted Turkey & Avocado BLT (no bread or tomatoes) When you remove the bread and tomatoes, this item is full of keto-friendly goodness — turkey, bacon, , greens, and mayo. Order: the Roasted Turkey & Avocado BLT with no bread and no tomatoes This simple sandwich featuring ham, Swiss cheese, mayo, , and greens makes a great keto-friendly meal when the bread is removed. The Chipotle Chicken Avocado Melt features smoked, pulled chicken, Gouda cheese, avocado, , Peppadew peppers, and chipotle mayo for a spicy, Southwestern flavor. Order: Many salads at Panera Bread are surprisingly high in carbs due to the addition of croutons, tortilla strips, beans, corn, fruit, or other high carb toppings. Additionally, many of their are loaded with sugar. To reduce the carb count, order your dressing on the side — and only use what you need. Below are the three most keto-friendly salads, when customized. When you leave out the croutons, the Caesar Salad is keto-friendly. It’s made even more so with the addition of . Notably, the Caesar dressing itself is low in carbs. Order: the Caesar Salad with chicken, without croutons — dressing on the side With just a few changes, the Greek Salad with Greek dressing is great for keto. Just remove the red onions and , which are high in carbs, and add chicken for a protein boost. Order: the Greek Salad with chicken — no tomatoes, no onions, and dressing on the side 9. Green Goddess Cobb Salad (no onions or tomatoes, different dressing) This Cobb salad is piled high with fresh salad greens, chicken, avocado, a hard-boiled egg, and . Make sure to skip the tomatoes and pickled red onions, and sub in Caesar dressing for the typical Green Goddess dressing, which is carb-heavy. Order: the Green Goddess Cobb Salad, no pickled red onions and no tomatoes, with Caesar dressing on the side (no Green Goddess dressing) Skip the famous bread bowls and stick to this one low carb option if you want keto-friendly soup at Panera Bread. Unfortunately, the other soups — even those that don’t seem carb-heavy — harbor 20 or more grams of net carbs per serving. While relatively high in net carbs for the keto diet, this veggie soup is the only soup offering at Panera Bread that’s remotely keto-friendly. Add or avocado to boost the fat content and make this a more substantial meal. It’s easy to eat keto at Panera if you stick to sandwiches without bread. If you choose a menu item that’s not on this list, here are a few tips to minimize the carb count: Order with no bread, no tomatoes, and no onions. If the sandwich contains a sugary sauce like barbecue sauce, replace it with a low carb option like or mustard. Order with no croutons, tortilla strips, beans, corn, tomatoes, fruit pieces, wonton strips, or onions. Choose low carb dressings like Greek, Caesar, or plain olive oil, and keep the dressing on the side. Opt for no bread bowl and no crackers, croutons, tortilla strips, or frizzled (fried) onions.

c4b77cf6-abaa-4104-ab37-ebcdd1a8dcd5,"When blood sugar levels are over 400 mg/dl, it’s no joke. There are many serious risks associated with blood sugar levels this high, but the good news is there are ways to prevent such high levels. Normal blood sugar levels range from 70 mg/dl to 120 mg/dl. High blood sugar levels may cause you to feel tired, thirsty and feel the urge to urinate frequently. Other side effects include increased susceptibility to infections and blurry vision.For diabetics who are in the later stages in life, a high blood sugar level can result in dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. While the symptoms discussed above are associated with high blood sugar levels in general, there are two main dangers that are specifically linked to blood sugar levels over 400. The first is hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome (HHNS). HHNS occurs when the body’s blood sugar levels rise to unsafe levels. As a result, the body tries to get rid of the excess sugar by passing it into the urine. Eventually this could result in severe dehydration which in turn can lead to seizures, coma and even death. There are several reasons why HHNS can occur: illness, infection, skipping doses of medicine or not adhering to one’s prescribed meal plan. Symptoms of HHNS include extreme thirst, dry skin, high fever, sleepiness, loss of vision, hallucinations and weakness on one side of the body. If you are experiencing the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately. In the meantime, drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration and test your sugar so that you can report your findings to the doctor. The other danger that is associated with high blood sugar levels is diabetic ketoacidosis. This condition occurs when there are high levels of ketones (acids that build up in the blood) in the body from excess blood sugar. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include thirst, frequent urination, sleepiness, dry skin, nausea, trouble breathing, confusion and high blood sugar levels. Should you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately as diabetic ketoacidosis can result in coma or death. Be sure to check your urine for ketones every 4 to 6 hours so that you can monitor the situation and keep your doctor updated. Although these short-term effects of blood sugar levels over 400 can be frightening, the long-term effects are also to be concerned with. Persistent high blood sugar levels can result in eye disease, also known as retinopathy, which can lead to blindness. Another complication is kidney disease, known as nephropathy, which can lead to kidney failure. Neuropathy which is a nerve disease that commonly leads to amputations. There are a host of other issues that can occur as a result of unchecked sugar levels including, heart disease. There is no doubt that having a blood sugar level over 400 is a dangerous thing, but the question is, what can you do to lower these risks? Proper diet is key to lowering the risks associated with high blood sugar. Since carbohydrates are the body’s main source of blood sugar, diabetics need to eat carbohydrates that the body will break down very slowly to avoid large upswings in blood sugar levels. The glycemic index rates carbohydrates according to how long it takes the body to absorb them and how severely they impact blood sugar levels. Diabetics should try to stick with carbohydrates rated 55 or less on the glycemic index. Carbohydrates rated between 56 and 69 should be consumed in moderation, and those with a glycemic-index rating of 70 and higher should be avoided. In addition to eating right, make sure you follow your doctor’s guidelines for taking your diabetes medication and checking your sugar. Set a specific time for these activities so that you do not forget. Diabetes does not have to be a life changing condition. With hard work and consistency, you can stay healthy for many years to come. ABCNews.com: What Causes High Blood Sugar And What Harm Can It Do To My Body?

By: | Tags:            As many as 61.3 million people in India suffer from diabetes, and according to estimates, one in every 5 people in India will be diabetic by 2025. Being diagnosed with the disease not only leads to changes in lifestyle and diet, but it could also lead to a variety of other ailments ranging from kidney disease to nerve damage. This makes it an urgent concern and we from  have announced a War on Diabetes. In this post, we’ll tell you everything you need to know about the condition.

It can be caused either due to the lack of insulin (type 1 diabetes) or because the body’s cells fail to respond to the insulin produced (type 2 diabetes). There’s another form of diabetes that afflicts pregnant women called gestational diabetes. Also Read - Beware! Excessive thirst could be a signal of serious health problem In diabetes, the body is unable to absorb glucose which leads to a host of problems. Here are some of the symptoms that could indicate diabetes: 9.     Blurred vision (Read: ) Our digestive system breaks down whatever food we eat into glucose. This glucose is absorbed by the blood with the help of a hormone called insulin. Diabetes occurs when the body is not able to produce insulin or is not able to use it effectively. Here are some of the reasons why this happens. Genes can be responsible for causing both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Having certain combination of genes may increase or decrease the risk of diabetes. If your parents were diabetics, you should be extra careful about your lifestyle. Sometimes, our own immune system may recognise the beta cells that produce insulin as antigens, and create antibodies to destroy them. Often, diabetes is diagnosed after most of the cells are destroyed and the patient then needs a daily dose of insulin to survive. Lack of exercise and obesity can be major causes of Type 2 diabetes. An imbalance between calories consumed and calories burned renders our body incapable of absorbing insulin properly. Just 30 minutes of physical activity reduces the chances of you having diabetes by 30 per cent. So, make sure you include activities like walking and cycling in your daily timetable. (Read: Fat to fit: Mega guide for losing weight the right way) As a person ages, several parts of his/her body stop functioning at their optimum best. This can lead to diabetes, along with several other ailments. Certain medicines like nicotinic acid, psychiatric drugs, diuretics, etc. can destroy the beta cells that produce insulin or disrupt insulin absorption. Since the beta cells are present in the pancreas – any injury or diseases like cancer, pancreatitis, etc. can stop beta cells from functioning and ultimately lead to diabetes. (Read: ) Diabetes is diagnosed using blood tests, and the three tests used for diagnosing diabetes are: This test is used for diagnosing Type 2 diabetes. It measures a person’s average blood glucose levels over the past three months. If a person’s A1C level is below 5.7%, it means that he/she is normal. If it is between 5.7 to 6.4%, it indicates prediabetes which may lead to diabetes if appropriate measures are not taken. A person is diagnosed with diabetes if he/she has an A1C level of 5.7% or above.   The Fasting Plasma Glucose test is the most common test used for diagnosing diabetes. It is performed by measuring a person’s blood sugar level, after he/she has fasted for at least 8 hours. If a person has a fasting glucose level of 126 mg/dL or above, he or she has diabetes. It is advised to repeat the test on another day for confirmation. In an oral glucose tolerance test, a person has to fast for at least 8 hours. After that, he/she has to drink a glass of water mixed with 75g of glucose.   If a person’s 2-hour blood glucose-level is between 140 to 199 mg/dL, the person has prediabetes which could lead to diabetes if appropriate measures are not taken. If the blood glucose-level is above 200 mg/dL, then the person is diagnosed with diabetes. If your diabetes can’t be controlled with diet, exercise and weight control, your doctor may recommend anti-diabetic medications or insulin. Most people who have type 2 diabetes start with an oral medicine. Here are some of them: (DiaBeta, Glucotrol, Amaryl, etc.) lower blood glucose levels by increasing the release of insulin from the pancreas. These drugs decrease blood sugar rapidly but may cause abnormally low and dangerous levels of blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) leading to mental confusion and even coma.  (Prandin, Starlix, etc.) also work on the pancreas to increase insulin secretion. Their effects depend on the level of glucose.  (lyraglutide), an injectable medicine, helps the pancreas make more insulin after eating a meal. It improves blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes when used with a diet and exercise programme.  Drugs that decrease the amount of glucose released from the liver Metformin)decrease glucose production by the liver, decrease the absorption of glucose in the intestines and improve the body’s resistance to insulin. It also suppresses hunger, which may be beneficial in diabetics who are overweight. Drugs that increase the sensitivity (response) of cells to insulin   (Actos and Avandia) lower blood glucose by increasing the sensitivity of the muscle and fat cells to insulin. These drugs may be taken with metformin and/or a sulfonylurea. They can cause mild liver problems but are reversible with discontinuation of the drug. Drugs that decrease the absorption of carbohydrates from the intestine Alpha glucosidase is an enzyme in the small intestine which breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Acarbose is the drug that inhibits this enzyme. Carbohydrates are not broken down as efficiently and glucose absorption is delayed, thus preventing high glucose levels after eating in people with diabetes.  (Byetta) is a substance like gut hormone (GLP-1) that cannot be easily broken down. It slows stomach emptying, slows the release of glucose from the liver and controls hunger. Administered in the form of an injection, Byetta also causes weight reduction, thus making it particularly suitable for patients with type 2 diabetes who are also overweight. (Januvia, Onglyza, Tradjenta), inhibit DPP-IV enzyme from breaking down gut hormone (GLP-1). This allows the hormone already in the blood to circulate longer. They also increase insulin secretion when blood sugars are high and signal the liver to stop producing excess sugar.  – Insulin is the backbone of treatment for patients with Type 1 diabetes. Insulin is also important in Type 2 diabetes when blood glucose levels cannot be controlled by diet, weight loss, exercise and oral medicines. Different types of insulin are: 1.   – starts working in about 15 minutes and lasts for 3 to 5 hours. There are 3 types of rapid-acting insulin: Insulin lispro, Insulin aspart and Insulin glulisine 2.   (regular insulin) – starts working in 30 to 60 minutes and lasts 5 to 8 hours. 3.   (insulin NPH) – starts working in 1 to 3 hours and lasts 12 to 16 hours. 4.   (insulin glargine and insulin detemir) – starts working in about 1 hour and lasts 20 to 26 hours. 5.  – combination of 2 types of insulin (usually a rapid-acting or short-acting insulin and an intermediate-acting insulin). (Read: ) The various methods for administering insulin are:  – This is similar to an ink cartridge in a fountain pen. An insulin cartridge is held by a small pen-sized device. The amount of insulin to be injected is dispensed by turning the bottom of the pen until the required number of units is seen in the dose-viewing window. The tip of the pen consists of a needle that is disposed off with each injection.  – This is the most recently available advance in insulin delivery. It is composed of a pump reservoir similar to that of an insulin cartridge, a battery-operated pump and a computer chip that allows the user to control the exact amount of insulin being delivered. The pump is used for continuous insulin delivery. The amount of insulin is programmed and is administered at a constant rate.  – Inhaled form of insulin is not much in use these days. The insulin is packaged in dry packs which are inserted into an inhalation device. This device allows the insulin to enter a chamber that has a mouth piece. Through this mouth piece the user can inhale the insulin. –is an injectable medication for use in diabetes patients treated with insulin but unable to achieve adequate sugar control. Amylin is a hormone synthesised by pancreas and helps control glucose after meals. It is absent or deficient in patients with diabetes. Pramlintide, a synthetic form of human amylin, when used with insulin, can improve sugar control. Symlin reduces blood sugar peaks after meal, reduces glucose fluctuations throughout the day and increases the sensation of fullness (leading to weight loss). (Read: Treatments for diabetes: Oral medications, insulin and other methods) Diabetes, if uncontrolled can lead to deadly complications.   1.  (Diabetic ketoacidosis): Since the hormone insulin which breaks down glucose is lacking, in uncontrolled cases, the body starts using fat as the fuel source. While you might think it’s not such a bad idea to lose some fat, what this leads to is build up of by-products of fat digestion called ‘ketones’. If you’re not taking your insulin doses regularly, have fever/diarrhoea/vomiting and/or going through a lot of stress or are an alcoholic, you need to be extra careful about developing this condition called ‘ketoacidosis’.  If you develop symptoms like deep gasping breathing, acute pain in the abdomen, bad dehydration leading to weakness and fainting, vomiting, it’s time you take it seriously and contact your doctor.  2.  (Diabetic retinopathy): Retina (the innermost layer of your eye) is affected by ineffective blood glucose control. The small blood vessels in the retina are damaged and weakened. The early symptom of eye problems related to diabetes is blurred vision and double vision. It can also cause a severe, permanent loss of vision. Diabetes increases the risk of developing cataracts and glaucoma. (Read: ) 3.  (Diabetic nephropathy): If you notice swelling in your feet and legs or around your eyes, your kidneys might get affected because of the uncontrolled blood sugar levels. If you have hypertension (or high BP), your chances of developing this is even higher. 4. : Some of the nerves, especially around your peripheries like legs might get affected first leading to a loss of sensation. You might not be able to figure out if you’ve had an injury and it may end up getting infected. Diabetic gangrene (infection of the leg, leading to decay of flesh) can occur and the leg may have to be amputated. Uncontrolled diabetes can also affect nerves that control your heartbeat, blood pressure, digestion, blood flow to organs etc leading to diarrhoea, erectile dysfunction, loss of bladder control, vision changes, and dizziness.

5297e285-cc3b-4d58-8952-591b778ccd6b,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disorder of carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism characterized by fasting elevations of blood sugar (glucose) levels and a greatly increased risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, retinopathy, and loss of nerve function. Diabetes can occur when the pancreas does not secrete enough insulin or if the cells of the body become resistant to insulin. Hence, the blood sugar cannot get into the cells, which then leads to serious complications. Diabetes is divided into two major categories: Type 1 and Type 2. About ten percent of all diabetics are Type 1 and about 90% are Type 2. Type 1 is associated with complete destruction of the beta-cells of the pancreas, which manufacture the hormone insulin. Type 1 patients require lifelong insulin for the control of blood sugar levels. Type 1 results from injury to the insulin-producing beta-cells, coupled with some defect in tissue regeneration capacity. In Type 1, the body’s immune system begins to attack the pancreas. Antibodies for beta-cells are present in seventy-five percent of all cases of Type 1, compared to one-half percent to two percent of non-diabetics. It is probable that the antibodies to the beta-cells develop in response to cell damage due to other mechanisms (chemical, free-radical, viral, food allergy, etc.). It appears that normal individuals either do not develop as severe an antibody reaction, or are better able to repair the damage once it occurs. Type 2 historically has had an onset after 40 years of age in overweight individuals but is today even seen in children due to the obesity epidemic present in all age groups in America as well as those exposed to high levels of POPs (persistent organic pollutants). Initially, insulin levels are typically elevated in Type 2, indicating a loss of sensitivity to insulin by the cells of the body. Obesity is a major contributing factor to this loss of insulin sensitivity. Approximately 90% of individuals categorized as having Type 2 are obese. Achieving ideal body weight in these patients is associated with restoration of normal blood glucose levels in many cases. Even if Type 2 has progressed to the point where insulin deficiency is present, weight loss nearly always results in significant improvements in blood glucose control and dramatic reductions in other health risks such as cardiovascular disease. There are other types of diabetes such as gestational diabetes – a type of diabetes that affects about 4% of all pregnant women. About 135,000 cases of gestational diabetes occur each year in the United States. Gestational diabetes occurs more frequently among African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, and American Indians. It is also more common among obese women and women with a family history of diabetes. After pregnancy, 5% to 10% of women with gestational diabetes develop Type 2 and that number increases to 20% to 50% chance of developing diabetes in the 5 to 10 years after pregnancy. Prediabetes (formerly  called “impaired glucose tolerance”) is categorized by fasting glucose being 100-125 mg/dl and/or postprandial glucose of 140-199 mg/dl. It is the first step in insulin resistance and estimated to affect 57 million Americans. Many people with prediabetes will go on to develop full-blown Type 2 despite the fact that prediabetes is usually reversible and, in most cases, diabetes can be completely avoided through dietary and lifestyle changes. Factors implicated in contributing to prediabetes, insulin resistance, and the progression to Type 2 include: a diet high in refined carbohydrates, particularly high fructose corn syrup; elevated saturated fat intake; over-eating due to increased portion sizes of food; increase in inflammatory markers; lack of exercise; industrial pollution; abdominal weight gain; hormonal imbalances; inadequate sleep; and nutrient deficiencies. Research increasingly indicates that prediabetes is accompanied by serious health risks especially an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Prediabetics often meet the criteria of the metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of factors that together carry a significantly greater risk for CVD and developing Type 2 that include: Two of the following: Secondary diabetes (a form of diabetes that is secondary to certain conditions and Syndromes, such as pancreatic disease, hormone disturbances, drugs, and malnutrition) Gestational diabetes (glucose intolerance that occurs during pregnancy) Impaired glucose tolerance (a condition that includes prediabetic or borderline diabetes); individuals with impaired glucose tolerance have blood glucose levels and glucose-tolerance test (GTT) results that are intermediate between normal and clearly abnormal The following criteria are used for diagnosing diabetes: Fasting (overnight): serum glucose (blood sugar) concentration greater than or equal to 126 mg/dl on at least two separate occasions Following ingestion of 75 g of glucose: serum glucose concentration greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl at two hours post-ingestion and at least one other sample during the two-hour test Although the exact cause of Type 1 diabetes is unknown, current theory suggests an autoimmune process leads to destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells in the pancreas. Antibodies for beta-cells are present in seventy-five percent of all cases of Type 1 diabetes, compared to one-half percent to two percent of non-diabetics. The antibodies to the beta-cells appear to develop in response to cell destruction due to other mechanisms (chemical, free-radical, viral, food allergy, etc.). Approximately ninety percent of individuals with Type II diabetes are obese. Obesity is a major contributing factor to this loss of insulin sensitivity. In most cases, achieving ideal body weight is associated with restoration of normal blood sugar levels in these patients. In other words, achieving ideal body weight is often a “cure” for type 2 diabetes. Diabetes, perhaps more than any other disease, is strongly associated with Western culture and diet as it is uncommon in cultures consuming a more “primitive” diet. However, as cultures switch from their native diets to the “foods of commerce,” their rate of diabetes increases, eventually reaching the same proportions seen in Western societies. Dietary modification and treatment is fundamental to the successful treatment of both Type I and Type II diabetes. All simple, processed, and concentrated carbohydrates must be avoided. Low glycemic load foods should be stressed and saturated fats should be kept to a minimum. Since diabetics have a higher incidence of death from cardiovascular disease (60-to-70 percent, versus 20-to-25 percent in people without diabetes), the dietary recommendations given in are equally appropriate here. Weight loss, in particular a significant decrease in body-fat percentage, is a prime objective in treating the majority of Type 2 diabetics; it improves all aspects of diabetes and may result in cure. For recommendations to promote weight loss see . For both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics, there are some specific foods that have been shown to produce positive effects on blood sugar control. These foods include olives, soybeans and other legumes, nuts, artichokes, bitter melon, garlic, Jerusalem artichokes, mangoes and onions. These foods all have a low glycemic index and glycemic load and are high in fiber. Cinnamon may also be helpful in controlling blood sugar levels. According to research, cinnamon might be acting as an insulin substitute in type 2 diabetes. A double-blind study of 60 people with type 2 diabetes revealed a significant decrease in fasting serum glucose (18-29%), triglyceride (23-30%), LDL cholesterol (7-27%), and total cholesterol (12-26%) levels after taking cinnamon for 40 days. The effective dosage was as little as 1 gram per day of cinnamon (roughly ¼ teaspoon). What nutritional supplements should I take for Diabetes Mellitus? Along with Dr. Lyon and Natural Factors, I have created the WellBetx – a family of nutritional and herbal products designed to address special nutritional needs of people with diabetes. The WellBetX products are designed to be used in conjunction with proper dietary, lifestyle, and medical treatment of diabetes. WellBetX is not designed to “treat” diabetes, instead it is designed to support the proper utilization of blood glucose and insulin as well as deal with some of the nutritional challenges and deficiencies that many diabetics suffer from. The various WellBetX products are designed to impact one or all of the following goals: Reduce after meal elevations in blood sugar levels. The WellBetX product line consists of the following formulas: – A proprietary fiber blend with remarkable properties in supporting blood sugar control along with a special extract of mulberry leaves. – A delicious way to improve blood sugar levels and promoting satiety. – a high potency formula that provides optimal levels of nutrients to support people with diabetes. – A unique formula of herbal extracts with scientific support for their role in promoting human health. – An alkaloid from goldenseal, barberry bark, and Oregon grape root has shown impressive results in supporting blood sugar control, blood pressure, and blood lipid levels. – A pharmaceutical grade fish oil with the added benefits of GLA from borage oil. If you have diabetes and utilize nutritional and herbal support, you must monitor blood sugar levels, especially if you are on insulin or have relatively uncontrolled diabetes. Typically insulin and drug dosages will have to be altered after employing natural medicines. Under no circumstances should a person suddenly stop taking insulin or oral diabetic drugs without consulting their physician. It is important to monitor blood sugar levels because poor blood sugar control dramatically risk of developing the complications of diabetes. The availability of home glucose monitoring kits makes it easier now than in the past to monitor blood sugar levels, resulting in a major improvement in the care of diabetes. Another major improvement is the measurement of the level of glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA1c), which allows monitoring of blood sugar levels over a long period of time. I recommend periodic measurement-every three months in poorly controlled diabetes, and every year in well-controlled cases. If a diabetic can keep their HgbA1c between 6 and 7%, the risk for developing any complication of diabetes is dramatically reduced. “Dr. Murray, I know that you are very busy and may not remember talking to me when you came to Houston and talked about your book and research on preventing and treating diabetes. You saved my life that night. I was very ill with Type II diabetes and the medication did not work and I could feel my life was slipping away. I was helpless to do anything until I met you. You gave me hope and helped me to believe that my life could continue and indeed it has. I went immediately and bought the Welbetx and began using it as you told me to that night. On the second day, I came back from my illness! I began to feel well again and I had energy and my sugar began to drop. Today I am 52 pounds lighter, I no longer have diabetes and am off medications and just doing your program and eating correctly and exercising three times a week. I have gone from a size 3XXX to a size Large. My pants have gone from a 48 to size 40. I weighed 268 and now weigh 216. I am well and fit and owe it to you and to the products that you developed. I wish I could do more to thank you for you saved my life. My wife and children are grateful to you too. You make a difference in peoples lives and I know that you saved my life. God Bless You and Your Work and Natural Factors. JG.” “Dr. Murray, the simple words Thank You! cannot begin to encompass the Gratitude I feel, the Hope you have restored to me, and the reality of significantly improved health that I thought may never happen. I have been morbidly obese and continually gained weight for the last twenty years. I have tried various diets during this time only to experience failure and even more weight gain. . . . In March 2004, within a few days of starting the WellBetXT products, the hypoglycemic episodes I would experience even before I got hungry started to level out which allowed me to more comfortably make better food choices. Within three weeks my blood sugar swings completely normalized. What was even more impressive was the PGXT and how it controlled my appetite, for the first time in years I found myself not hungry. I also started using the WellBetXT with PGXT meal replacement shakes for breakfast. Three months later on a follow up visit to my Physician, he came in the room with a smile on his face and showed me my blood test results. WOW! In 90 days my fasting insulin level had dropped from 35.1 to 19.0. It was now well within the normal range along with my fasting glucose levels and . . . that was not all; I had also lost 22 pounds and 23-1/2 inches. I had never had that kind of weight loss before, and yet I was still rarely hungry and I was feeling much better. . . Thank you, LA” On the show I discussed the failure of conventional medicine to address the underlying issues in many health conditions offering little more than drugs as biochemical “band aids.” Glaucoma most often refers to the vision loss caused by increased intraocular pressure (IOP) as a result of greater production than outflow of the fluid of the eye (the aqueous humor). The normal intraocular pressure is about 10 to 21 mm Hg. In chronic glaucoma, the intraocular pressure is usually mildly to moderately elevated (22 to 40 mm Hg). In acute glaucoma, the intraocular pressure is greater than 40 mm Hg. Acute glaucoma is a medical emergency, fortunately it is the rarest form of glaucoma. Chronic open-angle type glaucoma is by far the most common form. It accounts for about 70-75% of the approximately 3 million people in the United States who have glaucoma. In some cases glaucoma develops in people with normal IOP. Referred to as low-tension glaucoma or normotensive glaucoma (NTG), this form accounts for approximately 25 to 30 percent of all glaucoma cases in the United States. NTG is more common in women than in men and affects adults averaging 60 years old. A common risk factor for NTG is low blood pressure. Since many patients with glaucoma have no symptoms, it is important that regular eye exams be included in their annual checkup after the age of sixty. Glaucoma is a serious condition that requires strict attention. Since patients with the early stages of chronic glaucoma rarely have symptoms, it is important that regular eye exams be included in their annual checkup after the age of sixty. Chronic glaucoma can result in the gradual loss of peripheral vision resulting in tunnel vision. Typical signs and symptoms of acute glaucoma include extreme pain, blurring of vision, reddened eyes, and a fixed and dilated pupil. Acute glaucoma is a medical emergency. If you are showing any signs of glaucoma, consult an ophthalmologist immediately. Unless adequately treated within twelve to forty-eight hours, an individual with acute glaucoma will become permanently blind within two to five days. The cause of glaucoma appears to be an abnormality in the composition of the supportive structures of the eye. Specifically, structural changes reflecting poor collagen integrity and function are the hallmark features of glaucoma. These changes lead to blockage in the flow of the aqueous humor and result in elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) readings. For chronic glaucoma, a generally healthful diet is recommended, with a focus on foods high in vitamin C and flavonoids, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. In addition, regular consumption of cold-water fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel, herring, and halibut) is also encouraged due to their high content of omega-3 fatty acids. Animal studies have shown that an increased consumption of omega-3 fatty acids can lower IOP. Chronic glaucoma has been successfully treated by eliminating allergies. In one study, of the 113 patients exposed to a food or environmental allergen demonstrated an immediate rise in IOP of up to 20 mm, in addition to other typical allergic symptoms. To treat glaucoma by eliminating food allergens, follow the guidelines given in FOOD ALLERGIES. What nutritional supplements should I take for GLAUCOMA? High potency multiple vitamin and mineral formula; Vitamin D3 2,000-5,000 IU/day; Fish oil, EPA+DHA 1,000 to 3,000 mg/day. is necessary for proper collagen integrity. Vitamin C supplementation has been shown to lower IOP levels of glaucoma patients in many clinical studies. Although some people respond to as little as 2 grams per day, others may respond only to extremely high doses (35 grams per day). Abdominal discomfort is common when using high doses, but usually tapers off after three to four days. The ability of vitamin C to reduce the IOP lasts only as long as supplementation is continued. contains flavonoids that enhance the effects of vitamin C and stabilize the collagen matrix. The citrus bioflavonoid rutin has also been demonstrated to lower IOP when used as an adjunct in patients who are unresponsive to glaucoma medications alone. Grapeseed extract is a better choice. supplementation lowers IOP in a fashion similar to that of popular drugs used in the treatment of glaucoma. Magnesium works just like the drugs by blocking the entry of calcium to produce relaxation of the arteries. In fact, magnesium has been referred to as “nature’s calcium-channel blocker.” Magnesium supplementation improves the peripheral circulation and seems to have a beneficial effect on the visual field in patients with glaucoma. shows promise in the treatment of glaucoma. In one study of patients with severe chronic glaucoma, although the improvements in IOP were mild, given the poor prognosis for these patients the results were deemed relevant. The recommended dosage of ginkgo extract (24% ginkgo flavonglycosides) is 160 to 240 mg daily. Periodic re-examination by your physician to measure intraocular pressure is important. If the recommendations above are working there should be a gradual improvement in visual function and a normalization of IOP.   For more information, please see the completely revised and updated 3 edition of PQQ may be the perfect answer to preventing or reversing age-related mental decline. kiwiPQQ (short for pyrroloquinoline quinone) is a vitamin-like compound found in plant foods that shows a wide range of benefits for brain function and energy production. Learn more about PQQ with the following Q&A. What Exactly Does PQQ Do? PQQ is an extremely potent antioxidant that is able to carry out the role of an antioxidant in the body more than 20,000 times—which is a rare thing. For example, other antioxidants, such as vitamin C, are only able to accomplish this “cycling” process about four times. Are There Any Food Sources of PQQ? PQQ has been found in all plant foods analyzed to date. Particularly PPQ-rich foods include parsley, green peppers, kiwi, papaya, and tofu. These foods contain 2–3 mcg of PQQ per 100 grams. Green tea provides about the same amount per 4-oz. serving. While these amounts appear to be sufficient in helping our cells carry out their basic functions, research indicates that boosting PQQ through supplementation can produce some amazing effects.

Learn about keto diet basics as well as if it works for weight loss and if athletes should consider going keto to fuel up. Allison Knott, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.N. February 16, 2017 https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2017/02/27121955/3758614__630.jpg The ketogenic diet may be on the rise as far as diet trends go, but the concept isn't new. First identified as a beneficial treatment for epilepsy, the high-fat, very-low-carbohydrate approach has been around for close to 100 years. Recently, the diet has become popular among athletes (LeBron James tried it) and those looking for the next weight-loss cure-all. Followers eat foods like butter, oils, fatty meats and cheese. Proponents claim it can lower cholesterol and improve athletic performance, but before you go ""keto,"" here's a look at the science behind the popular diet. Ketogenic Diet Basics requires the body to rely mostly on fat for energy, rather than the usual carbohydrates (see Carbohydrates vs. Fat for Fuel below). When carb intake is very low, ketones-products of fat breakdown in the liver-must fuel the body. According to John Hawley, Ph.D., director of the Centre for Exercise and Nutrition at Mary MacKillop Institute for Health Research in Melbourne, Australia, there is no global definition of the ketogenic diet. In other words, no standard exists for how many grams of carbohydrate, fat, or protein should be consumed when following the diet. Most research around the diet has identified a carbohydrate intake between 25 and 50 grams per day, which is equivalent to two medium apples or one cup of cooked brown rice. This extreme reduction in carbohydrate is very difficult to maintain long-term and makes it impossible to meet the recommended amount of fruit, vegetable and whole-grain servings recommended for a healthy diet. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, carbohydrates should make up 45 to 60 percent of daily calories, or 130 grams/day, for most people to eat a balanced diet and get necessary nutrients. For epilepsy patients, ketogenic diets are administered in a clinical setting and require a team of dietitians and doctors to ensure that patients receive the correct daily levels of nutrients-and they're still extremely hard to follow. Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss Beyond the low intake of carbohydrates, another key element of the diet is the extremely high intake of dietary fat. By consuming the majority of calories from fat, and severely limiting carbohydrate, the body remains in a state of ketosis (relying mostly on ketones for energy). Short-term weight loss will occur naturally, mostly because of water weight you lose. Your body will deplete its glycogen stores (regular energy reserves from carbohydrate breakdown) and the water that is stored with them. While many people lose weight quickly, it's water weight, not true weight loss. In most cases, the weight will return when the dietary pattern again includes a larger percentage of carbohydrates. For that reason, the ketogenic diet probably won't help with long-term weight loss. Athletes and a High-Fat Diet The ketogenic diet is often promoted among athletes as a way to increase fat metabolism, and it does. ""If you eat a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet then your muscles will oxidize more fat during exercise,"" says Hawley. But, he points out, that argument misses an important point: ""Carbohydrates set the limit to how fast or far you can go as an athlete, not fat."" In other words, your body's ability to use fat as an energy source is not important when it comes to athletic performance lasting up to three hours. Some studies have even shown a detrimental effect on performance in those following a ketogenic diet, likely due to the increased oxygen needed when your body has to rely on fat for energy. Some argue that since athletes can eat whatever they want, the high-fat intake won't have negative consequences, but, according to Hawley, that just isn't the case. ""You're an athlete for one or at most two hours a day, not for the remaining 22 hours per day,"" he explains. Research has shown that diets high in dietary fat, especially saturated fat, can have negative, long-term health implications such as increasing the risk for cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. It's important to include some fats in the diet, though (the Dietary Guidelines recommend 20 to 35 percent of daily calories from fats, particularly poly- and monounsaturated), to aid in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and other crucial body processes. The New Fat Revolution: Are All Fats Really Healthy? Carbohydrates vs. Fat for Fuel If you want to talk about the best way to eat to fuel your body, we need to go back to biology class. Carbohydrates are our body's primary energy source. When we eat carbs, they are digested into individual molecules called glucose, which our cells use as energy. Glucose that isn't used for energy is then stored in the form of glycogen in the muscles and liver-and any excess is stored as fat. Meaning if you eat a bowl of spaghetti, you'll use a certain amount as energy (even when you're resting, your body needs energy to breathe, pump blood, etc.), you'll store some as glycogen and then if there's any left over it will be stored as fat. Basal metabolism (the energy needed to sustain your body at rest) requires a mixture of carbohydrates and fats for use as energy. During periods of prolonged aerobic activity, like running or swimming, the body shifts its fuel source and pulls mostly from glycogen stores to sustain activity. However, the amount of glycogen you can store in your muscles is limited and once depleted, carbohydrates must be consumed to replace what has been used. It's why marathon runners take in food and calories over the course of the marathon. When your body doesn't have access to carbohydrates, it will turn to alternate sources-fat or protein. Fat stores provide significantly more calories, or energy, than glycogen stores and at lower intensities of activity the body mostly relies on its fat for energy (think walking on the treadmill rather than running). However, the process of turning fat into energy requires additional metabolic steps which, in turn, use more oxygen. When fat is broken down, ketones are formed and used as an alternate fuel source. In a continued absence of carbohydrate, ketones become abundant in the bloodstream and the body enters a state of ketosis. The same process is seen during fasting or starvation, but neither is very pleasant nor sustainable long-term. If you have diabetes, you should talk to your healthcare provider about ketoacidosis, a serious condition when blood ketones get too high. Environmental Impact Personal, physical health is the focus of most popular diets and many don't draw connections between the diet and potential environmental impacts. Sustainability is important to consider, though. Nicole Tichenor, Ph.D., a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of New Hampshire's Sustainability Institute, researches the environmental impact of diets. She explains that healthy diets that are lower in animal-based foods and higher in plant-based foods have lower environmental impacts, including carbon footprint, land use and water use. The ketogenic diet, by principle, doesn't follow this pattern. Tichenor's take: ""the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee's working definition of a sustainable diet is one that promotes health and well-being, provides food security for the current population, and sustains human and natural resources for future generations. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, to eat a sustainable diet without beans/legumes, whole grains or root vegetables."" Bottom Line The ketogenic diet is extremely difficult to follow and very restrictive. You need to severely limit healthy whole grains, fruits and vegetables, which means you would miss out on a lot of important nutrients. While the ketogenic diet has its place in clinical settings, the diet doesn't translate to the general population and, in fact, may have long-term negative impact on people choosing to follow such an extreme way of eating.

5b2e1102-20a4-455e-89c7-e7f05c7366c4,"— Soy sauce, which is typically used in Asian cuisine, is a staple low calorie condiment with a distinct umami flavor. If you follow a ketogenic, or keto, diet, you may wonder whether this flavorful ingredient is a good choice. The keto diet drastically restricts carbs, and some soy sauces contain more carbs than others. This article discusses soy sauce, its carb content, and whether it’s a keto-friendly condiment. Several types of soy sauce exist, and they vary by production method and content. There are two main ways soy sauce is produced — traditionally and chemically. Traditional soy sauce is brewed by fermenting and wheat in water and salt using mold, yeast, and bacteria. It’s aged over months — sometimes even years (). In a much faster method, soy sauce can be chemically produced in as little as 8–12 hours by breaking down soybeans using high heat and a strong acid solution. (). Types of soy sauce also vary based on the proportions of soybeans, wheat, salt, and other ingredients used, including sugar. Along with flavor, texture, and aroma, the ingredients used may affect the carb content and whether the soy sauce is keto-friendly. The soy sauce commonly used in North America, which is considered to be “light soy sauce,” is typically very low in carbs, as it contains little to no added sugar (). However, significant are added to some varieties of soy sauce, such as “sweet soy sauce,” which is not keto-friendly. While the exact amount depends on the brand, here are the breakdowns of common types of soy sauce and their typical carb contents: Considered the most familiar type in North America, this variety typically contains around 1 gram of carbs per tablespoon (15mL) or less (). This variety may be slightly sweetened, giving it around 1–5 grams per tablespoon (15mL) (, ). This variety is commonly and typically contains 1 gram of carbs per tablespoon (15mL) (). Also known as “kecap manis,” this variety is typically high in added sugar. Depending on the brand, each tablespoon (15mL) may contain up to 15 grams of carbs (, ). The number of carbs in soy sauce typically ranges from 1–15 grams per tablespoon (15mL), depending on the type and brand. Though there are many variations of the keto diet, they all involve restricting carbs to promote — a metabolic state in which your body mainly burns fat for fuel instead of carbs (). Research suggests ketosis can be achieved by most people by reducing carb intake to 10% or less of your daily carb intake, or roughly 20–50 grams per day (). Given that many soy sauces are low carb, it’s possible to enjoy this flavor-enhancing condiment without pulling yourself out of ketosis. Yet, there are a few important things to consider: The carbs in soy sauce can range from 1–15 grams per tablespoon (15 mL). Check the to determine how many carbs your soy sauce contains per serving. The nutrition label usually reports carbs per tablespoon (15 mL) of soy sauce. For reference, a single soy sauce packet contains around 1 teaspoon (5 mL), or one-third of a tablespoon. Monitor how much you use to ensure it aligns with your dietary goals. Based on the carb content of your soy sauce, determine whether the portion size you use fits within your overall carb allowance for the day. Another rule of thumb is to avoid any soy sauce described as “sweet.” These typically contain added sugar and are likely not keto-friendy. Keep in mind that soy sauce is a common ingredient in Asian cuisine. When dining out, consider asking for an unsweetened soy sauce on the side to better manage the type and portion you consume. Most soy sauce is low in carbs and can be used on a keto diet. Check the nutrition facts label to determine whether the number of carbs fits within your daily allowance. Many individuals choose to sub soy sauce with similar tasting condiments due to allergies, gluten intolerance, or other dietary concerns. As with soy sauce itself, some soy sauce alternatives are more keto-friendly than others. Here is the carb content of several soy sauce substitutes: When made from soy protein, contain 0 grams of carbs per tablespoon (15mL) (). Liquid aminos derived from coconut contain more carbs than most soy sauces. Each tablespoon (15 mL) of contains around 6 grams of carbs (). Similarly to light soy sauce, Maggi seasoning sauce contains less than 1 gram of carb per tablespoon (15mL) (). As a small amount of sugar is usually added, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of fish sauce typically contains around 1 gram of carbs or less (). Fish sauce contains more sodium than soy sauce, so it’s typically not a 1-to-1 alternative. Like soy sauce, most soy sauce alternatives can easily be enjoyed on a keto diet as long as the number of carbs and portion size are considered in relation to your overall daily carb allowance. Many soy sauce alternatives are keto-friendly. Check the nutrition label to be certain the carb content per serving does not exceed your daily carb limit. You don’t need to exclude all soy sauces on a , as there are many low carb options to choose from. For example, many varieties only contain around 1 gram of carbs per tablespoon (15 mL). However, some varieties may contain significant amounts of carbs from added sugar. For example, sweet soy sauces may contain up to 15 grams of carbs per tablespoon (15 mL), which is not a keto-friendly amount. To prevent pulling yourself out of ketosis, determine the number of carbs in your soy sauce by checking the nutrition label. Monitor your portion sizes to ensure you don’t exceed your daily carb limit. — Soy sauce is one of the most popular soy products in the world.

5440c0d5-8a51-44a1-baec-255608f55d01,"Avoiding Hyperglycemia & Preventing Diabetic Ketoacidosis When blood glucose levels (also called blood sugar levels) are too high, it's called . Glucose is a sugar that comes from foods, and is formed and stored inside the body. It's the main source of energy for the body's cells and is carried to each through the bloodstream. But even though we need glucose for energy, too much glucose in the blood can be unhealthy. Hyperglycemia is the hallmark of diabetes — it happens when the body either can't make insulin () or can't respond to insulin properly (type 2 diabetes). The body needs insulin so glucose in the blood can enter the cells to be used for energy. In people who have developed diabetes, glucose builds up in the blood, resulting in hyperglycemia. If it's not treated, hyperglycemia can cause serious health problems. Too much sugar in the bloodstream for long periods of time can damage the vessels that supply blood to vital organs. And, too much sugar in the bloodstream can cause other types of damage to body tissues, which can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke, kidney disease, vision problems, and nerve problems in people with diabetes. These problems don't usually show up in kids or teens with diabetes who have had the disease for only a few years. However, they can happen in adulthood in some people, particularly if they haven't managed or controlled their diabetes properly. Blood sugar levels are considered high when they're above someone's target range. The will let you know what your child's target blood sugar levels are, which will vary based on factors like your child's age. A major goal in controlling diabetes is to keep blood sugar levels as close to the desired range as possible. It's a three-way balancing act of: All of these need to be balanced to keep blood sugar levels under control. If any one is off, blood sugar levels can be, too. In general, problems controlling blood sugar levels are due to one or more of the following: not getting enough or other diabetes medicine not following the meal plan (like eating too much on a special occasion without adjusting medicines) use of certain medicines that can raise blood sugar, like steroids used to treat inflammation The symptoms of hyperglycemia are similar to those that happen when someone is diagnosed with diabetes, such as: The kidneys respond to high levels of glucose in the bloodstream by flushing out the extra glucose in urine (pee). A child with diabetes who has hyperglycemia may need to pee more often and in larger volumes. Kids with hyperglycemia who lose a lot of fluid from urinating often become very thirsty and may drink a lot in an attempt to prevent dehydration. Without enough insulin to help the body use glucose, the body breaks down muscle and stored fat in an attempt to provide fuel to hungry cells. Because the body can't use glucose for energy properly, kids with hyperglycemia may be unusually tired. As part of the diabetes management plan, you'll need to check your child's blood sugar levels multiple times a day with a blood glucose meter. This helps you identify when your child has high blood sugar levels, which don't always cause symptoms. Someone who isn't testing regularly might have blood sugar levels high enough to damage the body without even realizing it. The  can show if someone has been having significant hyperglycemia over time, even though the person may not have had obvious symptoms. If you find that your child is having a lot of high blood sugar levels, the diabetes health care team may suggest changing the diabetes medicines or meal plan to bring the levels back into a healthy range. In other cases, an equipment issue, like an insulin pump problem or expired insulin, may be the cause. Make sure you contact the diabetes team if your child's blood sugar levels are often above the target range. Treating high blood sugar levels means correcting their cause. The diabetes health care team will give you specific advice on how to keep your child's blood sugar levels in a healthy range. But here are some suggestions for managing some causes of hyperglycemia: What to Do Not getting enough insulin or other diabetes medication Make sure your child takes the right type of insulin and the correct dose at the right time. Make sure that all equipment (pumps, meters, etc.) works properly. Diabetes medicines may need to be changed or adjusted — check with the diabetes health care team. Not following the meal plan (like eating too much food on special occasions without adjusting medicines) Work with a registered dietitian to change your child's meal plan as needed. Adjust insulin/pills whenever your child eats more or less than what's on the meal plan (the care team can help you with this). Adjust your child's medicines based on the care team's instructions. Your child should continue to take insulin (the dose may need to change). Check blood sugar levels often as per the diabetes management plan. Insulin or pills may need to change while your child takes the medicine that's causing high blood sugar levels. A single high blood sugar reading usually isn't cause for alarm — it happens to everyone with diabetes from time to time. However, consistently high blood sugar levels need to be addressed. Insulin lets glucose get into the body's cells. Without enough insulin, the body can't use glucose for energy and starts to use fat for fuel. This can happen, for example, when someone skips doses of insulin or when the need for insulin suddenly increases (for example, due to stress or illness) and the doses are not adjusted. When the body uses fat for energy, chemicals called ketones are released into the blood, causing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Some of the ketones, like extra glucose, exit the body through urine. But high levels of ketones in the blood can be a problem because they cause the blood to become acidic. Too much acid in the blood throws off the body's chemical balance. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a very serious — but completely preventable — condition that can lead to coma or death if it's not treated quickly. It happens more often in people with type 1 diabetes, but can sometimes happen in people with type 2 diabetes. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis usually don't start all at once — they usually come on slowly over several hours. Signs and symptoms include: These symptoms are caused by the sustained hyperglycemia (usually lasting several hours) that typically happens before someone develops diabetic ketoacidosis. If the person isn't treated, these symptoms can happen: How do you know if your child has diabetic ketoacidosis? The signs and symptoms can mimic or be triggered by other illnesses, like the flu. So, it's very important to check your child's blood sugar levels and urine ketones during illness — especially if there are high blood sugar readings — or if your child has symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. Because high levels of ketones in the blood cause ketones to appear in the urine, ketones can be checked at home by testing a sample of your child's urine. If the urine test for ketones is negative, it generally means that symptoms are not due to diabetic ketoacidosis. If the urine test is positive, contact your child's diabetes health care team.  Tests done by a lab or hospital can confirm whether a child has diabetic ketoacidosis, if necessary. Some newer blood glucose meters also offer the option of testing blood for ketones. Ask the diabetes health care team if such a meter is a good idea for your child. Diabetic ketoacidosis requires immediate medical treatment with intravenous (IV) insulin and fluids and close monitoring in a hospital. Contact the diabetes health care team immediately or seek emergency care if you think your child is having symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. All adult family members and your child's caregivers and school staff should know about the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in a child with diabetes, and they should know when to call 911. In addition, all kids and teens with diabetes should wear some sort of medical identification (like a bracelet or necklace) and/or carry medical identification (ID) information at all times. Besides identifying your child as having diabetes, these IDs can provide emergency contact information. Avoiding Hyperglycemia & Preventing Diabetic Ketoacidosis The best way to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis is to treat high blood sugar levels appropriately, which means following the diabetes management plan prescribed by the diabetes health care team. takes insulin and diabetes medicines as prescribed follows the meal plan and/or makes appropriate adjustments to diabetes medicines when changes to the meal plan are made monitors his or her blood sugar levels regularly and ketone levels when indicated follows the instructions and advice of the diabetes health care team and diabetes management plan, which should include instructions for sick days By regularly monitoring blood sugar levels, you'll know when your child's blood sugar is high. If that happens, contact the diabetes health care team for more information and to learn how to help bring your child's diabetes back under control.

By An MSK doctor weighs in on a recent study that links a ketogenic diet to improved responses to certain cancer drugs. In July 2018, researchers from Weill Cornell Medicine and Columbia University published the results of a that combined a very low-carbohydrate diet with targeted drugs called PI3K inhibitors as a treatment for cancer. The researchers found that this diet, called ketogenic, improved how well the drugs worked in several types of cancer in mice. The study attracted quite a bit of media attention, no doubt in part because the ketogenic diet is a among diet gurus. But for people with cancer, the study could be a source of confusion about what they should and should not be eating. In an interview,  describes the relationship between diet and cancer, including what role a ketogenic diet might play in prevention and treatment. Dr. Iyengar is a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering who treats people with breast cancer and researches the relationship between obesity and cancer. The food you eat during and after cancer treatment can play an important role in your recovery. Check out Memorial Sloan Kettering's nutrition advice and recipes to help you feel your best. What questions do your patients have about diet as it relates to cancer? By the time people with breast cancer come to see a medical oncologist like me, they’ve already been diagnosed with cancer. Many have had surgery, and now they’re coming to talk about how to prevent the cancer from returning. Oftentimes chemotherapy is a part of that conversation. Their main question is typically “What can I eat and what can’t I eat during chemo?” Many people believe that chemotherapy is going to obliterate their appetite. They think they’re going to waste away, so they need to eat as much as they can before chemo to prepare for this impending malnutrition. But the data, especially in breast cancer, suggest the opposite. People are more likely to gain weight during adjuvant [postsurgery] chemotherapy for breast cancer. A lot of my patients are surprised when I tell them to watch their calorie intake. This is because we now have plenty of epidemiologic evidence showing that a 5 to 10% weight gain during or after adjuvant chemotherapy increases the risk of breast cancer relapse. What do you think of the Weill Cornell–Columbia study that combined a ketogenic diet with drugs as a treatment for cancer? I think that this study is incredibly interesting. We’ve known for a while that a common side effect of PI3K inhibitors is hyperglycemia, meaning high blood sugar. That’s a problem for people with diabetes or prediabetes, and it’s one of the reasons why we sometimes have to stop treatment. This study suggests that controlling that rise in blood sugar — either through a ketogenic diet or through medication — could be one way to make the drugs more effective. Tell us a little bit more about the cancer drugs used in this study. Why did the investigators choose to study them in combination with a ketogenic diet? The idea behind giving someone PI3K inhibitors is that many cancers have mutations in the gene that codes for the PI3K enzyme. In fact, 70% of all cancers have mutations in the signaling pathway of which PI3K is a part. A key component of that pathway is insulin, a hormone that controls our blood sugar levels and has many other important functions. In the context of cancer cells, insulin can bind to a receptor on the surface of a cancer cell and stimulate growth-promoting pathways that include PI3K. When a person takes a PI3K inhibitor, insulin signaling is disrupted in the body. Since the main function of insulin is to lower blood glucose levels, disruption of insulin signaling leads to elevated blood glucose. To counteract this rise in glucose, the body secretes more insulin. The study investigators hypothesized that this insulin spike might negate the effect of blocking the PI3K enzyme with drugs. They took two approaches to prevent the spike: a ketogenic diet, which reduces the body’s glucose stores, and diabetes drugs that block insulin. Both approaches made PI3K inhibitors much more effective — at least in the mouse models they used. They concluded that a ketogenic diet improved responses to PI3K inhibitors by reducing the activation of insulin receptors in tumors. What should people with cancer know about the ketogenic diet, based on this study? First of all, this study was done in mice, so we don’t know yet if people will respond the same way. Second, it’s important to note that a ketogenic diet by itself was not effective as a cancer treatment in this study. In fact, for some of the cancers they tested, it actually made the cancer worse. That said, there could be other of a ketogenic diet for some people. A ketogenic diet is a very low-carbohydrate diet that also tends to be low calorie. Therefore, over time it will lead to weight loss. That in turn will reduce and other metabolic problems, which could reduce the risk of cancer forming and coming back. Other diets that induce weight loss may also be helpful in this regard. But restrictive diets can be difficult to follow for long periods of time. A ketogenic diet is particularly difficult to follow for prolonged periods. Furthermore, yo-yo dieting can have harmful health effects.  Ultimately, when it comes to diet, it depends on what works and is achievable for a particular person. Changing dietary behavior may be more effective than following a specific diet. In other words, if you can eat a healthy diet that is not overly restrictive, such as the , this may be the most beneficial approach in the long run. Ultimately, when it comes to diet, it depends on what works and is achievable for a particular person. Changing dietary behavior may be more effective than following a specific diet. Are any trials combining cancer therapy with either a ketogenic diet or insulin-reducing drugs? Several clinical trials are underway or are going to be launched soon. For example, researchers at Weill Cornell and Columbia are planning trials of a ketogenic diet with cancer therapy. We are also awaiting the results of a large global trial testing whether the diabetes drug metformin helps prevent breast cancer recurrence. At MSK, we have a for endometrial cancer, led by . It is currently enrolling participants. We are in the planning phase of developing trials that combine diabetes drugs with cancer drugs like PI3K inhibitors. In addition, MSK has one of the most active programs in the nation, led by . Under this program, we have several exercise trials that are currently ongoing. For example, we are testing different exercise regimens with chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer in a study led by . We will also soon launch a trial of precision exercise plans plus molecular and hormone-based cancer therapy for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. This is a rapidly developing area of research. As a physician-researcher, I find it very exciting that I can offer these options to my patients. As we learn more about how diet and metabolic alterations affect cancer, I am sure that we will find new ways to prevent cancer and prolong survival after a cancer diagnosis, all while improving well-being and general health. Is melanoma a form of cancer that respond well to a ketogenic diet?! In reply to by Pascale, thank you for your question. The research is at an early stage and we don’t know which cancers it might help. It is important to understand that the research is investigating whether a ketogenic diet can make some cancer treatments more effective, not whether a ketogenic diet alone is an effective treatment. There is no evidence that dietary changes alone are an effective treatment for melanoma. Keto should be implemented with lifestyle changes and exercise programs, mediation, acupuncture and many other integrative medicine treatments. Truly a comprehensive program seems most beneficial. Would this diet help those with gene mutations on this pathway that predispose them to getting cancer? We forwarded your question to Dr. Iyengar, who responded: “The study in mice was designed to address whether the keto diet improves response in cancers with PI3K mutations in conjunction with PI3K inhibitors. It is important to note that we are referring to mutations in tumor DNA, not mutations in the genes that predispose to cancer (in other words, the genes we inherit and pass down). We do not know if the keto diet is helpful for preventing cancer in individuals who have germline mutations that predispose to cancer. What we do know, is in individuals with mutations that predispose to cancer, obesity and metabolic diseases (like diabetes) are associated with earlier onset cancer. It is advisable for all individuals to maintain a healthy weight and healthy metabolic status by adhering to a balanced diet and exercise – and this is particularly important for individuals who are genetically at higher risk for developing cancer.” Thank you for your comment.  Can the Keto diet help in the treatment of Prostate Cancer?

I saw an article that is is being phased out. Dear Donna, we’re very sorry to hear about your relative’s diagnosis. Due to changes in the plans for manufacture of both pumps and catheters (the tube that attaches the pump to the liver), we have an investigational protocol where we are investigating a new pump and catheter combination. This still provides access of pumps to appropriate patients. Some pumps using catheter combinations that have been evaluated previously are still available for placement as well. These options can be discussed with the treating physician and we continue to provide pumps to patients in which this treatment is recommended as the best option. If your family member would like to schedule a consultation to learn more, they can online or call .

We recommend that you discuss any changes in diet with your medical team or with a dietitian who has experience in working with people who have cancer. Thank you for your comment and best wishes to you. Hi Dr. Iyenger: First, thanks for answering many of the questions we cancer patients have about the Keto Diet. A couple of questions for you: 1. Does research suggest that a Keto diet will improve the efficacy of the drugs we metastatic patients are on, particularly those that target the PI3K pathways (i.e. will we get a longer duration of the drug before progression)? And is the benefit worth the offset of what the diet will do to our liver compounded with what the drugs are already doing to our liver? As I understand it, the Keto diet has two planks: what you eat (low carbs, lots of protein and healthy fats) and intermittent fasting. What does the research say about intermittent fasting alone in promoting drug efficacy? Is that something healthier stageiv cancer patients should be considering adding to their diet? Lastly, can you also weigh in on the latest research regarding Methionine and cutting back on or eliminating meat and eggs and how that may elongate treatments for those of us with metastatic cancers (obviously that would need a separate article). Thanks! In reply to by Dear Liz, the effect that a ketogenic diet may have on cancer drug efficacy is a new area of research and it is not possible to make recommendations as this time. Some of the first clinical trials of this approach are beginning now, but it is too soon to say whether this approach will be effective. We recommend you talk with your doctor about which diet is right for you. Thank you for your comment. The article states that a Keto diet can actually make “cancers worse.” Please elaborate on this broad statement. I’m a MSK patient and currently NED after stage 3C Colorectal cancer. I, like many people, do Keto intermittently. If I thought there was ANY chance it may increase the chance of a recurrence, I would obviously not do it. So, please explain exactly what cancers you are referring to in the article when you say Keto could potentially make them worse. Or, at the very least, please cite the medical source that would back that up with specific cancer types. In reply to by Dear Katie, we recommend that you discuss any diets with your MSK care team. You may also want to ask your team for a referral to one of MSK’s dietitians. Thank you for your comment and best wishes to you. Do you have any keto advice specific to people with breast cancer? For instance, my friend has HER2+ breast cancer and wants to do keto, but keto is meat-heavy and meat usually has estrogen. Her breast cancer is fueled by estrogen. So she is doing a plant-based keto diet, but I have found little help on the specific topic of treating HER2+ breast cancer patients with keto, ideally primarily plant-based. Any websites, dieticians, etc. you can recommend for this particular dilemma of treating breast cancer with a meat/estrogen free keto plan? Thanks! In reply to by Dear Alice, you can learn more about the connection between soy and breast cancer from . We recommend that your friend discuss any diets she is considering with her doctor and that she get a referral to a dietitian who has experience working with people who have cancer. Thank you for your comment and best wishes to you and your friend. The Skinny on Fat and Cancer Risk What questions do your patients have about diet as it relates to cancer?

73c180af-ac71-47db-9c59-f529d7feb856,"— Medically reviewed by Many people looking to lose weight or manage chronic health conditions decide to restrict their carb intake (, , , ). Although grains are normally off-limits on low carb and ketogenic diets due to their high carb count, quinoa is often considered a health food. Thus, you may wonder whether it adheres to either of these diets. Technically a pseudocereal, quinoa () is nutritionally considered a whole grain. A diet rich in whole grains is linked to a reduced risk of disease and death (, ). This grain is touted for its many health benefits and broad range of nutrients. It’s naturally gluten-free, comes in several colors, and often eaten on its own or in salads, stews, and porridges (, ). This article tells you whether quinoa is low carb or keto-friendly. Quinoa is considered a fairly high carb food, as it contains 21.2 grams in a cooked 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving. This gives it roughly the same number of carbs as (, , , ). Depending on the type of low carb diet you follow, a single serving of quinoa may exceed your daily carb allowance. Since your body doesn’t fully digest the carbs from dietary fiber, subtracting the total fiber from the total carbs in a food tells you how many carbs your body breaks down. As 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of cooked quinoa holds 2.6 grams of fiber, this portion contains approximately 18.6 grams of net carbs (). Although this number is lower than the total carbs, keep in mind that it’s still significantly more than the 13 grams of net carbs in a single slice of whole grain bread — a food that’s on low carb diets (). Just 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of cooked quinoa provides roughly 21.2 grams of total carbs, or 18.6 grams of net carbs — making it a fairly high carb food. Many people want to eat quinoa on low carb or keto diets due to its rich nutrient profile (). However, serving size is key. If you’re planning on including this grain in your keto or low carb diet, you should only do so sparsely — not in full-sized portions. For instance, on a strict keto diet that limits your carb intake to 20 grams per day, one full 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of quinoa exceeds your carb allowance because it boasts over 21 grams of carbs (, , ). Even on a more relaxed keto diet that permits up to 50 grams daily, you would still have to carefully restrict all other carbs and stick to foods denser in protein and fat the rest of the day (, , ). Although some low carb diets are less stringent and allow for more carbs, you should only eat very small portions of quinoa on low carb or keto diets — if at all. For instance, you could sprinkle a spoonful on a salad or stew. This way, you could still enjoy quinoa’s signature crunch and nutty flavor without exceeding your carb allotment. How you prepare quinoa affects its overall nutrient content, making this grain especially important to limit — or avoid altogether — on low carb diets, including keto. For example, quinoa prepared with sauces or dressings packs more carbs than plain quinoa. Other dishes, such as and high carb fruit, also raise your meal’s carb contents. If you plan to eat small amounts of quinoa on your low carb diet, be sure to prepare it plain and in your meal. Quinoa fits low carb and keto diets only in very modest amounts. If you choose to eat it, consider it a garnish rather than a dish of its own — and be sure to avoid full-sized portions. In general, low carb diets contain fewer carbs and and fat than the typical Western diet (). These eating patterns promote lean meats, nuts, , and low carb veggies while limiting high carb foods like baked goods, desserts, certain fruits, and grains. Thus, if you follow a strict low carb diet, quinoa would automatically be considered off the table. A typical low carb diet restricts carbs to 50–130 grams per day, which is higher than the amount allowed on the keto diet (). The ketogenic diet is a type of low carb eating pattern that’s moderate in protein and very high in fat. It’s designed to help you achieve , a metabolic state in which your body burns fat instead of carbs as its primary energy source (, ). To maintain ketosis on this diet, you should typically consume 20–50 grams of carbs per day (). Many ban grains outright. Low carb diets, including keto, have more fat and protein than the average Western diet. While low carb diets restrict you to 50–130 grams of carbs per day, keto limits you to a minuscule 20–50. Although it’s considered a health food, quinoa is high in carbs and should be extremely limited on a low carb or keto diet. If you decide to consume it, never eat full portions. Rather, treat it like a garnish for , stews, sandwiches, or porridge. If you prefer to , it’s best to avoid quinoa altogether. — Medically reviewed by This is a detailed article about quinoa and its health effects.

We are also awaiting the results of a large global trial testing whether the diabetes drug metformin helps prevent breast cancer recurrence. At MSK, we have a for endometrial cancer, led by . It is currently enrolling participants. We are in the planning phase of developing trials that combine diabetes drugs with cancer drugs like PI3K inhibitors. In addition, MSK has one of the most active programs in the nation, led by . Under this program, we have several exercise trials that are currently ongoing. For example, we are testing different exercise regimens with chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer in a study led by . We will also soon launch a trial of precision exercise plans plus molecular and hormone-based cancer therapy for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. This is a rapidly developing area of research. As a physician-researcher, I find it very exciting that I can offer these options to my patients. As we learn more about how diet and metabolic alterations affect cancer, I am sure that we will find new ways to prevent cancer and prolong survival after a cancer diagnosis, all while improving well-being and general health. Is melanoma a form of cancer that respond well to a ketogenic diet?! In reply to by Pascale, thank you for your question. The research is at an early stage and we don’t know which cancers it might help. It is important to understand that the research is investigating whether a ketogenic diet can make some cancer treatments more effective, not whether a ketogenic diet alone is an effective treatment. There is no evidence that dietary changes alone are an effective treatment for melanoma. Keto should be implemented with lifestyle changes and exercise programs, mediation, acupuncture and many other integrative medicine treatments. Truly a comprehensive program seems most beneficial. Would this diet help those with gene mutations on this pathway that predispose them to getting cancer? We forwarded your question to Dr. Iyengar, who responded: “The study in mice was designed to address whether the keto diet improves response in cancers with PI3K mutations in conjunction with PI3K inhibitors. It is important to note that we are referring to mutations in tumor DNA, not mutations in the genes that predispose to cancer (in other words, the genes we inherit and pass down). We do not know if the keto diet is helpful for preventing cancer in individuals who have germline mutations that predispose to cancer. What we do know, is in individuals with mutations that predispose to cancer, obesity and metabolic diseases (like diabetes) are associated with earlier onset cancer. It is advisable for all individuals to maintain a healthy weight and healthy metabolic status by adhering to a balanced diet and exercise – and this is particularly important for individuals who are genetically at higher risk for developing cancer.” Thank you for your comment.  Can the Keto diet help in the treatment of Prostate Cancer? In reply to by Dear Robert, the keto diet is being studied for a number of different kinds of cancer. It is too early to make recommendations based on what we know now. Thank you for your comment. In 2013, I was diagnosed with colon cancer in the Sigmoid. I had Keyhole , In 2015 it reoccured.i then had a operation . I am presently in remission,seeing my Oncologist every 4 months.

I saw an article that is is being phased out. Dear Donna, we’re very sorry to hear about your relative’s diagnosis. Due to changes in the plans for manufacture of both pumps and catheters (the tube that attaches the pump to the liver), we have an investigational protocol where we are investigating a new pump and catheter combination. This still provides access of pumps to appropriate patients. Some pumps using catheter combinations that have been evaluated previously are still available for placement as well. These options can be discussed with the treating physician and we continue to provide pumps to patients in which this treatment is recommended as the best option. If your family member would like to schedule a consultation to learn more, they can online or call . Thank you for your comment.  Is it true that cancer loves sugar and Cancer patients should avoid sugar? My cancer is adenocarcinoma of the stomach which has metastasized to the lymph nodes. In reply to by Dear Tim, we’re sorry to hear about your diagnosis. You can learn more about sugar and cancer from . We recommend that you discuss any changes in diet with your medical team or with a dietitian who has experience in working with people who have cancer. Thank you for your comment and best wishes to you. Hi Dr. Iyenger: First, thanks for answering many of the questions we cancer patients have about the Keto Diet. A couple of questions for you: 1. Does research suggest that a Keto diet will improve the efficacy of the drugs we metastatic patients are on, particularly those that target the PI3K pathways (i.e. will we get a longer duration of the drug before progression)? And is the benefit worth the offset of what the diet will do to our liver compounded with what the drugs are already doing to our liver? As I understand it, the Keto diet has two planks: what you eat (low carbs, lots of protein and healthy fats) and intermittent fasting. What does the research say about intermittent fasting alone in promoting drug efficacy? Is that something healthier stageiv cancer patients should be considering adding to their diet? Lastly, can you also weigh in on the latest research regarding Methionine and cutting back on or eliminating meat and eggs and how that may elongate treatments for those of us with metastatic cancers (obviously that would need a separate article). Thanks! In reply to by Dear Liz, the effect that a ketogenic diet may have on cancer drug efficacy is a new area of research and it is not possible to make recommendations as this time. Some of the first clinical trials of this approach are beginning now, but it is too soon to say whether this approach will be effective. We recommend you talk with your doctor about which diet is right for you. Thank you for your comment. The article states that a Keto diet can actually make “cancers worse.” Please elaborate on this broad statement. I’m a MSK patient and currently NED after stage 3C Colorectal cancer. I, like many people, do Keto intermittently. If I thought there was ANY chance it may increase the chance of a recurrence, I would obviously not do it. So, please explain exactly what cancers you are referring to in the article when you say Keto could potentially make them worse. Or, at the very least, please cite the medical source that would back that up with specific cancer types. In reply to by Dear Katie, we recommend that you discuss any diets with your MSK care team. You may also want to ask your team for a referral to one of MSK’s dietitians. Thank you for your comment and best wishes to you. Do you have any keto advice specific to people with breast cancer? For instance, my friend has HER2+ breast cancer and wants to do keto, but keto is meat-heavy and meat usually has estrogen. Her breast cancer is fueled by estrogen. So she is doing a plant-based keto diet, but I have found little help on the specific topic of treating HER2+ breast cancer patients with keto, ideally primarily plant-based. Any websites, dieticians, etc. you can recommend for this particular dilemma of treating breast cancer with a meat/estrogen free keto plan? Thanks! In reply to by Dear Alice, you can learn more about the connection between soy and breast cancer from . We recommend that your friend discuss any diets she is considering with her doctor and that she get a referral to a dietitian who has experience working with people who have cancer. Thank you for your comment and best wishes to you and your friend. The Skinny on Fat and Cancer Risk What questions do your patients have about diet as it relates to cancer?

By , For most women, menopause—the cessation of menstrual periods—is a normal, natural occurrence. The average age at menopause is 51, although any time after 40 is considered normal. The years leading up to the menopausal transition—a time known as the perimenopause—may be characterized by changes in the menstrual period, hot flashes (a sudden feeling of warmth, sometimes accompanied by sweating), emotional ups and downs, sleep disturbances, and vaginal dryness. Some of these symptoms may continue after menopause. The severity of symptoms varies dramatically from person to person, ranging from barely noticeable menstrual changes to an experience described as debilitating. Women who experience menopause abruptly because of the surgical removal of their ovaries (called ) typically have much more severe symptoms than women who experience a natural menopause. Both the perimenopausal and postmenopausal periods may present additional challenges for women who have . For one thing, the hormonal fluctuations that are common to perimenopause can affect blood glucose levels. For another, some symptoms of menopause are the same as or easily confused with the symptoms of high or low blood glucose levels, so the cause must be determined before corrective action can be taken. In addition, both diabetes and menopause raise a woman’s risk of osteoporosis, so women with diabetes must be proactive about taking steps to keep their bones strong. Lack of sleep, whether related to menopause, stress, or something else, can disrupt diabetes control. And menopause is often associated with weight gain, which can make blood glucose control more difficult. A woman is said to be postmenopausal one year after her final menstrual period. Menstrual periods may be very irregular in the years leading up to the final period, sometimes with only one to three cycles occurring per year in the late perimenopause. A small percentage of women stop having periods abruptly without any cycle fluctuation. Although fertility declines sharply after age 40, perimenopausal women can become pregnant, so contraception is necessary for sexually active women who do not wish to become pregnant until menopause is confirmed. Once a woman has gone a year without a period, she can no longer become pregnant. As the ovaries age, they become less responsive to the hormonal messengers on which they rely for regular function, and greater amounts of estrogen and progesterone are required for ovulation and menstruation to occur. The perimenopausal years are characterized by fluctuating, although not necessarily low, levels of these hormones. The unstable levels of estrogen and progesterone contribute to menstrual cycle irregularities and perimenopausal symptoms. They can also contribute to unstable blood glucose levels. While the effects of estrogen and progesterone on diabetes control are not entirely understood, in general, it appears that higher levels of estrogen may improve sensitivity, while higher levels of progesterone may decrease insulin sensitivity. When insulin sensitivity decreases, more insulin is needed to get glucose into the cells. The changes associated with perimenopause commonly begin about three to five years before a woman’s final menstrual period, although some women notice subtle changes as early as their late 30’s. Eventually, the ovaries become unresponsive and unable to ovulate (release eggs). Once the ovaries cease ovulating altogether, estrogen levels decline, and menstrual periods stop. However, hot flashes, night sweats, sleep disturbances, and mood fluctuations may continue for several years. Vaginal dryness due to low estrogen levels may persist if not treated. One of the challenges for menopausal women who have diabetes is distinguishing between the symptoms of the two conditions. It is not uncommon to mistake menopause-related hot flashes or moodiness for symptoms of low blood glucose. Night sweats—hot flashes that occur at night—can interrupt sleep and lead to excessive daytime fatigue, which can also be mistaken for low blood glucose. If this leads to eating extra calories to raise a low blood glucose level, it could lead to high blood glucose and, over time, weight gain, if repeated on a regular basis. The reduced estrogen levels that occur with menopause can directly cause or can raise a woman’s risk of vaginal dryness, vaginal infections, and urinary tract infections—but so can high blood glucose levels. While all of these conditions are treatable, the cause of the problem must be determined for proper management. Regular blood glucose monitoring can help women figure out whether low or high blood glucose levels may be causing their symptoms. Any woman who is experiencing chronically high blood glucose levels should address that issue first, with the help of her diabetes team, if needed. But what if the symptoms are related to menopause and not high or low blood glucose levels? How does a woman with diabetes successfully treat the most common symptoms of the menopausal phase, including hot flashes, night sweats, moodiness or irritability, weight gain, and vaginal dryness? The answer depends on the severity of symptoms, as well as the degree of control the woman has over her diabetes. Women with poorly controlled diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications associated with hormone therapy, and are therefore less suitable candidates for this type of treatment. Lifestyle changes are always the first step to help reduce the discomforts of menopause. The following changes can help make the menopausal transition easier: Remain (or become) physically active. Regular physical activity or exercise can help increase energy levels, improve mood, and combat weight gain. Substitute whole grains and fresh fruits and vegetables for processed and refined foods, both to help control blood glucose (and blood pressure) levels and to increase overall energy level. Use alcohol and caffeine in moderation or not at all, since they can trigger hot flashes and decrease sleep quality. If spicy foods have a similar effect, reduce your intake or avoid them altogether. Consume more legumes (beans and peas), soy foods, and flaxseed. These foods contain or chemicals found in plants that may act like estrogen in the body. Some women report that increasing the amounts of these foods in their diet decreases the frequency and severity of their hot flashes, although scientific studies have not confirmed this. (Phytoestrogen pills and powders are not recommended at this time because of safety concerns). Get adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals. To keep their bones strong, women going through menopause who are not receiving hormone therapy should be getting 1,200–1,500 milligrams of calcium and 800 international units of vitamin D each day (which can be provided by three to four 8-ounce servings per day of low-fat milk or yogurt). Women receiving hormone therapy should aim for 1,000 milligrams of calcium per day. Vitamin E and the B vitamins have also been suggested as beneficial for reducing menopausal symptoms, but the research does not currently provide strong support. Use of herbal teas or supplements may be helpful for treating hot flashes and night sweats. Research is limited, but herbal preparations such as black cohosh, garden sage, and motherwort are used in many Asian and European countries. However, you should speak with your doctor before beginning any sort of herbal regimen. In addition to the lifestyle changes already described, there are many simple techniques that may help to relieve minor to moderate episodes of hot flashes. These include the following: Avoid heat around the face area from devices such as hair dryers and curling irons. Avoid using hot tubs, and keep baths and showers tepid or cool. Wear layers of clothing so you can take off some clothing, if needed. Sleep with a light blanket or other covering and with the windows open or a small fan blowing directly on you. Use a ceiling fan or air conditioner if you have one. Place cold compresses on your face when you experience hot flashes or sweating. Practice deep abdominal breathing—count to 10 while inhaling slowly, then exhale slowly while counting to 10. Repeat 10 times. Try to identify and avoid your own personal hot-flash triggers. Remind yourself that your symptoms will eventually lessen or abate. Hormone therapy (HT) can be used to alleviate severe menopausal symptoms, especially unrelenting hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness. Estrogen therapy (ET) is appropriate only for women who have had a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) because estrogen alone increases the risk of uterine cancer. Women who wish to use hormone therapy who have not had a hysterectomy must use a combination of estrogen and progestin together, called estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT). Hormone therapy is the only FDA-approved medicine for the treatment of hot flashes and night sweats. Many women report that other menopausal symptoms such as insomnia, mood instability, and lack of concentration are also improved when taking HT, although scientific data has not confirmed these claims. However, the benefits of HT must be weighed against the risks, such as those recently documented in the Women’s Health Initiative, a large scientific study looking for ways to prevent a variety of conditions in postmenopausal women. According to the results of this study, there is a slightly increased risk of heart attack (7 more cases per 10,000 women per year), (8 more cases per 10,000 women per year), and potentially life-threatening blood clots to the lungs (8 more cases per 10,000 women per year) for women taking EPT. In addition, dementia risk appears to double, increasing from 22 cases to 45 cases per 10,000 women per year. For women with a hysterectomy taking ET, the risk of heart attack did not increase, but the risk of stroke did increase (13 more cases per 10,000 women per year). In women taking EPT, but not those taking ET, breast cancer increased by 8 cases per 10,000 women per year. Because women with diabetes already have an increased risk of heart disease, it is especially important for women with diabetes to discuss the benefits and risks of HT with their health-care provider. Heart disease is the leading cause of death of American women. On the plus side, HT use was associated with 5 fewer hip fractures per 10,000 women per year and with 6 fewer cases of colorectal cancer per 10,000 women per year in the Women’s Health Initiative. HT is approved for the prevention of osteoporosis. There have been some studies suggesting that taking estrogen promotes insulin sensitivity, which may in turn lead to a lowering of blood glucose levels. (The combination of estrogen and progestin, however, does not seem to have this effect on blood glucose control.) However, this benefit alone is not considered a reason to use estrogen, since there are other, safer options for the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance (namely weight loss and increased physical activity). Some women should not take HT or should only take it with extreme caution. Hormone therapy is not considered an option for women who have a personal history of breast cancer, although a family history alone does not prevent most women from being candidates for HT. Estrogen therapy is usually not appropriate for women with a history of severe blood clotting disorders or other medical conditions that are exacerbated or complicated by supplemental estrogen, such as liver disease and certain cancers. Some nonhormonal medicines have been shown to improve hot flashes for some women and are most often used in women with severe symptoms who cannot or choose not to use hormones. These medicines include certain , blood pressure medicines, and neurologic medicines. The decrease in estrogen levels that accompanies menopause can make the tissues of the vulva, the lining of the vagina, and the urethra thin, dry, and less elastic and can cause shortening of the urethra. These changes can lead to decreased lubrication, vulvar burning, pain, and sometimes bleeding with sexual activity. They can also increase the likelihood of developing vaginal infections, noninfectious vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina not caused by infection), and urinary tract infections. Topical, nonprescription lubricants can provide temporary relief from vaginal dryness and assist with sexual activity, although they do not reverse the long-term tissue changes that result from estrogen loss. Over-the-counter vaginal moisturizers can help relieve the symptoms of vaginal dryness such as itching and burning, but such products do not supply estrogen to the tissues and therefore do not treat the underlying cause of the vaginal dryness. A prescription vaginal estrogen product such as a cream, tablet, or ring administered directly to the vagina, on the other hand, can cause genital and urethral tissue to become thicker, more elastic, and moist. Vaginal estrogen is not thought to carry the same risks as systemic hormone therapy (therapy that affects the entire body, such as HT administered in pill or patch form) because vaginal estrogen probably does not get into the bloodstream in any significant amounts. While replacing vaginal estrogen can decrease the risk of urinary tract infections and also tends to decrease the need to urinate frequently that often accompanies estrogen loss, an existing urinary tract infection should be treated with antibiotics. For a number of reasons, women are prone to accumulating excess body fat, whether or not they have diabetes. Unlike male hormones, which keep muscle mass high, female hormones promote fat formation. The fat is typically deposited first on the thighs and buttocks, then the stomach, followed by the upper body and arms. Women with Type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome, however, typically accumulate fat in the abdominal region. In addition to biological factors, certain lifestyle choices can also lead to increased body fat. Skipping meals and following “crash” diets can actually lead to weight gain in the long term by causing the body to slow down its metabolism and use calories more efficiently. The key to weight loss, therefore, is to eat regularly scheduled meals, choose healthful foods containing whole grains, fruits and vegetables, reduce your fat intake, and consume smaller portions. Losing even 10 to 20 pounds can help you control your blood glucose levels more easily, as well as improve your circulation, blood pressure, and heart health. Increasing your level of physical activity can help with all of these goals, and it’s good for your diabetes control and heart health even if you don’t lose weight. The following are some strategies for putting an exercise plan into action: Set small goals. If you are currently not physically active, start out by walking for 5 to 10 minutes, three days a week. Increase your time and distance gradually. Do an activity you enjoy. Try walking, swimming, water exercises, using an exercise bike, or taking yoga or Pilates classes. Doing more than one type of physical activity works different parts of your body and can keep your exercise routine from becoming stale. Exercise with other people who keep you motivated. Keep a log of your activities, both for motivation and to see how physical activity affects your blood glucose levels. Become more active in your daily life. Small steps such as taking a walk during your lunch hour and taking the stairs instead of the elevator can add up. Exercise one to two hours after eating. This will help control blood glucose levels. Perhaps the most important thing a perimenopausal woman can do is to listen to and respect her body. Just as each person’s diabetes requires an individualized plan for control, so is each woman’s experience with menopause unique. Because it’s common to experience some changes in blood glucose control as you go through menopause, it helps to maintain a regular schedule of blood glucose monitoring, as well as good exercise and eating habits. Using relaxation techniques to reduce stress and trying to get adequate sleep can help, too. Consult your medical provider if your symptoms are severe and are dramatically affecting your quality of life. If you are interested in trying hormone therapy or taking other medicines to control your symptoms, talk to your health-care provider about the benefits and risks as they relate to your personal health. This article and can help you to formulate a list of questions or concerns to bring up at your appointment. The goal of balancing diabetes control and menopause symptoms should be to remain strong and vital so you can maximize the quality of your life.

Are There Home Remedies (, Exercise, and Glucose Monitoring) for Diabetes? What Types of Health Care Professionals Treat Diabetes? Are There Support Groups and Counseling for People With Diabetes? Doctor's Notes on Diabetes (Mellitus, Type 1 and Type 2) Symptoms Learn the signs of diabetes and how it can be managed with diet and lifestyle changes. is a condition characterized by the body's inability to regulate glucose () levels in blood. In , the body does not produce enough insulin. People with can produce insulin, but the body is not able to use the insulin effectively. Symptoms of both type 1 and include The cause of type 1 is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system slowly destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Combinations of genetic factors and unhealthy lifestyle choices cause type 2 diabetes. The main diagnostic test for diabetes is measurement of the blood glucose level. Changes in lifestyle and may be adequate to control type 2 diabetes in some people. Other people with type 2 diabetes require medications. Insulin is essential treatment for type 1 diabetes. To date, only the drug teplizumab has proven effective to slow progression to type 1 diabetes in some early cases detected before clinical onset. No approach has yet proven effective to prevent type 1 diabetes. Prevention of type 2 diabetes can be accomplished in some cases by: sustaining a healthy lifestyle, such as abstinence. Prediabetes is a condition that can occur before development of type 2 diabetes. Any type of over time can damage blood vessels and nerves. Damage to blood vessels can lead to , , and vision problems including . can result in . Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a set of related diseases in which the body cannot regulate the amount of (specifically, glucose) in the blood. The blood delivers glucose to provide the body with energy for all daily activities. The converts the food a person eats into glucose (simple sugar) and stores this glucose as starch (called glycogen). The liver releases stored glucose into the bloodstream between meals. In a healthy person, several hormones tightly regulate the blood glucose level, primarily insulin. Insulin is produced by the pancreas, a small organ located in the upper belly between the stomach and liver. The pancreas also releases other important enzymes directly into the gut to help digest food. Insulin allows glucose to move out of the blood into cells throughout the body, where it is used for fuel. People with diabetes mellitus either do not produce enough insulin (type 1 diabetes), cannot use insulin properly (type 2 diabetes), or both (various forms of diabetes). In diabetic patients, glucose cannot move efficiently from the blood into cells, so blood glucose levels remain high. This not only starves all the cells, which need the glucose for fuel, but over time also harms certain organs and tissues exposed to high glucose levels. The body produces little or no insulin to regulate blood glucose level. T1D affects about 10% of all people with diabetes in the United States. T1D is typically diagnosed during childhood or adolescence. In the past T1D was called juvenile-onset diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Insulin deficiency can occur at any age due to destruction of the pancreas by , disease, or removal by surgery. T1D results from progressive destruction by the immune system of the pancreatic beta cells, the only cell type that produces significant amounts of insulin. People with T1D require daily insulin treatment to sustain life. Although the pancreas still secretes insulin in someone with T2D, the body’s tissues are partially or completely incapable of responding to insulin. This is often referred to as . The pancreas tries to overcome this resistance by secreting more and more insulin. People with insulin resistance develop T2D when they fail to secrete enough insulin to cope with their body's demands. At least 90% of adult individuals with diabetes have T2D. T2D is typically diagnosed during adulthood, usually after age 45 years. It was once called adult-onset diabetes mellitus, or mellitus. These names are no longer used, because T2D can occur in young people, and some people with T2D require insulin therapy. T2D is usually controlled with diet, , , and/or oral medications. However, more than half of all people with T2D require insulin to control their levels at some point during the course of their disease. Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a form of diabetes that occurs during the second half of . Although gestational diabetes typically resolves after , a woman who develops gestational diabetes is more likely than other women to develop T2D later in life. Women with gestational diabetes are more likely to have large , complicated pregnancies, and complicated deliveries. (also referred to as ) is a set of abnormalities in which insulin resistance or T2D is almost always present along with (), high fat levels in the blood (increased serum , predominant elevation of , decreased , and ), central , and abnormalities in blood clotting and inflammatory responses. A high rate of cardiovascular disease is associated with . Prediabetes is a common condition related to diabetes. In people with prediabetes, the blood sugar level is higher than normal but not yet high enough to be considered diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. Prediabetes increases a person's risk of developing T2D, , or . Prediabetes can typically be reversed (without insulin or medication) by sustained lifestyle changes, such as losing a modest amount of weight and increasing physical activity levels. Weight loss can prevent, or at least delay, the onset of T2D. An international expert committee of the American Diabetes Association redefined the criteria for prediabetes, lowering the blood sugar level cut-off point for prediabetes in adults. Approximately 20% more adults are now believed to have this condition and may develop diabetes within 10 years unless they change to healthier lifestyles, such as exercising more and maintaining a healthy weight. About 17 million Americans (6.2% of adults in North America) are believed to have diabetes mellitus. Some experts estimate that about one-third of adults with diabetes do not know they have diabetes mellitus. About 1 million new cases of diabetes mellitus are diagnosed each year. Diabetes mellitus directly or indirectly causes at least 200,000 deaths each year. The rates of people affected by T1D and T2D are increasing rapidly. These increases are due to many factors. The most significant reason for T2D is the increasing number of people due to sedentary lifestyles. T1D is an autoimmune disease. The body's immune system specifically destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. A predisposition to develop T1D may run in families. However, genetic causes (i.e., a positive family history) are much more common for T2D. Common and unavoidable viral infections are among the environmental factors which contribute to T1D by triggering autoimmunity. T1D is most common among people of non-Hispanic, Northern European descent (especially Finland and Sardinia), followed by African Americans, and Hispanic Americans. It is relatively rare among Asian Americans. T1D most often presents before age 21 but can occur at any age. T2D is strongly linked to genetics, so T2D tends to run in families. Several genes have been linked to T2D, and many more are under study. Risk factors for developing T2D include: Gestational diabetes or giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds Ethnicity, particularly when a close relative had T2D or gestational diabetes. African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Japanese Americans display greater risks of developing T2D than non-Hispanic white Americans. : Increasing age is a significant risk factor for T2D. Risk begins to rise significantly at about age 45 years, and rises considerably after age 65 years. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes are often dramatic and come on very suddenly. T1D is usually recognized in childhood or early adolescence, often in association with an injury or illness (such as a virus or ). The extra can cause (DKA). Symptoms of ketoacidosis include and . and often serious disturbances in blood levels of potassium and other factors follow. Without treatment, ketoacidosis can lead to and death. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes are often subtle and may be attributed to or obesity. A person may have T2D for many years without knowing it. People with T2D can develop the hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic (“HONK”) syndrome. If not properly treated, T2D can lead to complications such as blindness, , , and nerve damage. Common symptoms of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes include: With diabetes, the body’s metabolism is inefficient and sometimes unable to use glucose for fuel. The body switches over to metabolizing fat, partially or completely, as a fuel source. This process requires the body to use more energy. The end result is feeling fatigued or constantly tired. People with diabetes mellitus are unable to metabolize food. They may even though they appear to eat appropriate or even excessive amounts of food. Losing sugar and water in the urine can lead to and unintentional weight loss. A person with diabetes mellitus develops levels. When kidneys filter this blood, the high sugar content overwhelms the kidney's ability to control sugar filtering. The kidney spill excess sugar into the urine, resulting in large amounts of urine. The body tries to counteract this by sending a signal to the brain to dilute the blood, which translates into thirst. Thirst encourages more drinking (i.e., water consumption) to dilute the high blood sugar down to normal levels and to compensate for water lost by excessive urination. Typically, people with undiagnosed diabetes will drink more sugary , not just water, which drives the blood sugar higher. The body tries to rid itself of extra sugar in the blood by dumping it via urine. Excessive urination can cause dehydration because a large amount of water is necessary to excrete high amounts of blood sugar. If able, the pancreas will secrete more insulin to control high blood sugar levels. With T2D, the body resists actions of insulin. One action of insulin is to stimulate hunger. Therefore, higher insulin levels can increase hunger. Despite eating more, the person with diabetes may gain very little weight and may even lose weight. White blood cells are critical to defend the body against infection and also to clean up dead tissue. High blood sugar levels prevent white blood cells from functioning normally. When white blood cells do not function properly, wounds take much longer to heal and become infected more frequently. Long-standing diabetes is also associated with thickening of blood vessels, which prevents good circulation needed to deliver oxygen and other nutrients throughout the body. Diabetes can suppress the immune system. Certain infections may indicate poor blood sugar control and can occur more often in a person with diabetes. These include frequent yeast infections of the genitals, dental infections, skin infections, and frequent . Agitation, unexplained irritability, inattention, extreme lethargy, or confusion can all be signs of high blood sugar, or ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (“HONK” syndrome), or (). Thus, any of these in a diabetic person merit immediate medical assessment of blood glucose. Call your health care professional or 911 for immediate attention by a medical professional. Though not specific for diabetes, blurry vision frequently occurs with high blood sugar levels. When Should Someone Seek Medical Care for Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes? If a person has diabetes and experiences any of the following, contact a health care professional. Experiencing diabetes symptoms. This may indicate an uncontrolled blood sugar level despite treatment. Blood sugar levels are consistently high (more than 200 mg/dL). Chronically high blood sugar level is the root cause of all complications from diabetes. Blood sugar level is often low (less than 70 mg/dL), called hypoglycemia. This may indicate that the strategy is too aggressive. Hypoglycemia could also indicate infection or other stress on the body's organs, such as kidney failure, liver failure, adrenal gland failure, other conditions, or the concomitant use of certain medications. Injury to the foot or leg, no matter how minor. Even the tiniest cut or blister can become seriously infected in a person with diabetes. Early diagnosis and treatment of problems affecting the and lower extremities, along with regular , are critical to preserve function of the legs and to prevent amputation. Each person with long-standing diabetes must perform self-care by examining their feet daily for wounds. A person can use a mirror or smartphone on a selfie stick to inspect or document the bottoms of his or her own feet. Low-grade (below 101.5 F or 38.6 C). Fever can be one sign of infection. Many common infections can potentially be more dangerous for diabetic people than non-diabetic people. Note symptoms may indicate where the infection is located, such as , redness or swelling of skin, , , or . Nausea or vomiting despite keeping liquids down. The health care professional may adjust medications while the patient is sick. The health care professional will probably recommend an urgent office visit or a visit to the emergency department. Persistent nausea and vomiting can be a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or other serious illnesses. DKA can threaten life. Small sore(s) or ulcer on the foot or leg. Any non-healing sore or ulcer on the feet or legs of a diabetic person must be evaluated by a medical professional. Even a sore less than 1 inch wide, not draining pus, and not exposing deep tissue or bone should be evaluated by a health care professional. When you contact a health care professional, tell the person you are concerned because you or someone you know has diabetes. The patient will probably be referred to a nurse who will ask questions and initially recommend what to do. Be prepared for this conversation. Have handy by the phone a list of all medications and nutritional , medical problems, to medicines, and a blood sugar diary. The nurse may need any or all of this information to decide both the urgency of the patient's condition and how best to treat the problem. The following situations can become medical emergencies (call 911) and warrant an immediate visit to a hospital emergency department. Anyone with a severe diabetic complication should travel to an emergency department by car or ambulance. If the person is unable to speak for himself or herself, a companion should accompany him or her to speak with the health care professional. Always bring a complete and current list of medical problems, medications, nutritional , to medications, and the person's blood sugar diary to the emergency department. This information will help the health care professional diagnose the problem and treat it appropriately. Signs and symptoms of diabetic complications that warrant emergency care Lethargy, agitation, forgetfulness, or just strange behavior can be a sign of low or high blood sugar levels. If a person with diabetes has an altered mental status, then try giving him or her some fruit juice (about 6 ounces) or cake icing if the person is awake enough to swallow normally without . Avoid giving things that can lodge in the throat, such as hard candy. The health care professional can prescribe glucose wafers or gels that melt under the tongue or (a medication given into the nose or by injection). If a diabetic person does not wake up within about 5 minutes and behave normally within about 15 minutes, call 911. If the person is not known to have diabetes, these symptoms can be signs of , drug intoxication, , oxygen starvation, and other serious medical conditions. Call 911 immediately. If a diabetic person cannot keep down food, medications, or fluids at all, he or she may have diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic (HONK) syndrome, or another complication of diabetes. If he or she has not already taken his or her latest insulin dose or oral diabetes medicine, then contact a medical professional. If he or she already has low blood sugar levels, taking additional insulin or medication may drive the blood sugar level down even further, possibly to dangerous levels. If the primary health care professional cannot see the patient right away, seek emergency care for a person with diabetes and high fever. Note any other symptoms such as , painful urination, , or chest pain. If the person’s blood sugar level is above 400 mg/dL, and the primary health care professional cannot see him or her right away, go to the closest emergency department. High blood sugar levels can be a sign of DKA or HONK syndrome. Both conditions can be fatal if not treated promptly. For a diabetic person, a nonhealing sore larger than 1 inch in diameter can be a sign of a potentially limb-threatening infection. Other signs and symptoms that merit immediate care are exposed bone or deep tissue , large areas of surrounding redness and warmth, swelling, and severe pain in the foot or leg. Left untreated, such a sore may ultimately require amputation of the limb. Any cut penetrating all the layers of skin, especially on the legs, is a potential danger to a person with diabetes. Although important to anyone's recovery, proper is critical in diabetic people to assure proper wound healing. Take seriously any or arms (particularly in the middle of the chest or along the left side), and immediately seek medical attention. Diabetic people are more likely than nondiabetic people to have a , with or without experiencing chest pain. Irregular heartbeats and unexplained shortness of breath may also be signs of heart attack. Depending on the location, this can be a sign of heart attack, (dangerous widening of the large artery in the abdomen), DKA, or interrupted blood flow to the bowels. All these are more common in people with diabetes than in the general population. All are potentially life-threatening. People with diabetes also get other common causes of severe abdominal pain, such as , perforated ulcer, inflammation and infection of the gallbladder, , and bowel obstruction. Severe pain anywhere in the body is a signal for timely medical attention. Diabetes: What Raises and Lowers Your Blood Sugar Level? What Tests Do Health Care Professionals Use to Diagnose Diabetes? Doctors use common tests to diagnose diabetes and monitor blood sugar control. The health care professional will take a history including information about the patient's symptoms, risk factors for diabetes, past medical problems, current medications, allergies to medications, family history of diabetes, or other medical problems (such as or heart disease), and personal habits and lifestyle. Various laboratory tests can confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. This rapid test may be performed anywhere, including community-based screening programs. Although not as accurate as testing blood in a hospital laboratory, a fingerstick blood glucose test is easy to perform, and the adequate result is available quickly. The test involves sticking the patient's finger for a tiny blood sample. The blood drop is placed on a strip to be inserted into a machine that reports the blood sugar level. These portable machines are accurate to within about 10%-20% of true laboratory values. Fingerstick blood glucose values tend to be most inaccurate at very high or very low levels. Abnormally low or high results should be confirmed by repeat testing. Point-of-care testing is how most people with diabetes monitor their blood sugar levels at home. The patient will be asked to eat or drink nothing for eight hours before having blood drawn, usually first thing in the morning. If the blood glucose level is greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL (without eating anything) at any age, the person probably has diabetes. If the result is unclear, further testing may be performed to confirm diabetes. Such testing can be a fasting plasma glucose repeated on a different day, an oral glucose tolerance test (described below), or a fingerstick (called """" and described below). If fasting plasma glucose level is greater than 100 mg/dL but less than 126 mg/dL, then the patient has impaired fasting glucose, or IFG. IFG is prediabetes. Though patients with IFG do not yet have diabetes, they carry high risk of developing diabetes in the near future. After fasting for at least six hours, the health care professional draws blood to measure plasma glucose before and at two hours after drinking a specific sweet drink (which contains up to 75 grams of sugar). If the blood sugar level rises to 200 mg/dL or higher, the patient has diabetes. If the blood glucose level rises to between 140 and 199 mg/dL after the sugary drink, then the patient has impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). IGT is also a prediabetic condition. This test measures how high the blood sugar levels have been over approximately the last 120 days, which is the average life span of the red blood cells on which this test is based. Glucose attaches naturally on hemoglobin in red blood cells and stays there for the remaining life of the red blood cell. The percentage of hemoglobin with attached sugar can be measured in a small blood drop, obtained by fingerstick or blood draw. The is a practical measure of blood sugar control in most people with diabetes. The normal hemoglobin A1c value is under 6%. Hemoglobin A1c levels at or below 7% indicate good glucose control. Results at or above 8% indicate blood sugar levels are high too often. The hemoglobin A1c test is most useful for diabetes follow-up care. Though occasionally suboptimal for diagnosing diabetes, hemoglobin A1c above 6% is highly suggestive of diabetes. Often another test will support the diagnosis of diabetes. The hemoglobin A1c is usually measured about every three to six months in people with diabetes. It may be done more frequently for people with difficulty achieving and maintaining good blood sugar control. This test is rarely used to document chronic hypoglycemia in nondiabetic patients. Normal values may vary from laboratory to laboratory. Various treatments exist for diabetes. T1D requires insulin (by multiple daily injections or a pump), diabetic diet, and other lifestyle modifications. T2D is generally treated with diabetic diet, lifestyle changes (such as moderate to vigorous exercise), and medication(s). Are There Home Remedies (, Exercise, and Glucose Monitoring) for Diabetes? If a person has diabetes, healthful lifestyle choices in diet, exercise, , and other habits will help improve glycemic (blood sugar) control and prevent or minimize complications from diabetes. A healthy diet is key to controlling blood sugar levels and preventing . Patients who are obese and have had difficulty losing weight on their own should talk to a health care professional. He or she can recommend a dietitian, help set feasible goals, or supervise a weight-modification program. Eat a consistent, well-balanced diet high in fiber, low in saturated fat, low in concentrated sweets, and eliminate excess calories. A consistent diet includes roughly the same number of calories at predictably similar times of day. Such a disciplined diet helps match the correct dose of insulin or other medications. A healthy diet helps keep the blood sugar level relatively even. A healthy, predictable diet avoids excessively low or high blood sugar levels, which can be dangerous and even life-threatening. In any form, regular exercise helps reduce the risk of developing diabetes. Activity can reduce the risk of developing diabetes-related complications such as heart disease, , kidney failure, blindness, and leg ulcers. As little as 20 minutes of three times a week has proven beneficial. Any exercise is beneficial. No matter how easy or how long, some exercise is better than no exercise. Reducing the time spent sitting is helpful. Patients who have diabetes-related complications (such as eye, kidney, or nerve problems) may be limited in both the type of exercise and the amount of exercise they can safely perform. Consult your health care professional before starting any exercise program. Moderate or eliminate alcohol consumption. One drink is considered 1.5 ounces of liquor, 6 ounces of wine, or 12 ounces of beer. Adult men should not consume more than seven alcoholic in a week, and never more than two drinks in an evening. Adult women should not consume more than three alcoholic drinks in a week, and never more than one drink in an evening. Excessive alcohol use is a known risk factor for T2D. Alcohol consumption can cause low or high blood sugar levels, cause (neuritis), and increase . If a diabetic person smokes cigarettes or uses any other form of , he or she dramatically raises his or her risks for nearly all diabetes-related complications. damages blood vessels. contributes to heart disease, stroke, and poor circulation in the limbs. People who need help to quit tobacco use should talk to a health care professional. Check blood sugar levels frequently, then record the results in a logbook or digital record. At a minimum, check blood sugar before meals and at bedtime. The glucose log should include the doses and times of administration for insulin or oral medications, when and what the person ate, when and for how long the person exercised, and any significant events of the day (such as high or low blood sugar levels and how the person treated the problem). Many mobile applications (""apps"") exist to help log and share data. Simple equipment exists to test sugar levels less painfully and more conveniently. The daily sugar diary is invaluable both to self-management and to professional evaluation of responses to medications, diet, and exercise. Medicare pays for diabetic testing supplies, as do many private insurers and Medicaid. Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are useful devices that measure and log glucose levels under the skin. CGMs and their logs can be highly helpful tools for managing diabetes. CGMs must be calibrated carefully with blood glucose monitoring. Treatment of diabetes is highly individualized. Treatment depends on the specific type of diabetes, co-existing medical problems, presence of diabetes-related complications, and the physical and mental skills of the affected person. A health care team helps set healthy and feasible goals for lifestyle changes, blood sugar control, and treatment. Together, the affected person and his or her health care team formulate a plan to help meet these goals. Education about diabetes and its treatment is essential. At the initial diagnosis of diabetes, the health care team will spend much time educating the patient about the condition, treatment, and practical skills for daily self-care. The diabetes care team includes the health care professional and support staff. A professional dietitian and a diabetes educator are usually part of the team. The team may include specialists in hormone health (endocrinology), foot care (podiatry), , kidney diseases (nephrology), eye diseases (ophthalmology), and behavioral health (psychology or psychiatry). Among reputable sources, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease (NIDDK) provides information on diabetes and related research including clinical trials. The health care team will encounter the patient at appropriate intervals to monitor progress and evaluate goals. Treatment of T1D involves multiple daily injections of insulin or continuous insulin delivery by a pump. Daily injections usually combine short-acting insulin (e.g., lispro [], aspart [ or Fiasp], regular) and a long-acting insulin (e.g., NPH, lente, glargine [ or Basaglar], detemir []). Insulin must be given as an injection just under the skin. If taken by mouth, insulin would be destroyed in the stomach before it could get into the blood where it is needed. Most people with T1D inject themselves. Even if someone else usually injects the insulin, every person taking insulin must know how to inject insulin in case the other person is unavailable. A trained professional will show the patient how to store and inject insulin. Usually this is a nurse or a diabetes educator. Fast-acting insulin is usually injected three or four times each day, generally around mealtimes. Dosage is individualized and tailored to the patient's specific needs. Long-acting insulin formulations are typically administered once or twice each day. Some people prefer to receive fast-acting insulin continuously by infusion pumps. Supplemental mealtime insulin is programmed into the pump by the individual in consultation with his or her health care team. It is important to match food intake with insulin dosing, because insulin lowers blood sugar regardless of whether a person eats or not. If excessive insulin is received relative to food intake, the result may be hypoglycemia. This is called an . During the adjustment period after initial diagnosis, the individual learns how insulin affects him or her. He or she learns how to time meals and exercise with insulin injections to keep blood sugar levels as even as possible. Many people with diabetes struggle with adjustment to their condition, especially maintaining high motivation and resilience after many years coping with diabetes. Keeping accurate records of sugar levels and insulin dosages is crucial for diabetes management. Eating a consistent, healthy diet appropriate for the patient's diagnosis and weight is essential to control sugar levels and to prevent diabetes-related complications. Depending on several factors upon diagnosis of T2D, the person may be able to control blood sugar through lifestyle changes, without medication. Such factors include but are not limited to the patient’s age, motivation, self-discipline with diet and exercise, duration of T2D prior to clinical diagnosis, and co-existing conditions. For obese people with T2D, the best initial approach includes dietary restrictions and an exercise program under the supervision of a physician with the aim of weight loss. This course will generally be tried for three to six months. If blood sugar and glycosylated hemoglobin remain high, then the person will receive oral medication, usually a sulfonylurea or biguanide ( []). Even on medication, a healthy diet and physical activity are essential to lose weight or to maintain a healthy weight. People should perform moderate to vigorous physical activity as often as possible. The health care professional will carefully monitor the patient's progress on medication. The therapeutic goals are the right dose(s) of the right medication(s) at the right time(s) to control blood sugar levels with few side effects. Over time, people with T2D often require insulin injections to control their sugar levels. People with T2D commonly take a combination of oral medication and insulin injections to control sugar levels. Many different types of medications are available to help lower blood sugar levels in people with T2D. Each medication works in a different way. Combining two or more medications commonly gets better outcomes. These stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin. Sometimes, the pancreas lacks enough stored insulin to respond adequately to sulfonylurea. These decrease the amount of glucose produced by the liver by improving its sensitivity to insulin. These slow absorption of starch as a person eats, which slows down the rise of blood glucose level during and after meals. These increase tissue sensitivity to insulin but are restricted in the U.S. market. These stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin. These stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin more quickly. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT2) inhibitors: These block reabsorption of glucose by the kidney, leading to increased glucose excretion and reduction of blood sugar levels. are more common with SGLT2 inhibitors due to higher sugar levels in the urine. Amylin is a naturally occurring hormone secreted by the pancreas along with insulin. Amylin derivatives, such as (), help lower blood sugar levels after meals when insulin alone does not. Pramlintide is injected subcutaneously along with insulin. These promote insulin release by the pancreas. They mimic other natural actions that lower blood sugar level. () was the first incretin mimetic agent approved in the U.S. It is indicated for T2D in addition to metformin (Glucophage) or a sulfonylurea, when these agents alone cannot control the sugar level. Only synthetic types of human insulin are available in the U.S., since they are less likely to cause allergic reactions than the animal-derived insulin used in the past. Different formulations of insulin are categorized according to action onset and duration. Commercial mixtures of insulin sometimes provide constant (basal) control and immediate control. Rapid-acting insulin formulations: Prompt insulin zinc (Semilente, slightly slower acting) Intermediate-acting insulin formulations: Isophane insulin, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) (, ) Long-acting insulin formulations: Both T1D and T2D create high blood sugar levels, called hyperglycemia. Over years, hyperglycemia damages the of the eye, blood vessels of the kidneys and other organs, and the nerves. Damage to the retina from diabetes () is the leading cause of acquired blindness. Damage to the kidneys from diabetes () is the leading cause of acquired kidney failure. Damage to the nerves from diabetes () is a major cause of foot wounds and ulcers. It remains the leading cause of nontraumatic amputations of feet and legs. Damage to the nerves in the autonomic can lead to paralysis of the stomach (gastroparesis), , and an inability to control heart rate and during postural changes (dysautonomia). Diabetes accelerates , (the formation of fatty plaques inside the arteries), which can lead to blockages or a clot (thrombus). Such changes can then lead to heart attack, stroke, and decreased circulation in the arms and legs (). Diabetes predisposes people to elevated blood pressure (), high levels of and . Both independently and together with hyperglycemia, these conditions increase the risk of heart disease, , and other blood vessel complications. Diabetes can contribute to a number of acute medical problems. Acute means coming on suddenly rather than developing slowly over time (chronic). Many are associated with diabetes. Infections are frequently more dangerous in someone with diabetes because the body's normal ability to fight infections is impaired. Infections may worsen glucose control, which further delays recovery from infections. or low blood sugar occurs intermittently in most people with diabetes. It can result from receiving too much diabetes medication or insulin (an insulin reaction), missing a meal, exercising more than usual, drinking too much alcohol, or taking certain medications for other conditions. You should recognize hypoglycemia and must be prepared to treat it at any time. , feeling dizzy, poor concentration, tremor of the hands, and are common symptoms of hypoglycemia. A person can faint or lose consciousness with a if blood sugar level becomes too low. DKA is a serious condition in which uncontrolled hyperglycemia causes dehydration and inadequate insulin allows buildup of blood ketones (acidic waste products). High acid and altered salt levels in the blood can threaten life. DKA typically occurs at the initial diagnosis of T1D and in people with poor glucose control. DKA can be precipitated by infection, stress, , missing medications like insulin, or medical emergencies such as a stroke or heart attack. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic (HONK) syndrome is a serious condition in which high blood sugar level leads to severe dehydration. When the body tries to rid its excess sugar via the urine, this can cause severe dehydration leading to , coma, and even death. HONK syndrome typically occurs in people with T2D who are not controlling their sugar levels, who have become dehydrated, or who have stress, injury, stroke, or are taking certain medications, like steroids. A person with diabetes should be checked regularly for early signs of diabetic complications. A primary health care professional can order some tests. Other tests require referral to a specialist. People with diabetes who have entered or passed should have their eyes checked at least once a year by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) to screen for , a leading cause of acquired blindness. The urine should be checked for protein (microalbumin) on a regular basis, at least once annually. Urinary protein is an early sign of diabetic nephropathy, a leading cause of acquired kidney failure. Sensation in the legs should be checked regularly using a tuning fork or a monofilament device. is a leading cause of lower extremity ulcers in individuals with diabetes and the leading contributor to nontraumatic amputations of the feet or legs. The health care professional should check the feet and lower legs of adult diabetic patients at every visit for cuts, scrapes, , or other lesions that could become infected. Adults with diabetes should check the soles of their feet and their legs daily with a hand-held mirror or camera, either themselves or with the assistance of a relative or caretaker. The adult patient should be screened regularly for conditions that may contribute to heart disease, such as and . Follow treatment recommendations of your health care team. Keep records of blood sugar levels or CGM results as often as recommended by your health care team, including times when levels were checked, when and how much insulin or medication was taken, when and what was eaten, and when and for how long the patient exercised. Contact your health care professional if you have issues with treatment or symptoms suggesting poor glucose control. Fast-acting glucose should always be available for emergency use in case of hypoglycemia. Glucagon should always be available for emergency use by the patient or patient's support in case of seizure or unconsciousness suspected to be due to hypoglycemia. People with diabetes should always wear a medical identification tag that identifies their diagnosis and shows contact information for their healthcare provider. For children with diabetes, it is appropriate to show contact information for the parent(s). Attend diabetes education classes at the local hospital. The more educated you and your family are about your diabetes, the better your health is likely to be. If taking insulin, you should see your health care professional about every three months at a minimum. Every three to six months is generally adequate for those with uncomplicated diabetes and not taking insulin. Become educated to recognize the signs and symptoms of low blood sugar levels. Have a clear plan for treating low blood sugar levels, and know when to call 911. Mild symptoms include confusion and . These symptoms can progress to lethargy, agitation (sometimes with violent, jerking motions), or . No approach has yet been approved by the FDA to prevent T1D, though recent research showed promising results for teplizumab for some at highest risk of developing T1D. Control weight to normal or near-normal levels by eating a healthy low-fat, high-fiber diet with appropriate content of calories. Regular physical activity is essential to prevent T2D. To control high blood fat levels (e.g., high total ) or high blood pressure, take medications as directed. Lifestyle modifications and/or certain medications can sometimes prevent progression of prediabetes to T2D. Prediabetes can be diagnosed by checking fasting glucose or two hours after ingesting up to 75 grams of glucose (dose based on patient’s weight). If you or someone you know has any type of diabetes, focus on preventing diabetes-related complications. Complications can cause serious disabilities, such as blindness, kidney failure requiring dialysis, amputation, or even death. Tight glucose control! The single best thing people with diabetes can do is to keep their blood sugar level within the suggested range every day. The only way to accomplish this goal is the combination of glucose monitoring, appropriate diet, high personal motivation sustained over time, and appropriate medical treatment. Consult a nutritionist or your health care professional regarding diet. Quit smoking and stop use of other tobacco products. Increase physical activity. Adults should aim for moderate to vigorous physical activity lasting at least 30 minutes every day. Drink adequate amounts of water, and avoid consuming excessive salt. Take care of your skin. Keep it supple and hydrated to avoid sores and cracks that can become infected. Brush and floss your at least twice every day. Encounter your dentist and dental hygienist regularly to prevent tooth decay and . Wash and examine your feet daily. Including the soles, look for small cuts, sores, or blisters that may worsen. File toenails to avoid damaging the surrounding skin, rather than cutting them. A specialist in foot care (podiatrist) may be necessary to help care for your feet. Diabetes is a leading cause of death in all industrialized nations. Overall, the risk of premature death of people with diabetes is twice that of people without diabetes. Prognosis depends on the duration of diabetes, degree of blood sugar control, and development of complications. About 15% of people with T1D die before age 40 years, which is about 20 times the rate of this age group in the general population. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), kidney failure, and heart disease compose the most common causes of death related to T1D. The good news is prognosis improves with good sugar control. Maintaining tight blood (or CGM) sugar control prevents, slows the progression of, and can improve established complications of T1D. The life expectancy of people who are diagnosed with T2D during their 40s decreases by five to 10 years because of the disease. Heart disease leads the causes of death related to T2D. Aim for excellent glycemic control, tight blood pressure control, keeping the ""bad"" (LDL) level at the recommended level below 100 mg/dL (or even lower, particularly if other risk factors for cardiovascular disease are present), and keeping the ""good"" () cholesterol as high as possible. When indicated, can prevent, slow the progression of, and improve established complications related to diabetes. What Types of Health Care Professionals Treat Diabetes? Most primary care providers have experience managing diabetes, including internists, gynecologists, and family practitioners. Specialists in diabetes care are called endocrinologists or diabetologists. You can locate endocrinologists using the ""Find an Endocrinologist"" search engine online at the . You can locate a pediatric endocrinologist for diabetic youth using the ""Find a Doctor"" search engine of the . Are There Support Groups and Counseling for People With Diabetes? Consider joining a support group to share your experiences and learn from others. The , Hormone Health Network, and local chapters of Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International are excellent resources.

An individual nutrition plan will depend on many things, including underlying health and level of physical activity, the types of medication(s) being taken, and personal preference. Most people with type 2 diabetes find that having a fairly regular schedule for meals and snacks is helpful. Eating a variety of foods and watching portion sizes is also recommended.

Why is becoming a global epidemic, and is it just a coincidence that its rise is joined by another global epidemic — obesity? Could it be that the two are linked in some way, and if so, how? Dr. Nicola Davies, author of I Can Beat Obesity! Finding the Motivation, Confidence and Skills to Lose Weight and Avoid Relapse, investigates. The role of insulin resistance in the obesity-diabetes link Understanding is fundamental to answering the obesity-diabetes link question. The pancreas produces insulin, which helps the sugar we eat become fuel for cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to use for energy. Insulin resistance, however, reduces the ability of these cells to use the sugar for energy. This is more likely to occur in people who are overweight or obese since excess fat makes the cells less responsive to insulin, causing insulin resistance. There is also scientific evidence showing that fat cells are more insulin resistant than muscle cells. In other words, insulin is less effective in people who are overweight or obese, causing glucose in the bloodstream to remain high. There are several contributing factors to insulin resistance, not all of which are weight related. Some can be controlled, while others cannot. Genetics, age, and ethnicity all play a part. Medications like steroids can interfere with the insulin mechanism. Lifestyle factors such as alcohol intake, smoking, exercise level, and also play a key role, and there’s a cardiovascular connection too; individuals with high blood pressure and cholesterol are more prone to diabetes. Yet the one overarching indicator that outshines all other factors in terms of whether you’ll develop insulin resistance is your body weight. Nearly one-third of all American adults are obese, and the number of obese children has tripled in the last four decades. Indeed, obesity is the single best predictor of whether a person will develop Type 2 diabetes. If you are overweight or obese (characterized by a greater than 30), you have an exponentially higher risk of developing diabetes during your lifetime. In fact, almost 90 percent of people with Type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. People with a BMI above 30 are 80 times more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than people with a BMI under 22. Why is this? If we look more closely, it isn’t necessarily the weight itself that contributes to diabetes, but where it is stored in the body. Body fat can be classified according to two locations — visceral or subcutaneous. • is stored inside the belly area and wraps around the walls of internal organs, which means it can’t easily be removed by typical diets or exercise. • Subcutaneous fat is found right beneath the skin and is what you can physically measure when taking your waist circumference — the so-called “love handles.’” Visceral fat is the type that increases the risk of developing serious health problems such as diabetes. While subcutaneous fat isn’t as dangerous in general, when it comes to the belly area, both types of fat are present, so a growing belly can be a sign that one or both types of fat are increasing in the stomach region, raising your risk for diabetes. Ultimately, the weight around the midsection is the type we need to watch when it comes to preventing or controlling diabetes. People with excess abdominal fat (see table below) are much more prone to developing Type 2 diabetes because abdominal fat cells release inflammatory chemicals that reduce the body’s ability to incorporate and utilize insulin. It isn’t just where body fat (also known as adipose) is stored, but also the type of fat being stored. There are two kinds of adipose (fat) tissues. • Brown adipose tissues are, as you might expect, dark brown in color. They are linked with many blood vessels and associated with calorie burning, heat production, and energy balance. • White adipose, on the other hand, is responsible for storing energy and accumulates excessively in obesity. In a healthy body, muscles, fat tissue, and the liver absorb glucose from the bloodstream. White adipose supports this process of glucose regulation, which in turn helps reduce the risk of obesity and diabetes. However, when white adipose becomes excessively thick, its ability to help regulate glucose levels is disrupted. Understanding fat and how it is stored in the body can be useful if you are embarking on a weight-management regimen to prevent or control diabetes. The risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by age 25 quadruples in obese children. One large study in the United Kingdom examined electronic health records from 1994 to 2013 for nearly 370,000 children ages 2 to 15 for high BMI values indicative of childhood obesity. Researchers then looked at the diagnoses of either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes up to age 25 in those same people. Obese children had four times the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by age 25 compared to those children with a normal BMI during childhood. Historically, Type 2 diabetes had been considered an adult disease, but currently, Type 2 diabetes in children is being diagnosed at an alarming rate, with doctors attributing it to obesity, unhealthy diets, and lack of physical activity. Obesity is also an indicator of childhood Type 1 diabetes. Although Type 1 is an autoimmune disorder, factors such as obesity and insulin resistance further complicate the condition. In one study comprised of nearly 100,000 children who were monitored for weight changes during the first year of life, overweight and obese babies had a positive correlation with increased Type 1 diabetes incidence. The heavier the child, the younger the age of diabetes diagnosis. Although insulin resistance is not the main driver for Type 1 diabetes, this study shows that obesity does play a role and could explain why more children are developing both types of diabetes. The link between obesity and diabetes isn’t straightforward because other factors can exacerbate the link. is one area where this is particularly the case. Sleep is vital to so many of the body’s core functions, including insulin regulation. Untreated sleep issues such as , which is more common in overweight people, can increase the risk of developing obesity, which in turn increases the risk for insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Abdominal fat and overall obesity are the two biggest risk factors for developing sleep apnea because the excess fat in the pharynx (the part of the throat behind the mouth and nasal cavity) is more likely to block the airways. A cascade effect occurs in that obese people are more likely to develop obstructive sleep apnea, with even moderate sleep apnea disrupting metabolic processes and increasing the risk of developing diabetes. Endocrinologists point out that poor sleep negatively affects blood sugar levels and also disrupts many other bodily processes like cholesterol and blood pressure. These problems are much worse in obese individuals. Unfortunately, many people with Type 2 diabetes do suffer from poor sleep. Both the quantity of sleep as well as the quality matter in this equation. People who get too little sleep (less than six hours) or too much (more than nine hours) are more prone to Type 2 diabetes. Indeed, a British study of approximately 4,500 children showed that insufficient sleep was associated with three risk factors for Type 2 diabetes: higher BMI, increased insulin resistance, and elevated glucose readings. Researchers have another theory that obesity leads to , a condition characterized by elevated blood glucose levels that are not high enough to make a diabetes diagnosis. The number of people with prediabetes is rising sharply — at least 84 million people in the U.S. had it in 2015. Over time, prediabetes causes the body’s cells to start losing the ability to uptake insulin. In fact, most people with prediabetes end up developing Type 2 diabetes within 10 years. , a related condition, is a complex set of risk factors including excess abdominal fat, high blood pressure, elevated triglycerides, low HDL or “good” cholesterol, and high blood sugar levels. Many obese people suffer from this condition, which dramatically raises their chances of developing diabetes, among many other illnesses. In fact, having multiple metabolic syndrome risk factors leads to a five-fold increase in your risk for diabetes. Metabolic syndrome, also called Syndrome X or obesity syndrome, is hereditary, and as you get older, the risk gets higher. It’s very common among Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians — some of the same ethnicities that are more prone to diabetes. Doctors aren’t sure exactly why metabolic syndrome develops, but two of the biggest indicators are obesity (particularly abdominal fat) and insulin resistance. Obesity is the single biggest predictor of Type 2 diabetes, but fortunately, even small weight-related changes are very effective. Losing as little as five to 10 percent of your weight has been found to result in drastic improvements in overall health and well-being, which in turn reduce diabetes risk. If you weigh 200 pounds, lose 10 and see what happens. Diet interventions to reduce carbohydrates can be very effective. Get moving too — moderate walking for as little as 20 minutes per day can rev up your metabolism. Studies in which people employed these measures showed as much as a 60 percent reduction in the development of diabetes. If you already have prediabetes or full-blown Type 2 diabetes, stay focused and stay positive. You can make many lifestyle changes to your diet and exercise routine to prevent the situation from getting any worse. The same measures mentioned above will work even if you’ve already been diagnosed. Indeed, increasing evidence shows that weight loss can actually . The fact that weight and diabetes are so intertwined is a good thing, even if it might not seem so. It gives many of us some control over how we can avoid or manage diabetes. Indeed, the more we learn about how the link between these two conditions, the more empowered we are to tackle them head on in pursuit of better health and well-being. *** Being overweight is not the same as being obese. Overweight may simply be a result of having heavy bones or muscle mass, or even high body water content, but not necessarily fat. Obesity, on the other hand, refers only to having too much adipose tissue or fat in the body. Both conditions, however, refer to having weight or fat that is in excess of what is considered healthy for your height. Some people assume that they are unhealthy or “too fat” when their weight doesn’t fall in the ideal range. A healthy weight is computed based on your height, weight, and other factors. On the other hand, your ideal weight is often based on your personal preference and how you want your physique to appear. For obese people, losing five or 10 percent of their weight can already be healthy (or healthier) because it can reduce the risk of developing certain health problems. So, always try to aim for a healthy weight, rather than your ideal weight — they aren’t necessarily the same thing. • Obesity is detected through shrinking clothes and extra pounds Some people assume they are overweight or obese when their clothes feel tighter, the scale shows they’ve gained weight, or their waist feels wider than before. Although these signs show that you have gained some weight, they do not automatically mean you are obese. *** Interesting fact: the obesity-diabetes-memory link Type 2 diabetes has been linked to , and researchers now believe this could be related to increased weight in many people with Type 2 diabetes. People who are overweight or obese have been found to develop thinner grey matter in parts of the brain related to memory. Not only could weight management help with your diabetes, but it could also improve your memory. *** Want to learn more about weight and diabetes?

6dfbd2f7-4020-47b9-b907-57bdbd18265d,"— Medically reviewed by Beans are generally considered a healthy food. They’re rich in protein and fiber and provide a variety of vitamins and minerals. However, they also contain some carbs, so it can be a challenge to work them into a low carb, high fat keto diet. Most people on a keto diet aim to eat 50 grams or less of total carbs per day, or no more than 25 grams of net carbs, which is the number of total carbs minus the fiber and sugar alcohols. This article reviews the total and net carb counts of various types of beans, which ones are keto-friendly, and some low carb alternatives. This table provides the carb counts for some of the most common per 1/2-cup (60–90-gram) serving, cooked (, , , , , , , , , , ): Note that for most varieties of beans, a 1/2-cup serving weighs about 90 grams. However, green beans are much lighter, so a 1/2-cup serving weighs only about 60 grams. This table details the total and net carb amounts in a 1/2-cup (60–90-gram) serving of different varieties of beans. As you can see, some beans can be fairly high in carbs — both total and net — while others have much lower carb counts. On a strict , your best bet for beans is to choose either green beans or black soybeans. While green beans are typically prepared more like a vegetable than a bean, black soybeans are a great alternative to other, starchier beans in soups, bean dips, refried beans, or other recipes. However, some people recommend avoiding black soybeans on a keto diet because of the and its potential effects on your hormone balance, although no firm conclusions have been drawn regarding these potential effects (). Regardless, black soybeans have low total and net carb counts that will help you meet your goals while on keto. What’s more, most of the other types of beans can be incorporated into a well-planned day of keto eating if you stick to the proper portion size of just 1/2 cup (90 grams). Always check the label, though, as certain products like baked beans commonly contain added sugar, which can drastically increase the carb count. Green beans and black soybeans are low carb beans that can easily be incorporated into a keto diet. With careful planning, other types of beans can be included in small amounts as well. If you’re looking for some other keto-friendly substitutes for beans, here are promising alternatives: Cooked mushrooms are low in carbs and calories and can be used in place of beans in soups, stews, and chili to drastically reduce their carb counts. Like mushrooms, diced eggplant can be used to replace beans in certain recipes. You can also use eggplant to make a keto-friendly dip called baba ganoush, which can be used as an alternative to chickpea-based hummus. If you’re enjoying Mexican food, opt out of high carb refried beans or bean dip with your meal and choose guacamole or smashed instead. In soup or chili recipes, you can also omit beans and simply add extra ground meat, such as beef, pork, or turkey. Unlike the veggies listed above, this is a high protein option. When boiled, peanuts adopt a texture that’s remarkably similar to that of cooked beans. They’re also similarly high in protein and fiber, as peanuts are technically a legume in the bean family — not a nut. Several other can serve as an adequate substitute for beans in soup recipes, too. You likely have one or two options in your pantry, fridge, or freezer. Mushrooms, eggplant, boiled peanuts, and ground meat can be substituted for beans in soup, stew, and chili recipes. Meanwhile, baba ganoush and guacamole are keto-friendly dips that can replace higher carb options like hummus and bean dip. Most beans are too high in carbs to be staples on the keto diet. However, with careful planning, you can include small servings of beans occasionally. Always be sure to check labels for added sugars, though. and black soybeans are keto-friendly bean options, each containing only 2 grams of net carbs per 1/2-cup (60–90-gram) serving. Some promising keto substitutes for beans include mushrooms, eggplant, avocado, ground meat, and boiled peanuts. With these low carb beans and bean alternatives, there’s no need to shy away from bean recipes while on keto. — Medically reviewed by Green beans are crunchy and nutritious, but you may wonder whether they're safe to eat raw.

Type 2 diabetes symptoms include excessive thirst and urination, and dehydration. Type 2 diabetes causes and risk factors include older age, obesity, lack of exercise, family history, and excess fat around waistline. Treatments for type 2 diabetes are weight loss, a healthy diet, exercise, and medications if necessary. Anal itching is a common problem experienced by both men and women. Examples of causes of anal itching include irritants such as perfumes, chemicals, or dyes in toilet paper, food irritants, infections, and hemorrhoids. There are risk factors for anal itching such as diseases, profuse sweating, fecal soilage, and more. Anal itching in general can be treated at home with OTC medications if necessary. Obesity means an excess amount of body fat. No general agreement exists on the definition of obesity in children as it does adults. Some define pediatric obesity as body weight at least 20% higher than the healthy weight range for a child or adolescent of that height, or as a body fat percentage above 25% in boys or above 32% in girls. What causes diabetes, what tests diagnose it, and what is a good diabetic diet? Learn the signs of being diabetic, the treatments, and the differences between type 1 vs. type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent) can be caused by heredity, environmental factors, or ethnicity. Type 2 diabetes (non-insulin dependent) can be caused by high blood pressure, high lipid levels, high-fat diet, high alcohol intake, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, ethnicity, or age. People with diabetes rely on their insulin injections, insulin pumps, and other diabetes equipment and medications to keep them healthy. Transportation Security Agents should be notified of these items during travel. Also, food should be kept available to avoid hypoglycemia, and diabetic people should always stay hydrated. Be prepared to manage your diabetes, and control blood sugar and symptoms when you're sick, when you're at work or school, when traveling, during pregnancy, or during an emergency or natural disaster. Diabetes is one of the leading causes of blindness in the US and worldwide. Diabetic eye disease is a complication from diabetes. Types of diabetic eye disease include blindness, background diabetic retinopathy, nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, and glaucoma. Symptoms of diabetic retinopathy includes blurry or hazy vision, difficulty focusing, and night glare from oncoming lights. Causes of diabetic eye disease occur over time due to hypoglycemia (high blood sugar) and other abnormalities in metabolism found in people with diabetes. Treatment for diabetes eye problems depends on the type of eye problem. Medication and surgery for diabetes eye problems may be necessary in addition to lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy diet, exercise, quitting smoking. Read about diabetic foot care. Causes of foot problems in people with diabetes include footwear, nerve damage, poor circulation, trauma, infections, and smoking. Symptoms of foot problems in persons with diabetes include persistent pain, redness of the skin, leg or feet swelling, claudication, hard shiny skin on the legs, localized warmth around the wound, drainage or pus from the would, difficulty walking, fever, red streaking away from the wound, new or lasting numbness in the legs or feet. Any break in the skin can result in serious infection. Treatment depends upon the location and severity of the wound or problem. Amputation of the leg or foot is sometimes necessary. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) occurs when a person with diabetes becomes dehydrated. Causes of diabetic ketoacidosis include infection, missed insulin, or newly diagnosed diabetes. Some signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include excessive thirst, vomiting, confusion, dry skin or mouth, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency and if you think you or someone you know may be suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis call 911 or go to the nearest urgent care facility or emergency department. There are two types of diabetes, type 1 and type 2. There are two types of diabetic reactions; low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and high blood sugar (hyperglycemia). Symptoms of hypoglycemia include: dizziness; headache; rapid onset of cool, pale, moist, and clammy skin; rapid pulse; and shallow breathing. Treatment is to have the person with diabetes suffering the reaction eat or drink something with sugar such as juice, candy, or another sweet substance. Hyperglycemia is less common and the symptoms can occur over several days. Medical treatment is generally needed. Nutrition and diet is needed for health. Read dietary guidelines, dietary reference intakes, food guide pyramid, calories, carbohydrates, protein, fats, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals. A healthy variety of food provides nutrients for health and weight management and weight loss. Hemoglobin A1c (hemoglobin A1c) is a test used at times to monitor blood glucose in people with diabetes. HbA1c is a long-term indicator of blood glucose control. This test also monitors the effects of diet, exercise, and drug therapy on the patient's blood glucose. The normal range for hemoglobin A1c is less than 6%. HbA1c cannot be used to monitor day-to-day blood glucose levels. High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) is when the body's blood sugar rises. Blood sugar levels can be measured using a blood glucose meter. Diabetes mellitus is a common cause of high blood sugar. Symptoms include dry mouth, thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue. Treatment includes diet, exercise, and medications Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is caused by overmedication, use of certain medications, use of alcohol, missed meals, kidney or liver infection, and more. Common symptoms of hypoglycemia include: trembling, clammy skin, palpitations, anxiety, sweating, hunger, and irritability. Treatment of hypoglycemia in a person with diabetes is glucose (sugar). If the cause is another disease or condition, treatment will depend on the cause of the hypoglycemia. An insulin reaction occurs when an individual with diabetes experiences hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and becomes confused or unconscious. Causes of insulin reaction include improper medication dosing, exercise, or skipping meals. Common symptoms of a mild insulin reaction include dizziness, irritability, hunger, shakiness, rapid heart beat, and sweating. Treatment is generally sugar drinks, tablets, or wafers and monitoring insulin levels. Insulin resistance is a condition associated with several other conditions as well as a genetic component. Some of the conditions associated with insulin resistance include: the metabolic syndrome, stress, obesity, steroid use, or infection. Treatment of insulin resistance include lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise) and if necessary, medications. Metabolic syndrome refers to combination of metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease that occur together, including: insulin resistance, high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, and increased risk of blood clots. Causes include obesity, genetic factors, and smoking. Symptoms depend on factors present, but usually include large waistline. Treatment includes diet and exercise and medication. Neuropathy is a term that refers to malfunctions or diseases of the nerves. Types of neuropathy include diabetic neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, ulnar neuropathy, optic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, alcoholic neuropathy, proximal neuropathy, cranial neuropathy, auditory neuropathy, and focal neuropathy. Causes of neuropathy can be disease, injury, infections, or vitamin deficiencies. Symptoms of neuropathy depend on the nerves involved. Treatment is generally medication and lifestyle changes to prevent further nerve damage. More than two-thirds of Americans are overweight, including at least one in five children. Nearly one-third are obese. Obesity is on the rise in our society because food is abundant and physical activity is optional. The safest way to lose weight is to eat less and exercise more. Treatment may also include medications, surgery, and behavior modification. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD or peripheral artery disease) refers to any disease or disorder of the circulatory system outside of the brain and heart. Common causes of peripheral vascular disease include blood clots, diabetes, inflammation of the arteries, infection, structural defects, and injury. Symptoms of peripheral artery disease include buttock pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the legs, burning or aching pain in the feet or toes while resting, a sore on a leg or a foot that will not heal, one or both legs or feet feel cold or change color (pale, bluish, dark reddish), loss of hair on the legs, and impotence. Tests are used to diagnose peripheral vascular disease. Treatment guidelines include medication, lifestyle changes, and if necessary, surgical intervention. SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth) refers to a condition in which abnormally large numbers of bacteria (at least 100,000 bacteria per ml of fluid) are present in the small intestine, but they are more like the bacteria that are found in the colon. There are many conditions associated with SIBO, including:  Diabetes Scleroderma Crohn's disease Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) It has been theorized that SIBO may be responsible for the symptoms of at least some patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Symptoms of SIBO include: Excess gas Abdominal bloating Abdominal pain Treatment for SIBO can include: Antibiotics Probiotics Low FODMAP Diet Obesity is simply the accumulation of excess body fat. It is much more than that, however. Obesity is a chronic (long-term) disease that is very difficult to treat. It takes 3,500 extra calories to gain 1 pound. To lose weight, you must eat 3,500 calories less than you need, say 500 calories per day for one week, to lose 1 pound. What causes diabetes, what tests diagnose it, and what is a good diabetic diet? Learn the signs of being diabetic, the treatments, and the differences between type 1 vs. type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent) can be caused by heredity, environmental factors, or ethnicity. Type 2 diabetes (non-insulin dependent) can be caused by high blood pressure, high lipid levels, high-fat diet, high alcohol intake, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, ethnicity, or age.

Read This To Know What Next Written by and medically reviewed by team. Published on Jun 26, 2015 and last reviewed on Aug 03, 2019   -  3 min read Diabetes is a metabolic disease that affects the way your body uses blood sugar. Learn about the types, symptoms, and treatment of diabetes here. Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder. In this disorder, there is increase in blood sugar level. The cause may be lack of insulin or cells fail to respond and utilize insulin. It is considered as one among lifestyle disorders as unhealthy lifestyle is the major cause. Leading a healthy life style is necessary to manage diabetes. Type-1 diabetes: It is also called as insulin-dependent diabetes or juvenile diabetes. In this, there is deficiency in insulin production. Hence, insulin therapy is must for survival. Type-2 diabetes: It is also called as non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or adult onset diabetes. Here the cells develop resistance to insulin. Gestational diabetes: This is nothing but high blood sugar levels during pregnancy. Diabetes is diagnosed by testing sugar levels in your blood. My husband had five episodes of hypoglycemia in a single day. What could be causing all these? Tests include: (HbA1c), Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS), Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), Random Blood Sugar (RBS), Postprandial Blood Sugar (PPBS). Urine test, in which the urine sample is tested for sugar and ketones. There are two types of complications namely the acute and chronic complications. : It includes sudden occurrence of life threatening complications like hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Low blood sugar level or is caused due to increased dosage of insulin injection or diabetic medications or may be due to skipping meals after medication or accidental administration of second dose of medicines, excessive physical exercise without proper diet. When there is a diabetic patient in your family, then the members of the family should be in a position to identify and manage hypoglycemia to prevent any fatal conditions. If you are driving, slow down immediately and park the vehicle in a safe place. If you are walking, sit immediately to prevent injuries due to fall. Eat 4 teaspoons of sugar or drink a cup of milk or chew 3-4 candies. This is nothing but inctrease in blood sugar level. Occurs after many years of onset of diabetes. Prolonged elevation in blood sugar causes damage to blood vessels leading to following complications. - Retinal damage leading to blindness. Diabetic nephropathy- Kidney damage causes chronic kidney failure. Diabetic nephropathy- Abnormal or decreased sensation in skin. Cardiomyopathy- Damage to heart leading to heart failure. - Formation of skin ulcers, infection and gangrene. Diabetic encephalopathy- Damage to brain cells may cause dementia. If you are diagnosed as diabetic, you should remember the below key points always. To identify hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia (i.e, high and low sugar levels). Eye care- regular eye check up by ophthalmologist, maintenance of hygiene during eye wash, avoid self medication, in case of eye infection or visual disturbance consult doctor immediately.

30fcc308-97c0-43a0-b17f-06a82f18280d,"Referral and Contact Information Support Maynard Children's Hospital Accreditations and memberships Avoiding Hyperglycemia & Preventing Diabetic Ketoacidosis When blood glucose levels (also called blood sugar levels) are too high, it's called . Glucose is a sugar that comes from foods, and is formed and stored inside the body. It's the main source of energy for the body's cells and is carried to each through the bloodstream. But even though we need glucose for energy, too much glucose in the blood can be unhealthy. Hyperglycemia is the hallmark of diabetes — it happens when the body either can't make insulin () or can't respond to insulin properly (type 2 diabetes). The body needs insulin so glucose in the blood can enter the cells to be used for energy. In people who have developed diabetes, glucose builds up in the blood, resulting in hyperglycemia. If it's not treated, hyperglycemia can cause serious health problems. Too much sugar in the bloodstream for long periods of time can damage the vessels that supply blood to vital organs. And, too much sugar in the bloodstream can cause other types of damage to body tissues, which can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke, kidney disease, vision problems, and nerve problems in people with diabetes. These problems don't usually show up in kids or teens with diabetes who have had the disease for only a few years. However, they can happen in adulthood in some people, particularly if they haven't managed or controlled their diabetes properly. Blood sugar levels are considered high when they're above someone's target range. The diabetes health care team will let you know what your child's target blood sugar levels are, which will vary based on factors like your child's age. A major goal in controlling diabetes is to keep blood sugar levels as close to the desired range as possible. It's a three-way balancing act of: All of these need to be balanced to keep blood sugar levels under control. If any one is off, blood sugar levels can be, too. In general, problems controlling blood sugar levels are due to one or more of the following: not getting enough or other diabetes medicine not following the meal plan (like eating too much on a special occasion without adjusting medicines) use of certain medicines that can raise blood sugar, like steroids used to treat inflammation The symptoms of hyperglycemia are similar to those that happen when someone is diagnosed with diabetes, such as: The kidneys respond to high levels of glucose in the bloodstream by flushing out the extra glucose in urine (pee). A child with diabetes who has hyperglycemia may need to pee more often and in larger volumes. Kids with hyperglycemia who lose a lot of fluid from urinating often become very thirsty and may drink a lot in an attempt to prevent dehydration. Without enough insulin to help the body use glucose, the body breaks down muscle and stored fat in an attempt to provide fuel to hungry cells. Because the body can't use glucose for energy properly, kids with hyperglycemia may be unusually tired. As part of the diabetes management plan, you'll need to check your child's blood sugar levels multiple times a day with a blood glucose meter. This helps you identify when your child has high blood sugar levels, which don't always cause symptoms. Someone who isn't testing regularly might have blood sugar levels high enough to damage the body without even realizing it. The  can show if someone has been having significant hyperglycemia over time, even though the person may not have had obvious symptoms. If you find that your child is having a lot of high blood sugar levels, the diabetes health care team may suggest changing the diabetes medicines or meal plan to bring the levels back into a healthy range. In other cases, an equipment issue, like an insulin pump problem or expired insulin, may be the cause. Make sure you contact the diabetes team if your child's blood sugar levels are often above the target range. Treating high blood sugar levels means correcting their cause. The diabetes health care team will give you specific advice on how to keep your child's blood sugar levels in a healthy range. But here are some suggestions for managing some causes of hyperglycemia: What to Do Not getting enough insulin or other diabetes medication Make sure your child takes the right type of insulin and the correct dose at the right time. Make sure that all equipment (pumps, meters, etc.) works properly. Diabetes medicines may need to be changed or adjusted — check with the diabetes health care team. Not following the meal plan (like eating too much food on special occasions without adjusting medicines) Work with a registered dietitian to change your child's meal plan as needed. Adjust insulin/pills whenever your child eats more or less than what's on the meal plan (the care team can help you with this). Adjust your child's medicines based on the care team's instructions. Your child should continue to take insulin (the dose may need to change). Check blood sugar levels often as per the diabetes management plan. Insulin or pills may need to change while your child takes the medicine that's causing high blood sugar levels. A single high blood sugar reading usually isn't cause for alarm — it happens to everyone with diabetes from time to time. However, consistently high blood sugar levels need to be addressed. Insulin lets glucose get into the body's cells. Without enough insulin, the body can't use glucose for energy and starts to use fat for fuel. This can happen, for example, when someone skips doses of insulin or when the need for insulin suddenly increases (for example, due to stress or illness) and the doses are not adjusted. When the body uses fat for energy, chemicals called ketones are released into the blood, causing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Some of the ketones, like extra glucose, exit the body through urine. But high levels of ketones in the blood can be a problem because they cause the blood to become acidic. Too much acid in the blood throws off the body's chemical balance. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a very serious — but completely preventable — condition that can lead to coma or death if it's not treated quickly. It happens more often in people with type 1 diabetes, but can sometimes happen in people with type 2 diabetes. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis usually don't start all at once — they usually come on slowly over several hours. Signs and symptoms include: These symptoms are caused by the sustained hyperglycemia (usually lasting several hours) that typically happens before someone develops diabetic ketoacidosis. If the person isn't treated, these symptoms can happen: How do you know if your child has diabetic ketoacidosis? The signs and symptoms can mimic or be triggered by other illnesses, like the flu. So, it's very important to check your child's blood sugar levels and urine ketones during illness — especially if there are high blood sugar readings — or if your child has symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. Because high levels of ketones in the blood cause ketones to appear in the urine, ketones can be checked at home by testing a sample of your child's urine. If the urine test for ketones is negative, it generally means that symptoms are not due to diabetic ketoacidosis. If the urine test is positive, contact your child's diabetes health care team.  Tests done by a lab or hospital can confirm whether a child has diabetic ketoacidosis, if necessary. Some newer blood glucose meters also offer the option of testing blood for ketones. Ask the diabetes health care team if such a meter is a good idea for your child. Diabetic ketoacidosis requires immediate medical treatment with intravenous (IV) insulin and fluids and close monitoring in a hospital. Contact the diabetes health care team immediately or seek emergency care if you think your child is having symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. All adult family members and your child's caregivers and school staff should know about the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in a child with diabetes, and they should know when to call 911. In addition, all kids and teens with diabetes should wear some sort of medical identification (like a bracelet or necklace) and/or carry medical identification (ID) information at all times. Besides identifying your child as having diabetes, these IDs can provide emergency contact information. Avoiding Hyperglycemia & Preventing Diabetic Ketoacidosis The best way to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis is to treat high blood sugar levels appropriately, which means following the diabetes management plan prescribed by the diabetes health care team. takes insulin and diabetes medicines as prescribed follows the meal plan and/or makes appropriate adjustments to diabetes medicines when changes to the meal plan are made monitors his or her blood sugar levels regularly and ketone levels when indicated follows the instructions and advice of the diabetes health care team and diabetes management plan, which should include instructions for sick days By regularly monitoring blood sugar levels, you'll know when your child's blood sugar is high. If that happens, contact the diabetes health care team for more information and to learn how to help bring your child's diabetes back under control.

For a person with , ketoacidosis is a type of acidosis. — former term for type 2 diabetes, also formerly called noninsulin-dependent diabetes. — more than normal amounts of a protein called albumin in the urine. Albuminuria may be a sign of kidney disease. — a type of cell in an area of the pancreas called the Islets of Langerhans. Alpha cells make and release a hormone called glucagon, which increases the amount of glucose in the blood. — the building blocks of proteins; the main material of the body’s cells. is made of 51 amino acids joined together. — proteins that the body produces to protect itself from foreign substances (such as bacteria or viruses). — a large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to other parts of the body. Arteries are thicker than veins and have stronger, more elastic walls. — a disease of the arteries in the heart (also called or arteriosclerosis). Atherosclerosis occurs when the normal lining of the arteries deteriorates, the walls of the arteries thicken and deposits of fat and plaque block the flow of blood through the arteries. The arteries that supply blood to the heart become severely narrowed, decreasing the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart — especially during times of increased activity. — a disorder of the body’s immune system in which the immune system mistakes your body's own cells as invaders and attack them. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. — nerve damage most often affecting the digestive system, blood vessels, urinary system and sex organs. Autonomic nerves are not under a person's control and function on their own. — also called nonproliferative retinopathy. Is the early stage of retinopathy caused by diabetes. It does not usually impair vision. — continuous supply of low levels of insulin, such as provided by the insulin pump. — a type of cell in an area of the pancreas called the Islets of Langerhans. Beta cells make and release insulin, which controls the glucose level in the blood. — the measurement of the pressure or force inside the blood vessels (arteries) with each beat of the heart. Blood pressure is written as two numbers; the first number, the systolic pressure, is the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and fills the arteries with blood. The second number, the diastolic pressure, is the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats. — waste product of the kidneys. Increased BUN levels may indicate early kidney damage. — a bump or bulge on the first joint of the big toe caused by the swelling of a sac of fluid under the skin. Shoes that fit well can prevent bunions from forming. Bunions may lead to other problems, such as serious infection. — a small area of skin, usually on the foot, that has become thick and hard from rubbing or pressure. Calluses may lead to other problems, such as serious infection. Shoes that fit well can prevent calluses from forming. — energy that comes from food. Carbohydrates, protein, fat and alcohol all have calories. Fats have the most calories per gram. — one of the three main classes of nutrients and a source of energy. Carbohydrates are mainly sugars and starches that the body breaks down into glucose. — a doctor who takes care of people with heart disease; a heart specialist. — relating to the heart and blood vessels (arteries, veins and capillaries). — a health care professional who has met special requirements and is certified by the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators to teach people with diabetes how to manage their condition. — a waxy, odorless substance made by the liver that is an essential part of cell walls and nerves. Cholesterol plays an important role in body functions such as digestion and hormone production. In addition to being produced by the body, cholesterol comes from animal foods that we eat. Too much cholesterol may cause a build-up in the artery walls and lead to atherosclerosis. — a severe emergency in which a person is not conscious. Severe high or low blood sugar can cause a coma. — a sensor inserted under the skin that updates and reports glucose levels approximately every 5 minutes to the user. Home blood sugar monitoring may be required in order to calibrate the CGM and confirm readings. — a sudden rise in blood glucose levels in the early morning hours. This is more common in people with type 1 diabetes than type 2 diabetes. — great loss of body water. If a person with diabetes has a very high blood sugar level, it causes increased water loss, and the person becomes very thirsty. — a type of cell in the pancreas which releases other pancreatic hormones. — severe, untreated hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) that needs emergency treatment. DKA happens when there is not enough insulin. Ketoacidosis can lead to coma and even death. — an expert in nutrition who helps people plan the type and amount of foods to eat for special health needs. A registered dietitian (RD) has special qualifications. — cards, bracelets, or necklaces with a written message, used by people with diabetes or other medical conditions to alert others in case of a medical emergency. — a doctor who treats people who have problems with their endocrine glands. The pancreas is an endocrine gland. — a lab test that measures a person’s blood glucose level after fasting or not eating anything for 10 to 12 hours. Normal fasting blood glucose is less than 100 mg/dl for people who do not have diabetes. A diagnosis of diabetes is made when two blood tests show that your fasting blood glucose level is greater than or equal to 126 mg/dl. —substances that help the body use some vitamins and keep the skin healthy. They are also the major way the body stores energy. In food, there are two types of fats; saturated and unsaturated. — a type of sugar found in many fruits and vegetables and in honey. Fructose is used to sweeten some diet foods. — the death of body tissues, usually due to a lack of blood supply, especially in the legs and feet. — a form of nerve damage that affects the stomach. Food is not digested properly and does not move through the stomach normally. — a high blood glucose level that is discovered during pregnancy. As pregnancy progresses, there is an increased need for glucose for the developing baby. Additionally, hormone changes during pregnancy affect the action of insulin, resulting in high blood glucose levels. Usually, blood glucose levels return to normal after childbirth. However, women who have had gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. — an eye disease associated with increased pressure within the eye. Glaucoma can damage the optic nerve and cause impaired vision and blindness. — a hormone that raises the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Glucagon is sometimes injected when a person has lost consciousness (passed out) from a low blood sugar reaction. The injected glucagon helps raise the level of glucose in the blood. — a simple sugar found in the blood. It is the body’s main source of energy; also known as dextrose. — a test that can be used to determine if a person has diabetes. The test is done in a lab or doctor’s office in the morning before the person has eaten. First a sample of blood is taken. Then the person drinks a liquid that has glucose (sugar) in it. Periodically, another sample of blood is taken to see how the body processes the glucose in the blood. — the average amount of glucose that has been in a person’s blood over the past two to three months. It can be used to diagnose diabetes. It is also used along with home glucose monitoring to determine overall diabetes management. A level of 6.5% or higher is a diagnosis of diabetes. The target HbA1c for most people with diabetes is less than 7%. — a condition when the blood flows through the blood vessels at a force greater than normal. High blood pressure strains the heart, harms the arteries, and increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and kidney problems. Also called hypertension. — a way in which a person can measure how much glucose (sugar) is in the blood. Also called self monitoring of blood glucose. — a chemical released by the endocrine glands and other tissues to help control certain functions in the body. For instance, insulin is a hormone made by the beta cells in the pancreas, and when released, it triggers other cells to use glucose for energy. — bio-engineered insulin that is very similar to insulin made by your own body. — high blood sugar. Many things can cause hyperglycemia. It occurs when the body does not have enough insulin or cannot use the insulin it does have. — low blood glucose. Hypoglycemia in people with diabetes is often caused by an imbalance in diabetes medications, food intake, and/or activity levels. — persistent inability of the penis to become erect or stay erect. Men with diabetes may become impotent if blood sugar levels are high for a long time due to nerve and blood vessel damage caused by the high blood sugar. — changing the areas on the body where a person injects insulin. If the same injection site is used over and over again, hardened areas, lumps or indentations can develop under the skin which keep the insulin from being used properly. These lumps or indentations are called lipodystrophies. — recommended places on the body where people can inject insulin. These sites include the back of the upper arm, the abdomen, the thighs and the buttocks. — a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. The beta cells of the pancreas make insulin. — former term used for type 1 diabetes, also formerly called juvenile diabetes. — a small, computerized device that is worn on a belt , in a pocket, or under clothes. Most insulin pumps delivers insulin through a small, flexible tube inserted under the skin. It delivers a steady flow of insulin 24 hours a day, and on-demand doses programmed by the user for food or high blood sugar. — areas on the outer part of a cell that allow insulin in the blood to join or bind with the cell. When the cell and insulin bind together, the cell can take glucose from the blood and use it for energy. — when a person’s body will not allow insulin to work properly in the body. This condition can occur when a person is overweight, and it often improves when the person loses weight. — loss of consciousness as a result of severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). — former term used for type 1 diabetes. — the waste products of fat burning. When your blood glucose gets too high, the body breaks down its own fat and protein for energy instead of glucose. When fat is used, ketones appear in your urine and blood. A large amount of ketones can lead to a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. — a fine, sharp pointed needle for pricking the skin. Used in blood glucose monitoring. — the use of a strong beam of light (laser) to heal a damaged area. A person with retinopathy from diabetes might receive laser treatments to heal blood vessels in the eye. — former term used for type 2 diabetes. – a collection of health risks that increase the chance of developing heart disease, stroke and diabetes. It is also known as Syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome and dysmetabolic syndrome. — all of the physical and chemical processes in the body which occur when food is broken down, energy is created, and wastes are produced. — measurement that indicates the amount of glucose in a specific amount of blood. — disease of the kidneys caused by damage to the small blood vessels in the kidneys . People with diabetes may develop nephropathy as a result of high blood sugar damaging the blood vessels. — nerve damage. People with diabetes may develop neuropathy as a result of high blood sugar damaging the blood vessels and nerves. — former term for type 2 diabetes. —too much body fat for a person’s age, height, and gender. Obesity is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. — a doctor who treats people with eye diseases. — a person professionally trained to test the eyes and to detect and treat eye problems and some diseases by prescribing and adapting corrective lenses. — an organ behind the lower part of the stomach that is about the size of a hand. It has many roles, including the production of insulin and glucagon. — the time when the effect of something is as strong as it can be, such as when insulin is having the most effect on blood glucose. — damage to the gums and tissues around the teeth. People who have high blood sugar are more likely to have periodontal disease than people who do not . — a type of nerve damage most commonly affecting the feet and legs. The arms, abdomen and back may rarely be affected. — any abnormal condition that affects the blood vessels outside the heart and lymphatic vessels. Often occurs as decreased blood flow to the hands and feet. People with diabetes may develop PVD as a result of high blood sugar damaging the blood vessels. — a health professional who diagnoses and treats foot problems. — excessive thirst that lasts for long periods of time; may be a sign of diabetes. —excessive hunger and eating; may be a sign of diabetes. People with polyphagia as a result of diabetes often lose weight even though they are eating more than normal. — a type of fat that comes from vegetables. — increased need to urinate often; a common sign of diabetes. – a mixture of insulin that contains two different types of insulin. Using pre-mixed insulin prevents someone from having to take two injections at the same time or mixing insulin from two vials (bottles). — one of three main classes of nutrients. Proteins are made of amino acids, which are called the ""building blocks of the cells."" The cells need proteins to grow and to mend themselves. Protein is found in many foods such as meat, fish, poultry, eggs, legumes and dairy products. — the point at which the blood is holding so much of a substance, such as glucose, that the kidneys allow the excess to ""spill"" into the urine. — the center part of the back lining of the eye that senses light. It has many small blood vessels that can be harmed by high blood sugar levels. — a disease of the small blood vessels in the retina of the eye. People with diabetes may develop retinopathy as a result of high blood sugar damaging the blood vessels in the eyes. — anything that increases the chance of a person developing a disease or condition. — an artificial sweetener that is sometimes used in place of sugar because it has no calories. — also called rebound effect. A swing to a high level of glucose in the blood after an extremely low level It often happens as the result of an untreated low blood sugar during the night. People who experience high levels of blood glucose in the morning may need to test their blood glucose levels in the middle of the night. If blood glucose levels are repeatedly low overnight, adjustments in evening snacks or insulin doses may be recommended. —table sugar; a form of sugar that the body must break down into a more simple form before the blood can absorb it and take it to the cells. — a type of carbohydrate. Sugar is a quick and easy fuel for the body to use. Some types of sugar are lactose, glucose, fructose and sucrose. — fats carried in the blood from the food we eat. Most of the fats we eat, including butter, margarines and oils, are in triglyceride form. Excess calories, alcohol or sugar in the body are converted into triglycerides and stored in fat cells throughout the body. The body needs insulin to remove this type of fat from the blood. — a type of diabetes in which the insulin-producing cells (beta cells) of the pancreas are damaged. People with type 1 diabetes produce little or no insulin, so glucose cannot get into the body’s cells for use as energy. This causes blood glucose to rise. People with type 1 diabetes must use insulin injections to manage their blood glucose. — a type of diabetes in which the insulin produced is either not enough or doesn’t work properly in the body. As a result, glucose cannot get into the body’s cells for use as energy. This causes blood glucose to rise. — a break in the skin; a deep sore. People with high blood sugar levels may develop ulcers from minor scrapes on the feet or legs, from cuts that heal slowly, or from the rubbing of shoes that don’t fit well. Ulcers can become infected and should be treated promptly. — the basic measure of insulin. U-100 is the most common concentration of insulin. U-100 means that there are 100 units of insulin per milliliter (ml) of liquid. – an infection of the urinary system (kidneys, bladder, and/or the tubes that connect them. Symptoms can include burning or pain with urination and frequent urination. People with high blood sugar levels have a higher risk of getting a UTI than people with target blood sugar levels. - an inflammation or infection of the vaginal tissues, usually caused by a fungus. A woman with this condition may have itching or burning or vaginal discharge. Women who have high blood sugar levels may develop vaginitis more often than women who have target blood sugar levels. — relating to the body's blood vessels (arteries, veins and capillaries). — a blood vessel that carries blood to the heart. — a procedure in which the gel from the center of the eyeball is removed because it has blood and scar tissue in it that blocks vision. An eye surgeon replaces the clouded gel with a clear fluid. – a fungal infection of male or female genitals. Symptoms can include itching, soreness, white discharge, and pain with intercourse. People with high blood sugars have a higher risk of getting a yeast infection than people with target blood sugar levels. Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 08/30/2019.

Find out what foods you can eat on the keto diet, if the keto diet would work for you and what you can expect if you ditch the carbs and embrace the fat. Abbey Sharp, R.D. Updated October 07, 2020 After years of being restricted to therapeutic nutrition in hospitals, the ketogenic diet (typically called the keto diet) is back as one of the hottest diet trends in America. The diet originated back in the 1920s as a way to treat childhood epilepsy, and due to its striking success rate-people eating a keto diet experience fewer seizures-it's still used in that field today. But what about its use for the general healthy population just looking to drop a notch on their belt or get more out of life? Let's unpack this ultra-low carb, high-fat diet bit by bit. I Tried the Ketogenic Diet for 30 Days and Here's What Happened What Is the Keto Diet? The ketogenic diet is super high in fat (about 80 percent of your daily calories), super low in carbohydrates (less than 5 percent of your calories), and moderate in protein (typically 15 to 20 percent of your calories). This is a pretty drastic departure from the generally recommended macronutrient distribution of 20 to 35 percent protein, 45 to 65 percent carbohydrates, and 10 to 35 percent fat. The most important component of the keto diet is a natural and normal process called ketosis. Normally, bodies run very well on glucose. Glucose is produced when the body breaks down carbohydrates. It's a very simple process, which is why it's the body's preferred way to produce energy. When you cut back on carbs or just haven't eaten in a while, your body looks for other sources of energy to fill the void. Fat is typically that source. When your blood sugar drops because you're not feeding your body carbs, fat is released from your cells and flood the liver. The liver turns the fat into ketone bodies, which your body uses as its second choice for energy. What Foods Can You Eat on the Keto Diet? This short list leaves out all of your favorite carb-heavy foods, such as grains, rice, beans, potatoes, sweets, milk, cereals, fruits and even some vegetables (get our complete list of foods you can and cannot eat on the keto diet). What Are the Potential Benefits of the Keto Diet? While the keto diet certainly is not easy, research shows it has some potential therapeutic benefits, in addition to its use for treating epilepsy. Here, some areas of research where a keto diet shows promise. Alzheimer's Disease Research suggests that when patients with Alzheimer's eat a ketogenic diet, cognitive function significantly improves. It's believed that this has something to do with improving mitochondrial function by providing the brain with new fuel. Parkinson's Disease One of the key features of Parkinson's disease is the abnormal accumulation of a protein known as alpha-synuclein. Research funded by the Michael J. Fox Foundation has explored whether a ketogenic diet stimulates the breakdown of these proteins, reducing the amount of alpha-synuclein in the brain. Multiple Sclerosis In a small 2016 , patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) were put on a ketogenic diet. After six months, they reported improved quality of life, as well as physical and mental health improvements. Before doctors or researchers can make a connection between keto and MS, they need bigger sample sizes and more thorough research. Still, the preliminary findings are exciting. Cardiovascular Disease This is definitely a point of confusion and controversy since a diet that relies so heavily on meat and fat is naturally thought to raise blood cholesterol and cause heart issues. However, some evidence suggests that this may not be the case. In fact, the keto diet may improve triglyceride, HDL and LDL levels. A 2017 looked at all of the available evidence around the ketogenic diet and cardiovascular health and found that the diet may be associated with some improvements in cardiovascular risk factors. Mind you, the authors also expressed their concerns with maintaining the diet in the long term, and they proposed that these benefits may not be long-lasting. It's clear that we need long-term studies to fill that gap. Type 2 Diabetes This population has been studied heavily with the keto diet since it's technically as low-carb as you can get. While the research to date has been conducted in very small sample sizes, evidence suggests that an ultra-low-carb diet (like the keto diet) may help reduce A1C and improve insulin sensitivity by as much as 75 percent. In fact, a 2017 found that a keto diet was associated with better glucose control and a reduction in medication use. Having said that, the authors cautioned that it was unclear whether the results were due to weight loss in general, or higher ketone levels. Early experimental research suggests that the keto diet may have anti-tumor effects, likely because it reduces overall calorie intake (and circulating glucose) for tumor growth. In one 2014 of animal research, a ketogenic diet was found to be successful at reducing , , and . More research on humans with larger sample sizes is needed, but it's definitely food for thought. Can the Keto Diet Help with Weight Loss? This is one of the keto diet's main selling points and a primary reason it's so popular: keto diet proponents say you can drop a lot of weight in a relatively short period of time. But is that too good to be true? A number of studies, including one , have found that patients assigned to a very-low-carbohydrate diet (like the keto diet) had greater weight-loss outcomes compared with those eating low-fat. Promising, right? Well, weight loss is only good if that momentum is sustainable long-term, and it's not clear that that's the case. A large found that while low-carb dieters tended to lose more weight than low-fat dieters at first, the differences disappeared by the one-year mark. It seems that there may be an early difference, but it might all wash out the same in the end. Still, let's look at some reasons why keto may work for some as a weight-loss tool. When you severely restrict your food intake by cutting out , you're quite likely to lose weight. There is some evidence that higher-protein diets like the keto diet do have some, partially because both fat and protein are satiating so you don't feel hungry, but also because of the loss in glycogen stores. Glycogen is the body's glucose storage that is bound up with water, so when we deplete the glycogen, you also deplete your water storage. Lose a ton of water, and you're going to drop weight fast. In addition to the satiating capabilities of fat and protein, research suggests that the keto diet may help suppress the hunger hormone, ghrelin. For people who are always hangry, this is a really big plus. The Downsides of Keto Unfortunately, it can't all be rainbows and unicorns. Here are some . Athletic Performance Impediments For those people who train heavy and hard, going keto might cramp your style. As important as protein is for muscle growth, carbs also play an equally critical role by releasing insulin to drive that protein into muscles faster. It also helps us build up glycogen stores for longer training sessions, runs or hikes. One comprehensive of the literature in sports nutrition found that while research is lacking on the long-term impacts of the keto diet, in the short term, the keto diet is inferior to other diet protocols on anaerobic, aerobic and in some cases even strength performance measures. Keto ""Flu"" Your body isn't accustomed to using ketones on the regular, so when you make the switch, you tend to feel unwell. The keto diet also influences electrolyte balance, resulting in brain fog, headaches, nausea and . Keto dieters also consistently complain about getting bad-smelling , sweat and pee as a result of the by-product of fat metabolism (acetone) seeping out. Thankfully, this effect is just temporary, so just know you won't have to spend your life smelling rank. Constipation No one likes to feel backed up, and sadly if you're not careful about your diet choices when going keto, it could become a concern. One 10-year (albeit small) looking at the effects of a keto diet on young children found that 65 percent experienced digestive woes. Thankfully, going keto is not a life sentence for problem bowels. Since you're cutting out whole grains and fruit (two of the most common sources of fiber), aim to up your fiber-rich veggies, and consider a supplement. Nutrition Deficiencies As with any super-restrictive regimen, when you cut food out, there's a good chance you'll be missing something big. Here's what you need to keep an eye open for. Believe it or not, depending on your diet, you may be low on salt. When carb intake is low and insulin isn't being excreted, the absorb less sodium and potassium and excrete more as waste, leaving you feeling dizzy, fatigued and grumpy. Rather than reaching for more processed food, try seasoning your food a little more liberally with sea salt. With the approved list of foods being so brief, you might not be getting in enough fruits and veggies on keto. One of the biggest impacts? A potassium deficiency-and all of the lovely constipation and muscle cramps that accompanies it. Aim to up your intake of foods like spinach, avocado, tomatoes, kale and mushrooms to get your potassium fix. Most of our comes from a nice array of fruits, so if you're cutting all of that out, you'll have to make sure you're keeping your veggies up to compensate. Reach for more broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and cabbage to ensure you get your fill. Disordered Eating As with all restrictive eating patterns, the keto diet certainly can interfere with your relationship with food. Overly restricting or removing whole food groups from your diet has the very real power to encourage orthorexic tendencies and an unhealthy obsession with what to eat. It also interferes with some of the social aspects of food, considering how limiting it is. No cake on your birthday. No pie on Thanksgiving. No chocolate truffles on Valentine's Day. Boo to that! If you consider yourself someone who loves to eat and takes great joy in the social experience of a good meal, then the restriction of this diet may be emotionally unhealthy. Who Shouldn't Do the Keto Diet? Before starting any new diet, you should always clear it with your health care provider first. This is particularly true for certain groups for whom the keto diet may not be a healthy idea. These include (but are not limited to): Fat is more difficult than other macronutrients for the body to digest, so this may be a strain for those with gallbladder or pancreatic disease. While research is in its infancy, early animal suggest some metabolic changes occur during ketosis that may impact fetal growth. is also not the time to risk undernourishing yourself, as nutritional deficiencies and extreme weight loss may reduce milk supply and stunt infant growth. Childhood is never a time for dieting, never mind an extreme diet like the ketogenic diet. Those who are prone to kidney stones may want to avoid the keto diet due to the shifts in sodium, potassium and fluid balance. As previously mentioned, the keto diet is extreme, and any type of diet that severely restricts or limits foods may perpetuate disordered eating thoughts. Patients with limited digestive capacities should avoid the keto diet, since fat is particularly difficult for the body to digest. The Bottom Line on Keto From the early understanding of the keto research and literature, it looks like we're just scratching the surface understanding some of the potential therapeutic roles of the keto diet. While it's unclear if it's any better or worse than any other diet for weight loss, the reality is that there is no one-size-fits-all model for diets. This doesn't even consider that weight-loss diets, in general, don't really work. While researchers can't agree on a specific statistic, it's commonly accepted that the vast majority of dieters will regain the weight lost (and often pack on extra pounds, as well). The long-term outcome of the keto diet is likely to be no different, especially given how challenging and restrictive it is to maintain. Our advice? If you like carbs, don't swear them off entirely. Choose more often and ways to choose the most satiating versions of them to fuel you. And if you want to give keto a try, get in touch with a registered dietitian to help you work through the diet correctly and in a healthy manner.

Lainey Younkin, M.S., R.D. Updated November 24, 2020 The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, moderate-protein and very low-carbohydrate diet. Carbohydrates are the body's preferred source of energy, but on a strict ketogenic diet, less than 5 percent of energy intake is from carbohydrates (learn more in our ). The reduction of carbohydrates puts the body into a metabolic state called ketosis. Ketosis is when the body starts breaking down stored fat into molecules called ketone bodies to use for energy, in the absence of circulating blood sugar from food. Once the body reaches ketosis, most cells will use ketone bodies to generate energy until you start eating carbohydrates again. Traditionally, the ketogenic diet was only used in clinical settings to reduce seizures in children with epilepsy. ""Now there is a lot of interest in the diet's effectiveness in helping with other neurological conditions, cancer, diabetes, PCOS [polycystic ovary syndrome], obesity, high cholesterol and cardiovascular disease,"" says Emily Stone, M.S., R.D. People also eat keto to lose weight (here's what happened when one writer tried going keto for 30 days). Even if you know that you need to eat a very low-carb, high-fat, moderate protein diet—it can be confusing to know which foods to eat. Here's our guide to foods you can eat, foods you should avoid and foods you can sometimes have when you're following a ketogenic diet. Foods You Can Eat on the Ketogenic Diet Here is a list of all the low-carb, keto-friendly foods that are appropriate to eat when you're following keto. Fish and Seafood Fish is rich in B vitamins, potassium and selenium; it's also protein-rich and carb-free. Salmon, sardines, mackerel, albacore tuna and other fatty fish boast high levels of omega-3 fats, which have been found to lower blood sugar levels and increase insulin sensitivity. Frequent fish intake has been linked to a decreased risk of chronic disease as well as improved mental health. Aim to consume at least two 3-ounce servings of fatty fish weekly. Low-Carb Veggies Nonstarchy vegetables are low in calories and carbs, but high in many nutrients, including vitamin C and several minerals. They also contain antioxidants that help protect against cell-damaging free radicals. Aim for nonstarchy vegetables with less than 8 g of net carbs per cup. Net carbs are total carbohydrates minus fiber. Broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, bell peppers, zucchini and spinach fit the bill. Cheese has zero carbohydrates and is high in fat, making it a great fit for the ketogenic diet. It's also rich in protein and calcium. But, a 1-ounce slice of cheese delivers about 30 percent of the daily value for saturated fat, so if you're worried about heart disease consider portions when noshing on cheese. Plain Greek Yogurt and Cottage Cheese Yogurt and cottage cheese are high in protein and calcium-rich. Five ounces of plain Greek yogurt provides just 5 g of carbohydrates and 12 grams of protein. The same amount of cottage cheese also has 5 grams of carbohydrates with 18 grams of protein. Studies have shown that both calcium and protein can reduce appetite and promote fullness. Higher-fat yogurts and cottage cheese help keep you full for longer, and full-fat products would be part of the ketogenic diet. Choose heart-healthy fats like avocados, which are high in monounsaturated fat and potassium, a mineral many Americans are lacking. Half of a medium avocado contains 9 grams of total carbohydrates, 7 grams of which are fiber. Swapping animal fats for plant fats like avocados can help improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Meat and Poultry Meat is a source of lean protein and is considered a staple on the ketogenic diet. Fresh meat and poultry contain no carbohydrates and are rich in B vitamins and several minerals, including potassium, selenium and zinc. While processed meats, like bacon and sausage, are allowed on keto, they aren't the best for your heart and may raise your risk of certain types of cancer if you eat too much. Choose chicken, fish and beef more often and limit processed meats. Eggs are high in protein, B vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Two eggs contain zero carbohydrates and 12 grams of protein. Eggs have been shown to trigger hormones that increase feelings of fullness and keep blood sugar levels stable, and they also contain antioxidants such as lutein and zeaxanthin, which help protect eye health. Nuts, Seeds and Healthy Oils Nuts and seeds are full of healthy polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, fiber and protein. They also are very low in net carbs. Olive oil and coconut oil are the two oils recommended on . Olive oil is high in oleic acid and is associated with a lower risk of heart disease. Coconut oil is high in saturated fat but contains medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which can increase ketone production. MCTs may increase metabolic rate and promote the loss of weight and belly fat too. Measure portion sizes when consuming any type of healthy fat. Carb counts for 1 oz. (28 g) of nuts and seeds (net carbohydrate equals total carbs minus fiber): Berries are rich in antioxidants that reduce inflammation and protect against disease. They are low in carbs and high in fiber. Unsweetened Coffee and Tea Plain coffee and tea contain zero grams of carbohydrates, fat or protein, so they are A-OK on the keto diet. Studies show coffee lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Tea is rich in antioxidants and has less caffeine than coffee; drinking tea may reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke, help with weight loss and boost your immune system. Dark Chocolate and Cocoa Powder Check the label on these, as the amount of carbs depends on the type and how much you consume. Cocoa has been called a ""superfruit"" because it is rich in antioxidants, and dark chocolate contains flavanols, which may reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering blood pressure and keeping arteries healthy. List of Foods You Can't Eat on the Keto Diet: Don't get too discouraged. Dietitians Stone and Laura Dority, M.S., R.D., L.D., with , say that no foods are really off-limits on the keto diet. It's about total carbohydrate intake and how you choose to ""spend"" your carbs. Generally, you should stay under 20-40 grams of carbohydrates per day. ""The exact amount needed to achieve ketosis can vary on the individual, though, with carb prescriptions ranging from 10 to 60 grams per day. This total is for net carbohydrates (total carbs minus fiber),"" says Stone. Dority adds, ""Individuals who are really active can eat more carbs (maybe more at the 40-gram level) than someone who is sedentary."" High-Carb Foods That Most People Avoid on the Keto Diet Cereal, crackers, rice, pasta, bread and beer are high in carbohydrates. Even whole-wheat pasta and the new bean-based pastas are high in carbs. Consider alternatives like or shirataki noodles, which are healthier low-carb options. Sugary breakfast cereals and healthy whole-grain cereals are high in carbohydrates too and should be avoided or minimized. ""A slice of bread is 11 grams of carbs on average so technically you could have one slice a day maybe but that's spending all your carbs on pretty poor nutrition so I wouldn't recommend it when for the same carbs you could have A LOT of veggies,"" says Dority. Beer can be enjoyed in moderation on a low-carb diet. Dry wine and spirits are better options but all alcohol should be very limited. Starchy vegetables and high-sugar fruits Starchy vegetables contain more digestible carbohydrates than fiber and should be limited on the ketogenic diet. These include corn, potatoes, sweet potatoes and beets. Limit high-sugar fruits too, which spike your blood sugar more quickly than berries and have more carbohydrates (get a full list of ). (1 medium): 24 g net carbs (27 g total carbs) (1 oz. / 28 g): 21 g net carbs, 22 g total carbs) (2 large): 32 g net carbs (36 g total carbs) (1 cup, sliced): 22 g net carbs (25 g total carbs) (1 medium): 21 g net carbs (27 g total carbs) (1 medium): 33 g net carbs (37 g total carbs) (1 medium): 20 g net carbs (24 g total carbs) (1 cup, cooked): 14 g net carbs (17 g total carbs) Sweetened yogurts Stick to plain yogurt to limit added sugars (aka carbohydrates). Greek yogurt is higher in protein and lower in carbohydrates compared to regular yogurt. Fruit juice-natural or not-is high in fast-digesting carbs that spike your blood sugar. Stick to water. Honey, syrup and sugar in any form Avoid sugar, honey, maple syrup and other forms of sugar, which are high in carbohydrates and low in nutrients. Chips and crackers Avoid chips, crackers and other processed, grain-based snack foods, which are high in carbohydrates and low in fiber. Gluten-free baked goods Gluten-free does not equal carb-free. In fact, many gluten-free breads and muffins are as high in carbohydrates as traditional baked goods. They usually lack fiber too. Foods and Drinks You Can Sometimes Have on the Keto Diet You can technically have any food on the keto diet if it falls within your daily carbohydrate goal, but these foods fall in the middle between high-carb and low-carb. Milk is an excellent source of calcium, potassium and several B vitamins. But, 1 cup has 12 grams of sugar (lactose). Choose almond, coconut or another low-carb milk instead. Beans and Legumes Beans and legumes are high in fiber and protein and are part of a heart-healthy diet but are also high in carbohydrates. They may be included in small amounts on a ketogenic diet. However, it's often recommended to avoid them altogether. Pros of the Ketogenic Diet ""There is solid evidence to support use of the ketogenic diet in individuals with epilepsy who have seizures that are drug resistant,"" says Dority. In the short term, people who follow the diet report weight loss. Dority says, ""There is certainly some good recent research showing promise in disorders such as autism, traumatic brain injury, brain tumors, migraines and Alzheimer's (to name a few but the list could go on), as well as some great research on ketogenic diets and type 2 diabetes reversal including dramatically reducing insulin needs, fasting blood sugar levels, lowering A1C and obtaining significant weight loss."" Cons of the Ketogenic Diet ""Like most highly restrictive diets, it is difficult to meet nutritional needs while doing keto,"" says Stone. ""It often comes with uncomfortable side effects like constipation and the 'keto flu.' Also, the long-term health consequences are not well understood."" Learn more about the . The Bottom Line It's not a one-size-fits-all prescription, and it's crucial to work with a dietitian to ensure you're getting essential nutrients while maintaining ketosis. There's promising research on the benefits of the ketogenic diet for many conditions, but some people can't keep it up for the long haul, plus the long-term effects are poorly understood. If you decide to go keto, work with a dietitian to help you create a plan.

Lainey Younkin, M.S, R.D. January 07, 2020 Everyone loves to hate carbs. They've gotten a bad reputation recently and are blamed for everything from causing diabetes to poor energy levels (not all carbs are bad for you FYI). But what is a low-carb diet anyways? And isn't keto low-carb too? Read on to learn the differences between a low-carb diet and a ketogenic diet, plus find out which one is better for weight loss and overall health. What is a low-carb diet? There is no standard definition for a low-carb diet. It is simply a diet that is lower in carbohydrates than what is recommended or than what most people consume. The Dietary Guidelines recommend that 45-65 percent of calories come from carbohydrates. So any diet with carb intake less than 45 percent of total calories is considered a low-carb diet. the effects of low-carb diets on health outcomes is difficult since there is no standard definition for low-carb. See our low-carb meal plans created by a registered dietitian. What is the keto diet? The ketogenic (keto) diet falls under the definition of a , which is a diet with less than 50 grams of carbohydrates per day. Five percent or less of calorie intake is from carbs on , which is about 20-50 grams per day, depending on your total energy intake. The keto diet was introduced by physicians in the 1920s for treating epilepsy, but has since become a popular weight loss diet. Since it's very low-carb, people lose weight rapidly, hence why it is enticing to try. The keto diet may also help control blood sugars and improve some neurological disorders (learn more about if the ketogenic diet is right for diabetes). But the effects of being on the diet long-term are unknown. What's the nutrient breakdown? There are three macronutrients: carbohydrates, protein, and fat. When you cut back on carbs, you replace those carbohydrate calories with another macronutrient—usually fat. This leads to a low-carb, moderate protein, high-fat diet. For example, if someone follows a low-carb diet with 30 percent of calories from carbs and the recommended 10-20 percent from protein, it means that about 50-60 percent of their calories will come from fat. The breakdown of macros on the keto diet is about 80 percent calories from fat, 15-20 percent from protein and less than 5 percent from carbohydrates. Contrast that with the Dietary Guidelines recommendation of 25-35 percent calories from fat, 10-30 percent from protein and 45-65 percent from carbohydrates. How does each diet work? The body prefers to use glucose—a carbohydrate—as its energy source. When carbohydrate intake is very low (<50 grams) and glucose isn't available for energy, the body makes glucose from other sources. This is called gluconeogenesis. When carb intake is even lower than this, like on the keto diet, and the body can't make enough glucose for its needs, the body enters a metabolic state called ketosis where it breaks down fat for energy into ketone bodies (learn more about ). Once you reach ketosis, most cells will use the ketones created by ketosis for energy until you start eating carbohydrates again. Key similarities between low-carb and keto Both diets are low in carbohydrates, but the keto diet is lower in carbs (<5 percent calories from carbs) and higher in fat. Neither diet technically restricts entire food groups, unless the food pushes you over the carb limit for the day. Grains, legumes, dairy, fruits, vegetables, processed foods, sugary foods, and some alcohol are restricted for this reason (here's a complete list of foods you can and cannot eat on the ketogenic diet). Which one is better for weight loss? Both a low-carb diet and keto diet can help you lose weight. When you eat carbohydrates, the hormone insulin is released to take glucose to your cells for energy. Extra glucose is stored as glycogen but if there's glucose leftover after that, insulin stores the rest as fat. When you cut carbs, not as much insulin is released so the body can be in fat burning mode instead of fat storing mode. You will also likely end up cutting down your calorie intake, since the foods you can eat are limited. But, a lot of things can help you lose weight quickly. The question is: Which pattern of eating can you keep up with for the long term? Although you may lose weight on a low-carb or keto diet, if you can't eat that way forever, you won't keep the weight off forever. Research backs this too. Countless have tried to figure out if low-carb or low-fat is better for weight loss. Most reach the same : Low-carb diets can lead to faster weight loss in the short-term, but at one to two years follow-up, the weight loss outcomes are the same for low-carb and low-fat dieters. A in overweight adults with type 2 diabetes found that after one year, those that followed a ketogenic diet lost more weight and had lower A1Cs than those following a low-fat diet. Few to no studies have compared the effects of low-carb diets to ketogenic diets on weight loss or other health outcomes. Which is better for overall health? The ketogenic diet is proven effective in children with epilepsy, and emerging shows it may provide benefits for a number of neurological disorders. shows keto might also help those with type 2 diabetes better control blood glucose levels and potentially reduce their A1C. More research is needed though. The effects of following keto long-term are unknown. It is difficult to study since most people have trouble complying to such low carbohydrate intake for years. For non-keto, low-carb diets, a and study concluded that even though low-carb diets are safe in the short-term and effective, there were no differences on blood sugar response compared to a diet with more carbs for people with type 2 diabetes and that total calorie intake is still the best predictor of weight loss.

Downsides of eating low-carb or keto You may have heard of the ""keto flu,"" a nasty side effect of the ketogenic diet that causes dizziness, nausea, and fatigue due to losing fluid and sodium quickly after cutting carbs. Another downside is the difficulty of following the keto diet. Many people eating keto might not actually be in a state of ketosis. It's recommended to follow keto under the supervision of a doctor or dietitian. Both a low-carb diet and keto diet cut carbs, which means cutting fiber. Fiber suppresses appetite and slows digestion leading to weight loss and maintenance. Fiber also lowers risk for cardiovascular disease and helps stabilize blood sugars (try these ). Fiber is food for the good bacteria in your gut. These bugs feed off of non-starchy vegetables, fruit, whole grains, beans, and legumes - all foods that are limited on low-carb diets. A healthy microbiome is linked to improved heart health, brain health, digestion, and immunity. It is also well that eating whole grains is associated with a lower risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Eating a high percentage of calories from fat could also raise LDL (""bad"") cholesterol levels and triglycerides. If eating low-carb, be sure to choose healthy fats like salmon, albacore tuna, olive oil, avocado, nuts and seeds. There are less restrictive diets such as the that are associated with a healthy weight, reduced risk for heart disease and diabetes, and living longer. The Mediterranean diet is also a whole-body, holistic approach that includes daily movement, eating with others, and being social. This eating pattern is more sustainable for people to keep up with for their entire lives. Things to consider before deciding on low-carb vs. keto Before deciding to do any diet, ask yourself why you are going on the diet. Is it for weight loss or for something else? Talk to your health care providers, including your physician and a dietitian, to determine which diet is best for you based on your goals. Remember this: you'll only continue seeing results as long as you can keep up with the diet. Is the diet you're choosing compatible with your lifestyle? Do you eat out a lot or travel for work frequently? It's not impossible to eat low-carb or keto on the road, but (as with most diets) preparation and planning are key—as is working with a professional who can help you. Bottom Line There's no standard definition for a low-carb diet, but it generally refers to eating less than 45 percent of calories from carbs. The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, moderate protein, very low-carb diet with less than 5 percent of calories coming from carbohydrates. Both diets can help you lose weight, but studies show they don't work any better than low-fat diets for losing weight long-term. You may find it easier to follow a low-fat diet or a healthy eating pattern like the Mediterranean diet than to drastically cut carbs for the rest of your life.

09003643-c655-4733-ad15-1078525b7e89,"Diabetes affects more than in the U.S. and is the seventh leading. The most common form of diabetes, , is a chronic disease that develops due to insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone that helps transfer glucose from the blood to the muscles, fat, and liver, and other cells, where it can be used for energy. Insulin resistance occurs when the body has trouble producing insulin, or when the insulin fails to transfer glucose into these cells. This leads to a build-up of glucose in the blood, otherwise known as high blood sugar, which is the hallmark symptom of diabetes. If not properly managed, this can have for the heart, kidneys, and other organs. Diabetes and sleep are intricately connected, and many people with type 2 diabetes experience poor sleep quality or. The good news is that careful attention to diet, exercise, and blood sugar levels can make a world of difference to sleep quality and, in turn, to overall health. It’s estimated that with type 2 diabetes have sleep problems due to unstable blood sugar levels and accompanying diabetes-related symptoms, High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) during the night can lead to and next-day fatigue. As with many chronic conditions, feelings of depression or stress about the disease itself may also keep you awake at night. When blood sugar levels are , the kidneys overcompensate by causing you to urinate more often. During the night, these frequent trips to the bathroom lead to disrupted sleep. High blood sugar may also cause headaches, increased thirst, and tiredness that can interfere with falling asleep. By contrast, going too many hours without eating or taking the wrong balance of diabetes medication can also lead to at night. You may have nightmares, break out into a sweat, or feel irritated or confused when you wake up. Talk to your healthcare provider if you are experiencing fatigue, trouble sleeping, or any other worrying symptoms. They can help analyze the reason and work with you to keep your blood sugar levels more stable. Just as diabetes can cause sleep problems, sleep problems also appear to play a role in diabetes. Getting poor sleep or less has been linked to high blood sugar levels in people with diabetes and . However, it’s not entirely clear whether one causes the other or whether more variables are at work. Researchers believe that sleep restriction may affect blood sugar levels due to its effects on insulin, cortisol, and . One-quarter of people with diabetes report sleeping less than six hours or more than eight hours a night, which puts them at a higher risk of having . In addition to raising blood sugar levels in people who already have diabetes, sleep deprivation also raises the risk of developing insulin resistance in the first place. This link becomes apparent as early as. Studies have also found that or are correlated with higher blood sugar, even in non-diabetic people. However, there may be other variables that explain this, such as the fact that people with irregular sleeping schedules are more likely to follow an erratic diet. Sleep deprivation raises levels of ghrelin, the hunger hormone, and decreases levels of leptin, the hormone that makes us feel full. To compensate for lower energy levels, people who sleep poorly may be more likely to seek relief in foods that raise blood sugar and put them at risk of , which is a risk factor for diabetes. Adults with type 2 diabetes who experience disturbed sleep or frequent nighttime awakenings may also be less likely to follow other standards for diabetes self-care, such as getting enough exercise and closely monitoring blood glucose levels. In addition to its immediate effects on blood sugar levels, poor sleep can take a long-term toll on individuals with type 2 diabetes. Those who resort to sleep medication or who have trouble staying asleep are more likely to report feeling serious psychological distress. There is also tentative evidence to suggest that people with diabetes who do not get enough sleep may be at a higher risk for later in life. What Sleep Disorders Are Common in People with Diabetes? Individuals with type 2 diabetes have a higher chance of developing accompanying , the most common being restless legs syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea. Approximately one in five people with type 2 diabetes have, marked by tingling or other irritating sensations in the legs that can interfere with getting to sleep. People with diabetes are also at risk for another condition called peripheral neuropathy. Caused by nerve damage, the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are very similar to RLS and include numbness, tingling, and pain in the extremities. People who experience these symptoms should consult a healthcare provider, as peripheral neuropathy requires treatment to reduce long-term nerve damage. Obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which a person momentarily stops breathing at recurring intervals throughout the night. In most cases, the person is not aware this is happening, though a bed partner may observe snoring and gasping. These lapses in breathing cause micro-arousals (very brief awakenings) that interfere with the natural progression of the sleep stages and impair sleep quality. OSA typically occurs in people who are overweight or obese, as they often have a thicker neck circumference that interferes with the airway. The condition can be treated with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device that keeps the airway open to restore normal breathing and reduce interruptions to sleep. What Is the Connection Between Sleep Apnea and Diabetes? Though does not directly cause diabetes, it is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and has been shown to increase insulin resistance, even in non-diabetic and people. The estimates that up to one in four people with type 2 diabetes also suffers from OSA, and a further quarter of type 2 diabetics suffer from another sleep-related breathing disorder. Both OSA and type 2 diabetes are more common in people who are overweight and obese. However, OSA appears to affect insulin resistance and glucose control. Not only does OSA cause sleep fragmentation that interferes with slow-wave sleep, but it also periodically cuts off the body’s oxygen supply. Together, these effects lead to insulin resistance and . In many studies, short-term sleep apnea treatment appears to improve , while improves blood sugar and insulin resistance. However, other studies have in blood glucose levels after treating OSA, leading some researchers to believe the connection could be due to other variables such as. More research is needed to further characterize the nature of the connection, but it is clear that plays an important role in sleep apnea and diabetes. A combination of and CPAP treatment may be the most effective way to treat sleep apnea in people with type 2 diabetes. How Can People with Diabetes Cope with Sleep Issues? Careful management of blood sugar levels can help improve sleep for people with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, given the close relationship between diabetes and sleep, good habits are particularly important. These include both daytime and nighttime habits, such as: Adhering to a diet plan that works for you and helps keep blood sugar controlled Avoiding stimulants like caffeine or nicotine before bed Based on your personal situation, your doctor may be able to recommend sleep aids for diabetics or additional ways to get better sleep. They may choose to conduct a polysomnogram, or sleep study, to see if a sleep disorder is to blame for your sleep problems. Secondary sleep disorders can then be treated with targeted therapies such as a CPAP machine. National Diabetes Statistics Report 2020: Estimates of Diabetes and its Burden in the United States.

Why Some Children Live With a Persistent Fear of Abandonment How Narcissism Distorts Self-Image via Self-Concept Clarity Awe: The Instantaneous Way to Feel Good and Relieve Stress Do You Often Feel Disappointed in Your Relationship? Dreams have been described as dress rehearsals for real life, opportunities to gratify wishes, and a form of nocturnal therapy. A new theory aims to make sense of it all. Why Some Children Live With a Persistent Fear of Abandonment How Narcissism Distorts Self-Image via Self-Concept Clarity Awe: The Instantaneous Way to Feel Good and Relieve Stress Do You Often Feel Disappointed in Your Relationship? Chronic Schizophrenia Put Into Remission Without Medication New research suggests ketogenic diet may play a role in treating schizophrenia. Two women finally conquered symptoms of schizophrenia with the ketogenic diet. is usually a chronic, devastating disorder that causes tremendous suffering. It can ruin lives. Even with the best treatments available, symptoms and suffering often continue. An article that two colleagues and I just published April 6, 2019 in the medical journal describes two patients with longstanding schizophrenia who experienced complete remission of symptoms with the , a well-established, evidence-based treatment for epilepsy. Of particular interest in our research, both patients were able to stop antipsychotic medications and have remained in remission for years now. Though more evidence is certainly needed, this is extraordinarily hopeful news for those with this disorder and for the mental health professionals treating them. Schizophrenia affects 1 percent of the population. Its close cousin, , affects 2 to 5 percent of the population. Tens of millions of people suffer. Symptoms include , delusions, and disorganized thought and speech patterns. Hallucinations are when people see things or hear things that aren’t there, while delusions are thoughts that aren’t true, such as paranoid beliefs. Many people describe these psychotic symptoms as “being out of touch with reality.” People diagnosed with schizophrenia may also ignore hygiene, avoid being around people, and lack . The illness affects most areas of life and can severely impair people at school, work, and in relationships. Prevailing treatments revolve around antipsychotic medications. As useful as these are for some, unfortunately, they can yield poor results for others. A three-year study that tracked over 6,000 adults diagnosed with schizophreniashows just how poor. All patients were treated at academic medical centers and were taking antipsychotic medications. The study tracked three metrics: symptom relief, quality of life, and ability to function in society. Only 4 percent of those patients achieved full relief from the illness on all three measures. Clearly, we need new treatment ideas for schizophrenia. No one knows for sure what causes schizophrenia. Most clinicians and researchers think it involves a . This refers to neurotransmitters in the brain—chemicals that send messages from one brain cell to another. This theory has largely focused on excess activity of a neurotransmitter called —primarily because all antipsychotic medications block dopamine receptors. While there is a lot of evidence to support the dopamine theory, many current treatments designed around it have come up short. The treatments appear to only affect some of the symptoms, not all of them, and don’t change the course of the illness itself. Other researchers think of schizophrenia as a . There is evidence that the brains of people with schizophrenia are different than other people’s brains, and can change over time. Some of the changes observed include shrinking of some brain regions, and changes in the connections between different brain regions.      However, emerging evidence suggests that something else might be behind schizophrenia. has turned to , or energy production in the brain cells. It is well known that people with schizophrenia are three times more likely to develop diabetes. A common debate in the field is whether the antipsychotic medications, which are known to cause weight gain and diabetes, are to blame. Recent research suggests that this is not the entire explanation. Even people newly diagnosed with schizophrenia appear to already have insulin resistance, even though most don’t yet have diabetes. This means that their brains may not be getting enough energy from glucose. Other brain studies have found metabolic abnormalities, such as higher levels of and inflammation as well.    The medical version of the ketogenic is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein diet proven to work for epilepsy. In my article , I explain the history and research demonstrating that the ketogenic diet is a powerful intervention in treating epilepsy. While referred to as a “diet,” make no mistake: this is a powerful medical intervention. Studies show that over 50 percent of children with epilepsy who do not respond to medications experience significant reductions in the frequency and severity of their seizures, with some becoming completely seizure-free. Using epilepsy treatments in psychiatry is nothing new. Anticonvulsant medications are often used to treat disorders. Depakote, Lamictal, Tegretol, Neurontin, Topamax, and all of the (medications like Valium and Ativan, commonly prescribed for ) are all examples of anticonvulsant medications routinely prescribed in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Therefore, it’s not unreasonable to think that a proven anticonvulsant dietary intervention might also help some people with psychiatric symptoms.   Interestingly, the effects of this diet on the brain have been studied for decades because neurologists have been trying to figure out how it works in epilepsy. This diet is known to produce ketones which are used as a fuel source in place of glucose. This may help to provide fuel to insulin resistant brain cells. This diet is also known to affect a number of neurotransmitters and ion channels in the brain, improve metabolism, and decrease inflammation. So there is existing science to support why this diet might help schizophrenia. An 82-year-old woman with chronic paranoid schizophrenia since age 17 The first patient documented in the is a woman who spent nearly her whole life suffering chronic, treatment-resistant schizophrenia. For more than 50 years, she endured , disorganized speech, visual and auditory hallucinations. By the time she was 70, she was and had been hospitalized repeatedly for or suicide attempts. She had been treated with over ten different antipsychotic and mood stabilizing medications, including regular antipsychotic injections. None of them helped her symptoms. She was unable to care for herself and had a court-appointed guardian and home health services. At the age of 70, weighing 330 pounds, she went to a medical weight loss clinic and was started on a ketogenic diet. Within two weeks of starting the diet, she reported a noticeable reduction not only in her weight but also her psychotic symptoms. Within several months, she started to feel so much better that she was able to stop taking her psychiatric medications while remaining on the diet. Over time, her mood stabilized, and her hallucinations and paranoia remitted completely. She was no longer suicidal. Her case was. Today, 12 years later, she has lost a total of 150 pounds and remains on the ketogenic diet. She takes no medications and remains symptom-free. She was able to regain her independence, no longer requiring the guardian and the home health care team. When I recently spoke with her, she recalled her decades of suffering and hopelessness, and said that since starting the diet, she has had a ""new life,"" and is happy to be alive. A 39-year-old woman with schizophrenia for 20 years The second patient is a 39-year-old woman who suffered from depression, anxiety, , hallucinations and paranoia since her teens. As patients sometimes do, she concealed her psychotic symptoms when she was initially treated for depression and anorexia.  When she finally reported her psychotic symptoms later in her twenties, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. For the next ten years, she was treated with 7 different antipsychotic medications—including clozapine (called the “gold standard antipsychotic ”)—along with and anti-anxiety medications. Nevertheless, she continued to have symptoms. She was having chronic gastrointestinal problems, so she saw a doctor who recommended the ketogenic diet. Noticing some improvement of her symptoms and being frustrated with all of her psychiatric medications, she unwisely stopped taking all 14 of her medications “cold turkey.”  This sent her into severe psychosis requiring an extended hospitalization. In the hospital, she was re-medicated with Haldol-decanoate (an injectable medication which had not worked for her previously) and she continued the ketogenic diet. Within a month on both Haldol and the ketogenic diet, she reported complete remission of her psychotic symptoms for the first time since she was 14. Over the following year, she slowly tapered off Haldol, and remained free of psychotic symptoms. Of note, she lost 70 pounds from the diet, which exacerbated her anorexia. She has since regained 30 of those pounds and maintains a healthy weight today. Five years after starting the ketogenic diet, she is off all antipsychotic medications, remains on the diet, and is free of all psychotic symptoms. She has also finished graduate school and now works full time. More Evidence of the Ketogenic Diet for Schizophrenia While inspiring, these two case reports aren't the first of their kind. They join a growing body of evidence supporting the use of the ketogenic diet in the treatment of schizophrenia. In 1965, ten women hospitalized with schizophrenia who were already receiving medications and (ECT or “shock ”) were also placed on the ketogenic diet for a month. The researchers reported that their symptoms improved after two weeks on the diet, but then returned back to their baseline level of symptoms after the diet was stopped. In 2017, I reported two other cases of schizoaffective disorder improving significantly on the ketogenic diet. is a diagnosis that includes both a mix of schizophrenia and a , often bipolar disorder. One man and one woman, both in their 30’s, had suffered treatment-resistant schizoaffective disorder for years. On the diet, their symptoms were greatly improved, and they both lost significant amounts of weight. Off the diet, their symptoms returned. In 2018, two Ecuadorian , one male and one female, diagnosed with schizophrenia since the ages of 14 and 18 were started on a . This study had a psychiatrist rate each twin’s symptoms while being unaware of their diet status. Interestingly, only when the patients were compliant with the diet did their symptoms improve. They also both lost weight. When they stopped the diet at the end of the study, their symptoms returned to their baseline level. In 2015, researchers conducted a study of the effects of the ketogenic diet in a mouse model of schizophrenia. Studies exactly like this are used in the development of new antipsychotic medications. The ketogenic diet was found to normalize the mouse behaviors associated with schizophrenia, indicating an antipsychotic effect. In 2018, the same researchers published another study of the ketogenic diet normalizing impaired prepulse inhibition in mice—yet another marker commonly associated with schizophrenia. The mice on the ketogenic diet appeared normal on this measure. Interestingly, weight loss was a factor for which they controlled in designing the study. Some of the mice were calorie restricted and others were not. They concluded that weight loss was not required to get the benefit of the ketogenic diet—the diet alone was enough. The two women described in the article above, who are currently in complete remission from schizophrenia, probably do not care why this diet worked. The proof is in the pudding for them. But we doctors like to know more about how and why things work, and better understand how many more people might respond to this type of treatment. Clearly, more research is needed. However, make no mistake. All of these research findings, from the basic science of schizophrenia to the case reports and studies mentioned here, open up a new field of inquiry—one based on entirely novel mechanisms of action and a whole new way of understanding schizophrenia. I, for one, am hopeful for the millions of people suffering. The sooner we can offer more effective treatments, the better.    If you have schizophrenia or any serious disorder and are considering using the ketogenic diet as a treatment, I strongly recommend that you consult with a healthcare professional before trying this diet. Why? Because mental illnesses are serious disorders and sometimes dangerous. The medical version of the ketogenic diet has risks and side effects. You should have accurate information, help, and medical supervision to implement treatments in a safe and effective way. All of the patients described in all of these studies were treated by physicians while attempting the ketogenic diet. Nothing in this article is intended as medical advice. Anyone contemplating the ketogenic diet as a treatment for illness of any kind is urged to seek medical help from a competent medical provider trained in treatment of the underlying condition as well as the ketogenic diet therapy before initiating the ketogenic diet. The ketogenic diet induces significant metabolic changes which can impact medication metabolism, among other things. Individuals seeking treatment of any illness using the ketogenic diet will likely require additional support especially during the initial adaptation phase, and thereafter for the duration of treatment which can take years depending on a variety of factors. No doctor-patient relationship is created by this article, or by any responses to comments posted in this forum by Chris Palmer, M.D. Submitted by Christie Barnett on April 6, 2019 - 8:27am Wow, Chris! As a psychiatric nurse for 30+ years, I see this as ground breaking! I've seen so much suffering with the treatments we currently have. To have a new treatment pathway is so hopeful and exciting! Submitted by Chris Palmer M.D. on April 6, 2019 - 10:04am Thank you, Christie! I couldn't agree more about how exciting and promising this new approach is. Mental health profesionals often think of schizophrenia as incurable, chronic and degenerative - it only seems to get worse with time. These two cases suggest maybe there is still hope - even for those who have suffered for decades. Submitted by F68.10 on May 12, 2019 - 6:27pm You see a study with 2 patients, and you find it ""exciting"" and ""promising""? And you're an MD? Do you really need to be told, rather abruptly and inelegantly I must confess, by a delusional patient that you yourself are being delusional? Inducing false hope is a Cardinal Sin in medicine. Submitted by Chris Palmer M.D. on May 13, 2019 - 5:11am Well, F68.10, I recognize your name as the diagnostic code for factitious disorder, so I'm not quite sure how much of your story you are making up. Secondly, you shouldn't have to ""confess"" that you are a ""delusional patient."" If you do have delusions, it's not your fault, and no confession is needed. Delusions are a symptom, and shouldn't be used as a slur to call someone when you disagree with them. If you read the full article, you'll see there are many more than just 2 cases, 16 to be exact. However, these two cases are exceptional in that both patients had longstanding psychotic symptoms that have completely resolved for years now off of antipsychotic medications. That's not delusional... it's just a fact, at least for them. For the other 14 patients described, they did not get this same outcome - at least not yet - but most of them had at least some improvement on the ketogenic diet. So there is still much to learn. The good news is that psychiatric researchers around the world are taking this field and new perspective on schizophrenia very seriously, and several studies are being pursued now, so we should have more information soon. Submitted by F68.10 on May 13, 2019 - 10:03am Well, honestly, it frightens me more than anything that this kind of research purports to treat schizophrenia patients. I'm much more interested in how scientists attempt to break down the schizophrenia concept into finer concepts than research in any unproven ""treatment"". When it comes to ""delusions"", I have noted quite a discrepancy between MD's understanding of what delusions are and epistemology's understanding of what delusions are. There's no point in furthering any conversation if you do not recognize this basic fact. (And I do not care whether or not you will). Submitted by Elvira Hugh on July 9, 2019 - 7:05am My heart goes out to everyone who have or cares for a mentally ill person, you are the true hero. My son was diagnosed with schizophrenia 17years ago, He had gone through several bouts of depression, delusion and hallucinations. It stops people engaging in society, results in higher rates of suicide, homelessness and incarceration. We've finally benefited from some real dedicated support group of people with natural treatment and a small number of friends and family that knew and loved us. To all schizophrenia or psych patients out there, reach out and get the support you need and deserve from this page: mentalcures . blogspot . com to start your natural treatment called MINTORIN. Be it any condition, a healthy diet and natural treatment is a road to fast recovery. I don’t want people to feel that suicide is their only option, know you are loved, you are valuable, you are worth more than your darkness. Submitted by Glenn on April 6, 2019 - 5:14pm I have a mild form of schizoaffective disorder, but also, at 68, have severe coronary artery disease. I wouldn't think it would be wise to jump into this, but wonder if I could benefit. What would you think, in my shoes? Glenn Submitted by Chris Palmer M.D. on April 6, 2019 - 5:21pm Thanks for reaching out, and for your important question. I would strongly recommend that you see a healthcare professional who has experience with the ketogenic diet in order to review your history, labs, and other risk factors and then make an assessment of what would be best to try. There is a fair amount of evidence that many versions of the ketogenic diet can actually improve cardiac risk factors, but given your history, you should definitely work with someone and get a full assessment and come up with a treatment plan that is safe. Submitted by Joelle on April 7, 2019 - 3:05am Do you know of any research on the effects of the ketogenic diet on bipolar disorders? The Keto diet has been shown to be effective in treating people who suffer from repeated seizures. Since the same meds treat people with seizures, and with bipolar disorders, perhaps the diet could also help with both illnesses. At the very least, the ketogenic diet could reverse the side-effects of meds on the metabolism, since they often lead to insulin insensitivity. Submitted by Chris Palmer M.D. on April 7, 2019 - 5:20am Yes, there is evidence of the ketogenic diet working in bipolar disorder. If you go to my website, chrispalmermd . com, you can find a blog there on the topic, along with some of the research articles that have been done. Stay tuned for even more articles right here on Psychology Today in the future outlining the evidence. Submitted by Mike on April 7, 2019 - 7:23am Submitted by Chris Palmer M.D. on April 7, 2019 - 8:15am There are reports of improvement in depression and anxiety throughout the lay press, on websites, books, etc. ""Keto clarity"" is a good example. In the medical literature, there is evidence of an antidepressant and anti-anxiety effect in people being treated with the KD for weight loss, epilepsy, and some other disorders. There are a couple of animal studies suggesting an antidepressant and anti-anxiety effect. However, there are no clinical trials, or even case reports, currently published in the medical literature that specifically address the ketogenic diet directly treating major depression or anxiety disorders. I'm hoping to change that soon, so stay tuned! I'm also aware of at least one clinical trial just getting started in the UK. Submitted by Wondering on April 8, 2019 - 8:23pm Can’t thank you enough for this post. My uncle (not related by blood) has schizophrenia and he has seen amazing results through keto. My question is for myself (age: mid-30s): my mom has bipolar I, dad has depression and diabetes - I have been diagnosed w major depressive disorder, as well as PMDD and endometriosis, and have been managing w Effexor for a while. Should I try keto or the Mediterranean diet (read your website article on this diet)? Also, if I contact my health care provider for keto oversight, should I go through psychiatrist, dietician or general care practitioner? Thank you again for your post. Submitted by Chris Palmer M.D. on April 9, 2019 - 5:08am I would recommend that you work with your general care practitioner, given the different medical issues that you have. A dietician certified in keto can be an invaluable resource, but they can be hard to find. If you continue to have psychiatric symptoms, or need to change your Effexor, you may want to work with your psychiatrist on that end. Your story illustrates the complex and very different disorders that can be affected by this diet, and it's important to work with someone who understands both those disorders and the ketogenic diet. But your general practitioner might feel comfortable with all of these aspects depending upon his/her experience. Submitted by Pavlik on April 7, 2019 - 12:44pm It's iron overload from the (non heme) iron added to flour. Lanthanum+manganese cures it As well as parkinson's and dementia. Lanthanum changes brain chemistry, reduces dopamine activity (likely through reducing iron content, which increases it, in fact low iron diet has the same effects as neuroleptics) Manganese inhibits iron absorption and vice versa. Links are not allowed, so I can't post any studies. Submitted by Bernice on April 8, 2019 - 2:54am I appreciate the information in your comment about Lanthanum+manganese being helpful and will try to find more information on this topic. I wish the site allowed links. Submitted by Mia on January 13, 2020 - 8:54am Terrible advice, manganese is linked to autism, and manganese is not a good idea for schizoprenia. Submitted by Anonymous on April 7, 2019 - 5:18pm Anything that frees people from the tyranny of mds is a good thing Submitted by Chris Palmer M.D. on April 7, 2019 - 5:30pm I would say anything that frees people from the tyranny of the illness and symptoms. For some people, meds work, and I'm all for that. But as I discussed in this article, when it comes to schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the meds don't really work all that well. People deserve better lives, without suffering. Submitted by Anonymous on April 7, 2019 - 5:51pm mds not meds. It wasn't a typo. Free from the tyranny of western medical practitioners.

Submitted by Chris Palmer M.D. on April 7, 2019 - 7:15pm Being an MD myself, I'll try not to take it personally. I do understand your anger. There are a lot of people who are not helped by the current paradigm, and many would argue are hurt by the treatments. I've seen people gain over 100 pounds in a matter of months from our treatments. Something is clearly not OK with that, especially when they continue to have symptoms and still suffer. I'm hoping to change all of this... even though I'm still an MD.

Submitted by Brenda D. on April 8, 2019 - 4:18pm Any evidence that following a vegetarian ketogenic diet might also help? Submitted by Chris Palmer M.D. on April 8, 2019 - 4:23pm This one comes up a lot. It is possible to do a vegetarian version of the ketogenic diet. We don't have data in psychiatric patients (at least not that I know of), but there is a lot of data in epilepsy. It's more difficult to do, as the food choices are more restricted, but it does work in epilepsy, which is an indicator that it could very well also work for psychiatric disorders, given the overlap. Submitted by Liz de Villiers on April 15, 2019 - 1:46am My husband has auditory delusions which was diagnosed 10 years ago. I suspect that he suffered for some time before that. In 1998 he had a mild heart attack and was put on a low fat diet and also medicated with statins for high cholesterol. I am wondering if the low fat diet could have caused the mental health issues. He is also OCD. I am keen to explore this ketogenic diet for him. Has there been scientific evidence that a low fat diet can contribute to this disorder. Submitted by Chris Palmer M.D. on April 15, 2019 - 7:22am Liz, thanks for this important question. First of all, I'm sorry to hear about your husband's suffering. I hope he's able to find a solution - one way or another. To address your question, it's an important one, but we don't have answers yet. It's not at all clear that diet prior to the start of schizophrenia plays a role in causing it, although there are some who think it may be involved. We know that certain diets can promote inflammation and change the gut microbiome in adverse ways, two things that might play a role in schizophrenia, and other mental illnesses. Some versions of the low fat diet include a lot of sugar and processed foods, two things that are likely not helpful in promoting health. However, I think of the ketogenic diet as a metabolic intervention - one that can help when there is a problem. I don't necessarily look at it as a diet that everyone should do. For example, children with seizures likely did not develop seizures because of their diet. Some of them are still breastfeeding, and that likely did not cause their seizures. Nonetheless, the ketogenic diet can sometimes stop their seizures. I hope that more research will continue to help us to better understand the role of diet in causing mental illnesses, but for now, we at least have some ideas about dietary interventions that can help when problems do arise. Does Harvard Medical School recommend Keto or Carnivore Diet? Submitted by Tricia on April 30, 2019 - 12:15am Dear Dr Palmer, Are you colleagues with Dr Georgia Ede at Harvard? Did you read her article ""Carnivore Diet for Mental Health?"" Is the Carnivore Diet better than the Ketogenic Diet for mental health? Submitted by Chris Palmer M.D. on April 30, 2019 - 6:54am Thanks for this question. I do know Dr. Georgia Ede, but she is no longer at Harvard. Just to be clear, Harvard is a big place, with lots of schools and lots of opinions from its different faculty members. As an institution, it does not recommend either of these diets. As much as I like new ideas, I also like to see at least some evidence published in the medical literature. To the best of my knowledge, there are no studies or even case reports of the carnivore diet published in the mental health literature, so I would be reluctant to officially recommend that. For the ketogenic diet, we can at least consider this an ""off label"" use of a proven treatment for epilepsy in psychiatry, which we routinely do for other epilepsy treatments, such as the numerous medications listed in this article, so I feel this has at least more evidence and more of a rationale based on existing practice. With this said, just because we don't have evidence doesn't mean something doesn't work. But I do want to move the field of mental health forward, and disseminate effective treatments more broadly, and in order to do that safely and responsibly, we do need to make sure we have a good basis for recommendations, and that our recommendations are safe. Ketogenic Diet vs a Gluten-Free diet for major mental illness Submitted by Christina Veselak on May 15, 2019 - 2:32pm While we know that adding fat to the diet helps stabilize the neuronal membrane, which addresses at least one posited cause of schizophrenia, ketogenic diets are also very low carb, and are generally therefore gluten free. There is quite a bit of research indicating that a real subset of people with both Bipolar disorder, Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective disorder go completely into remission on a gluten free diet. Also, some patients on a casein-free diet go into remission as well. So, some of these factors need to be teased out. Thanks for posting this. Unproven treatment suggests you can quit your meds Submitted by Troy Kohler on September 27, 2019 - 5:46pm Do you ever wonder how an educated professional can turn into a believer, even a promoter of quack techniques? I do sometimes. I look out for MDs like that. Submitted by Chris Palmer M.D. on September 28, 2019 - 6:46am I understand your skepticism. However, it sounds like maybe you don't understand the process to develop new treatments in medicine, such as case reports, animal studies, that then progress to randomized controlled trials (one underway now). You may also not understand the overlap between epilepsy treatments and treatments for psychiatric disorders, and the fact that this is already a ""proven"" treatment for epilepsy. Assuming you're not a physician, it's OK that you don't know these things. But I do. Submitted by Claudia on December 18, 2019 - 8:57pm Have you done any research on fasting as a therapeutic model for Schizophrenia? Professor Yuri Nikolaev's work from the Moscow Institute in 1970s did a study for 25-30 days of fasting and saw significant improvement in symptoms. Was wondering if any of this has been replicated elsewhere and more recently? Submitted by Chris Palmer M.D. on December 19, 2019 - 1:17pm Thank you, Claudia, for this insightful question. I have done research on Professor Nikolaev's work and the experience of using fasting as a treatment in Russia. To the best of my knowledge, the biggest problem with their practice is that once people start eating again, the symptoms usually return quickly. This is one of the biggest benefits of considering the ketogenic diet - it mimics the fasting state and can produce the therapeutic benefits over longer periods of time, and it prevents the body from going into ""starvation"" mode. Submitted by Mia on January 13, 2020 - 8:59am I'd like to start my boyfriend on a keto diet for his schizoprenia and document the changes on video. The real challenge here is getting him to agree to the diet. Any advice? Submitted by Chris Palmer M.D. on January 13, 2020 - 10:22am Thanks, Mia, for your interest in this intervention. I would strongly recommend that you work with a competent psychiatrist or nurse practitioner, especially if he is on medications. He could continue working with his current psychiatrist if he has one, but just let him/her know. The ketogenic diet is a powerful intervention, and as you probably know, schizophrenia can sometimes result in dangerous situations, so it's important to do this safely with medical supervision. Submitted by Mia on January 13, 2020 - 10:50am There are no psychiatrists in our area who would ever agree to using the keto diet. Trust me, after 4 1/2 years of desperation I have tried that.. It would have to be done without a psychiatrist.. and he would stay in the meds until he felt ok to slowly taper off.. Again, I can't even convince him to try it, but I'm not giving up. Submitted by Chris Palmer M.D. on January 13, 2020 - 11:54am I do understand your frustration. I'm hoping to change this by talking about this at conferences, publishing articles in medical journals, and getting studies going - both my own and helping other researchers. There is much work to do. If you haven't tried it already, some people have had luck changing their psychiatrists' minds by printing out my publications (the ones in medical journals) and taking them to the psychiatrist. This has persuaded at least some of them to consider it. Submitted by Christina on February 25, 2020 - 5:00pm My son has been living with schizophrenia since the end of 8th grade. He will be 25 this year. He finds little enjoyment in life and finds it difficult to summon the energy and concentration necessary to do much of anything. Years of taking antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anti anxiety medication have helped him not get any worse. At least this is what the doctors tell me. I was involved in his care to a greater extent when he was younger, but now it seems the doctors are happy to act as his guardian. At times, I have tried to ask about nutritional therapies for his treatment, but was never taken seriously. How do I find a doctor who is willing to try a nutritional approach to his care, and provide the support to make sure necessary changes can be implemented? It’s hard to believe any risks associated with a nutritional approach can be any worse than the side effects he has experienced while on the pharmaceuticals which have been prescribed to him. I believe in the healing power of our bodies, when they are nourished properly, I have experienced this myself in my life, but it took many years before I happened upon the knowledge and resources I would need to begin a road to recovery. I want my son treated by healthcare professionals who acknowledge this. I live in Omaha. Any guidance would be much appreciated. Submitted by Chris Palmer M.D. on February 26, 2020 - 6:23am Christina, I'm sorry to hear about your son's struggles. As you likely know, he's not alone. There are countless people just like him. As you know, schizophrenia is a severe and devastating disorder. This makes most psychiatrists skeptical that a diet can be helpful. I generally recommend that people print out my research articles, or at least the references, and provide them to their doctors. These are published in respected journals, so it should at least get their attention. The ketogenic diet is really a metabolic intervention, not just a ""diet."" This can be helpful to reinforce in order to get doctors to take this seriously. Most psychiatrists don't know how to do this diet, so finding a ketogenic trained dietician can be essential. This person can oversee the dietary aspect of the treatment. I have more information on my website. I hope this helps. Submitted by Mia on February 26, 2020 - 8:49am Carnivore diet is better than keto for mental health issues. No plants, no fruits, just meat and fat. Submitted by DD on October 3, 2020 - 10:04am I followed strict elimination protocol where I removed all agricultural products and also all plant products. My Ketogenic Diet is quite strict but very simple and super palatable. I eat ribeye, some eggs, some butter, connective tissue and organs when I get a change. And like I've mentioned already, I eat zero vegetation. One could say I eat carnivorous, but I still consider myself withing framework of Ketogenic Diet (where ketones are being elevated), because my protein is around 20-30% of my total calories, and my fat goes up to 70-80%, with carbohydrates obviously being zero. Just within 5-7 days of eating Ketogenic Diet my symptoms subsided where I could think with absolute clarity. And because of my clarity I can now understand what delusions are. I think too, I'm like Chris's patients who went to full remission on Carnivorous Ketogenic diet. It's just happened by itself where no medication could ever achieve anything remotely positive, Ketogenic Diet did saved my life. Submitted by Chris Palmer M.D. on October 4, 2020 - 5:06am Thanks for sharing your story. I'm delighted to hear that this diet is working for you! I wish you success on your continued journey and recovery. Submitted by DD on October 4, 2020 - 2:14pm Thank you for sharing this very important information, Chris. I was so focused talking about myself that I forgot to give you a credit for inspiring me to take a leap.

e2e96ea4-9047-41bd-8f45-b75c2c084146,"Insulin is an extremely important hormone that’s produced by your pancreas. It has many functions, such as allowing your cells to take in sugar from your blood for energy. However, too much insulin can lead to serious health problems. Having high levels, also known as hyperinsulinemia, has been linked to obesity, heart disease and cancer (, , ). High blood insulin levels also cause your cells to become resistant to the hormone’s effects. When you become insulin resistant, your pancreas produces insulin, creating a vicious cycle (). Here are 14 things you can do to lower your insulin levels. Of the three macronutrients — carbs, protein and fat — carbs raise blood sugar and insulin levels the most. For this and other reasons, can be very effective for losing weight and . Many studies have confirmed their ability to lower insulin levels and increase insulin sensitivity, compared to other diets (, , , , ). People with health conditions characterized by insulin resistance, such as metabolic syndrome and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), may experience a dramatic lowering of insulin with carb restriction. In one study, individuals with metabolic syndrome were randomized to receive either a low-fat or low-carb diet containing 1,500 calories. Insulin levels dropped by an average of 50% in the low-carb group, compared to 19% in the low-fat group (). In another study, when women with PCOS ate a lower-carb diet containing enough calories to maintain their weight, they experienced greater reductions in insulin levels than when they ate a higher-carb diet (). Low-carb diets have been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and reduce insulin levels in people with obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and PCOS. has been credited with preventing insulin and blood sugar spikes after eating. This has been shown to mainly occur when vinegar is taken with high-carb foods (, , ). A small study found that people who took about 2 tablespoons (28 ml) of vinegar with a high-carb meal experienced lower insulin levels and greater feelings of fullness 30 minutes after the meal (). Researchers believed this effect was partly due to vinegar’s ability to delay stomach emptying, leading to a more gradual absorption of sugar into the bloodstream (). Vinegar may help prevent high insulin levels after you consume meals or foods high in carbs. Although the pancreas releases different amounts of insulin depending on the type of food you eat, eating too much of any food at one time can lead to hyperinsulinemia. This is especially a concern in obese people with . In one study, insulin-resistant obese people who consumed a 1,300-calorie meal had twice the increase in insulin as lean people who consumed the same meal. They also experienced nearly twice the increase in insulin as obese people who were considered “metabolically healthy” (). Consuming fewer calories has consistently been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and decrease insulin levels in overweight and obese individuals, regardless of the type of diet they consume (, , , , , , ). One study looked at different weight loss methods in 157 people with metabolic syndrome. The researchers found that fasting insulin levels decreased by 16% in the group that practiced calorie restriction and 12% in the group that practiced portion control (). Reducing calorie intake by portion control or counting calories can lead to lower insulin levels in overweight and obese people with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. may very well be the most important food to stay away from if you’re trying to lower your insulin levels. In one study where people overate either candy or peanuts, the candy group experienced a 31% increase in fasting insulin levels, compared to a 12% increase in the peanut group (). In another study, when people consumed jams containing high amounts of sugar, their insulin levels rose significantly more than after consuming low-sugar jams (). Fructose is found in table sugar, honey, high-fructose corn syrup, agave and syrup. Consuming large quantities of it promotes insulin resistance, which ultimately drives insulin levels higher (, , ). One study found that people had similar insulin responses after consuming 50 grams of table sugar, honey or high-fructose corn syrup every day for 14 days (). In another study, overweight people who added to their usual diet experienced a 22% increase in fasting insulin levels. In contrast, the group who added artificially sweetened foods to their usual diet experienced a 3% in fasting insulin levels (). A high intake of sugar in any form has been shown to increase insulin levels and promote insulin resistance. Engaging in regular physical activity can have powerful insulin-lowering effects. Aerobic appears to be very effective at increasing insulin sensitivity in people who are obese or have type 2 diabetes (, , , ). One study compared two groups. One performed sustained aerobic exercise, and the other performed high-intensity interval training. The study found that although both groups experienced improvements in fitness, only the group that performed sustained aerobic activity experienced significantly lower insulin levels (). There’s also research showing that resistance training can help decrease insulin levels in older and sedentary adults (, ). Combining aerobic and resistance exercise seems to be the most effective and has been shown to most greatly affect insulin sensitivity and levels (, , ). In a study of 101 breast cancer survivors, those who engaged in a combination of strength-training and endurance exercise for 16 weeks experienced a 27% reduction in insulin levels (). Aerobic exercise, strength training or a combination of both may help increase insulin sensitivity and lower your levels. is a delicious spice loaded with health-promoting antioxidants. Studies in healthy people and those with insulin resistance suggest that taking cinnamon may enhance insulin sensitivity and decrease insulin levels (, , ). In one study, healthy people who consumed about 1.5 teaspoons of cinnamon in rice pudding had significantly lower insulin responses than when they ate rice pudding without cinnamon (). In another small study, young men who consumed a high-sugar drink after taking cinnamon for 14 days experienced lower insulin levels than when they consumed the drink after taking a placebo for 14 days (). It’s important to note that not all studies have found that cinnamon lowers your levels or increases insulin sensitivity. Cinnamon’s effects may vary from person to person (, ). However, including up to one teaspoon (2 grams) per day may provide other health benefits, even if it doesn’t reduce your levels significantly. Some studies have found that adding cinnamon to foods or beverages lowers insulin levels and increases insulin sensitivity. are a major part of many people’s diets. However, research in animals and humans has found that consuming them regularly can lead to several health problems. These include high insulin levels and weight gain (, , ). Furthermore, refined carbs have a high glycemic index. The glycemic index (GI) is a scale that measures a specific food’s capacity to raise blood sugar. Glycemic load takes into account a food’s glycemic index, as well as the amount of digestible carbs contained in a serving. Several studies have compared foods with different glycemic loads to see if they affected insulin levels differently. They found that eating a high-glycemic load food raises your levels more than eating the same portion of a low-glycemic load food, even if the carb contents of the two foods are similar (, , ). In one study, overweight people followed one of two unrestricted-calorie diets for 10 weeks. After a test meal, the high-GI group had higher insulin levels than the low-GI group (). Replacing refined carbs, which are digested and absorbed quickly, with slower-digesting whole foods may help lower insulin levels. In order to reduce insulin levels, it’s important to live an active lifestyle. One study of over 1,600 people found that those who were the most were nearly twice as likely to have metabolic syndrome as those who performed moderate activity at least 150 minutes per week (). Other studies have shown that getting up and walking around, rather than sitting for prolonged periods, can help keep insulin levels from spiking after a meal (, ). A 12-week study in middle-aged sedentary women found that the women who walked for 20 minutes after a large meal had increased insulin sensitivity, compared with women who didn’t walk after a meal. In addition, the walking group became more fit and lost body fat (). Another study looked at 113 overweight men at risk of type 2 diabetes. The group who took the most steps per day had the greatest reduction in insulin levels and lost the most belly fat, compared to the group who took the lowest number of steps daily (). Avoiding prolonged sitting and increasing the amount of time you spend walking or doing other moderate activities can reduce insulin levels. Intermittent fasting has become . Research suggests it may help reduce insulin levels as effectively as daily calorie restriction (). One study found that obese women lost weight and had other health improvements following calorie-restricted intermittent fasting with either liquid or solid meals. However, only the liquid diet significantly reduced fasting insulin levels (). Alternate-day fasting involves fasting or dramatically reducing calories one day and eating normally the following day. Some studies have found it effectively lowers insulin levels (, ). In one study, 26 people who fasted every other day for 22 days experienced an impressive 57% decrease in fasting insulin levels, on average (). Although many people find intermittent fasting beneficial and enjoyable, it doesn’t work for everyone and may cause problems in some people. To find out more about intermittent fasting, read . Intermittent fasting may help reduce insulin levels. However, study results are mixed, and this way of eating may not suit everyone. provides a number of health benefits, including helping with weight loss and . It absorbs water and forms a gel, which slows down the movement of food through the digestive tract. This promotes feelings of fullness and keeps blood sugar and insulin from rising too quickly after a meal (, , , ). One observational study found women who ate the highest amount of soluble fiber were half as likely to be insulin resistant as women who ate the least amount of soluble fiber (). Soluble fiber also helps feed the friendly bacteria that live in your colon, which may improve gut health and reduce insulin resistance. In a six-week controlled study of obese older women, those who took flaxseed experienced greater increases in insulin sensitivity and lower insulin levels than women who took a probiotic or placebo (). Overall, fiber from whole foods appears to be more effective at reducing insulin than fiber in supplement form, although results are mixed. One study found that a combination of whole food and supplemental fiber lowered insulin levels the most. Meanwhile, another found that insulin decreased when people consumed black beans but not when they took a fiber supplement (, ). Soluble fiber, especially from whole foods, has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and lower insulin levels, particularly in people with obesity or type 2 diabetes. Belly fat, also known as visceral or abdominal fat, is linked to many health problems. Carrying too much fat around your abdomen promotes inflammation and insulin resistance, which drives hyperinsulinemia (, , ). Studies have shown that decreasing belly fat leads to increased insulin sensitivity and lower insulin levels (, , ). Interestingly, one study found that people who lost abdominal fat retained the benefits for insulin sensitivity, even after regaining a portion of the belly fat back (). Unfortunately, people with high insulin levels often find it very difficult to lose weight. In one study, those with the highest levels not only lost weight less rapidly but also regained the most weight later on (). However, there are to lose belly fat effectively, which should help lower your insulin levels. Losing belly fat can increase insulin sensitivity and help reduce your insulin levels. It contains high amounts of an antioxidant known as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Several studies suggest it may help fight insulin resistance (, , , , , ). In one study, people with high insulin levels who took green tea extract experienced a small decrease in insulin over 12 months, while those who took a placebo had an increase (). In a detailed analysis of 17 studies, researchers reported that green tea was found to significantly lower fasting insulin levels in studies considered the highest quality (). However, not all high-quality studies have shown that green tea reduces insulin levels or increases insulin sensitivity (, ). Several studies have found that green tea may increase insulin sensitivity and decrease insulin levels. There are many reasons to consume fatty like salmon, sardines, mackerel, herring and anchovies. They provide high-quality protein, and are by far the best sources of long-chain omega-3 fats, which have . Studies have shown they may also help reduce insulin resistance in people with obesity, gestational diabetes and PCOS (, , , ). One study in women with PCOS found a significant 8.4% decrease in insulin levels in a group who took fish oil, compared to a group who took placebo (). Another study in obese children and adolescents showed that taking fish oil supplements significantly reduced insulin resistance and triglyceride levels. The long-chain omega-3 fatty acids found in fatty fish may help reduce insulin resistance and insulin levels. Consuming at meals can be beneficial for controlling your weight and insulin levels. In one study, overweight older women had lower insulin levels after consuming a high-protein breakfast compared to a low-protein breakfast. They also felt fuller and ate fewer calories at lunch (). However, protein does stimulate insulin production so that your muscles can take up amino acids. Therefore, eating very high amounts will lead to higher insulin levels. In addition, some types of protein appear to cause greater insulin responses than others. One study found that and casein protein in dairy products raised insulin levels even higher than bread in healthy people (). However, the insulin response to dairy proteins may be somewhat individual. One recent study found that insulin levels increased similarly in obese men and women after meals containing beef or dairy (). Another study in obese adults showed a high-dairy diet led to higher fasting insulin levels than a high-beef diet (). Avoiding excessive amounts of protein, especially dairy protein, can help prevent insulin levels from rising too high after meals. High insulin levels can lead to many health problems. Taking steps to increase your insulin sensitivity and decrease your insulin levels may help you lose weight, lower your risk of disease and increase your quality of life.

8d72a612-ee31-4ec2-ba81-7416bd788bd5,"Introduction Type II diabetes is a heterogeneous syndrome results from the progressive defects of impairment of ß- cell insulin secretion and insulin resistant of the target tissues. It also increases due to the rising rate of obesity which involves the deficiency of insulin to compensate for resistance by increasing insulin secretion [1]. However it is increasingly clear that reductions in insulin sensitivity and ß- cell functions leads to the rise of type II diabetes [2]. The normal pancreatic ß- cells displaying the remarkable response to nutrients and obesity – associated insulin resistance by the hyper secretion of insulin to maintain fuel homeostasis. But the cellular resistance unable to sustain the ß– cells compensatory response in type II diabetes [3]. Although the cause of the metabolic deterioration is unknown, but several hypothesis have been proposed including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, ER stress, and gluco-lipotoxicity [4, 5]. Recent studies with intensive investigations suggesting that elevated glucose along with circulating free fatty acids distributed especially from the intra abdominal fat are the major culprits of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction [6, 7]. But the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of gluco-lipotoxicity contribute to ß- cell dysfunction and loss in type II diabetes remains debated. A recent observation from experimental, clinical and genetic evidence suggests endoplasmic reticulum was responsible for molecular mechanism of gluco-lipotoxicity which may contribute to ß - cell dysfunction in type II diabetes [8, 9]. In this review, we discussed about the involvement of ER in gluco-lipotoxicity induced ß- cell dysfunction along with the brief involvement of mitochondria. ER stress response Adaptation to metabolic changes requires the high regulation and co-ordination of many homeostatic systems, since the quality and quantity of available nutrients does not temporally match their needs. Pancreatic ß - cells displaying remarkable response to nutrients by the balance between the anabolic hormone insulin and the catabolic hormone glucagon in order to maintain fuel homeostasis. For an appropriate response, the cells require the development of suitable sensors and signaling molecules, which integrates all these signals into an appropriate insulin secretory rate in order to maintain homeostasis. In addition, in hyperglycemia, glucose is not taken up by the cells; therefore, the glucose remains in circulation in the blood. Another consequence of insulin depletion is the increase in the breakdown of fats in the body and fatty oxidation. This consequence of insulin depletion results in the overproduction of ketones and leads to ketosis.

Furthermore, within the HLA locus are three classes of genes. Type II, is where the body can’t make enough or properly use insulin, also known as non-insulin dependent. Other specific type of diabetes may have its origin from certain genetic syndromes, surgery, drugs, malnutrition inflection and other illness. The cause of this disease remains a mystery. Genetics, environmental factors, lack of exercise, plays an important role in the cause of diabetes. Diabetes can cause different types of problems depending on which types of diabetes they have. A person’s lifestyle choices can greatly increase or decrease his/her chances of developing diabetes. Poor lifestyle choices can lead to increased levels of fat, which is dangerous because excess levels of fat makes it more difficult for one’s body to utilize insulin effectively.

Type 2 diabetes (non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM]) is a heterogeneous disorder. Patients with NIDDM have insulin resistance, and their beta cells lack the ability to overcome this resistance. Although this form of diabetes previously was uncommon in children, 20% or more of new patients with diabetes in childhood and adolescence now have NIDDM, a change associated with increased rates of obesity. Insulin is essential to process carbohydrate, fat, and protein. Insulin reduces blood glucose levels by allowing glucose to enter muscle cells and fat cells and by stimulating the conversion of glucose to glycogen as a carbohydrate store. This hormone is responsible for maintaining an optimal glucose level in the blood. It allows the body cells to use glucose as a main energy source. Due to abnormal insulin metabolism, in a diabetic person, the body cells and tissues cannot make use of glucose from the blood, resulting in elevated blood glucose level or hyperglycemia. Over time, elevated blood glucose level in the bloodstream can lead to severe complications, such as disorders of the eyes, cardiovascular diseases, kidney damage and nerve destruction. In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas is not able to produce sufficient amount of insulin as required for the body. The disease, diabetes mellitus presents from complications of carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. Many routes can contribute to the rise of the disease, beta cell dysfunction, insulin release mechanisms fail or tissue cells become insulin resistant from over exposure to high concentrations of glucose. This disorder can be diagnosed as an autoimmune disorder as well, resulting from the destruction of insulin producing β-cells. The chronic effects of such disease processes can lead to critical failures of major bodily systems, such as the kidneys, heart, nerves, and vascular system. Significant microvasuclar and macrovascular complications arise from chronic hyperglycemia caused by diabetes mellitus and will be the main focus of this essay. Type 1 diabetes results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin producing beta cells located in the Pancreas. It is because of this destruction that Type 1 diabetes patients need to take shots of insulin for the remainder of their life in order to control the glucose in the body itself. Where as a patient with type 2 diabetes can have higher levels of blood sugar in the body, and can eventually level out without the aid of insulin. It should be said that in both cases the bodies lack of insulin production causes the body to be unable to convert the glucose to energy. When this occurs the body begins to burn fatty acids required for energy production which begins to produce ketones in the body which are r... ... middle of paper ... ... predisposing the patient to renal deficiency. SECTION I Scientific Rationale for Selection of the Target A. Characterization of Target Diabetes Mellitus is a heterogeneous group of metabolic diseases characterized by the presence of excessive amounts of glucose and glucagon in the blood of diabetic patients. The most frequently cited reason for Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is either a lack of insulin secretion (DM Type I) and/or, more commonly, the resistance to insulin in the peripheral tissues, particularly muscle and adipose tissue (DM type II). Hence, insulin has long been a target for the treatment of DM. In DM Type I, intravenous or subcutaneous insulin injection has often been the norm. Diabetes is a disease known by most of the people which occurs when the blood sugar level is exceptionally high compared to normal level. The essay will focus more on diabetes type 1 by which the production of insulin in the pancreas is inhibited because the β-cells in the pancreas are destroyed by the immune system (Dr Ananya Mandal). The unusually high blood sugar level can cause adverse effects on the human body. The kidney eventually will be damaged by the high concentration of glucose in the blood. This is a result of the extra work for the glomerulus to filter the high sugar level in the blood, causing the glomerulus to become leaky (American Diabetes Association, 2013). This is a discussion of research article listed at end of paper When muscle is damaged, there is a general resistance to insulin. The physiological stress that is associated with damaged muscle impairs how insulin stimulates IRS-1, PI 3-kinase, and Akt-kinase. This presumably leads to less glucose absorption. Previous studies have shown that there has been temporary insulin resistance due to the physiological stress associated with muscle damage. However, the molecular mechanisms by which physiological stress induces insulin resistance is not known. Copyright © 2000-2020. 123Helpme.com.

Other causes of hypoglycemia include , certain (such as ), , , , , , , and a number of drugs, including alcohol. Low blood sugar may occur in otherwise healthy babies who have not eaten for a few hours. The glucose level that defines hypoglycemia is variable. In people with diabetes, levels below 3.9  (70 mg/dl) are diagnostic. In adults without diabetes, symptoms related to low blood sugar, low blood sugar at the time of symptoms, and improvement when blood sugar is restored to normal confirm the diagnosis. Otherwise, a level below 2.8 mmol/l (50 mg/dl) after not eating or following exercise may be used. In newborns, a level below 2.2 mmol/l (40 mg/dl), or less than 3.3 mmol/l (60 mg/dl) if symptoms are present, indicates hypoglycemia. Other tests that may be useful in determining the cause include insulin and levels in the blood. Among people with diabetes, prevention is by matching the foods eaten with the amount of exercise and the medications used. When people feel their blood sugar is low, testing with a is recommended. Some people have few initial symptoms of low blood sugar, and frequent routine testing in this group is recommended. Treatment of hypoglycemia is by eating foods high in simple sugars or taking . If a person is not able to take food by mouth, by injection or in the nose may help. The treatment of hypoglycemia unrelated to diabetes includes treating the underlying problem and a . The term ""hypoglycemia"" is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to , a controversial condition with similar symptoms that occurs following eating, but with normal blood sugar levels. Hypoglycemic symptoms and manifestations can be divided into those produced by the counter-regulatory hormones (/adrenaline and glucagon) triggered by the falling glucose, and the effects produced by the reduced brain sugar. , feeling of warmth (sympathetic rather than adrenergic) Nonspecific dysphoria, moodiness, depression, crying, exaggerated concerns Feeling of numbness, (paresthesia) Negativism, irritability, belligerence, combativeness, , weakness, apathy, , daydreaming, Confusion, , or dizziness, Staring, glassy look, blurred vision, , incoordination, sometimes mistaken for Focal or general motor deficit, , Not all of the above manifestations occur in every case of hypoglycemia. No consistent order to the appearance of the symptoms is seen, if symptoms even occur. Specific manifestations may also vary by age, severity of the hypoglycemia, and speed of the decline. In young children, vomiting can sometimes accompany morning hypoglycemia with . In older children and adults, moderately severe hypoglycemia can resemble , mental illness, drug intoxication, or drunkenness. In the elderly, hypoglycemia can produce focal -like effects or a hard-to-define malaise. The symptoms of a single person may be similar from episode to episode, but are not necessarily so, and may be influenced by the speed at which glucose levels are dropping, as well as previous incidents. In , hypoglycemia can produce irritability, jitters, , , respiratory distress, episodes, sweating, , somnolence, , refusal to feed, and seizures or ""spells"". Hypoglycemia can resemble , , , or . In both young and old people with hypoglycemia, the brain may habituate to low glucose levels, with a reduction of noticeable symptoms despite impairment. In insulin-dependent diabetic people, this phenomenon is termed , and is a significant clinical problem when improved is attempted. Another aspect of this phenomenon occurs in , when chronic hypoglycemia before diagnosis may be better tolerated than acute hypoglycemia after treatment is underway. Hypoglycemic symptoms can also occur when one is sleeping. Examples of symptoms during sleep can include damp bed sheets or clothes from perspiration. Having nightmares or the act of crying out can be a sign of hypoglycemia. Once individuals are awake, they may feel tired, irritable, or confused and these may be signs of hypoglycemia, as well. In nearly all cases, hypoglycemia that is severe enough to cause seizures or unconsciousness can be reversed without obvious harm to the brain. Cases of death or permanent neurological damage occurring with a single episode have usually involved prolonged, untreated unconsciousness, interference with breathing, severe concurrent disease, or some other type of vulnerability. Nevertheless, brain damage or death has occasionally resulted from severe hypoglycemia. Research in healthy adults shows that mental efficiency declines slightly but measurably as blood glucose falls below 3.6 mmol/l (65 mg/dl). defense mechanisms ( and ) are normally activated as it drops below a threshold level (about 3.0 mmol/l (55 mg/dl) for most people), producing the typical hypoglycemic symptoms of shakiness and . Obvious impairment may not occur until the glucose falls below 2.2 mmol/l (40 mg/dl), and many healthy people may occasionally have glucose levels below 3.6 mmol/l (65 mg/dl) in the morning without apparent effects. Since the brain effects of hypoglycemia, termed , determine whether a given low glucose is a ""problem"" for that person, most doctors use the term hypoglycemia only when a moderately low glucose level is accompanied by symptoms or brain effects. Determining the presence of both parts of this definition is not always straightforward, as hypoglycemic symptoms and effects are vague and can be produced by other conditions; people with recurrently low glucose levels can lose their threshold symptoms so that severe neuroglycopenic impairment can occur without much warning, and many measurement methods (especially glucose meters) are imprecise at low levels. Recovery from severe hypoglycemia with unconsciousness or seizure even after restoration of normal blood glucose may take longer. When a person has not been unconscious, failure of carbohydrate to reverse the symptoms in 10–15 minutes increases the likelihood that hypoglycemia was not the cause of the symptoms. When severe hypoglycemia has persisted in a hospitalized person, the amount of glucose required to maintain satisfactory blood glucose levels becomes an important clue to the underlying cause. Glucose requirements above 10 mg/kg/minute in infants, or 6 mg/kg/minute in children and adults are strong evidence for . In this context, this is referred to as the glucose infusion rate. Finally, the blood glucose response to glucagon given when the glucose is low can also help distinguish among various types of hypoglycemia. A rise of blood glucose by more than 1.70 mmol/l (30 mg/dl) suggests insulin excess as the probable cause of the hypoglycemia. Significant hypoglycemia appears to increase the risk of . The most common cause of hypoglycemia is medications used to treat diabetes mellitus such as insulin, sulfonylureas, and . Risk is greater in diabetics who have eaten less than usual, exercised more than usual, or drunk . Other causes of hypoglycemia include kidney failure, certain , liver disease, hypothyroidism, starvation, inborn errors of metabolism, severe infection or sepsis, , and a number of drugs, including alcohol. Low blood sugar may occur in babies who are otherwise healthy who have not eaten for a few hours. Inborn errors of metabolism may include the lack of an enzyme to make glycogen (glycogen storage type 0). Serious illness may result in low blood sugar. Severe disease of nearly all major organ systems can cause hypoglycemia as a secondary problem. persons, especially in or those prevented from eating, can develop hypoglycemia from a variety of circumstances related to the care of their primary disease. Hypoglycemia in these circumstances is often multifactorial or . Once identified, these types of hypoglycemia are readily reversed and prevented, and the underlying disease becomes the primary problem. Not enough cortisol, such as in , not enough glucagon, or not enough epinephrine can result in low blood sugar. This is a more common cause in children. Like most animal tissues, brain depends primarily on glucose for fuel in most circumstances. A limited amount of glucose can be derived from stored in , but it is consumed within minutes. For most practical purposes, the brain is dependent on a continual supply of glucose diffusing from the blood into the interstitial tissue within the and into the themselves. Therefore, if the amount of glucose supplied by the blood falls, the brain is one of the first organs affected. In most people, subtle reduction of mental efficiency can be observed when the glucose falls below 3.6 mmol/l (65 mg/dl). Impairment of action and judgment usually becomes obvious below 2.2 mmol/l (40 mg/dl). Seizures may occur as the glucose falls further. As blood glucose levels fall below 0.55 mmol/l (10 mg/dl), most neurons become electrically silent and nonfunctional, resulting in . These brain effects are collectively referred to as . The importance of an adequate supply of glucose to the brain is apparent from the number of nervous, hormonal, and metabolic responses to a falling glucose level. Most of these are defensive or adaptive, tending to raise the blood sugar by and or provide alternative fuels. If the blood sugar level falls too low, the liver converts a storage of glycogen into glucose and releases it into the bloodstream, to prevent the person going into a , for a short time. Brief or mild hypoglycemia produces no lasting effects on the brain, though it can temporarily alter brain responses to additional hypoglycemia. Prolonged, severe hypoglycemia can produce lasting damage of a wide range. This can include impairment of cognitive function, motor control, or even consciousness. The likelihood of permanent brain damage from any given instance of severe hypoglycemia is difficult to estimate and depends on a multitude of factors such as age, recent blood and brain glucose experience, concurrent problems such as , and availability of alternative fuels. Prior hypoglycemia also blunts the counter-regulatory response to future hypoglycemia. While the mechanism leading to blunted counterregulation is unknown several have been proposed. Those type 1 diabetics found ""dead in bed"" in the morning after suspected severe hypoglycemia are often found to have had some underlying coronary pathology that led to an induced fatal heart attack. In 2010, a case report was published demonstrating the first known case of an individual found ""dead in bed"" whilst wearing a , which provided a history of glucose levels before the fatal event; the person had suffered a severe hypoglycemic incident, and while the authors described only a ""minimal counter-regulatory response"", they stated no ""anatomic abnormalities"" were observed during autopsy. The vast majority of symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes results in no detectable permanent harm. The glucose level that defines hypoglycemia is variable. In diabetics a level below 3.9  (70 mg/dl) is diagnostic. In adults without diabetes, symptoms related to low blood sugar, low blood sugar at the time of symptoms, and improvement when blood sugar is restored to normal confirm the diagnosis. This is known as the . Otherwise, a level below 2.8 mmol/l (50 mg/dl) after not eating or following exercise may be used. In newborns, a level below 2.2 mmol/l (40 mg/dl) or less than 3.3 mmol/l (60 mg/dl) if symptoms are present indicates hypoglycemia. Other tests that may be useful in determining the cause include insulin and C peptide levels in the blood. , a high blood sugar level, is the opposite condition. Throughout a 24‑hour period, blood plasma glucose levels are generally maintained between 4 and 8 mmol/l (72 and 144 mg/dl). Although 3.3 or 3.9 mmol/l (60 or 70 mg/dl) is commonly cited as the lower limit of normal glucose, symptoms of hypoglycemia usually do not occur until 2.8 to 3.0 mmol/l (50 to 54 mg/dl). In cases of recurrent hypoglycemia with severe symptoms, the best method of excluding dangerous conditions is often a diagnostic fast. This is usually conducted in the hospital, and the duration depends on the age of the person and response to the fast. A healthy adult can usually maintain a glucose level above 2.8 mmol/l (50 mg/dl) for 72 hours, a child for 36 hours, and an infant for 24 hours. The purpose of the fast is to determine whether the person can maintain his or her blood glucose as long as normal, and can respond to fasting with the appropriate metabolic changes. At the end of the fast, insulin should be nearly undetectable and ketosis should be fully established. The person's blood glucose levels are monitored and a critical specimen is obtained if the glucose falls. Despite its unpleasantness and expense, a diagnostic fast may be the only effective way to confirm or refute a number of serious forms of hypoglycemia, especially those involving excessive insulin. The precise level of glucose considered low enough to define hypoglycemia is dependent on the measurement method, the age of the person, presence or absence of effects, and the purpose of the definition. While no disagreement exists as to the normal range of blood sugar, debate continues as to what degree of hypoglycemia warrants medical evaluation or treatment, or can cause harm. Deciding whether a blood glucose in the borderline range of 2.5–4.2 mmol/l (45–75 mg/dl) represents clinically problematic hypoglycemia is not always simple. This leads people to use different ""cutoff levels"" of glucose in different contexts and for different purposes. Because of all the variations, the Endocrine Society recommends that a diagnosis of hypoglycemia as a problem for an individual be based on the combination of a low glucose level and evidence of adverse effects. Glucose concentrations are expressed as millimoles per (mmol/l or mM) in most of the world, and milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl or mg/100 ml) in Lebanon, the United States, Japan, Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Colombia, India, and Israel. Glucose concentrations expressed as mg/dl can be converted to mmol/l by dividing by 18.0 g/dmol (the of glucose). For example, a glucose concentration of 90 mg/dl is 5.0 mmol/l or 5.0 mM. The circumstances of hypoglycemia provide most of the clues to diagnosis. Circumstances include the age of the person, time of day, time since last meal, previous episodes, nutritional status, physical and mental development, drugs or toxins (especially insulin or other diabetes drugs), diseases of other organ systems, family history, and response to treatment. When hypoglycemia occurs repeatedly, a record or ""diary"" of the spells over several months, noting the circumstances of each spell (time of day, relation to last meal, nature of last meal, response to carbohydrate, and so forth) may be useful in recognizing the nature and cause of the hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels discussed in this article are levels measured by standard, automated methods used in . For clinical purposes, plasma and serum levels are similar enough to be interchangeable. plasma or serum levels are slightly higher than levels, and levels are typically in between. This difference between arterial and venous levels is small in the fasting state, but is amplified and can be greater than 10% in the postprandial state. Whole blood glucose levels (e.g., by fingerprick ), though, are about 10–15% lower than venous plasma levels. Furthermore, available glucose meters are only warranted to be accurate to within 15% of a simultaneous laboratory value under optimal conditions, and home use in the investigation of hypoglycemia is fraught with misleadingly low numbers. In other words, a meter glucose reading of 39 mg/dl could be properly obtained from a person whose laboratory serum glucose was 53 mg/dl; even wider variations can occur with ""real world"" home use. Two other factors significantly affect glucose measurement: and delay after . The disparity between venous and whole blood concentrations is greater when the hematocrit is high, as in newborn infants, or adults with . High neonatal hematocrits are particularly likely to confound glucose measurement by meter. Second, unless the specimen is drawn into a tube or processed immediately to separate the serum or plasma from the cells, the measurable glucose will be gradually lowered by metabolism of the glucose at a rate around 7 mg/dl/h, or even more in the presence of . The delay that occurs when blood is drawn at a satellite site and transported to a central laboratory hours later for routine processing is a common cause of mildly low glucose levels in general chemistry panels. Children's blood sugar levels are often slightly lower than adults'. Overnight fasting glucose levels are below 3.9 mmol/l (70 mg/dl) in 5% of healthy adults, but up to 5% of children can be below 3.3 mmol/l (60 mg/dl) in the morning fasting state. As the duration of fasting is extended, a higher percentage of infants and children will have mildly low plasma glucose levels, typically without symptoms. The normal range of newborn blood sugars continues to be debated. Newborns' brains are thought to be able to use alternate fuels when glucose levels are low more readily than adults. Experts continue to debate the significance and risk of such levels, though the trend has been to recommend maintenance of glucose levels above 60–70 mg/dl the first day after birth. represents a special case with respect to the relationship of measured glucose and hypoglycemic symptoms for several reasons. First, although home glucose meter readings are often misleading, the probability that a low reading, whether accompanied by symptoms or not, represents real hypoglycemia is much higher in a person who takes insulin than in someone who does not. The following is a brief list of hormones and metabolites that may be measured in a critical sample. Not all tests are checked on every person. A ""basic version"" would include insulin, cortisol, and electrolytes, with C-peptide and drug screen for adults and growth hormone in children. The value of additional specific tests depends on the most likely diagnoses for an individual person, based on the circumstances described above. Many of these levels change within minutes, especially if glucose is given, and there no value exists in measuring them after the hypoglycemia is reversed. Others, especially those lower in the list, remain abnormal even after hypoglycemia is reversed, and can be usefully measured even if a critical specimen is missed. Part of the value of the critical sample may simply be the proof that the symptoms are indeed due to hypoglycemia. More often, measurement of certain hormones and metabolites at the time of hypoglycemia indicates which organs and body systems are responding appropriately and which are functioning abnormally. For example, when the blood glucose is low, hormones that raise the glucose level should be rising and insulin secretion should be completely suppressed. It can also be mistaken for . The most effective methods of preventing further episodes of hypoglycemia depend on the cause. The risk of further episodes of diabetic hypoglycemia can often be reduced by lowering the dose of insulin or other medications, or by more meticulous attention to blood-sugar balance during unusual hours, higher levels of exercise, or decreasing alcohol intake. Many of the inborn errors of metabolism require avoidance or shortening of fasting intervals, or extra carbohydrates. For the more severe disorders, such as type 1 glycogen storage disease, this may be supplied in the form of every few hours or by continuous gastric infusion. Several treatments are used for , depending on the exact form and severity. Some forms of congenital hyperinsulinism respond to or . Surgical removal of the overactive part of the pancreas is curative with minimal risk when hyperinsulinism is focal or due to a benign insulin-producing tumor of the pancreas. When congenital hyperinsulinism is diffuse and refractory to medications, near-total pancreatectomy may be the treatment of last resort, but is less consistently effective and fraught with more complications. Hypoglycemia due to hormone deficiencies such as hypopituitarism or adrenal insufficiency usually ceases when the appropriate hormone is replaced. Hypoglycemia due to dumping syndrome and other postsurgical conditions is best dealt with by altering diet. Including fat and protein with carbohydrates may slow digestion and reduce early insulin secretion. Some forms of this respond to treatment with an , which slows digestion. Reactive hypoglycemia with demonstrably low blood-glucose levels is most often a predictable nuisance that can be avoided by consuming fat and protein with carbohydrates, by adding morning or afternoon snacks, and reducing alcohol intake. Idiopathic postprandial syndrome without demonstrably low glucose levels at the time of symptoms can be more of a management challenge. Many people find improvement by changing eating patterns (smaller meals, avoiding excessive sugar, mixed meals rather than carbohydrates by themselves), reducing intake of stimulants such as , or by making lifestyle changes to reduce stress. Treatment of some forms of hypoglycemia, such as in diabetes, involves immediately raising the blood sugar to normal through the eating of carbohydrates such as sugars, determining the cause, and taking measures to hopefully prevent future episodes. However, this treatment is not optimal in other forms, such as , where rapid carbohydrate ingestion may lead to a further hypoglycemic episode. Blood glucose can be raised to normal within minutes by taking (or receiving) 10–20 g of . It can be taken as food or drink if the person is conscious and able to swallow. This amount of carbohydrate is contained in about 3–4 ounces (100–120 ml) of orange, apple, or grape juice, although fruit juices contain a higher proportion of fructose, which is more slowly metabolized than pure dextrose. Alternatively, about 4–5 ounces (120–150 ml) of regular (not sugar-free) soda may also work, as will about one slice of bread, about four crackers, or about one serving of most starchy foods. Starch is quickly digested to glucose (unless the person is taking ), but adding fat or protein retards digestion. Symptoms should begin to improve within 5 minutes, though full recovery may take 10–20 minutes. Overfeeding does not speed recovery, and if the person has diabetes, it will simply produce afterwards. A mnemonic used by the and others is the ""rule of 15"" – consuming 15 grams of carbohydrate followed by a 15-minute wait, repeated if glucose remains low (variable by individual, sometimes 70 mg/dl). If a person has such severe effects of hypoglycemia that they cannot (due to combativeness) or should not (due to seizures or unconsciousness) be given anything by mouth, medical personnel such as paramedics, or in-hospital personnel can give intravenous dextrose, concentrations varying depending on age (infants are given 2 ml/kg dextrose 10%, children are given dextrose 25%, and adults are given dextrose 50%). Care must be taken in giving these solutions because they can cause skin necrosis if the IV is infiltrated, sclerosis of veins, and many other fluid and electrolyte disturbances if administered incorrectly. If IV access cannot be established, the person can be given 1 to 2 mg of glucagon in an . If a person has less severe effects, and is conscious with the ability to swallow, medical personal may administer gelatinous oral glucose. The soft drink has been used for hypoglycemia in the United Kingdom, but it has recently replaced much of its glucose with artificial sweeteners, which do not treat hypoglycemia. One situation where starch may be less effective than glucose or sucrose is when a person is taking acarbose. Since acarbose and other prevent starch and other sugars from being broken down into that can be absorbed by the body, people taking these medications should consume monosaccharide-containing foods such as glucose tablets, honey, or juice to reverse hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia was first discovered by when he was working with on purifying insulin in 1922. Collip was asked to develop an assay to measure the activity of insulin. He first injected insulin into a rabbit, and then measured the reduction in blood-glucose levels. Measuring blood glucose was a time-consuming step. Collip observed that if he injected rabbits with a too large a dose of insulin, the rabbits began convulsing, went into a coma, and then died. This observation simplified his assay. He defined one unit of insulin as the amount necessary to induce this convulsing hypoglycemic reaction in a rabbit. Collip later found he could save money, and rabbits, by injecting them with glucose once they were convulsing. The word ""hypoglycemia"" is hypoglycaemia or hypoglycæmia.

13e2878d-ccc2-4465-b55a-0024e35b3619,"23 Studies on Low Carb and Low Fat Diets — Time to Retire the Fad — — When it comes to weight loss, nutritionists often debate the issue “carbohydrates versus fat.” Most mainstream health organizations argue that a diet that is rich in fat can lead to health problems, especially heart disease. They tend to recommend a , which restricts dietary fat to less than 30% of total calories. However, a growing number of studies have been challenging the low fat approach. Many now argue that a low carb diet, which is higher in fat and protein, may be more effective for treating and preventing obesity and other conditions. This article analyzes the data from 23 studies comparing and low fat diets. All of the studies are randomized controlled trials, and they all appear in respected, peer-reviewed journals. Many of the studies comparing low carb and low fat diets focus on people with: A randomized trial of a low-carbohydrate diet for obesity. Sixty-three adults with obesity followed either a low fat or a low carb diet for 12 months. The low fat group was calorie restricted. After 6 months, the low carb group had lost 7% of their total body weight, compared with the low fat group, which lost 3%. The difference was statistically significant at 3 and 6 months but not at 12 months. There was more weight loss in the low carb group, and the difference was significant at 3 and 6 months, but not 12. The low carb group had greater improvements in blood triglycerides and HDL (good cholesterol), but other biomarkers were similar between groups. A low-carbohydrate as compared with a low-fat diet in severe obesity. In this study, 132 individuals with severe obesity (an average BMI of 43) followed either a low fat or a low carb diet for 6 months. Many had metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes. Those on the low fat diet had a restricted calorie intake. The low carb group lost an average of 12.8 pounds (5.8 kg), while the low fat group lost only 4.2 pounds (1.9 kg). The difference was statistically significant. Those who followed the low carb diet lost about three times more weight than those on the low fat diet. There was also a statistically significant difference in several biomarkers: fell by 38 mg/dL in the low carb group, compared with 7 mg/dL in the low fat group. improved on the low carb diet, but it worsened slightly on the low fat diet. levels fell by 26 mg/dL in the low carb group, but only by 5 mg/dL in the low fat group. levels dropped by 27% in the low carb group, but it rose slightly in the low fat group. Overall, the low carb diet produced more benefits for weight and key biomarkers in this study. Effects of a low-carbohydrate diet on weight loss and cardiovascular risk factor in overweight adolescents. Thirty adolescents with overweight followed either a low carb diet or a low fat diet for 12 weeks. Neither group restricted their calorie intake. Those on the low carb diet lost 21.8 pounds (9.9 kg), while those on the low fat diet lost only 9 pounds (4.1 kg). The difference was statistically significant. The low carb group lost 2.3 times as much weight and had significant decreases in triglyceride and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol levels. Total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) — or “bad” cholesterol — fell in the low fat group only. A randomized trial comparing a very low carbohydrate diet and a calorie-restricted low fat diet on body weight and cardiovascular risk factors in healthy women.The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, 2003. Fifty-three females who had obesity but were in good health followed either a low fat or a low carb diet for 6 months. The low fat group restricted their calorie intake. Those in the low carb group lost an average of 18.7 pounds (8.5 kg), while those on the low fat diet lost an average of 8.6 pounds (3.9 kg). The difference was statistically significant at 6 months. The low carb group lost 2.2 times as much weight as the low fat group. Blood lipids improved significantly for each group, but there was no significant difference between the groups. The National Cholesterol Education Program Diet vs a diet lower in carbohydrates and higher in protein and monounsaturated fat: A randomized trial Sixty individuals with overweight followed either a low carb diet that was high in monounsaturated fat, or a low fat diet based on the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). They followed the diet for 12 weeks The low carb group lost an average of 13.6 pounds (6.2 kg), while the low fat group lost 7.5 pounds (3.4 kg). The difference was statistically significant. The low carb group lost 1.8 times as much weight, and several changes occurred in biomarkers: is a marker for abdominal fat. This marker improved slightly in the low carb but not in the low fat group. fell by 42 mg/dL in the low carb group, compared with 15.3 mg/dL in the low fat group. However, the difference wasn’t statistically significant between groups. increased by 4.8 nm, and the percentage of particles decreased by 6.1% in the low carb group. There was no significant difference in the low fat group, and the changes weren’t statistically significant between the groups. Overall, the low carb group lost more weight and had some improvement in several important risk factors for cardiovascular disease. A low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet versus a low-fat diet to treat obesity and hyperlipidemia. In this study, 120 individuals with overweight and high blood lipids followed either a low carb or a low fat diet for 24 weeks. The low fat group restricted their calorie intake. People in the low carb group lost 20.7 pounds (9.4 kg) of their total body weight, compared with 10.6 pounds (4.8 kg) in the low fat group. People in the low carb group lost significantly more weight and had greater improvements in blood triglycerides and HDL (good) cholesterol. Comparison of energy-restricted very low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets on weight loss and body composition in overweight men and women. In a study involving 28 people with obesity or overweight, females followed either a very low carb or a low fat diet for 30 days, and males followed one of these diets for 50 days. Both diets were calorie restricted. People in low carb group lost significantly more weight. This was especially true for the men, even though they ate more calories than the low fat group. People in the low carb group lost more weight than those in the low fat group. The men on the low carb diet lost three times as much abdominal fat as the men on the low fat diet. Comparison of a low-fat diet to a low-carbohydrate diet on weight loss, body composition, and risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease in free-living, overweight men and women.The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, 2004. Forty people with overweight followed either a low carb or a low fat diet for 10 weeks. Each group had the same calorie intake. The low carb group lost 15.4 pounds (7.0 kg), and the low fat group lost 14.9 pounds (6.8 kg). The difference wasn’t statistically significant. Both groups lost a similar amount of weight, and the following also occurred: decreased in both groups, both systolic and diastolic. decreased in the low fat group only. rose in the low carb group, but it fell in the low fat group. went down in both groups, but only the low carb group had decreases in levels. This indicates improved insulin sensitivity. Perceived hunger is lower and weight loss is greater in overweight premenopausal women consuming a low-carbohydrate/high-protein vs high-carbohydrate/low-fat diet., 2005. Twenty-eight females with overweight, who hadn’t yet reached menopause, consumed either a low carb or a low fat diet for 6 weeks. The low fat diet was calorie restricted. Those in the low carb group lost 14.1 pounds (6.4 kg), while those in the low fat group lost 9.3 pounds (4.2 kg). The results were statistically significant. Significantly more weight loss occurred with the low carb diet, and there was also reduced hunger, compared with the low fat diet. Short-term effects of severe dietary carbohydrate-restriction advice in Type 2 diabetes. In this study 102 people with type 2 diabetes received either low carb or low fat diet advice for 3 months. Those in the low fat group were advised to reduce portion sizes. The low carb group lost 7.8 pounds (3.55 kg), while the low fat group lost only 2 pounds (0.92 kg). The difference was statistically significant. The low carb group lost more weight and had greater improvement in their total cholesterol/HDL ratio. There was no difference in triglycerides, blood pressure, or HbA1c (a marker for blood sugar levels) between the groups. The effects of a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet and a low-fat diet on mood, hunger, and other self-reported symptoms. In this study, 119 people with overweight followed either a low carb, ketogenic diet or a calorie restricted low fat diet for 6 months. People in the low carb group lost 28.4 pounds (12.9 kg), while those in the low fat group lost 14.7 pounds (6.7 kg). The low carb group lost almost twice as much weight and experienced less hunger. Comparison of the Atkins, Zone, Ornish, and LEARN diets for change in weight and related risk factors among overweight premenopausal women: the A TO Z Weight Loss Study., 2007. In this study, 311 women who hadn’t experienced menopause and who had either overweight or obesity followed one of four diets: The Atkins group lost the most weight — 10.3 pounds (4.7 kg) — at 12 months, compared with the Ornish group losing 4.9 pounds (2.2 kg), the Zone group losing 3.5 pounds (1.6 kg), and the LEARN group losing 5.7 pounds (2.6 kg). However, the difference wasn’t statistically significant at 12 months. The Atkins group lost the most weight, although the difference wasn’t statistically significant. The Atkins group had the greatest improvements in blood pressure, triglycerides, and HDL (good) cholesterol levels. Those who followed LEARN or Ornish, which are low fat diets, had decreases in LDL (bad) cholesterol at 2 months, but then the effects diminished. Low- and high-carbohydrate weight-loss diets have similar effects on mood but not cognitive performance. Ninety-three people with either overweight or obesity followed either a low carb, high fat diet or a low fat, high carb diet for 8 weeks. Both groups were calorie restricted. The low carb group lost 17.2 pounds (7.8 kg), while the low fat group lost 14.1 pounds (6.4 kg). The difference was statistically significant. The low carb group lost more weight. Both groups had similar improvements in mood, but speed of processing (a measure of cognitive performance) improved further on the low fat diet. A low-carbohydrate diet is more effective in reducing body weight than healthy eating in both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Thirteen people with diabetes and 13 without diabetes followed either a low carb diet or a “healthy eating” diet. This was a calorie restricted, low fat diet recommended by Diabetes UK. The study lasted 3 months. People in the low carb group lost an average of 15.2 pounds (6.9 kg), compared with 4.6 pounds (2.1 kg) in the low fat group. The low carb group lost about three times as much weight as the low fat group. There was no difference in any other marker between groups. The effect of a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet versus a low-glycemic index diet on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Eighty-four individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes followed a low carb, ketogenic diet or a calorie restricted low glycemic diet for 24 weeks. The low carb group lost more weight — 24.4 pounds (11.1 kg) — than the low glycemic group — 15.2 pounds (6.9 kg). People in the low carb group lost significantly more weight than the low glycemic group. In addition: went down by 1.5% in the low carb group, compared to 0.5% in the low glycemic group. increased in the low carb group only, by 5.6 mg/dL. were either reduced or eliminated in 95.2% of the low carb group, compared to 62% in the low glycemic group. improved in both groups, but the difference between groups wasn’t statistically significant. Weight loss with a low-carbohydrate, Mediterranean, or low-fat diet. In this study, 322 people with obesity followed one of three diets: The low carb group lost 10.4 pounds (4.7 kg), the low fat group lost 6.4 pounds (2.9 kg), and the Mediterranean diet group lost 9.7 pounds (4.4 kg). The low carb group lost more weight than the low fat group and had greater improvement in HDL (good) cholesterol and triglycerides. Effects of weight loss from a very-low-carbohydrate diet on endothelial function and markers of cardiovascular disease risk in subjects with abdominal obesity. In this study, 107 individuals with abdominal obesity followed either a low carb or a low fat diet, both with calorie restrictions, for 8 weeks. The low carb group lost 7.9% of their body weight, compared with 6.5% in the low fat group. The low carb group lost more weight. There was also no difference in common markers or risk factors between groups. Metabolic effects of weight loss on a very-low-carbohydrate diet compared with an isocaloric high-carbohydrate diet in abdominally obese subjects., 2008. Eighty-eight people with abdominal obesity followed either a very low carb or a low fat diet for 24 weeks. Both diets were calorie restricted. People in the low carb group lost an average of 26.2 pounds (11.9 kg), while those in the low fat group lost 22.3 pounds (10.1 kg). However, the difference wasn’t statistically significant. Both diets led to similar weight loss results and improvements in triglycerides, HDL (good) cholesterol, C-reactive protein, insulin, insulin sensitivity, and blood pressure. Total and LDL (bad) cholesterol improved in the low fat group only. Carbohydrate restriction has a more favorable impact on the metabolic syndrome than a low fat diet. Forty people with high risk factors for cardiovascular disease followed either a low carb or a low fat diet for 12 weeks, both with calorie restrictions. The low carb group lost 22.3 pounds (10.1 kg), while the low fat group lost 11.5 pounds (5.2 kg). People in the low carb group lost almost twice as much weight as those in the low fat group, although their calorie intake was the same. fell by 107 mg/dL on the low carb diet, but it only fell 36 mg/dL on the low fat diet. rose by 4 mg/dL on the low carb diet, but it fell by 1 mg/dL on the low fat diet. went down by 11 points on the low carb diet, but it only went down 2 points on the low fat diet. increased on the low carb diet, but it stayed the same on the low fat diet. On the low carb diet, the LDL particles partly shifted from small to large, which is good. However, on the low fat diet, they partially shifted from large to small, which is less healthy. Long-term effects of a very-low-carbohydrate weight loss diet compared with an isocaloric low-fat diet after 12 months. In this study, 118 individuals with abdominal obesity followed either a low carb or a low fat diet for 1 year. Both diets were calorie restricted. People in the low carb group lost 32 pounds (14.5 kg), while those in the low fat group lost 25.3 pounds (11.5 kg). The difference wasn’t statistically significant. The low carb group experienced greater decreases in triglycerides and greater increases in both HDL (good) and LDL (bad) cholesterol, compared with the low fat group. Lack of suppression of circulating free fatty acids and hypercholesterolemia during weight loss on a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet. Thirty-two adults with obesity followed either a low carb or a calorie restricted, low fat diet for 6 weeks. The low carb group lost 13.7 pounds (6.2 kg), while the low fat group lost 13.2 pounds (6.0 kg). The difference wasn’t statistically significant. The low carb group saw a greater decrease in triglycerides (43.6 mg/dL) than the low fat group (26.9 mg/dL). Both LDL (bad) and HDL (good) cholesterol decreased in the low fat group only. Efficacy and safety of a high protein, low carbohydrate diet for weight loss in severely obese adolescents. Forty-six individuals followed either a low carb or a low fat diet for 36 weeks. People in the low fat group restricted their calorie intake. Those in the low carb group had a greater decrease in body mass index (BMI) Z-scores than the low fat group, but weight loss didn’t differ between groups. The low carb group had a greater reduction in BMI Z-scores, but weight loss was similar between groups. Various biomarkers improved in both groups, but there was no significant difference between them. In type 2 diabetes, randomization to advice to follow a low-carbohydrate diet transiently improves glycaemic control compared with advice to follow a low-fat diet producing a similar weight loss. Sixty-one individuals with type 2 diabetes followed either a low carb or a low fat diet for 2 years, both with calorie restrictions. Those in the low carb group lost 6.8 pounds (3.1 kg), while those in the low fat group lost 7.9 pounds (3.6 kg). The difference wasn’t statistically significant. There was no difference in weight loss or common risk factors between groups. There was a significant improvement in glycemic control at 6 months for the low carb group. However, compliance was poor, and the effects diminished at 24 months as people started to consume more carbs. The following graph shows how weight loss compared between the 23 studies. People lost weight in 21 of the studies. Most of the studies found a significant difference in weight loss, in favor of the low carb diet. The low carb groups often lost 2–3 times as much weight as the low fat groups. In a few instances, there was no significant difference. In most cases, the low fat groups followed calorie restrictions, while the low carb groups ate as many calories as they wanted. When both groups restricted calories, the low carb dieters still lost more weight (, , ), although it wasn’t always significant (, , ). In only one study, the low fat group lost more weight (), but the difference was small— 1.1 pound (0.5 kg) — and not statistically significant. In several of the studies, weight loss was greatest in the beginning. Then people started regaining the weight over time as they abandoned the diet. The low carb diets were more effective in reducing abdominal fat, a type of fat that researchers have linked to various health conditions. (, , ). Two reasons why low carb diets may be more effective for weight loss are: These factors can help reduce a person’s calorie intake. You can read more about this diet works here: Why do Low Carb Diets Work? The Mechanism Explained. Low carb diets generally don’t appear to raise total and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. Low fat diets can lower total and LDL (bad) cholesterol, but this is usually only temporary. After 6–12 months, the difference isn’t usually statistically significant. Some healthcare providers have reported that low carb diets can cause LDL (bad) cholesterol and other lipid markers to increase in a few people. However, the authors of the above studies didn’t note these adverse effects. The studies that looked at advanced lipid markers (, ) only showed improvements. One way to raise HDL (good) cholesterol levels is to eat more . For this reason, it’s not surprising to see that low carb diets, being higher in fat, are more likely to raise HDL (good) cholesterol than low fat diets. Higher HDL (good) levels may help improve metabolic health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. People with metabolic syndrome often have low HDL (good) levels. Eighteen of the 23 studies reported changes in HDL (good) cholesterol levels. Low carb diets generally raise HDL (good) levels, but these levels appear to change less on low fat diets. In some cases, they go down. Triglycerides are an important cardiovascular risk factor and other key symptoms of metabolic syndrome. The best way to reduce triglycerides is to eat fewer carbohydrates, and especially eat less . Nineteen of 23 studies reported changes in blood triglyceride levels. Both low carb and low fat diets can help reduce triglycerides, but the effect is stronger in the low carb groups. People without diabetes saw their blood sugar and insulin levels improve on both the low carb and low fat diets. The difference between the groups was usually small. Three studies compared how the diets affected people with type 2 diabetes. Only one study managed to reduce carbohydrates sufficiently. In this study various improvements occurred, including a drastic fall in HbA1c, a marker for blood sugar levels (). In addition, over 90% of the individuals in the low carb group managed to reduce or eliminate their diabetes medications. However, the difference was small or nonexistent in the other two studies, because compliance was poor. The participants ended up eating around 30% of their calories as carbs. (, ). When measured, blood pressure tended to decrease on both types of diet. A common problem in weight loss studies is that people often abandon the diet before the study is complete. Nineteen of the 23 studies reported the number of people who completed the study. The average percentage of people who followed the diet throughout was: This suggests that a low carb diet is no more difficult to than other types of diet. The reason may be that low carb diets appear to reduce hunger (, ), and participants can eat until they’re full. Low fat diets, meanwhile, are often calorie restricted. The person needs to weigh their food and count calories, which can be onerous. Individuals also lose more weight, and lose it , on a low carb diet. This may improve their motivation to continue the diet. The participants in these studies didn’t report any serious adverse effects due to either diet. Overall, the low carb diet appears to be well tolerated and safe. Many people have traditionally opted for a low fat diet and counting calories to lose weight. However, the findings of these studies suggest that a low carb diet may be just as effective, and perhaps more so, than a low fat diet. — — Diet and exercise may be key components of weight loss for women, but many other factors play a role.

cec3c895-a496-4b61-ac3f-bb8036d6ad57,"Insulin dose lowering with alternative remedies and nutritional supplements, natural remedy July 2 2017 by Insulin, a released from the pancreas, is the primary substance responsible for maintaining appropriate levels. Insulin allows glucose to be transported into cells so that they can produce or store the glucose until it's needed. The rise in blood sugar levels after eating or drinking stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin, preventing a greater rise in blood sugar levels and causing them to fall gradually. Because muscles use glucose for energy, blood sugar levels fall during physical activity. See for a natural way to control this condition and lower the required dosage of insulin for optimal control. There are many medications that are prescribed to patients with high blood sugar levels including Front Biosci (Elite Ed). 2015. Natural supplements for improving insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Type 2 diabetes is a common metabolic disorder characterized by resistance to the actions of insulin to stimulate skeletal muscle glucose disposal. In light of the staggering financial/human cost of type 2 diabetes, there is considerable need for safe and effective agents that can be used to prevent and/or adjunctively treat the disease. Available evidence suggests that a number of natural supplements, including cinnamon, biotin, fenugreek, ginseng, , and alpha-lipoic acid, have the potential to reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes in the large at-risk population. The evidence also suggests that, when used adjunctively, these natural products are likely to help clinicians achieve optimal glycemic control, improve long-term prognosis, and/or minimize the need for insulin therapy in type 2 diabetics. The first inhalable version of insulin won federal approval, giving millions of adult diabetics an alternative to some of the regular injections they now endure. The Food and Drug Administration said the Inc. insulin, to be marketed as “Exubera,” is the first new way of delivering insulin since the discovery of the hormone in the 1920s. Pfizer jointly developed the drug and dispenser with Sanofi-Aventis and Nektar Therapeutics. Inhalable Insulin -  Is it cost effective? Pfizer Inc's inhaled insulin product Exubera should not be prescribed on Britain's state health service, the country's cost-effectiveness watchdog, NICE, recommended in 2006. Pfizer, the world's biggest pharmaceuticals group, said the preliminary opinion from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) was ""perverse and short-sighted"". Exubera won marketing approval in both Europe and the United States in January, 2006 as a treatment for patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. But NICE -- whose function is to assess whether treatments are cost effective for the National Health Service -- said it did not offer sufficient benefits over conventional insulin injections to be worth the money. It estimated the cost of using Exubera to be 1,102 pounds ($1,931) per patient a year. That might be justified for people with severe fear of injections, NICE's appraisal committee said, but there was no way of identifying those who would gain sufficient benefit for the technology to be cost effective. Insulin resistance and how to reduce it, supplements, vitamins, herbal remedies Insulin resistance can be linked to diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol and , cardiovascular disease and other abnormalities. These abnormalities constitute the insulin resistance syndrome. Because insulin resistance usually develops long before these diseases appear, identifying and treating patients with insulin resistance has potentially great preventive value.      Insulin resistance is a condition in which tissues such as fat and muscle in the body respond poorly to insulin, the major hormone required for glucose metabolism. This condition is present in pre-diabetic states and continues when a person develops diabetes. Research suggests that supplementation with chromium picolinate may help improve insulin resistance. However diet, weight loss, and exercise are the options to reduce insulin resistance.      Insulin resistance is a state in which a given concentration of insulin produces a less-than-expected biological effect. Insulin resistance has also been arbitrarily defined as the requirement of 200 or more units of insulin per day to attain glycemic control and to prevent ketosis. Amino Acids. 2016. Physiological and therapeutic effects of carnosine on cardiometabolic risk and disease. Obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are the most common preventable causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is a dipeptide with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-glycation, anti-ischaemic and chelating roles and is available as an over-the-counter food supplement. Animal evidence suggests that carnosine may offer many promising therapeutic benefits for multiple chronic diseases due to these properties. Carnosine, traditionally used in exercise physiology to increase exercise performance, has potential preventative and therapeutic benefits in obesity, insulin resistance, T2DM and diabetic microvascular and macrovascular complications (CVD and stroke) as well as number of neurological and mental health conditions. High-calorie American diet causes insulin resistance within days. Chronic diseases have overtaken acute diseases, such as infections, as the major cause of premature mortality worldwide. Diabetes mellitus, a chronic degenerative metabolic disease, has reached epidemic proportions in the past 30 years, with worldwide prevalence approaching 400 million people. Men aged 20 to 32 years with acne are more likely to have insulin resistance and to have higher fasting plasma glucose levels than age-matched controls. Just one sleepless night can hamper the body's ability to use insulin to process sugar in the bloodstream. I may be no coincidence that while sleep duration has shortened in western societies in the past decade there has also been an increase in cases of insulin resistance and adult-onset diabetes. This is the advantage of getting some physical activity during the day so that you can get a deeper rest overnight. Individuals with high stress and high hostility levels have an increased risk of developing insulin resistance, which occurs when the body's response to insulin begins to slow down and blood sugar levels begin to rise. People with insulin resistance have a high risk of developing diabetes. Insulin resistance is associated with stress and certain personality factors, including hostility. Symptoms The syndromes of insulin resistance actually have a broad clinical spectrum, which includes obesity, glucose intolerance, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome X. Many of these disorders are associated with various endocrine, metabolic, and genetic conditions. These insulin resistance syndromes may also be associated with immunological diseases. Syndrome X, the state of insulin resistance also known as metabolic or dysmetabolic syndrome, has drawn the greatest attention because of the public health importance. In an effort to clinically identify patients with insulin resistance, various organizations have developed diagnostic criteria. The most commonly used criteria in the United States are those of the National Cholesterol Education Program / Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP/ATP III). Green Tea effect Randomized controlled trial for an effect of green tea consumption on insulin resistance and inflammation markers. J Nutr Sci Vitaminol. 2005. Department of Nutritional Sciences, School of Food and Nutritional Sciences, University of Shizuoka, 52-1 Yada, Shizuoka, Japan To study the effects of the intake of green tea and polyphenols, which are a component of green tea, on insulin resistance and systemic inflammation, a randomized controlled trial was conducted on 66 patients aged 32-73 y (53 males and 13 females) with borderline diabetes or diabetes. Subjects in the intervention group were asked to take a packet of green tea extracts/powder containing 544 mg polyphenols (456 mg catechins) daily, which was a dose that could be taken without difficulty, and were asked to divide the green tea extracts/powder in a packet into 3 or 4 fractions dissolved in hot water everyday and to take a fraction after every meal or snack for 2 mo, in addition to daily food intake. In conclusion, the daily supplementary intake of 500 mg green tea polyphenols did not have clear effects on blood glucose level, Hb A1c level, insulin resistance or inflammation markers. The positive correlation between the level of polyphenol intake and insulin level warrants further studies on the effect of green tea on insulin resistance. An allergic reaction develops in 2% of patients that use insulin. This ranges in severity from erythema and pruritus to life-threatening . Allergic reactions to insulin usually occur within a few hours after an injection and are usually due to a local or systemic type I IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Despite considerable research into the immunogenicity of insulin, this has not yet been clarified completely and allergic reactions to insulin still occur. A blood test for anti-insulin antibodies and intradermal skin tests are indicated. There are several options available for the treatment of insulin allergy and each patient should be evaluated individually. Digestion of food in the intestines converts the compacted storage carbohydrates, starch and glycogen, to glucose. After each meal, a flux of glucose (more than 200 g) passes through the blood pool (4-6 g) in a short period of 2 hours, keeping its concentration ideally in the range of 80-120 mg/100 mL. Tissue-specific glucose transporters (GLUTs) aid in the distribution of glucose to all tissues. The balance glucose after meeting the immediate energy needs is converted into glycogen and stored in liver (up to 100 g) and skeletal muscle (up to 300 g) for later use. High blood glucose gives the signal for increased release of insulin from pancreas. Insulin binds to insulin receptor on the plasma membrane and activates its autophosphorylation. This initiates the post-insulin-receptor signal cascade that accelerates synthesis of glycogen and triglyceride. A major action of insulin is to inhibit gluconeogensis in the liver decreasing glucose output into blood. Cases with failed control of blood glucose have alarmingly increased in the past few decades coinciding with changed life-styles and large scale food processing. Appetite and satiety are subject to complex regulation, with neuroendocrine mechanisms playing an important role. The central nervous system is attracting increasing attention as a target tissue for many hormones such as leptin, PYY3-36, ghrelin, glucagon-like-peptide 1 and many others. Among its many well-known functions, insulin is also a potent appetite suppressing hormone, and insulin receptors are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system. I was directed to your site by one of my patients, and I noticed that someone had asked a question regarding Insulin and Alzheimer's. FYI, there is a growing body of evidence for diabetes as a risk factor for AD. Furthermore, it is known that beta amyloid is degraded by the insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) in the brain, and in those with insulin-resistant diabetes, this means that the excess insulin is preferentially degraded, leaving the beta amyloid to precipitate and form plaques even earlier than one might expect to see them otherwise. Just thought that info might be helpful. The information came from data presented by Dr. Richard Mayeux of Columbia University at the 9th International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders, Philadelphia, July 2004. Sincerely, Amanda G. Smith, MD Assistant Director, USF Suncoast Alzheimer's and Gerontology Center, Tampa, FL 33617 suncoastalzheimers dotcom I am on insulin and have heard good things about acid. Can I take insulin and lipoic acid together?    We are not in a position to advise you on an individual basis, but as a general rule, if the lipoic dosage is low, such as 20 mg or less, then there should be no problems using it with your insulin. If you intend to take more lipoic, you should be monitored by your health care provider since blood sugar may be influenced by lipoic acid. Is a good supplement for a diabetic on insulin to take?    No general statements can be made that apply to everyone, but using 30 mg of CoQ10 a few times a week should be fine for most people, including those on insulin, but your doctor needs to approve. I am curious what supplements are recommended to mitigate insulin insensitivity. I hear that cinnamin tablets are good?     Cinnamon is a good option, so is alpha lipoic acid, banaba, bitter melon extract. 8th Annual World Congress on Insulin Resistance, Diabetes & Cardiovasular Disease (WCIR) Exploring of new frontiers in metabolism - tomorrow's clinical science today, 2010 Hilton Universal City Los Angeles, California Register NOW EARLY BIRD DISCOUNTCall for Abstracts Topics: Clinical topics may include any aspect of insulin resistance and its relationship to the causation and/or natural history of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, gonadal dysfunction such as PCOS, gestational diabetes, other endocrine abnormality, inflammation, endothelial or other vascular dysfunction, liver disease (NAFLD), malignancy, and sleep apnea and other sleep disorders in childhood, adolescence and adulthood.All abstracts will be published in Diabetes & Vascular Disease Research.

Medical Author: Medical Editor: When to Seek Medical Care for High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) Questions to Ask Your Doctor about High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) Self-Care at Home for High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) Support Groups and Counseling for High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) Doctor's Notes on High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) Symptoms High blood sugar needs to be monitored through blood tests. Whenever the glucose () level in one's blood rises high temporarily, this condition is known as hyperglycemia. The opposite condition, , is called . Glucose comes from most foods, and the body uses other chemicals to create glucose in the and muscles. The blood carries glucose () to all the cells in the body. To carry glucose into the cells as an energy supply, cells need help from insulin. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas, an organ near the stomach. The pancreas releases insulin into the blood, based upon the blood level. Insulin helps move glucose from digested food into cells. Sometimes, the body stops making insulin (as in ), or the insulin does not work properly (as in ). In diabetic patients, glucose does not enter the cells sufficiently, thus staying in the blood and creating high blood sugar levels. Blood sugar levels can be measured in seconds by using a blood glucose meter, also known as a glucometer. A tiny drop of blood from the finger or forearm is placed on a test strip and inserted into the glucometer. The blood sugar (or glucose) level is displayed digitally within seconds. Blood glucose levels vary widely throughout the day and night in people with . Ideally, blood glucose levels range from 90 to 130 mg/dL before meals, and below 180 mg/dL within 1 to 2 hours after a meal. Adolescents and adults with strive to keep their blood sugar levels within a controlled range, usually 80-150 mg/dL before meals. Doctors and health educators guide each patient to determine their optimal range of blood glucose control. When blood sugar levels remain high for several hours, and more serious complications can develop. Moreover, even mild hyperglycemia (a fasting blood sugar over 109 mg/dL in adolescents/adults or over 100 mg/dL in children before ) - when unrecognized or inadequately treated for several years - can damage multiple tissues in the brain, kidneys, and arteries. When hyperglycemia is associated with the presence of ketones in the urine, this state demands immediate medical attention. When blood sugar levels rise and stay high (over 165 mg/dL consistently) for days to weeks, diabetes should be suspected and treatment initiated. High blood sugar level fluctations occur daily in people with diabetes. It is important to control blood sugar levels through , , and medication (if prescribed), to know the symptoms of elevated blood sugar, and to seek treatment, when necessary. is one of several persistent conditions causing high blood sugar levels. For someone with diabetes, hyperglycemia has many possible causes: Eating food containing too many carbohydrates, a form of sugar. The body of a person with diabetes cannot process high levels of carbohydrates fast enough to convert it into energy. Blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes can rise within hours after eating. Not producing enough insulin action (either by injection of insulin or taking medicine which stimulates the pancreas to make more insulin). People with diabetes must control blood sugar by a combination of dietary discretion, taking medication, and physical activity. When food, , and insulin are not balanced, blood sugar levels rise. Emotions can play a role in causing hyperglycemia, but should not be used as an excuse for poor control of diabetes. Daily exercise is a critical contributor to regulating blood sugar levels. With illness, blood sugar levels tend to rise quickly over several hours. Certain drugs, especially , can affect blood sugar levels. ______________ is another term for type 2 diabetes. A high blood sugar level itself is a symptom of diabetes. However, an individual experiencing hyperglycemia may have no symptoms at all. If hyperglycemia persists for several hours and leads to , other symptoms may develop, such as: Left untreated, hyperglycemia can lead to a condition called ketoacidosis, also known as (DKA) or diabetic coma. This occurs because the body has insufficient insulin to process glucose into fuel, so the body breaks down to use for energy. When the body breaks down fat, ketones are produced as by-products. Some ketones are eliminated via the urine, but not all. Until the patient is rehydrated, and adequate insulin action is restored, ketones remain in the blood. Ketones in the blood cause , , , or . Ketoacidosis is life-threatening and demands immediate treatment. When to Seek Medical Care for High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) If hyperglycemia persists for at least two or three days, or if ketones appear in the urine, call a doctor. Generally, people with diabetes should test their blood sugar levels at least four times a day: before meals and at bedtime (or following the schedule advised by the prescribed individual diabetes care plan). The urine should be checked for ketones any time the blood sugar level is over 250 mg/dL. When blood sugar stays high despite following a diabetic diet and plan of care, call the nurse, diabetes health educator, or physician for adjustments in the diet. If blood sugars are high because of illness, check for ketones and contact a health professional. Blood sugar levels that stay above 160 mg/dL for longer than a week Ketoacidosis or diabetic coma is a medical emergency. Call 911 for emergency transport to a hospital or similar emergency center. Questions to Ask Your Doctor about High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) Please ask your health care professional about the following: How to treat a high blood sugar level when it occurs in you, a family member, or coworkers How to prevent the blood sugar level from becoming too high How to contact the medical staff during an emergency What emergency supplies to carry to treat high blood sugar Additional educational materials regarding high blood sugar Self-Care at Home for High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) Check blood sugar levels with a blood glucose meter. If blood sugar level is higher than normal, but there are no symptoms, continue routine care such as: Take a blood sugar reading every four hours (write it down) until levels are back to normal. Check urine for ketones (all patients with diabetes) and write down the readings. Follow sick day rules as defined in your diabetes care plan until ketones disappear from urine. A simple way to lower high blood sugar is to exercise. But if blood glucose levels are higher than 240 mg/dL, first check the urine for ketones. If ketones are present, do not exercise. The risk is that blood sugar levels will rise even higher. Talk with the doctor about a safe way to lower blood glucose levels in this situation. Work with a diabetes health educator or registered dietitian to develop a workable diet plan to manage diabetes. If diet and exercise are not keeping blood sugar levels in the normal range, the doctor may adjust the amount, timing, or type of medications or insulin. High blood sugars may be a sign that the person with diabetes needs to take medication, to change medications, or to change the way it is given (for example, additional insulin would be given, or a switch might be made from oral medication to injected medication). Other illnesses need to be diagnosed and treated if an illness is causing high blood sugar levels. Infection or illness may need to be treated in the hospital, where health professionals can adjust the plan of care. A number of medications are available to help control blood sugar levels for people with . Insulin is also prescribed  for people with diabetes (all with and many with type 2 diabetes). Patients with diabetes should have a performed every three months. Similar to a report card, this test provides feedback about the overall sugar levels for the past three months. People with diabetes should have a level less than 7% at each clinical visit. Levels above 7% usually result from a person's consistent failure to: Work with a certified diabetes educator. This person will have a CDE certification and may work in a diabetes education center or hospital. Check blood sugar as directed by a CDE and doctor or nurse. Know the symptoms and act quickly before blood sugars get out of control. Follow a diabetes diet plan. Adjust the plan as needed. Take as directed by your healthcare professional. Support Groups and Counseling for High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) You or family members may wish to join a support group with other people to share your experiences. The American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation are both excellent resources. Your health care provider will have information about local groups in your area.

Since all of them claim to be superior, it can be hard to know which ones are worth trying. The truth is that no one diet is best for everyone — and what works for you may not work for someone else. This article reviews the 9 most popular weight loss diets and the science behind them. The claims that you should eat the same foods that your hunter-gatherer ancestors ate before agriculture developed. The theory is that most modern diseases can be linked to the Western diet and the consumption of grains, dairy, and processed foods. While it’s debatable whether this diet really provides the same foods your ancestors ate, it is linked to several impressive health benefits. The paleo diet emphasizes whole foods, lean protein, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds, while discouraging processed foods, sugar, dairy, and grains. Some more flexible versions of the paleo diet also allow for dairy like cheese and butter, as well as tubers like potatoes and sweet potatoes. have shown that the paleo diet can lead to significant weight loss and reduced waist size (, , , ). In studies, paleo dieters automatically eat much fewer carbs, more protein, and 300–900 fewer calories per day (, , , ). The diet seems effective at reducing risk factors for heart disease, such as cholesterol, blood sugar, blood triglycerides, and blood pressure (, , ). The paleo diet eliminates whole grains, legumes, and dairy, which are healthy and nutritious. The paleo diet emphasizes whole foods but bans grains and dairy. Its multiple health benefits include weight loss. The restricts all animal products for ethical, environmental, or health reasons. Veganism is also associated with resistance to animal exploitation and cruelty. Veganism is the strictest form of vegetarianism. In addition to eliminating meat, it eliminates dairy, eggs, and animal-derived products, such as gelatin, honey, albumin, whey, casein, and some forms of vitamin D3. A vegan diet seems to be very effective at helping people lose weight — often without counting calories — because its very low fat and high fiber content may make you feel fuller for longer. Vegan diets are consistently linked to lower body weight and body mass index (BMI) compared to other diets (, , , , ). One 18-week study showed that people on a vegan diet lost 9.3 pounds (4.2 kg) more than those on a control diet. The vegan group was allowed to eat until fullness, but the control group had to restrict calories (). However, calorie for calorie, vegan diets are not more effective for weight loss than other diets (). Weight loss on vegan diets is primarily associated with reduced calorie intake. Plant-based diets are linked to a reduced risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and premature death (, , , , ). Limiting processed meat may also reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s disease and dying from heart disease or cancer (, , , , ). Because vegan diets eliminate animal foods completely, they may be , including vitamin B12, vitamin D, iodine, iron, calcium, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids (, , , , ). Vegan diets exclude all animal products. They may cause weight loss due to lower calorie intake while reducing your risk of several diseases. have been popular for decades — especially for weight loss. There are several types of low-carb diets, but all involve limiting carb intake to 20–150 grams per day. The primary aim of the diet is to force your body to use more fats for fuel instead of using carbs as a main source of energy. Low-carb diets emphasize unlimited amounts of protein and fat while severely limiting your carb intake. When carb intake is very low, fatty acids are moved into your blood and transported to your liver, where some of them are turned into ketones. Your body can then use fatty acids and ketones in the absence of carbs as its primary energy source. Numerous studies indicate that low-carb diets are extremely helpful for weight loss, especially in overweight and obese individuals (, , , , ). They seem to be very effective at reducing dangerous belly fat, which can become lodged around your organs (, ). People on very low-carb diets commonly reach a state called . Many studies note that ketogenic diets lead to more than twice the weight loss than a low-fat, calorie-restricted diet (, , , ). Low-carb diets tend to reduce your appetite and make you feel less hungry, leading to an automatic reduction in calorie intake (, ). Furthermore, low-carb diets may benefit many major disease risk factors, such as blood triglycerides, cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, insulin levels, and blood pressure (, , , , ). Low-carb diets do not suit everyone. Some feel great on them while others feel miserable. Some people may experience an increase in “bad” LDL cholesterol (). In extremely rare cases, very low-carb diets can cause a serious condition called nondiabetic ketoacidosis. This condition seems to be more common in lactating women and can be fatal if left untreated (, , , ). However, low-carb diets are safe for the majority of people. Low-carb diets severely limit carb intake and push your body to use fat for fuel. They aid weight loss and are linked to many other health benefits. is a high-protein, low-carb weight loss diet split into four phases — two weight loss phases and two maintenance phases. How long you stay in each phase depends on how much weight you need to lose. Each phase has its own dietary pattern. The weight loss phases are primarily based on eating unlimited high-protein foods and mandatory oat bran. The other phases involve adding non-starchy vegetables followed by some carbs and fat. Later on, there will be fewer and fewer pure protein days to maintain your new weight. In one study, women following the Dukan diet ate about 1,000 calories and 100 grams of protein per day and lost an average of 33 pounds (15 kg) in 8–10 weeks (). Also, many other studies show that high-protein, low-carb diets may have major weight loss benefits (, , , ). These include a , a decrease in the hunger hormone ghrelin and an increase in several fullness hormones (, , , ). Apart from weight loss, there are no recorded benefits of the Dukan diet in scientific literature. There is very little quality research available on the Dukan diet. The Dukan diet limits both fat and carbs — a strategy not based on science. On the contrary, consuming fat as part of a high-protein diet seems to increase metabolic rate compared to both low-carb and low-fat diets (). What’s more, fast weight loss achieved by severe calorie restriction tends to cause significant muscle loss (). The loss of muscle mass and severe calorie restriction may also cause your body to conserve energy, making it very easy to regain the weight after losing it (, , , ). The Dukan diet has not been tested in quality human studies. The diet may cause weight loss, but it also may slow down your metabolism and make you lose muscle mass along with fat mass. An restricts your consumption of fat to under 10% of daily calories. Generally, a low-fat diet provides around 30% of its calories as fat. Studies reveal that this diet is ineffective for weight loss in the long term. Proponents of the ultra-low-fat diet claim that traditional low-fat diets are not low enough in fat and that fat intake needs to stay under 10% of total calories to produce health benefits and weight loss. An ultra-low-fat diet contains 10% or fewer calories from fat. The diet is mostly plant-based and has a limited intake of animal products (). Therefore, it’s generally very high in carbs — around 80% of calories — and low in protein — at 10% of calories. This diet has proven very successful for weight loss among obese individuals. In one study, obese individuals lost an average of 140 pounds (63 kg) on an ultra-low-fat diet (). Another 8-week study with a diet containing 7–14% fat showed an average weight loss of 14.8 pounds (6.7 kg) (). Studies suggest that ultra-low-fat diets can improve several risk factors for heart disease, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and markers of (, , , , , ). Surprisingly, this high-carb, low-fat diet can also lead to significant improvements in type 2 diabetes (, , , ). Furthermore, it may slow the progression of multiple sclerosis — an autoimmune disease that affects your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves in the eyes (, ). The fat restriction may cause long-term problems, as fat plays many important roles in your body. These include helping build cell membranes and hormones, as well as helping your body absorb fat-soluble vitamins. Moreover, an ultra-low-fat diet limits intake of many healthy foods, lacks variety, and is extremely hard to stick to. An ultra-low-fat diet contains less than 10% of its calories from fat. It can cause significant weight loss and may also have impressive benefits for heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. The is the most well-known low-carb weight loss diet. Its proponents insist that you can lose weight by eating as much protein and fat as you like, as long as you avoid carbs. The main reason why low-carb diets are so effective for weight loss is that they reduce your appetite. This causes you to eat fewer calories without having to think about it (, ). The Atkins diet is split into four phases. It starts with an induction phase, during which you eat under 20 grams of carbs per day for two weeks. The other phases involve slowly reintroducing healthy carbs back into your diet as you approach your goal weight. The Atkins diet has been studied extensively and found to lead to faster weight loss than low-fat diets (, ). Other studies note that low-carb diets are very helpful for weight loss. They are especially successful in , the most dangerous fat that lodges itself in your abdominal cavity (, , , , , , ). Numerous studies show that low-carb diets, like the Atkins diet, may reduce many risk factors for disease, including blood triglycerides, cholesterol, blood sugar, insulin, and blood pressure (, , , , ). Compared to other weight loss diets, low-carb diets also better improve blood sugar, “good” HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and other health markers (, ). As do other very low-carb diets, the Atkins diet is safe and healthy for most people but may cause problems in rare cases. The Atkins diet is a low-carb weight loss diet. It’s effective for weight loss but also has benefits for many other disease risk factors. The is an extreme diet meant to cause very fast weight loss of up to 1–2 pounds (0.45–1 kg) per day. Its proponents claim that it boosts metabolism and fat loss without inducing hunger (, ). HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is a hormone present at high levels during early pregnancy. It tells a woman’s body it’s pregnant and maintains the production of hormones that are important for fetal development. It has also been used to treat fertility issues (). The diet is split into three phases. During the first phase, you begin taking HCG supplements. During the second phase, you follow an ultra-low-calorie diet of only 500 calories per day, along with HCG supplement drops, pellets, injections, or sprays. The weight loss phase is prescribed for 3–6 weeks at a time. In the third phase, you stop taking HCG and slowly increase your food intake. The HCG diet does cause weight loss, but multiple studies conclude that the weight loss is due to the ultra-low-calorie diet alone — not the HCG hormone (, , , ). Aside from weight loss, there are no documented benefits of the HCG diet. Like most other ultra-low-calorie diets, the HCG diet may cause muscle loss, which results in a reduced ability to burn calories (). Such severe calorie restriction further reduces the number of calories your body burns. This is because your body thinks it’s and therefore attempts to preserve energy (). In addition, most HCG products on the market are scams and don’t contain any HCG. Only injections are able to raise blood levels of this hormone. Moreover, the diet has many side effects, including headaches, fatigue, and depression. There is also one report of a woman developing blood clots, most likely caused by the diet (). The FDA disapproves of this diet, labeling it dangerous, illegal, and fraudulent (). The HCG diet is a rapid weight loss diet. It’s not based on any scientific evidence and may reduce metabolic rate and cause muscle loss, headaches, fatigue, and depression. is a low-glycemic load diet that has you limit carbs to 35–45% of daily calories and protein and fat to 30% each (). It recommends eating only carbs with a low glycemic index (GI). The GI of a food is an estimate of how much it raises your blood glucose levels after consumption. The Zone Diet was initially developed to reduce diet-induced inflammation, cause weight loss, and reduce your risk of chronic diseases (). The Zone Diet recommends balancing each meal with 1/3 protein, 2/3 colorful fruits and veggies, and a dash of fat — namely monounsaturated oil, such as olive oil, avocado, or almonds. It also limits high-GI carbs, such as bananas, rice, and potatoes. Studies on low-GI diets are rather inconsistent. While some say that the diet promotes weight loss and reduces appetite, others show very little weight loss compared to other diets (, , , ). The greatest benefit of this diet is a reduction in risk factors for heart disease, such as reduced cholesterol and triglycerides (, , , , ). One study suggests that the Zone Diet may improve blood sugar control, reduce waist circumference, and lower chronic inflammation in overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes (). One of the few drawbacks of this diet is that it limits the consumption of some healthy carb sources, such as and potatoes. The Zone Diet is a low-GI diet. Studies on its weight loss benefits are inconsistent, but the diet improves many important health markers and reduces your risk of heart disease. cycles your body between periods of fasting and eating. Rather than restricting the foods you eat, it controls when you eat them. Thus, it can be seen as more of an eating pattern than a diet. The to do intermittent fasting are: Involves skipping breakfast and restricting your daily eating period to eight hours, subsequently fasting for the remaining 16 hours of the day. Involves 24-hour fasts once or twice per week on non-consecutive days. On two non-consecutive days of the week, you restrict your intake to 500–600 calories. You do not restrict intake on the five remaining days. Eat small amounts of raw fruits and vegetables during the day and one huge meal at night. Intermittent fasting is commonly used for weight loss because it leads to relatively easy calorie restriction. It can make you eat fewer calories overall — as long as you don’t overcompensate by eating much more during the eating periods. Intermittent fasting is generally very successful for weight loss. It has been shown to cause weight loss of 3–8% over a period of 3–24 weeks, which is a lot compared to most weight loss diets (, ). In addition to causing less muscle loss than standard calorie restriction, it may increase your metabolic rate by 3.6–14% in the short term (, , , ). Intermittent fasting may reduce markers of inflammation, cholesterol levels, blood triglycerides, and blood sugar levels (, , , ). Furthermore, intermittent fasting has been linked to increased levels of human growth hormone (HGH), improved insulin sensitivity, improved cellular repair, and altered gene expressions (, , , , ). Animal studies also suggest that it may help new brain cells grow, lengthen lifespan, and protect against Alzheimer’s disease and cancer (, , , ). Although intermittent fasting is safe for well-nourished and healthy people, it does not suit everyone. Some studies note that it’s as it is for men (, ). In addition, some people should avoid fasting, including those sensitive to drops in blood sugar levels, pregnant women, breastfeeding moms, teenagers, children, and people who are malnourished, underweight, or nutrient deficient. Intermittent fasting lets your body cycle between fasting and eating. It is very effective for weight loss and has been linked to numerous health benefits. Different diets work for different people, and you should pick one that suits your lifestyle and tastes. The best diet for you is the one that you can stick to in the long term.

The problem is that the term “sugar” is used as a blanket term to describe compounds that have drastically different biological effects in your body, which causes confusion. Whole carbohydrates from plant foods are extremely beneficial to your health and provide “natural sugars,” which metabolize to glucose for your brain, liver, and muscles. On the other hand, “refined sugars” are for type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases that negatively affect your overall health. Unlike , which is an autoimmune condition, , and its precursor condition prediabetes, are caused by , the accumulation of excess fat in tissues that are not designed to store large quantities of fat. The type of sugar you eat (natural vs. refined) can influence your level of insulin resistance, which means that the correct question to ask is: “Which sugars cause insulin resistance and which sugars reverse insulin resistance?” In this article, we’ll clear up some of the sugar misunderstandings and give you some new terms to use that will clear up the confusion about sugar. Then we’ll explain how each of these new concepts affects your diet and overall health, along with some simple, effective strategies to prevent and reverse type 2 diabetes. Changing the Sugar Conversation: Your New Key Definitions Quick Myth Check — What About Low-Carb Diets? Aren’t They Popular Because All Carbs are Bad? Refined Sugars, Obesity, Diabetes, and How They Relate Other Factors That Can Cause or Contribute to Diabetes How to Fight Back Against Diabetes and Insulin Resistance Changing the Sugar Conversation: Your New Key Definitions The term “natural sugars” refers to the carbohydrate chains found in whole foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. They can still be sweet, but their chemical structure is very different to that of refined sugars. Natural sugars are sometimes called “complex carbohydrates,” because they are long-chain molecules that take time to digest, cut, and absorb. As a result, natural sugars take a longer time for your body to process, resulting in a more sustained release of energy over time. Natural sugars are eaten in whole foods that also contain that are essential for optimal nutrient absorption, transport, and storage. These micronutrients include vitamins, minerals, fiber, water, antioxidants, and phytochemicals and can be thought of as “information” for tissues throughout your body. Refined sugars are artificial sweeteners that are added to processed and prepared food, including table sugar (sucrose), high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), maltodextrin, dextrose, and many others. Refined sugars are added to foods and beverages to increase sweetness and consumer appeal. Refined sugars are sometimes called “simple carbohydrates” due to their short-chain chemical structure. Because refined sugars can be metabolized very easily and are generally not “protected” by the vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants, and phytochemicals found in whole foods, when you eat them they can elevate your blood glucose very quickly and increase your risk for . Glucose is a sugar that is the predominant building block of most whole carbohydrates found in nature. In addition, glucose is also the only monosaccharide found in fiber. Glucose is the primary fuel for your liver, muscles, and brain, and is the most important fuel in your entire body. The fundamental distinction that is important to make when talking about sugar is using the word “natural” or “refined” before the word “sugar.” Simply talking about “sugar” is not descriptive enough. are found in plants, and are excellent for your body. Your digestive system slowly cuts natural sugars into their monosaccharide building blocks, which are then absorbed into your blood to be burned for energy or stored for later use. The human body has evolved over millions of years to thrive on a , which have historically been the food that’s most widely available throughout human history. The shift to a diet high in meat and added sugars has only been possible recently on the time scale of human evolution, and the research shows that diets and have coincided with the and . are manufactured in a laboratory, and are the results of a manufacturing process. They are designed to make foods taste unnaturally and . These hyper-concentrated sweeteners, like HFCS, table sugar, and aspartame are often found in foods that are also high in trans fats, like donuts, pastries, chips, cookies, and ice cream. The difference between natural and refined sugars is not only helpful to understand, it’s . Natural sugars found in plant foods are one of the sources of nutrition you can put in your body. When you eat a diet containing predominantly plants, your liver, muscle and receive a steady stream of glucose throughout the day, helping to keep you feeling high energy at all times. Refined sugars found in processed foods dramatically increase your risk for obesity, heart disease, and diabetes, all of which we’ll tackle in the next section. Quick Myth Check — What About Low-Carb Diets? Aren’t They Popular Because All Carbs are Bad? Low-carb diets, like the Paleo diet and the ketogenic diet, originated from a mistaken understanding of human evolution, and a flawed understanding of the function of insulin. In individuals living with existing insulin resistance, high-carbohydrate diets can cause spikes in blood glucose, especially when those carbohydrates come from processed foods. As a result, some doctors recommend high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets, with the goal of eliminating these blood glucose spikes. However, it’s actually high-fat diets that cause insulin resistance in the first place, decreasing the ability of your liver and muscle to uptake glucose from your blood. So while the short-term results of reducing your carbohydrate intake can lead to decreased fasting blood glucose, decreased fasting insulin, and a lower A1c, the long-term result is an increase in insulin resistance, which in turn increases your risk for chronic disease. You can learn more about the topic in our article on . Refined Sugars, Obesity, Diabetes, and How They Relate Coming now from the perspective of two, very different types of sugars, the question should instead be ““ And the answer is clear — refined sugars increase your risk for diabetes, while natural sugars from fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains actually help reduce your risk for diabetes. The relationship between refined sugars and diabetes can be complicated. The direct effects of refined sugars include blood glucose spikes and liver insulin resistance, but there are also many interrelated secondary effects. are clearly linked to obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes, resulting from a rapid rise in blood glucose values that can overwhelm your liver in the post-meal state, resulting in fat and cholesterol synthesis in your liver. Obesity, in turn, leads to a , which is the underlying cause of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. But this relationship is not always a direct cause-and-effect relationship. The big picture is what’s important to understand: a diet high in refined sugar is a risk factor for weight gain, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes whereas a diet high in natural sugar from whole carbohydrates decreases your chronic disease risk. Other Factors That Can Cause or Contribute to Diabetes There are both controllable risk factors and uncontrollable risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Fortunately, the vast majority of these are within your control, including: The amount of packaged and processed foods you eat The quantity of fat in your diet (especially saturated fat) In fact, there is only one major factor of increased risk for type 2 diabetes that is technically out of your control: However, despite the fact that your genetics may increase your risk for type 2 diabetes, this condition is still extremely treatable and preventable . How to Fight Back Against Diabetes and Insulin Resistance The first, most powerful step in improving your healthy living with all forms of diabetes is through your diet. There are many other factors that can help improve your diabetes health, but the single most effective change you can make is to improve the quality of your diet. For preventing and reversing insulin resistance, the research overwhelmingly points to a , which can help you keep your target weight, avoid and reverse insulin resistance, and provide better mood and overall health, all without needing to restrict portions. To learn more, you can go into detail with our , which touches on the science behind this diet and some commonly asked questions. Increasing your exercise and daily movement has a positive feedback loop with dietary changes. More activity means your body can burn fat and glucose more efficiently. Ultimately, integrating more movement stimulates your muscle to produce more mitochondria, which in turn makes your muscles more efficient at processing glucose, thus accelerating the process of reversing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Humans have evolved to withstand long periods of time without eating – an evolutionarily conserved trait from times when food was less available. The result is that during periods of (usually 16-24 hours), your body begins a process called to ensure that cells still have the energy to function. When intermittent fasting, your body can oxidize excess fat, and recycle dysfunctional protein. It’s a sort of “internal recycling program,” and studies have shown dramatic improvements in overall health. To learn more about intermittent fasting, feel free to use our .

d0ec117e-f995-464b-97ac-f6f0235c9de5,"What Are the Health Benefits of Salacia Oblonga? Ways to Avoid Elevated Blood Glucose in Pregnant Women Your fasting blood glucose level should be between 75 and 100 milligrams per deciliter. A fasting glucose measurement of 100 to 125 milligrams per deciliter indicates that you may be prediabetic, and a value of more than 125 milligrams per deciliter indicates that you may have type 2 diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association. Some clinical and supporting studies suggest that adding cinnamon or a cinnamon supplement to your diet may help to bring your glucose level down. Because organs such as your brain heavily rely on glucose for energy, it is critical to maintain your fasting blood glucose level above about 60 milligrams per deciliter. However, a high glucose level over prolonged periods of time can damage many of your organs and tissues. If your fasting glucose level is in the prediabetic range, adding 500 milligrams per day of a cinnamon extract supplement could significantly lower your glucose level, according to the “Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition.” A review of several studies indicates that cinnamon supplementation can help to control blood glucose, regardless of whether or not you have diabetes. Glucose can attach to blood proteins, including the hemoglobin that carries oxygen in your red blood cells. A test called A1C can help diagnose diabetes by monitoring the percentage of hemoglobin in complex with glucose. An A1C between 5.7 and 6.4 percent indicates an increased risk of developing diabetes and a level of more than 6.4 percent indicates diabetes. If your A1C percent is too high, 1 to 2 grams of cinnamon daily, or 120 to 360 milligrams of a cinnamon extract supplement daily for about 3 months may lower your A1C level, as suggested by several clinical studies. If you are concerned about blood glucose, your physician may arrange to have you take a glucose tolerance test. You will be given a glucose drink, and your glucose will be periodically measured over a 2-hour period. Blood glucose of more than 140 milligrams per deciliter after 2 hours indicates poor glucose tolerance. Regular use of cinnamon may help to prevent the symptoms of diabetes from developing by improving your glucose tolerance, according to a report in the “European Journal of Applied Physiology."" Subjects were given 3 grams of cinnamon per day for 2 weeks, and the beneficial effects disappeared when cinnamon supplementation ceased. Your fasting blood glucose level, A1C percentage and glucose tolerance are largely determined by the ability of insulin to facilitate glucose movement from your blood into your tissues, which is called insulin sensitivity. Ingesting cinnamon during a glucose tolerance test improves insulin sensitivity, suggesting that including cinnamon with your meals may do the same. Supportive studies in animals indicate that cinnamon can increase the channeling of blood glucose into storage as a form of starch called glycogen by stimulating the glucose transport protein responsible for taking glucose out of your blood and moving it into your tissues.

0e792432-d61d-4ce6-9e1e-8761e7f690d1,"From marinara sauce to peanut butter, added sugar can be found in even the most unexpected products. Many people rely on quick, processed foods for meals and snacks. Since these products often contain added sugar, it makes up a large proportion of their daily calorie intake. In the US, added sugars account for up to 17% of the total calorie intake of adults and up to 14% for children (). Dietary guidelines suggest limiting calories from added sugar to less than 10% per day (). Experts believe that sugar consumption is a major cause of obesity and many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes. Here are 11 reasons why eating too much sugar is bad for your health. Rates of obesity are rising worldwide and added sugar, especially from sugar-sweetened beverages, is thought to be one of the main culprits. Sugar-sweetened drinks like sodas, juices and sweet teas are loaded with fructose, a type of simple sugar. Consuming fructose increases your hunger and desire for food more than glucose, the main type of sugar found in starchy foods (). Additionally, excessive fructose consumption may cause resistance to , an important hormone that regulates hunger and tells your body to stop eating (). In other words, sugary beverages don’t curb your hunger, making it easy to quickly consume a high number of liquid calories. This can lead to weight gain. Research has consistently shown that people who drink sugary beverages, such as soda and juice, weigh more than people who don’t (). Also, drinking a lot of sugar-sweetened beverages is linked to an increased amount of visceral fat, a kind of deep belly fat associated with conditions like diabetes and heart disease (). Consuming too much added sugar, especially from sugary beverages, increases your risk of weight gain and can lead to visceral fat accumulation. High-sugar diets have been associated with an increased risk of many diseases, including heart disease, the number one cause of death worldwide (). Evidence suggests that high-sugar diets can lead to obesity, inflammation and high triglyceride, blood sugar and blood pressure levels — all risk factors for heart disease (). Additionally, consuming too much sugar, especially from sugar-sweetened drinks, has been linked to atherosclerosis, a disease characterized by fatty, artery-clogging deposits (). A study in over 30,000 people found that those who consumed 17–21% of calories from added sugar had a 38% greater risk of dying from heart disease, compared to those consuming only 8% of calories from added sugar (). Just one 16-ounce (473-ml) can of soda contains 52 grams of sugar, which equates to more than 10% of your daily calorie consumption, based on a 2,000-calorie diet (). This means that one sugary drink a day can already put you over the for added sugar. Consuming too much added sugar increases heart disease risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure and inflammation. High-sugar diets have been linked to an increased risk of dying from heart disease. A diet high in refined carbs, including sugary foods and drinks, has been associated with a . Foods with a high glycemic index, such as processed sweets, raise your blood sugar more rapidly than foods with a lower glycemic index. Sugary foods quickly spike blood sugar and insulin levels, causing increased androgen secretion, oil production and inflammation, all of which play a role in acne development (). Studies have shown that low-glycemic diets are associated with a reduced acne risk, while high-glycemic diets are linked to a greater risk (). For example, a study in 2,300 teens demonstrated that those who frequently consumed added sugar had a 30% greater risk of developing acne (). Also, many population studies have shown that rural communities that consume traditional, non-processed foods have almost non-existent rates of acne, compared to more urban, high-income areas (). These findings coincide with the theory that diets high in processed, sugar-laden foods contribute to the development of acne. High-sugar diets can increase androgen secretion, oil production and inflammation, all of which can raise your risk of developing acne. The worldwide prevalence of diabetes has more than doubled over the past 30 years (). Though there are many reasons for this, there is a clear link between excessive sugar consumption and diabetes risk. Obesity, which is often caused by consuming too much sugar, is considered the strongest (). What’s more, prolonged high-sugar consumption drives resistance to insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels. causes blood sugar levels to rise and strongly increases your risk of diabetes. A population study comprising over 175 countries found that the risk of developing diabetes grew by 1.1% for every 150 calories of sugar, or about one can of soda, consumed per day (). Other studies have also shown that people who drink sugar-sweetened beverages, including fruit juice, are more likely to develop diabetes (, ). A high-sugar diet may lead to obesity and insulin resistance, both of which are risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Eating excessive amounts of sugar may increase your risk of developing certain cancers. First, a diet rich in sugary foods and beverages can lead to obesity, which significantly raises your risk of cancer (). Furthermore, diets high in sugar increase inflammation in your body and may cause insulin resistance, both of which increase cancer risk (). A study in over 430,000 people found that added sugar consumption was positively associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer, pleural cancer and cancer of the small intestine (). Another study showed that women who consumed sweet buns and cookies more than three times per week were 1.42 times more likely to develop endometrial cancer than women who consumed these foods less than 0.5 times per week (). Research on the link between added sugar intake and cancer is ongoing, and more studies are needed to fully understand this complex relationship. Too much sugar can lead to obesity, insulin resistance and inflammation, all of which are risk factors for cancer. While a healthy diet can , a diet high in added sugar and processed foods may increase your chances of developing depression. Consuming a lot of processed foods, including high-sugar products such as cakes and sugary drinks, has been associated with a higher risk of depression (, ). Researchers believe that blood sugar swings, neurotransmitter dysregulation and inflammation may all be reasons for sugar’s detrimental impact on mental health (). A study following 8,000 people for 22 years showed that men who consumed 67 grams or more of sugar per day were 23% more likely to develop depression than men who ate less than 40 grams per day (). Another study in over 69,000 women demonstrated that those with the highest intakes of added sugars had a significantly greater risk of depression, compared to those with the lowest intakes (). A diet rich in added sugar and processed foods may increase depression risk in both men and women. Wrinkles are a natural sign of aging. They appear eventually, regardless of your health. However, poor food choices can worsen wrinkles and speed the skin aging process. (AGEs) are compounds formed by reactions between sugar and protein in your body. They are suspected to play a key role in skin aging (). Consuming a diet high in refined carbs and sugar leads to the production of AGEs, which may cause your skin to age prematurely (). AGEs damage collagen and elastin, which are proteins that help the skin stretch and . When collagen and elastin become damaged, the skin loses its firmness and begins to sag. In one study, women who consumed more carbs, including added sugars, had a more wrinkled appearance than women on a high-protein, lower-carb diet (). The researchers concluded that a lower intake of carbs was associated with better skin-aging appearance (). Sugary foods can increase the production of AGEs, which can accelerate skin aging and wrinkle formation. Telomeres are structures found at the end of chromosomes, which are molecules that hold part or all of your genetic information. Telomeres act as protective caps, preventing chromosomes from deteriorating or fusing together. As you grow older, telomeres naturally shorten, which causes cells to age and malfunction (). Although the shortening of telomeres is a normal part of aging, unhealthy lifestyle choices can speed up the process. Consuming high amounts of sugar has been shown to accelerate telomere shortening, which increases cellular aging (). A study in 5,309 adults showed that regularly drinking sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with shorter telomere length and premature cellular aging (). In fact, each daily 20-ounce (591-ml) serving of sugar-sweetened soda equated to 4.6 additional years of aging, independent of other variables (). Eating too much sugar can accelerate the shortening of telomeres, which increases cellular aging. Foods high in added sugar quickly spike blood sugar and insulin levels, leading to increased energy. Products that are loaded with sugar but lacking in protein, fiber or fat lead to a brief energy boost that’s quickly followed by a sharp drop in blood sugar, often referred to as a crash (). Having constant blood sugar swings can lead to major fluctuations in energy levels (). To avoid this , choose carb sources that are low in added sugar and rich in fiber. Pairing carbs with protein or fat is another great way to keep your blood sugar and . For example, eating an apple along with a small handful of almonds is an excellent snack for prolonged, consistent energy levels. High-sugar foods can negatively impact your energy levels by causing a spike in blood sugar followed by a crash. A high intake of fructose has been consistently linked to an increased risk of . Unlike glucose and other types of sugar, which are taken up by many cells throughout the body, fructose is almost exclusively broken down by the liver. In the liver, fructose is converted into energy or stored as glycogen. However, the liver can only store so much glycogen before excess amounts are turned into fat. Large amounts of added sugar in the form of fructose overload your liver, leading to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition characterized by excessive fat buildup in the liver (). A study in over 5,900 adults showed that people who drank sugar-sweetened beverages daily had a 56% higher risk of developing NAFLD, compared to people who did not (). Eating too much sugar may lead to NAFLD, a condition in which excessive fat builds up in the liver. Aside from the risks listed above, sugar can harm your body in countless other ways. Having consistently high blood sugar levels can cause damage to the delicate blood vessels in your kidneys. This can lead to an increased risk of kidney disease (). Eating too much . Bacteria in your mouth feed on sugar and release acid byproducts, which cause tooth demineralization (). is an inflammatory condition characterized by pain in the joints. Added sugars raise uric acid levels in the blood, increasing the risk of developing or worsening gout (). High-sugar diets can lead to impaired memory and have been linked to an increased risk of dementia (). Research on the impact of added sugar on health is ongoing, and new discoveries are constantly being made. Consuming too much sugar may worsen cognitive decline, increase gout risk, harm your kidneys and cause cavities. Excessive added sugar has many negative health effects. Although consuming small amounts now and then is perfectly healthy, you should try to cut back on sugar whenever possible. Fortunately, simply focusing on eating automatically decreases the amount of sugar in your diet. Here are some tips on how to : Swap sodas, energy drinks, juices and sweetened teas for water or unsweetened seltzer. Drink your coffee black or use Stevia for a zero-calorie, natural sweetener. Sweeten plain yogurt with fresh or frozen berries instead of buying flavored, sugar-loaded yogurt. Consume whole fruits instead of sugar-sweetened fruit smoothies. Replace candy with a homemade trail mix of fruit, nuts and a few dark chocolate chips. Use olive oil and vinegar in place of sweet salad dressings like honey mustard. Choose marinades, nut butters, ketchup and marinara sauce with zero added sugars. Look for cereals, granolas and granola bars with under 4 grams of sugar per serving. Swap your morning cereal for a bowl of rolled oats topped with nut butter and fresh berries, or an omelet made with fresh greens. Instead of jelly, slice fresh bananas onto your peanut butter sandwich. Use natural nut butters in place of sweet spreads like Nutella. Avoid alcoholic beverages that are sweetened with soda, juice, honey, sugar or agave. Shop the perimeter of the grocery store, focusing on fresh, whole ingredients. In addition, keeping a food diary is an excellent way of becoming more aware of the main sources of sugar in your diet. The best way to limit your added sugar intake is to prepare your own healthy meals at home and avoid buying foods and drinks that are high in added sugar. Focusing on preparing healthy meals and limiting your intake of foods that contain added sweeteners can help you cut back on the amount of sugar in your diet. Eating too much added sugar can have many negative health effects. An excess of sweetened foods and beverages can lead to weight gain, blood sugar problems and an increased risk of heart disease, among other dangerous conditions. For these reasons, added sugar should be kept to a minimum whenever possible, which is easy when you follow a based on whole foods. If you need to cut added sugar from your diet, try some of the small changes listed above. Before you know it, your sugar habit will be a thing of the past.

From the birthday party to the end-of-school-year pizza party, these celebratory events often come with a selection of food that is not always the healthiest. While having Type 1 diabetes does not exclude you from eating a confetti-covered cupcake or that slice of pizza that is the staple of most school gatherings; it does mean however that you’ll be presented with foods that can make managing T1D all that more challenging. We wanted to know how these five common party foods affect BGLs, so we looked at the daily nutritional value closely of the following foods: 1 scoop of Baskin Robin’s chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream We found that these typical party foods can make managing Type 1 (or Type 2) diabetes more difficult because of the high amounts of the following ingredients: That is not to say, if you have Type 1 you should only eat raw veggies, while the others enjoy the common treats. You should, however, be aware of what these typical snacks do to blood sugar and why. Knowing more about how food affects physiology will aid you in adjusting insulin and help you prepare for optimal blood sugar control. Most commonly found in the form of sodium chloride or “table salt,” this element is crucial for bodily functions. The explains that “The body uses sodium to control blood pressure and blood volume. Your body also needs sodium for your muscles and nerves to work properly.” But what does high sodium do over extended periods of time? Firstly, it can add to dehydration which can keep your blood glucose levels high. Secondly, it can put you at risk for other complications. Carly Crompton, who holds a Nutrition degree with a focus on physiology and metabolism from University of California, Berkeley,  says that “Type 1 diabetics are already at an elevated risk for hypertension and diets with high sodium increase your risk as well.” Will eating one slice of pizza (with 23% of your daily value for sodium) today increase your child’s risk of hypertension twenty years from now? Probably not — but the typical slice of pizza has additional attributes to consider when it comes to maintaining blood sugar control. In a , clinicians observed how high-fat meals affected glucose levels in adult Type 1 diabetes patients. Howard Wolpert, MD, Senior Physician in the Joslin Clinic Section on Adult Diabetes and the Director of the Insulin Pump Program at Joslin, who also led the study, said that “several hours after eating high-fat meals, glucose levels went up.” More than that though, they stayed up. “Despite the increased insulin, participants had greater hyperglycemia after the high-fat dinner with insulin levels elevated five to ten hours after the meal. The average increase in insulin was 42 percent with significant individual differences.” (). This means higher fat foods can cause prolonged elevated BGLs. It also means that there were high variations on how that affected individuals. What insulin dosage works for one child, will not necessarily be the same for another. That’s why testing and recording what’s successful and what is not is important. Bailey West, a graduate from the University of Florida in Nutrition and Dietetics says, “High fat meals are among the trickiest to account for when bolusing, mainly because fats digest more slowly than carbohydrates. The rate at which our bodies digest meals coincide with our need for insulin. So, as our bodies are trying to process a meal of carbs, proteins and high amounts of fat, more insulin is needed and for a longer period of time.” Check out Tidepool’s  (available in beta) that allows you to record how foods affect your blood sugar. Knowing ahead of time is half the battle. Not all fats are bad fats, of course. Cholesterol (a type of fat) isn’t always bad either. Crompton notes, “Cholesterol is used by the body in different ways. For example, it is necessary in the membrane function of your cells, but when there’s too much cholesterol, (particularly bad ones), it can start clogging up arteries. Because someone with Type 1 is at a higher risk for heart disease and heart attack, they should avoid “bad” cholesterol. Bad cholesterols include saturated fats that you find in all of these common party snack (except for soda). Here is a short list of recognizable fatty foods and what type of fat they contain:  HDL (high density lipo protein) – these are fats with omega 3s such as nuts, chia and flax seeds, avocado, olive oil, fatty fish like salmon, and eggs. LDL (low density lipo protein)  – these are your trans fats and saturated fats, high-fat dairy like butter, ice cream and margarine. It’s true. 30 g of carbohydrates in a cookie will spike your blood glucose level faster than 30 g of carbs in an apple. Why? A cookie is typically made with refined sugar and an apple contains fiber sugar. The glycemic index of these foods vary greatly because of this. The describes the Glycemic Index (GI) as “a measurement of how a -containing food raises .” As someone with Type 1 diabetes or a caretaker of someone with the condition, this glycemic index is vital in helping to determine how a food will affect one’s blood sugar. Carbohydrates with a low GI value (55 or less) are digested at a slower rate, therefore they cause a lower and slower rise in blood sugar levels. Interestingly enough, an orange has a GI value of 40 whereas a grapefruit has a GI value of only 25. That’s a big difference for seemingly similar foods! Nutritionist Caroline Potter explains, “When it comes to sugars, you simply cannot just look at the carbohydrate count, you have to go beyond and take into account the fiber, minerals and nutrients involved in eating and digesting the sugars. Due to the lack of nutrients in refined sugars or artificial sweeteners, they are quickly absorbed into your blood stream, causing your blood glucose to sky-rocket as compared to whole food sources like fruit, raw honey or maple syrup.” Check the glycemic index for  from Harvard Medical School. – raises BGLs slower over a longer period of time and slows down your digestive process – spike BGLs faster and are commonly found in many processed foods, candy and soda beverages. As you probably already know all too well, there is a direct correlation between the amount of carbs you eat and the impact on your blood glucose level. There are some foods, like many vegetables and meat, that have very low carbs. This means, you don’t typically have to administer insulin in order to consume them and maintain blood sugar control. The more carbs you consume, the more insulin you need, (while this varies person to person in terms of what is adequate), it’s something to consider when weighing dietary options. It is not to say that you shouldn’t eat carbs as someone with Type 1 — carbs are also a vital source of energy — it is to say though that less carbs can make diabetes blood sugar management easier. “This is due to a smaller margin of error when determining how much insulin we need,” nutrition expert Bailey West says. “Lower carbohydrate eating helps with that uncertainty.” Of course, the slice of pizza or the ice cream sundae is not forbidden for the person with Type 1, but if you’re indulging, it does take a bit more preparation in order to keep BGLs in safe range. Remember, there are different ways in which to bolus too. On a Medtronic pump, for example, you can administer a where it assists with rapid as well as slow-absorbing carbohydrates. Always talk to your professional healthcare provider to create a plan that works best for your Type 1 lifestyle and dietary needs. Here are some general tips on how to prepare: Know the history of what happened last time the food was eaten (record on an app such as ). Having Type 1 diabetes doesn’t prevent you from participating in important cultural celebrations that sometimes revolve around (not-so-healthy) food. It does though require you to be more aware of what those commonly eaten foods do to blood sugar. If you want to maintain optimal blood sugar control, you just have to know what you’re getting into. One mom discusses her reaction to seeing her son wearing his Omnipod and Dexcom together for the first time. Ketogenic diet is one that is high in fat and very low in carbohydrates, resulting in the production of ketones to be used for fuel instead of glucose.

53af412a-9389-477e-bdea-e4c514da5f64,"Eat Stop Eat Review: Does It Work for Weight Loss? — The concept of intermittent fasting has taken the health and wellness world by storm. Early research suggests that engaging in periodic, short-term fasting practices could be a simple but effective way to shed unwanted weight and improve metabolic health. There are multiple ways to implement an intermittent fasting protocol into your routine, but one method that’s becoming increasingly popular is known as Eat Stop Eat. This article reviews everything you need to know about the Eat Stop Eat diet, including how to implement it, whether it’s effective for weight loss, and possible drawbacks to consider before diving in. Eat Stop Eat is a unique that’s characterized by the inclusion of up to two non-consecutive fasting days per week. It was developed by Brad Pilon, author of the popular and aptly titled book “Eat Stop Eat.” Pilon was inspired to write this book after researching the effects of short-term fasting on metabolic health at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada (). According to Pilon, the Eat Stop Eat method isn’t your typical weight loss diet. Instead, it’s a way to reevaluate what you have been previously taught about meal timing and frequency and how that relates to your health (). Implementing the Eat Stop Eat diet is relatively straightforward. You simply choose one or two non-consecutive days per week during which you abstain from eating — or fast — for a full 24-hour period. For the remaining 5–6 days of the week you can eat freely, but it’s recommended that you make sensible food choices and avoid consuming more than your body needs. Though it seems counterintuitive, you will still eat something on each calendar day of the week when using the Eat Stop Eat method. For instance, if you’re fasting from 9 a.m. Tuesday until 9 a.m. Wednesday, you’ll make sure to eat a meal prior to 9 a.m. on Tuesday. Your next meal will occur after 9 a.m. on Wednesday. This way, you ensure you’re fasting for a full 24 hours — but not longer. Keep in mind that even on fasting days of Eat Stop Eat, is strongly encouraged. Drinking plenty of water is the best choice, but you’re also allowed other types of calorie-free beverages, such as unsweetened or artificially sweetened coffee or tea. Eat Stop Eat is a type of intermittent fasting diet in which you fast for 24 hours once or twice per week. One of the main reasons people are implementing intermittent fasting diets like Eat Stop Eat is to encourage . Though there are currently no studies specifically evaluating Eat Stop Eat for weight loss, mounting evidence suggests that the periodic, prolonged fasting that Eat Stop Eat employs may support weight loss efforts for some people (). The first — and perhaps most obvious — way that Eat Stop Eat may promote weight loss is through a . It’s well understood that losing weight requires you to consume fewer calories than you burn (). When applied properly, Eat Stop Eat sets you up for 1–2 days’ worth of a calorie deficit each week. Over time, this reduction in your total calorie intake could result in weight loss as you burn more calories than you take in. However, current evidence doesn’t indicate that restricting calories for an entire day at a time is any more effective for reducing weight than the continual daily calorie restriction that most traditional diets utilize (). Another way Eat Stop Eat could lead to weight loss is because of certain metabolic shifts that occur when your body is in a fasted state. The body’s preferred fuel source is carbs. When you eat carbs, they’re broken down into a usable form of energy known as glucose. After roughly 12–36 hours of fasting, most people will burn through the glucose they have stored in their bodies and subsequently transition to using fat as an energy source instead. This is a metabolic state known as (). Early research suggests that because of this metabolic shift, prolonged fasting may favor fat utilization in a way that traditional dieting strategies can’t (). Still, data on this potential benefit is limited, and there seems to be significant variability in how quickly people transition into ketosis. Thus, it’s unlikely that everyone will reach ketosis within the 24-hour fasting window used in the Eat Stop Eat diet. More research is needed to better understand how metabolic changes that may occur on an Eat Stop Eat diet can influence fat reduction and overall weight loss efforts. Eat Stop Eat may support weight loss through calorie reduction and changes in metabolism. However, results cannot be guaranteed for everyone. The fasting practices implemented in Eat Stop Eat are likely safe for most healthy adults. Yet, you should consider potential downsides if you’re thinking of trying it out. Certain people may have a difficult time meeting all of their on the Eat Stop Eat diet. When it comes to dieting, it’s not uncommon for people to think of food in terms of calories alone. But food is much more than calories. It’s also an important source of vitamins, minerals, and other beneficial compounds that support your most vital bodily functions. It’s essential for anyone following Eat Stop Eat to pay close attention to the foods they eat on their non-fasting days to ensure adequate protein, fiber, vitamin, and mineral intake throughout their diet. If you have particularly high nutritional demands or currently struggle to eat enough food to meet your needs, removing 1–2 days’ worth of food could contribute to insufficient nutrient intake or unhealthy weight loss. Some people use intermittent fasting diets like Eat Stop Eat to control and insulin sensitivity (). Most healthy people have no difficulty maintaining blood sugar levels during the 24-hour fasting periods required on Eat Stop Eat, but that may not be the case for everyone. For some people, such as those with diabetes, extended periods without food may contribute to dangerous blood sugar drops that could be life-threatening. If you take blood sugar medications or have any medical conditions that cause poor blood sugar regulation, consult your healthcare provider before attempting Eat Stop Eat or any other diet than includes fasting (). Fasting practices implemented on the Eat Stop Eat diet may contribute to changes in metabolic and reproductive hormone production. However, the specific health outcomes resulting from such hormonal changes are difficult to predict due to a lack of human research. Some studies suggest that certain hormonal shifts may offer positive health benefits, such as , while others indicate a potential risk for negative effects like inadequate reproductive hormone production and pregnancy complications (, , , ). Because of the mixed data and limited total evidence, Eat Stop Eat is not generally recommended for anyone who’s pregnant, breastfeeding, or trying to conceive. If you have a history of hormonal dysregulation, irregular periods, or amenorrhea, consult your healthcare provider prior to starting an Eat Stop Eat diet. While many people report feeling more dietary freedom when using fasting as a weight loss aid, the restrictive nature of such eating patterns could have a negative psychological impact. Some research indicates that short-term fasting may lead to irritability, volatile moods, and reduced libido (). That said, proponents of intermittent fasting often say that mood issues resolve after you have become accustomed to your fasting routine — though these claims haven’t yet been proven. Restrictive dieting may also contribute to behaviors, such as bingeing or obsessive thoughts about food and weight (). Because of this, Eat Stop Eat is not recommended for anyone with a history of disordered eating or a tendency toward developing these behaviors. Though fasting is safe for most healthy people, it may contribute to low blood sugar, insufficient nutrient intake, hormone shifts, and negative psychological effects. At this point, there’s insufficient evidence to determine whether Eat Stop Eat is an effective weight loss method for everyone. Studies have found various intermittent fasting strategies to be effective for achieving weight loss of up to 10% (). However, there’s immense variability in study designs, specific fasting protocols, and total weight loss, making it difficult to predict exact results for Eat Stop Eat (). Weight loss is a complex process that can be very unique to each individual. Many factors beyond and meal timing affect your ability to lose or gain weight (). Ultimately, more long-term research on Eat Stop Eat is needed to determine whether it’s any more effective than other approaches to weight loss. Although early research suggests Eat Stop Eat may support weight loss, there’s currently not enough evidence to determine whether it’s an effective strategy for everyone. Eat Stop Eat is a popular form of intermittent fasting in which you fast for 24 hours once or twice per week. Research on this particular eating pattern is limited, but it may support weight loss by way of reduced calorie intake and changes in metabolic function that favor . Though fasting is generally considered safe, it could have negative side effects, such as inadequate nutrient intake, low blood sugar, and the development of disordered eating patterns. As always, consult your healthcare provider if you’re unsure whether Eat Stop Eat is an appropriate weight loss strategy for you. — Intermittent fasting is an effective way to lose weight and improve health.

Metabolic Syndrome: Proven Diet & Natural Treatment Plan Any guess at what disorder affects 40 percent of people over the age of 60? It’s called metabolic syndrome, which unfortunately does not simply mean that your metabolism is slow or out of whack. Metabolic syndrome is a metabolic disorder that involves not one, but a combination of three or more of the following health issues: abdominal obesity, high blood sugar, high levels, high blood pressure or low HDL (“good”) cholesterol. The term “metabolic” refers to the biochemical processes involved in the body’s normal functioning. When you have metabolic syndrome, your body is in a state of serious malfunction. Metabolic syndrome increases your risk for some very concerning and possibly deadly health issues, including heart disease, stroke and diabetes. But there’s good news. There’s hope for getting your body metabolically back on track as well as keeping it on track throughout your entire life. Some of the best ways to avoid metabolic syndrome include maintaining a healthy weight, regularly exercising and eating a plant-centric diet while avoiding . In fact, a loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current body weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can also improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and increase HDL cholesterol.

() Consumption of these two are major culprits when it comes to high blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, and the development of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Sugar, especially when used to sweeten beverages, is a major culprit, as are refined carbs. () A recent study conducted in Korea, where metabolic syndrome incidence is high, looked at the effects of on this metabolic disorder. What the researchers found was that “the percentage of energy from carbohydrates in men and intake of refined grains, including white rice, in women were associated with metabolic syndrome.” () Limit alcohol intake is key to metabolic syndrome and good health in general. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels. Alcohol also adds extra calories to your diet, which can cause weight gain. However, limited consumption of , as a meta-analysis published in  found that while heavy alcohol consumption indeed increases the risk of metabolic syndrome, “very light alcohol consumption seemed to be associated with a reduced risk of metabolic syndrome.” () Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day, while women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is: When it comes to metabolic syndrome and encouraging good health in general, you want to focus on consuming whole, real, high-quality food and drinks. Some of the top foods to heal and prevent metabolic syndrome include: The omega-3 found in wild-caught, cold-water fish have been found to help regulate heartbeat, reduce blood pressure, decrease blood clot formation and reduce overall inflammation, all of which decrease the risk for heart attacks and strokes. () Omega-3 foods are also that help reduce triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. Other include walnuts, flaxseeds, natto and grass-fed beef. Dark leafy greens like kale and spinach, avocado, broccoli, cabbage, and carrots are a just a few of the many options when it comes to your daily intake of vegetables, which are loaded with disease-fighting and anti-inflammatory antioxidants and . Eating avocados in particular has been found to be clinically associated with lower metabolic syndrome in U.S. adults because your gut. () Think of a rainbow as you make your daily vegetable choices (red bell peppers to pumpkin to yellow squash to arugula to purple eggplant). This way, not only do you keep your meals interesting, but you obtain all of the great vitamins and nutrients vegetables can offer you! Similar to vegetables, there are so many options that not only taste good, but help you ward off metabolic syndrome. You can opt for apples, bananas, oranges, pears or prunes if you need some ideas that are easy to consume quickly or on the go. In moderation (so you don’t overdo it on natural sugar), daily fruit consumption is an easy and therapeutic habit to develop if you haven’t already. Pomegranate and in particular have been shown to help ameliorate metabolic syndrome. Research published in  concluded that pomegranate “exerts hypoglycaemic effects, including increased insulin sensitivity, inhibition of α-glucosidase, and impact on glucose transporter type 4 function, but is also responsible for a reduction of total cholesterol, and the improvement of blood lipid profiles, as well as anti-inflammatory effects through the modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor pathways. These effects may also explain how pomegranate-derived compounds function in the amelioration of adverse health effects caused by metabolic syndrome.” () Some delicious and tasty legumes to try include kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas and lima beans. Rich in fiber and protein, legumes are an excellent daily choice for keeping blood sugar stable and your waistline trim. And they’re particularly useful in preventing metabolic syndrome. A 2014 study examined the effects of legumes on metabolic syndrome. A validated 48-item food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary behaviors of 2,027 individuals pulled from the Isfahan Healthy Heart Program. Researchers found that “all MetS components were less prevalent among subjects with regular legume intake.” () , like quality whole grains including oatmeal and brown rice, not only have proven benefits for diabetes and heart health, but they also help keep your waistline in check. As such, whole grains are a part of a balanced, healthy metabolic syndrome diet treatment plan. () Research published in 2009 showed that ginseng, and , which are commonly used in Chinese medicine, are potent natural remedies when it comes to metabolic syndrome. They help regulate glucose and lipid metabolism, which directly and positively affect weight management. () When researchers from the Department of Home Science at Azad University of Agriculture and Technology in India investigated the effects of leaves on blood glucose and serum cholesterol levels in humans through double-blind clinical trials, the outcomes showed that holy basil caused significant improvements in blood glucose control and mild improvements in cholesterol levels. This suggests that basil supplementation can be a useful and safe way to help control diabetes and complications that result from the disease like metabolic syndrome. ()  contains phycocyanin, a pigment that scientists have discovered possesses antihypertensive effects, meaning it lowers blood pressure). Japanese researchers claim that this is because consuming the blue-green algae reverses endothelial dysfunction in metabolic syndrome. () increases the levels in the body, which not only improves your immune system and disease resistance, but also helps balance proper levels of cholesterol in the body. In addition, it significantly improves glucose tolerance by lowering levels of glucose in the blood, which improves heart health and conditions like diabetes or metabolic syndrome. () Three awesome  are grapefruit, cinnamon and ginger. Grapefruit essential oil actually works with your body in activating enzymes that help your body break down brown body fat. Cinnamon oil has been shown time and time again to help regulate and something in your body called GTF, glucose tolerance factor. For that reason, cinnamon oil is also fantastic for anybody with diabetes. (, ) Ginger oil reduces sugar cravings and helps reduce inflammation in the body. If you’re going to lose weight, it’s key that you also reduce inflammation and support digestion and absorption of nutrients, which ginger oil helps you to do. () is key when it comes to treating metabolic syndrome.  helps your body become a fat-burning machine. It consists of exercising at 90 percent to 100 percent of your maximum effort for 30 to 60 seconds, slowing it down to low-impact for a recovery period of just 30 to 60 seconds, and then bumping it back up again. If you’ve been spending hours on the treadmill without results, it’s because long-distance cardiovascular exercise can decrease testosterone and raise cortisol, the stress hormone. Increased levels of cortisol stimulate the appetite, increase fat storing, and slow down or inhibit exercise recovery. If burst training isn’t for you, then aim for at least 30 minutes per day of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking. () Through diet and exercise, losing weight can reduce insulin resistance and blood pressure, helping to get your metabolic syndrome under control. () Smoking cigarettes can lead to and worsen the health consequences of metabolic syndrome as well as increase your likelihood for heart problems and stroke, among other major health concerns. () Metabolic syndrome is also sometimes called dysmetabolic syndrome syndrome X, metabolic disease or insulin resistance syndrome. What is metabolic syndrome exactly? It’s actually the term for a cluster of conditions, including abdominal obesity, high triglyceride levels, high fasting blood sugar levels, high blood pressure or low HDL cholesterol. When a person has three or more of these metabolic risk factors occurring together, then he or she is diagnosed as having metabolic syndrome. About 85 percent of people who have type 2 diabetes also have metabolic syndrome. These individuals have a much higher risk for heart disease than the 15 percent of people who have type 2 diabetes without metabolic syndrome. () Thus, natural also are used to treat metabolic syndrome. I’m happy to say that aggressive and heart-healthy lifestyle changes are typically the main treatment for metabolic syndrome, which I fully support since lifestyle changes are the natural approach and get to the root causes of the disorder. Recommended lifestyle changes typically include heart-healthy eating, good stress management, losing and maintaining a healthy weight, more physical activity, and quitting smoking. If lifestyle changes aren’t effective, then your doctor will likely prescribe medications to treat and control your risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL (“good”) cholesterol and high blood sugar. A doctor’s main goal when treating metabolic syndrome is to reduce the risk of . The second goal of treatment is to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes, if it hasn’t already developed. It’s scary but true that most of the disorders associated with metabolic syndrome are symptomless. However, one very common visible sign of metabolic syndrome is a large waist circumference: at least 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, you’re at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. () If you have very high blood sugar, then you might experience the signs and symptoms of diabetes like increased thirst, increased urination, fatigue and blurred vision. A normal fasting blood sugar level is less than 100 mg/dL. A fasting blood sugar level between 100–125 mg/dL is considered . A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL or higher is considered diabetes. A fasting blood sugar level of 100 mg/dL or higher (or being on medicine to treat high blood sugar) is considered a metabolic risk factor. is another symptom and risk factor for metabolic syndrome, which can go unnoticed unless you check your blood pressure regularly. A blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg or higher (or being on medicine to treat high blood pressure) is considered a metabolic risk factor. Another possible sign of metabolic syndrome is a high triglyceride level. Triglycerides are a type of fat or lipid found in your blood. When you eat, your body converts any calories it doesn’t need to use right away into triglycerides. A triglyceride level of 150 mg/dL or higher (or being on medicine to treat high triglycerides) is a metabolic risk factor for metabolic syndrome. HDL cholesterol is often referred to as “good” cholesterol because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. An HDL cholesterol level of less than 50 mg/dL for women and less than 40 mg/dL for men (or being on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol) is risk factor for metabolic syndrome. A doctor can diagnose metabolic syndrome based on the results of a physical exam and blood tests. The two main causes of metabolic syndrome are being overweight or obese and a lack of physical activity.A 2017 study highlighted that an hour of weekly resistance exercise was associated with 29 percent lower risk of developing metabolic syndrome, compared to no resistance exercising. Participants who coupled aerobic exercise with their resistance exercise showcased a 25 percent lower risk. () Metabolic syndrome is a metabolic disease that’s directly linked with insulin resistance, which is more common in obese and inactive people. Let me explain what I mean by insulin resistance. A healthy digestive system breaks down food into glucose. Next, insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps the glucose enter your cells to be used as fuel. However, if you experience , your cells won’t respond in a typical fashion to insulin, and hence, the glucose cannot enter your cells as easily. This phenomenon results in increased glucose levels in your bloodstream despite your body’s efforts to manage the glucose by producing more and more insulin. If this goes on long enough, then your body is unable to make enough insulin to maintain normal blood glucose levels and you can develop diabetes. Since bout 85 percent of people who have type 2 diabetes also have metabolic syndrome, if you develop diabetes then your likelihood of having metabolic syndrome is increased by a very large margin. Additional risk factors, most of which are unfortunately out of your control, that increase your chances of having metabolic syndrome include: () Age Your risk of metabolic syndrome increases with age, affecting 40 percent of people over the age of 60. Race Hispanics and Asians seem to be at greater risk of metabolic syndrome than are people of other races. Family history of diabetesYou’re more likely to have metabolic syndrome if you have a family history of type 2 diabetes or if you had diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes). Other diseasesYour risk of metabolic syndrome is higher if you’ve ever had cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or . In addition, researchers continue to study other health conditions that may play a role in metabolic syndrome, including: Breathing problems during sleep (such as sleep apnea) Metabolic syndrome is becoming more and more prevalent due to a rise in obesity rates among children and adults. In the not so distant future, metabolic syndrome may even overtake smoking as the leading risk factor for heart disease. Thankfully, there is realistic hope for naturally preventing metabolic disorders in the body. You can prevent or delay metabolic syndrome mainly with something that is very much in your control — lifestyle changes. A daily and long-term effort to maintain a healthy lifestyle is no doubt your surest and best bet to avoid metabolic syndrome and all the complications that can arise from this multidimensional health struggle! So keep the following in mind: Metabolic syndrome is a metabolic disorder that involves not one, but a combination of three or more of the following health issues: abdominal obesity, high blood sugar, high triglyceride levels, high blood pressure or low HDL (“good”) cholesterol. On a metabolic syndrome diet treatment plan, you should avoid fake and processed foods, artificial sweeteners, diet sodas, trans fats, refined carbohydrates and sugar, and alcohol. Foods to eat include fish and omega-3 foods, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains. In addition, the following supplements are beneficial for metabolic health: ginseng, berberine, bitter melon, holy basil, spirulina and maca root. Other natural remedies include essential oils, burst training, losing weight and not smoking. About 85 percent of people who have type 2 diabetes also have metabolic syndrome. Symptoms and risk factors for metabolic disease include large waist circumference, high fasting blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol. The two main causes of metabolic syndrome are being overweight or obese and a lack of physical activity.

Medical Author: Medical Editor: What Is a Nocturnal (While Asleep) Insulin Reaction? What Is the Medical Treatment for Insulin Reaction? What is the medical definition of insulin reaction? An insulin reaction occurs when a person with becomes confused or even unconscious because of (hypo=low + glycol = + emia = in the blood) caused by insulin or oral diabetic medications. (Please note that for this article and blood glucose mean the same thing and the terms may be used interchangeably.) The terms insulin reaction, insulin , and hypoglycemia (when associated with a person with ) are often used interchangeably. What happens if you have too much insulin in your body? In normal physiology, the body is able to balance the glucose ( levels) in the bloodstream. When a person eats, and glucose levels start to rise, the body signals the pancreas to secrete insulin. Insulin ""unlocks the door"" to cells in the body so that the glucose can be used for energy. When blood sugar levels drop, insulin production decreases and the begins producing glucose. In people with , the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin to meet the body's demand. Treatment may include medications taken by mouth (oral hypoglycemics), insulin, or both. The balance of food intake and medication is not automatic, and a person with diabetes needs to be aware that too much medication or too little food may cause blood sugar levels to drop. Interestingly, brain cells do not need insulin to access the glucose in the bloodstream. Brain cells also cannot store excess glucose, so when blood sugar levels drop, brain function is one of the first parts of the body to become affected. In an insulin reaction, the blood sugar levels are usually below 50 mg/dL (or 2.78 mmol/L in SI units). Insulin reactions occur when there is an imbalance of food intake and the amount of insulin in the body. Oral medications can remain active in the body for more than 24 hours. The effects of Injectable insulin can be short or very long depending upon the type. Even in individuals whose diabetes is well controlled and regulated with medication, a variety of factors can cause the insulin/glucose levels to fluctuate from the normal range. Also, plays a role in causing hypoglycemia? People who have had diabetes for 10-20 years and/or have been on long term or large doses of insulin are more prone to ""insulin unawareness"". They can suddenly become hypoglycemic without any warning and should check sugar before driving. They should consider Continuous Glucose Monitoring or a handheld reader with a 14-day patch that lets them read blood sugar at any time. Perhaps the most common cause of an insulin reaction or hypoglycemia is a missed meal. Once insulin is injected or a diabetes medication is taken, its effect needs to be balanced by caloric intake from food (providing glucose to bind with the insulin). If the number of calories eaten decreases, blood glucose levels drop and the insulin acts unopposed, which causes the characteristic symptoms of an insulin reaction. An insulin reaction can also occur with . When a person exercises the muscle cells need extra energy (glucose), and if food intake is decreased, the blood sugar levels will drop. Another common cause of insulin reaction is medication error. If a person with diabetes injects too much insulin or takes too many diabetic drugs, the insulin levels in the blood rise because there is not enough glucose in the blood to bind to the insulin, and an insulin reaction occurs. Disorders of these endocrine glands can also affect the balance between insulin and glucose in the body. Diabetes: What Raises and Lowers Your Blood Sugar Level? The symptoms of an insulin reaction are due to decreased brain cell function because of lack of glucose within the bloodstream. The longer the hypoglycemia persists, the more severe the symptoms. (low body temperature) may occur if the hypoglycemia persists for a prolonged period of time What Is a Nocturnal (While Asleep) Insulin Reaction? Some people with diabetes experience nighttime (nocturnal) hypoglycemia. Signs and symptoms of nocturnal hypoglycemia include: In nocturnal hypoglycemia, the blood sugar level upon awaking may be elevated as a result of the body's attempt to compensate for the level several hours before. This is sometimes called the Somogyi phenomenon. Attempts to lower the morning blood sugar level by adjusting mediation or insulin dosing may result in a paradoxical worsening of the problem. Onset of signs and symptoms is generally sudden and within a few hours after injection of short-acting insulin. The onset may occur many hours after injection of long-acting insulin preparations or with oral medications. In this case it may be more difficult to appreciate the symptoms as being related to hypoglycemia. Most people with diabetes have experienced an insulin reaction early after their initial diagnosis as and medication or insulin dosing is being adjusted to fit into their lifestyle. Whenever a person is unconscious, regardless of the cause, call 911 or your local emergency telephone number to activate emergency medical service responses. If the affected individual remains confused, even after eating or drinking to correct a low blood sugar, he or she should receive medical care. People with diabetes who take sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic medications, like (, , ), (, , ), or (), should contact their health care practitioner or seek urgent medical care if they experience an insulin reaction. These medications can remain active in the body for a prolonged period of time, and observation in a hospital setting may be necessary. Insulin reactions, especially those that occur at night or early morning should be reported to your health care practitioner. People with diabetes should keep a record of their blood sugar readings as it is an important tool to help keep blood sugars under good control and decrease the risk of long-term complications of diabetes. A low blood sugar associated with symptoms of hypoglycemia confirms an insulin reaction. The next step is to find out why the insulin reaction occurred. The history taken by the health care practitioner from the patient, bystanders, and family. Often those people that were around the affected individual can assist in defining the reason for the reaction. Further testing and follow-up will depend upon the situation. A person who wakens immediately and returns to normal function with correction of the blood sugar may need no further testing. An individual who continues to have mental status changes like confusion, lethargy, coma, or -like symptoms will likely require further care and testing. Most people with diabetes or their family members can recognize the early symptoms of an insulin reaction and can self-treat the situation. Ideally, a fingerstick blood test will be taken to confirm the diagnosis, but it is also reasonable to immediately drink something with sugar (for example, fruit juice, regular soda, or water with table sugar). Glucose tablets and sugar wafers are also easily digested and can provide instant glucose into the bloodstream. Emergency medical services (call 911 or your local emergency number) should be activated if the affected person is unconscious or has difficulty staying awake. Do NOT try to put food or drink into an unconscious person's mouth because there is a risk that it will be aspirated into the causing . It is reasonable to try to rub sugar or another sweet substance inside the cheek or along the gum line. Sugar is quickly absorbed through these sites, and this may be enough to waken the patient. is an injectable medication that can raise blood sugar levels. Many people with diabetes carry an injectable glucagon pen to use in emergencies, and often their family members also are trained in how to give an injection to treat low blood sugar levels. The patient cannot always realize that the reaction is happening and his/her relatives should be taught when and how to inject Glucagon. After a Glucagon injection, people are subject to an even worse reaction and they should try to ingest sugar as soon as they come out of the initial reaction. Should the affected individual return to normal, fingerstick blood sugar tests should be checked regularly (every 15-20 minutes) to make certain that the levels do not start to drop again. The person should not be left alone in case hypoglycemia recurs. What Is the Medical Treatment for Insulin Reaction? Increasing blood sugar levels is the treatment of an insulin reaction. Emergency personnel may start an intravenous line and inject an ampule of D50W, a highly concentrated glucose solution. If the patient takes a long-acting insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication, the IV line may be left in place and a dextrose (a type of sugar) solution may be continually infused. Patients who are elderly, have an underlying illness that caused the hypoglycemia, or are taking long-acting medication may need further observation, additional treatment, and admission to the hospital. Patients who are (hypothermic) because of a prolonged insulin reaction may require rewarming. Most patients are able to be discharged home after a short observation period. When EMS is involved at home, if the patient wakens and returns to normal with glucose treatment, there may be no need to transport them to hospital if there is a responsible adult who can care for them at home. People with diabetes need to be vigilant to maintain their blood sugar levels within the normal range. Diet, , and proper insulin dosing need to be continually monitored to prevent hypoglycemia and insulin reactions. Insulin reactions are a common situation and are usually easily treated with little consequence. If the episode occurs when the patient is driving, using heavy machinery, or otherwise engaged in a potential risky situation, injury may occur. Patients may develop significant organ damage if blood sugars remain low for a prolonged a period of time. Medically reviewed by John A.

5108beb9-9cd5-4c58-b525-10a5cfe14f5d,"1. An agitated, confused female client arrives in the emergency department. Her history includes type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and angina pectoris. Assessment reveals pallor, diaphoresis, headache, and intense hunger. A stat blood glucose sample measures 42 mg/dl, and the client is treated for an acute hypoglycemic reaction. After recovery, nurse Lily teaches the client to treat hypoglycemia by ingesting:a. 2 to 5 g of a simple carbohydrate.b. 10 to 15 g of a simple carbohydrate.c. 18 to 20 g of a simple carbohydrate.d. 25 to 30 g of a simple carbohydrate. B. To reverse hypoglycemia, the American Diabetes Association recommends ingesting 10 to 15 g of a simple carbohydrate, such as three to five pieces of hard candy, two to three packets of sugar (4 to 6 tsp), or 4 oz of fruit juice. If necessary, this treatment can be repeated in 15 minutes. Ingesting only 2 to 5 g of a simple carbohydrate may not raise the blood glucose level sufficiently. Ingesting more than 15 g may raise it above normal, causing hyperglycemia. 2. A female adult client with a history of chronic hyperparathyroidism admits to being noncompliant. Based on initial assessment findings, nurse Julia formulates the nursing diagnosis of Risk for injury. To complete the nursing diagnosis statement for this client, which ""related-to"" phrase should the nurse add?a. Related to bone demineralization resulting in pathologic fracturesb. Related to exhaustion secondary to an accelerated metabolic ratec. Related to edema and dry skin secondary to fluid infiltration into the interstitial spacesd. Related to tetany secondary to a decreased serum calcium level A. Poorly controlled hyperparathyroidism may cause an elevated serum calcium level. This, in turn, may diminish calcium stores in the bone, causing bone demineralization and setting the stage for pathologic fractures and a risk for injury. Hyperparathyroidism doesn't accelerate the metabolic rate. A decreased thyroid hormone level, not an increased parathyroid hormone level, may cause edema and dry skin secondary to fluid infiltration into the interstitial spaces. Hyperparathyroidism causes hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia; therefore, it isn't associated with tetany. 3. Nurse John is assigned to care for a postoperative male client who has diabetes mellitus. During the assessment interview, the client reports that he's impotent and says he's concerned about its effect on his marriage. In planning this client's care, the most appropriate intervention would be to:a. Encourage the client to ask questions about personal sexuality.b. Provide time for privacy.c. Provide support for the spouse or significant other.d. Suggest referral to a sex counselor or other appropriate professional. D. The nurse should refer this client to a sex counselor or other professional. Making appropriate referrals is a valid part of planning the client's care. The nurse doesn't normally provide sex counseling. 4. During a class on exercise for diabetic clients, a female client asks the nurse educator how often to exercise. The nurse educator advises the clients to exercise how often to meet the goals of planned exercise?a. At least once a weekb. At least three times a weekc. At least five times a weekd. Every day B. Diabetic clients must exercise at least three times a week to meet the goals of planned exercise — lowering the blood glucose level, reducing or maintaining the proper weight, increasing the serum high-density lipoprotein level, decreasing serum triglyceride levels, reducing blood pressure, and minimizing stress. Exercising once a week wouldn't achieve these goals. Exercising more than three times a week, although beneficial, would exceed the minimum requirement. 5. Nurse Oliver should expect a client with hypothyroidism to report which health concerns?a. Increased appetite and weight lossb. Puffiness of the face and handsc. Nervousness and tremorsd. Thyroid gland swelling B. Hypothyroidism (myxedema) causes facial puffiness, extremity edema, and weight gain. Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease) include an increased appetite, weight loss, nervousness, tremors, and thyroid gland enlargement (goiter). 6. A female client with hypothyroidism (myxedema) is receiving levothyroxine (Synthroid), 25 mcg P.O. daily. Which finding should nurse Hans recognize as an adverse drug effect?a. Dysuriab. Leg crampsc. Tachycardiad. Blurred vision C. Levothyroxine, a synthetic thyroid hormone, is given to a client with hypothyroidism to simulate the effects of thyroxine. Adverse effects of this agent include tachycardia. The other options aren't associated with levothyroxine. 7. A 67-year-old male client has been complaining of sleeping more, increased urination, anorexia, weakness, irritability, depression, and bone pain that interferes with her going outdoors. Based on these assessment findings, nurse Richard would suspect which of the following disorders?a. Diabetes mellitusb. Diabetes insipidusc. Hypoparathyroidismd. Hyperparathyroidism D. Hyperparathyroidism is most common in older women and is characterized by bone pain and weakness from excess parathyroid hormone (PTH). Clients also exhibit hypercaliuria-causing polyuria. While clients with diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus also have polyuria, they don't have bone pain and increased sleeping. Hypoparathyroidism is characterized by urinary frequency rather than polyuria. 8. When caring for a male client with diabetes insipidus, nurse Juliet expects to administer:a. vasopressin (Pitressin Synthetic).b. furosemide (Lasix).c. regular insulin.d. 10% dextrose. A. Because diabetes insipidus results from decreased antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) production, the nurse should expect to administer synthetic vasopressin for hormone replacement therapy. Furosemide, a diuretic, is contraindicated because a client with diabetes insipidus experiences polyuria. Insulin and dextrose are used to treat diabetes mellitus and its complications, not diabetes insipidus. 9. The nurse is aware that the following is the most common cause of hyperaldosteronism?a. Excessive sodium intakeb. A pituitary adenomac. Deficient potassium intaked. An adrenal adenoma D. An autonomous aldosterone-producing adenoma is the most common cause of hyperaldosteronism. Hyperplasia is the second most frequent cause. Aldosterone secretion is independent of sodium and potassium intake as well as of pituitary stimulation. 10. A male client with type 1 diabetes mellitus has a highly elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb) test result. In discussing the result with the client, nurse Sharmaine would be most accurate in stating:a. ""The test needs to be repeated following a 12-hour fast.""b. ""It looks like you aren't following the prescribed diabetic diet.""c. ""It tells us about your sugar control for the last 3 months.""d. ""Your insulin regimen needs to be altered significantly."" C. The glycosylated Hb test provides an objective measure of glycemic control over a 3-month period. The test helps identify trends or practices that impair glycemic control, and it doesn't require a fasting period before blood is drawn. The nurse can't conclude that the result occurs from poor dietary management or inadequate insulin coverage. 11. Following a unilateral adrenalectomy, nurse Betty would assess for hyperkalemia shown by which of the following?a. Muscle weaknessb. Tremorsc. Diaphoresisd. Constipation A. Muscle weakness, bradycardia, nausea, diarrhea, and paresthesia of the hands, feet, tongue, and face are findings associated with hyperkalemia, which is transient and occurs from transient hypoaldosteronism when the adenoma is removed. Tremors, diaphoresis, and constipation aren't seen in hyperkalemia. 12. Nurse Louie is developing a teaching plan for a male client diagnosed with diabetes insipidus. The nurse should include information about which hormone lacking in clients with diabetes insipidus?a. antidiuretic hormone (ADH).b. thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).c. follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).d. luteinizing hormone (LH). A. ADH is the hormone clients with diabetes insipidus lack. The client's TSH, FSH, and LH levels won't be affected. 13. Early this morning, a female client had a subtotal thyroidectomy. During evening rounds, nurse Tina assesses the client, who now has nausea, a temperature of 105° F (40.5° C), tachycardia, and extreme restlessness. What is the most likely cause of these signs?a. Diabetic ketoacidosisb. Thyroid crisisc. Hypoglycemiad. Tetany B. Thyroid crisis usually occurs in the first 12 hours after thyroidectomy and causes exaggerated signs of hyperthyroidism, such as high fever, tachycardia, and extreme restlessness. Diabetic ketoacidosis is more likely to produce polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia; hypoglycemia, to produce weakness, tremors, profuse perspiration, and hunger. Tetany typically causes uncontrollable muscle spasms, stridor, cyanosis, and possibly asphyxia. 14. For a male client with hyperglycemia, which assessment finding best supports a nursing diagnosis of Deficient fluid volume?a. Cool, clammy skinb. Distended neck veinsc. Increased urine osmolarityd. Decreased serum sodium level C. In hyperglycemia, urine osmolarity (the measurement of dissolved particles in the urine) increases as glucose particles move into the urine. The client experiences glucosuria and polyuria, losing body fluids and experiencing fluid volume deficit. Cool, clammy skin; distended neck veins; and a decreased serum sodium level are signs of fluid volume excess, the opposite imbalance. 15. When assessing a male client with pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal medulla that secretes excessive catecholamine, nurse April is most likely to detect:a. a blood pressure of 130/70 mm Hg.b. a blood glucose level of 130 mg/dl.c. bradycardia.d. a blood pressure of 176/88 mm Hg. D. Pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal medulla that secretes excessive catecholamine, causes hypertension, tachycardia, hyperglycemia, hypermetabolism, and weight loss. It isn't associated with the other options. 16. A male client is admitted for treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Which nursing intervention is appropriate?a. Infusing I.V. fluids rapidly as orderedb. Encouraging increased oral intakec. Restricting fluidsd. Administering glucose-containing I.V. fluids as ordered C. To reduce water retention in a client with the SIADH, the nurse should restrict fluids. Administering fluids by any route would further increase the client's already heightened fluid load. 17. A female client has a serum calcium level of 7.2 mg/dl. During the physical examination, nurse Noah expects to assess:a. Trousseau's sign.b. Homans' sign.c. Hegar's sign.d. Goodell's sign. A. This client's serum calcium level indicates hypocalcemia, an electrolyte imbalance that causes Trousseau's sign (carpopedal spasm induced by inflating the blood pressure cuff above systolic pressure). Homans' sign (pain on dorsiflexion of the foot) indicates deep vein thrombosis. Hegar's sign (softening of the uterine isthmus) and Goodell's sign (cervical softening) are probable signs of pregnancy. 18. Which outcome indicates that treatment of a male client with diabetes insipidus has been effective?a. Fluid intake is less than 2,500 ml/day.b. Urine output measures more than 200 ml/hour.c. Blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg.d. The heart rate is 126 beats/minute. A. Diabetes insipidus is characterized by polyuria (up to 8 L/day), constant thirst, and an unusually high oral intake of fluids. Treatment with the appropriate drug should decrease both oral fluid intake and urine output. A urine output of 200 ml/hour indicates continuing polyuria. A blood pressure of 90/50 mm Hg and a heart rate of 126 beats/minute indicate compensation for the continued fluid deficit, suggesting that treatment hasn't been effective. 19. Jemma, who weighs 210 lb (95 kg) and has been diagnosed with hyperglycemia tells the nurse that her husband sleeps in another room because her snoring keeps him awake. The nurse notices that she has large hands and a hoarse voice. Which of the following would the nurse suspect as a possible cause of the client's hyperglycemia?a. Acromegalyb. Type 1 diabetes mellitusc. Hypothyroidismd. Deficient growth hormone A. Acromegaly, which is caused by a pituitary tumor that releases excessive growth hormone, is associated with hyperglycemia, hypertension, diaphoresis, peripheral neuropathy, and joint pain. Enlarged hands and feet are related to lateral bone growth, which is seen in adults with this disorder. The accompanying soft tissue swelling causes hoarseness and often sleep apnea. Type 1 diabetes is usually seen in children, and newly diagnosed persons are usually very ill and thin. Hypothyroidism isn't associated with hyperglycemia, nor is growth hormone deficiency. 20. Nurse Kate is providing dietary instructions to a male client with hypoglycemia. To control hypoglycemic episodes, the nurse should recommend:a. Increasing saturated fat intake and fasting in the afternoon.b. Increasing intake of vitamins B and D and taking iron supplements.c. Eating a candy bar if light-headedness occurs.d. Consuming a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet and avoiding fasting. D. To control hypoglycemic episodes, the nurse should instruct the client to consume a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet, avoid fasting, and avoid simple sugars. Increasing saturated fat intake and increasing vitamin supplementation wouldn't help control hypoglycemia. 21. An incoherent female client with a history of hypothyroidism is brought to the emergency department by the rescue squad. Physical and laboratory findings reveal hypothermia, hypoventilation, respiratory acidosis, bradycardia, hypotension, and nonpitting edema of the face and pretibial area. Knowing that these findings suggest severe hypothyroidism, nurse Libby prepares to take emergency action to prevent the potential complication of:a. Thyroid storm.b. Cretinism.c. myxedema coma.d. Hashimoto's thyroiditis. C. Severe hypothyroidism may result in myxedema coma, in which a drastic drop in the metabolic rate causes decreased vital signs, hypoventilation (possibly leading to respiratory acidosis), and nonpitting edema. Thyroid storm is an acute complication of hyperthyroidism. Cretinism is a form of hypothyroidism that occurs in infants. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland in which autoimmune factors play a prominent role. 22. A male client with type 1 diabetes mellitus asks the nurse about taking an oral antidiabetic agent. Nurse Jack explains that these medications are only effective if the client:a. prefers to take insulin orally.b. has type 2 diabetes.c. has type 1 diabetes.d. is pregnant and has type 2 diabetes. B. Oral antidiabetic agents are only effective in adult clients with type 2 diabetes. Oral antidiabetic agents aren't effective in type 1 diabetes. Pregnant and lactating women aren't prescribed oral antidiabetic agents because the effect on the fetus is uncertain. 23. When caring for a female client with a history of hypoglycemia, nurse Ruby should avoid administering a drug that may potentiate hypoglycemia. Which drug fits this description?a. sulfisoxazole (Gantrisin)b. mexiletine (Mexitil)c. prednisone (Orasone)d. lithium carbonate (Lithobid) A. Sulfisoxazole and other sulfonamides are chemically related to oral antidiabetic agents and may precipitate hypoglycemia. Mexiletine, an antiarrhythmic, is used to treat refractory ventricular arrhythmias; it doesn't cause hypoglycemia. Prednisone, a corticosteroid, is associated with hyperglycemia. Lithium may cause transient hyperglycemia, not hypoglycemia. 24. After taking glipizide (Glucotrol) for 9 months, a male client experiences secondary failure. Which of the following would the nurse expect the physician to do?a. Initiate insulin therapy.b. Switch the client to a different oral antidiabetic agent.c. Prescribe an additional oral antidiabetic agent.d. Restrict carbohydrate intake to less than 30% of the total caloric intake. B. Many clients (25% to 60%) with secondary failure respond to a different oral antidiabetic agent. Therefore, it wouldn't be appropriate to initiate insulin therapy at this time. However, if a new oral antidiabetic agent is unsuccessful in keeping glucose levels at an acceptable level, insulin may be used in addition to the antidiabetic agent. 25. During preoperative teaching for a female client who will undergo subtotal thyroidectomy, the nurse should include which statement?a. ""The head of your bed must remain flat for 24 hours after surgery.""b. ""You should avoid deep breathing and coughing after surgery.""c. ""You won't be able to swallow for the first day or two.""d. ""You must avoid hyperextending your neck after surgery."" D.To prevent undue pressure on the surgical incision after subtotal thyroidectomy, the nurse should advise the client to avoid hyperextending the neck. The client may elevate the head of the bed as desired and should perform deep breathing and coughing to help prevent pneumonia. Subtotal thyroidectomy doesn't affect swallowing. What is a hormone secreted from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland? Answers:A. LH B. MSH C. ADH D. GnRH . CADH is secreted from the posterior pituitary. LH comes from the anterior pituitary, MSH from the intermediate. GnRH is released from the hypothalamus. An indication of Chvostek' sign is: Answers:A. Twitching of the lips after tapping the face B. Elevated blood sugar after glucose infusion C. Inability to hold one's arms straight D. Spasms of the hand after blood circulation is cut off . ATwitching of the lips after tapping the face in the right place is an indication of Chvostek's sign and a sign of hypocalcaemia. Spasms of the hand are associated with Trousseau's sign. A 26 year old female client presents with the symptom of unwanted facial hair. What of the following conditions is most likely? Answers:A. Graves' disease B. PCOS C. Hyperthyroidism D. Addison's disease BPCOS is well known to cause hormonal irregularities in women which can result in hair growth. In explaining the condition to a client, a nurse would say that Cushing's syndrome is caused primarily by: Answers:A. Low levels of glucocorticoidsB. Excess secretion of sodium C. Autoimmunity in the pancreasD. Elevated levels of cortisol DCushing's syndrome is caused by elevated levels of cortisol. Glucocorticoids tend to cause this. Which of the following symptoms is not typical of Cushing's syndrome? Answers:A. Osteoporosis B. Weight loss C. Diabetes D. Mood instability BCushing's syndrome tends to produce rapid weight gain, not weight loss. Which of the following would be an indication of Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome? Answers:A. A 33 year old woman with a karyotype of XY B. A 16 year old male with reduced kidney functionC. Failure to respond to cortisol therapyD. Several pregnancies all of which ended in miscarriages AAndrogen Insensitivity Syndrome is when the body does not respond to androgens such as testosterone. This can result in genetic males being born with the appearance of women. A client presents with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, muscle cramps, and positive Trosseau's sign. What diagnosis does this support? Answers:A. Diabetes insipidus B. Conn's syndrome C. Hypoparathyroidism D. Acromegaly CHypoparathyroidism often leads to the symptoms mentioned. Conn's syndrome is an aldosterone-producing adenoma. A client with Graves' disease experiences a thyroid storm and has tachycardia and hypertension. What medication is most likely to be used? Answers:A. Levofloxcin B. Chlorothiazide C. Percocet D. Propylthiouracil . DPropylthiouracil is a commonly used medication for treating hyperthyroidism. Levofloxacin is an antibiotic, chlorothiazide is a diuretic, and Percocet a painkiller. Which of the following statements by a client with Type II Diabetes indicates the need for further education? Answers:A. I should avoid hot tubs B. I should aim for an HbA1C level of 5.5% C. I may need insulin at times D. My life expectancy is likely reduced by 10 years . BWhile an HbA1C level of 5.5% would be below the threshold for diabetes, it is an unrealistic target. Data has shown that trying to lower the HbA1C level too much can lead to an increase in complications. In educating a client, the nurse is likely to explain the following is the cause of Hashimoto's disease: Answers:A. Antibodies attacking the thyroid gland B. Inflammation in the kidneys C. An adenocarcinoma in the brain D. Overactivation of the pituitary gland AHashimoto's disease is caused by autoimmunity to the thyroid gland, often involving antibodies. Acromegaly is most frequently diagnosed in: a. Middle-aged adultsb. Newbornsc. Children ages 2 to 5d. Adults age 65 and older . A: Acromegaly results from benign tumors on the pituitary gland that produce excessive amounts of growth hormone. Although symptoms may present at any age, the diagnosis generally occurs in middle-aged persons. Untreated, the consequences of acromegaly include 2. Grave's disease is: a. The most common cause of hypothyroidismb. The most common cause of hyperparathyroidismc. The most common cause of hyperthyroidismd. The most common cause of adrenal insufficiency type 2 diabetes, hypertension and increased risk of cardiovascular disease, arthritis and colon polyps. 2. C: Grave's disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by an enlarged thyroid gland and overproduction of thyroid hormones producing symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as rapid heartbeat, heat intolerance, agitation or irritability, weight loss, and trouble sleeping. It usually presents in persons age 20 to 40 and it is much more common in women than in men. 3. Symptoms of Grave's ophthalmopathy include all of the following except: a. Bulging eyeballsb. Dry, irritated eyes and puffy eyelidsc. Cataracts d. Light sensitivity 3. C: Grave's ophthalmopathy is an inflammation of tissue behind the eye causing the eyeballs to bulge. In addition to the above-mentioned symptoms, Grave's ophthalmopathy may cause pressure or pain in the eyes, double vision, and trouble moving the eyes. About one-quarter of persons with Grave's disease develop Grave's ophthalmopathy. The condition is frequently self-limiting, resolving without treatment over the course of a year or two. 4. An ACTH stimulation test is commonly used to diagnose: a. Grave's diseaseb. Adrenal insufficiency and Addison's diseasec. Cystic fibrosisd. Hashimoto's disease 4. B: The ACTH stimulation test measures blood and urine cortisol before and after injection of ACTH. Persons with chronic adrenal insufficiency or Addison's disease generally do not respond with the expected increase in cortisol levels. An abnormal ACTH stimulation test may be followed with a CRH stimulation test to pinpoint the cause of adrenal insufficiency. 5. All of the following are symptoms of Cushing's syndrome except: a. Severe fatigue and weaknessb. Hypertension and elevated blood glucosec. A protruding hump between the shouldersd. Hair loss 5. D: Cushing's syndrome also may cause fragile, thin skin prone to bruises and stretch marks on the abdomen and thighs as well as excessive thirst and urination and mood changes such as depression and anxiety. Women who suffer from high levels of cortisol often have irregular menstrual cycles or amenorrhea and present with hair on their faces, necks, chests, abdomens, and thighs. 6. Which of the following conditions is caused by long-term exposure to high levels of cortisol? a. Addison's diseaseb. Crohn's diseasec. Adrenal insufficiencyd. Cushing's syndrome 6. D: Cushing's syndrome is a form of hypercortisolism. Risk factors for Cushing's syndrome are obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Cushing's syndrome is most frequently diagnosed in persons ages 20 to 50 who have characteristic round faces, upper body obesity, large necks, and relatively thin limbs. 7. A ""sweat test"" or newborn screening may be used to detect: a. Cystic fibrosisb. Adrenal insufficiencyc. Grave's diseased. Hypothyroidism 7. A: Cystic fibrosis is the most common inherited fatal disease of children and young adults in the United States. Cystic fibrosis is usually diagnosed by the time an affected child is three years old. Often, the only signs are a persistent cough, a large appetite but poor weight gain, an extremely salty taste to the skin, and large, foul-smelling bowel movements. A simple sweat test is currently the standard diagnostic test. The test measures the amount of salt in the sweat; abnormally high levels are the hallmark of the disorder. 8. Hashimoto's disease is: a. Chronic inflammation of the thyroid glandb. Diagnosed most frequently in Asian-Americans and Pacific Islandersc. A form of hyperthyroidismd. A rare form of hypothyroidism 8. A: Hashimoto's disease is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. It is an autoimmune disease that produces chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland. More women are affected than men and it is generally diagnosed in persons ages 40 to 60. When treatment is indicated, synthetic T4 is administered. 9. Persons at increased risk of developing Hashimoto's disease include all of the following except: a. Persons with vitiligob. Asian-Americansc. Persons with rheumatoid arthritisd. Persons with Addison's disease 9. B: Along with the above-mentioned groups, persons with type 1 diabetes and persons suffering from pernicious anemia (insufficient vitamin b12) are at increased risk of developing Hashimoto's disease. Because it tends to run in families, there is likely a genetic susceptibility as well. Environmental factors such as excessive iodine consumption and selected drugs also have been implicated as potential risk factors. 10. All of the following statements about Hashimoto's disease are true except: a. Many patients are entirely asymptomaticb. Not all patients become hypothyroidc. Most cases of obesity are attributable to Hashimoto's diseased. Hypothyroidism may be subclinical 10. C: Although weight gain may be a symptom of Hashimoto's disease, the majority of obese people have normal thyroid function; rarely is thyroid disorder the sole cause of obesity. Other symptoms of Hashimoto's disease include fatigue, cold intolerance, joint pain, myalgias, constipation, dry hair, skin and nails, impaired fertility, slow heart rate, and depression. 11. The most common benign tumor of the pituitary gland is a: a. Gliomab Prolactinomac. Carcinoid tumord. Islet cell tumor 11. B: Prolactinomas can cause symptoms by releasing excessive amounts of prolactin into the blood or mechanically by pressing on surrounding tissues. In women, symptoms may include menstrual irregularities and infertility; in men erectile dysfunction and libido may be impaired. 12. Symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) may include all of the following except: a. Pelvic painb. Acne, oily skin, and dandruffc. Infertilityd. Weight Loss 12. D: In addition to the above-mentioned symptoms, PCOS may cause menstrual irregularities, thinning hair or male-pattern baldness, thick skin or dark patches of skin and excessive hair growth on the face, chest, abdomen, thumbs and toes. 13. Women with PCOS are at increased risk for all of the following except: a. Pregnancy b. Diabetesc. Cardiovascular diseased. Metabolic syndrome 13. A: Women with PCOS produce excessive amounts of androgens and do not release ova during ovulation, which seriously compromises their ability to conceive. Although women with PCOS can become pregnant, often by using assistive reproductive technology, they are at increased risk for miscarriage. 14. All of the following organs may be affected by multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 except: a. Parathyroid glandsb. Kidneysc. Pancreas and Duodenumd. Pituitary gland 14. B: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, also known as Werner's syndrome, is a heritable disorder that causes tumors in endocrine glands and the duodenum. Although the tumors associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 are generally benign, they can produce symptoms chemically by releasing excessive amounts of hormones or mechanically by pressing on adjacent tissue. 15. What is the treatment for hyperparathyroidism? a. Synthetic thyroid hormoneb. Desiccated thyroid hormonec. Surgical removal of the glandsd. Calcium and phosphate 15. C: When hyperparathyroidism requires treatment, surgery is the treatment of choice and is considered curative for 95% of cases. Because untreated hyperparathyroidism may elevate blood and urine levels of calcium and deplete phosphorus, bones and teeth may lose the minerals needed to remain strong. 16. The most common causes of death in people with cystic fibrosis is: a. Dehydrationb. Opportunistic infectionc. Lung cancerd. Respiratory failure 16. D: Declining pulmonary function is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis. Drugs such as Pulmozyme (dornase alfa) and Zithromax (azithromycin) can slow the progression of lung disease and mechanical physical therapy devices help CF patients to breathe more easily by loosening and dislodging mucus. For some patients with severe lung damage, lung transplantation is a treatment option. 17. Untreated hyperthyroidism during pregnancy may result in all of the following except: a. Premature birth and miscarriageb. Low birthweightc. Autismd. Preeclampsia 17. C: In addition to the above-mentioned complications of uncontrolled hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, expectant mothers may suffer congestive heart failure and thyroid storm, which is life-threatening thyrotoxicosis with symptoms that include agitation, confusion, tachycardia, shaking, sweating, diarrhea, fever, and restlessness. 18. Short stature and undeveloped ovaries suggest which of the following disorders: a. Polycystic ovarian syndromeb. Prolactinomac. Grave's diseased. Turner syndrome 18. D: Turner syndrome results from a chromosomal abnormality and occurs in an estimated 1 in 2,500 female births. It occurs more frequently in preterm pregnancies. Affected women are shorter than average and are infertile because they lack ovarian function. They also may have webbed necks, broad chests, arms that turn out from the elbow, lymphedema of the hands and feet and skeletal, cardiac, and renal problems. 19. Endocrine disorders may be triggered by all of the following except: a. Stressb. Infectionc. Chemicals in the food chain and environmentd. Cell phone use 19. D: Endocrine function may be influenced by myriad factors. In addition to the above-mentioned, there is evidence that exposure to naturally occurring and man-made endocrine disruptors such as tributyltin, certain bioaccumulating chlorinated compounds, and phytoestrogens is widespread and in susceptible individuals, may trigger endocrine disorders. 20. An analysis of data from the Women's Health Initiative questioned the use of which therapy to prevent heart disease? a. Synthetic thyroid hormoneb. Oral contraceptivesc. Weight-loss drugsd. Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy 20. D: The results of the Women's Health Initiative study prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to advise against using hormone therapy (estrogen-alone or estrogen-plus-progestin) to prevent heart disease. When hormone replacement therapy is used to treat moderate to severe hot flashes and symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy it should used at the lowest doses for the shortest duration needed to achieve treatment objectives. The parathyroid glands play a major role in regulating which substances?A. Calcium and PhosphorusB. Cholride and potassiumC. Potassium and calciumD. Sodium and potassium a. Calcium and Phosphorus The primary function of insuln is to:A. Lower blood glucose levelsB. Produce melaninC. regulate the bodys metabolic rateD. stimulate release of digestive enzymes a client is admitted to the hospital with a medical DX of hyerthyroidism. When taking a history which information would be most significant?A. edema, intolerance to cold, lethargyb. peri-orbital edema, lethargy mask like facec. weight loss, intolerance to cold, muscle wastingd. weight loss, intolerance to heat, exophthalmos Which nursing action is most appropriate for a client in ketoacidosis?a. admin of carbsb. admin of IV fluidsc. applying cold compressd. giving glucagon IV The nurse smells a sweet fruity odor on the breath of a client admitted with DM. This odor may be associated with?a. alcohol intoxicationb. insulin shockc. ketoacidosis A client asks what the purpose of the Hb A1c test is. The nurses best explanation would be that the test measures the average:a. blood sugar lvl's over a 6-10 week periodb. hemoglobin lvl's over a 6 - 10 week periodc. protien lvl over a 3 month periodd. vanillylmandelic acid lvl's which of the following would be a nursing priority for a client just DX with Addison's disease?a. avioding unnecessary activityb. encouraging client to wear a med alert tagc. ensuring the client is adequatly hydratedd. explaining that the client will need life long hormone therapy A nurse is caring for a client in the late stage of Ketoacidosis. The nurse notices that the clients breath has a characteristic fruity odor. Which of the following substances is responsible for the fruity smell in the breath?a. iodineb. acetonec.alcohold. glucose A nurse is caring for a client with Addison's disease. Which of the following mursing considerations shoul dbe employed when caring for this client?a. avoid sodium in the clients dietb. monitor and protect skin integrityc. document the specific gravity of urined. monitor increases in blood pressure A nurse is assigned to care for and monitor any complications in a 40 yr client with chronic diabetes. Which of the following is a macrovascular complication of diabetes.a. neuropathyb. retinopathyc. nephropathyd. Arteriosclerosis A nurse is instructing a 50yr diabetic client about the steps to be followed for self admin of insulin. Which of the following instructions should be included in te client teaching?a. instruct client to aviod injections to the abdomenb. encourage client to always inject insulin in the same sitec. inform client about the type of syringe to used. encourage client to do active exercise after injection A nurse is preparing a diet plan for a 50yr with simple goiter. Which of the following should be included in teh clients diet to decrease the enlargement of he thyroid gland?a. iodineb. sodiumc. potassiumd. calcium A nurse is caring for a 60yr client affected with hypoparathyroidism. When checking the lab report, the nurse finds tht the clients calcium lvl was very low. Which of the following vitamins regulates teh calcium lvl in the body?a. Ab. Dc. Ed. K A client presents to the emergency room with a history of Graves' disease. The client reports having symptoms for a few days, but has not previously sought or received any additional treatment. The client also reports having had a cold a few days back. Which of the following interventions would be appropriate to implement for this client, based on the history and current symptoms? Select all that apply. Administer aspirin Replace intravenous fluids Induce shivering Relieve respiratory distress Administer a cooling blanket Replace intravenous fluids Induce shivering Relieve respiratory distress Administer a cooling blanket Rationale: Thyroid storm (also called thyroid crisis) is an extreme state of hyperthyroidism that is rare today because of improved diagnosis and treatment methods (Porth, 2005). When it does occur, those affected are usually people with untreated hyperthyroidism (most often Graves' disease) and people with hyperthyroidism who have experienced a stressor, such as an infection, trauma. The rapid increase in metabolic rate that results from the excessive TH causes the manifestations of thyroid storm. The manifestations include hyperthermia, with body temperatures ranging from 102°F (39°C) to 106°F (41°C); tachycardia; systolic hypertension; and gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea). Agitation, restlessness, and tremors are common, progressing to confusion, psychosis, delirium, and seizures. The mortality rate is high. Rapid treatment of thyroid storm is essential to preserve life. Treatment includes cooling without aspirin (which increases free TH) or inducing shivering, replacing fluids, glucose, and electrolytes, relieving respiratory distress, stabilizing cardiovascular function, and reducing TH synthesis and secretion. #1 is incorrect because cooling happens without the use of aspirin. All of the other choices are correct. A nursing student is studying for a test on care of the client with endocrine disorders. Which of the following statements demonstrates an understanding of the difference between hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism? ""Deficient amounts of TH cause abnormalities in lipid metabolism, with decreased serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels."" ""Graves' disease is the most common cause of hypothyroidism."" ""Decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate reduces the kidney's ability to excrete water, which may cause hyponatremia."" ""Increased amounts of TH cause a decrease in cardiac output and peripheral blood flow."" Correct Answer: ""Decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate reduces the kidney's ability to excrete water, which may cause hyponatremia."" Rationale: # 1 is incorrect because deficient amounts of TH cause abnormalities in lipid metabolism with elevated serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. # 2 is incorrect because Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, not hypothyroidism. # 4 is incorrect because increased amounts of TH cause an increase in cardiac output and peripheral blood flow. A Clinical Instructor is questioning a student nurse about disorders of the parathyroid glands. Which statement by the nursing student, would indicate the need for further teaching? ""Hyperparathyroidism results in an increased release of calcium and phosphorus by bones, with resultant bone decalcification."" ""Hyperparathyroidism results in deposits in soft tissues and the formation of renal calculi."" ""Hypoparathyroidism results in impaired renal tubular regulation of calcium and phosphate."" ""Hypoparathyroidism results in decreased activation of vitamin D which then results in decreased absorption of calcium by the pancreas."" ""Hypoparathyroidism results in decreased activation of vitamin D which then results in decreased absorption of calcium by the pancreas."" Rationale: Choices 1, 2, and 3 are all correct statements. # 4 demonstrates a need for further teaching because hypoparathyroidism results in decreased activation of vitamin D which then results in decreased absorption of calcium by the intestines, not the pancreas. A nurse on a general medical-surgical unit is caring for a client with Cushing's syndrome. Which of the following statements is correct about the medication regimen for Cushing's syndrome? Mitotane is used to treat metastatic adrenal cancer. Aminogluthimide may be administered to clients with ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors before surgery is performed. Ketoconazole increases cortisol synthesis by the adrenal cortex. Somatostatin analog increases ACTH secretion in some clients. Mitotane is used to treat metastatic adrenal cancer. Rationale: Mitotane directly suppresses activity of the adrenal cortex and decreases peripheral metabolism of corticosteroids. It is used to treat metastatic adrenal cancer. # 2 is incorrect because aminogluthimide may be administered to clients with ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors that cannot be surgically removed. # 3 is incorrect because ketoconazole inhibits, not increases, cortisol synthesis by the adrenal cortex. # 4 is incorrect because somatostatin suppresses, not increases, ACTH secretion. Which of the following nursing implications is most important in a client being medicated for Addison's disease? Administer oral forms of the drug with food to minimize its ulcerogenic effect. Monitor capillary blood glucose for hypoglycemia in the diabetic client. Instruct the client to never abruptly discontinue the medication. Teach the client to consume a diet that is high in potassium, low in sodium, and high in protein. Instruct the client to never abruptly discontinue the medication. Rationale: The primary medical treatment of Addison's disease is replacement of corticosteroids and mineralcorticoids, accompanied by increased sodium in the diet. The client needs to know the importance of maintaining a diet high is sodium and low in potassium. Medications should never be discontinued abruptly because crisis can ensue. Oral forms of the drug are given with food in Cushing's disease. A nurse on a surgical floor is caring for a post-operative client who has just had a subtotal thyroidectomy. Which of the following assessments should be completed first on the client? Assess for signs of tetany by checking for Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs Assess dressing (if present) and the area under the client's neck and shoulders for drainage. Administer analgesic pain medications as ordered, and monitor their effectiveness. Assess respiratory rate, rhythm, depth, and effort. Assess respiratory rate, rhythm, depth, and effort. Rationale: All of the above assessments have importance, but airway and breathing in a client should always be addressed first when prioritizing care. Assess for signs of latent tetany due to calcium deficiency, including tingling of toes, fingers, and lips; muscular twitches; positive Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs; and decreased serum calcium levels. However, tetany may occur in 1 to 7 days after thyroidectomy so # 1 is not the highest priority. Assessing for hemorrhage is always important, but the danger of hemorrhage is greatest in the first 12 to 24 hours after surgery, and as this client is immediately post operative it is not the main concern at this time. Pain medication is important but according to Maslow, pain is a psychosocial need to be addressed after a physiologic need. The nurse is caring for a client who is about to undergo an adrenalectomy. Which of the following Preoperative interventions is most appropriate for this client? Maintain careful use of medical and surgical asepsis when providing care and treatments. Teach the client about a diet high in sodium to correct any potential sodium imbalances preoperatively. Explain to the client that electrolytes and glucose levels will be measured postoperatively. Teach the client how to effectively cough and deep breathe once surgery is complete. Maintain careful use of medical and surgical asepsis when providing care and treatments. Rationale: Use careful medical and surgical asepsis when providing care and treatments since Cortisol excess increases the risk of infection. # 2 is incorrect. Nutrition should be addressed preoperatively. Request a dietary consultation to discuss with the client about a diet high in vitamins and proteins. If hypokalemia exists, include foods high in potassium. Glucocorticoid excess increases catabolism. Vitamins and proteins are necessary for tissue repair and wound healing following surgery. # 3 is incorrect. Monitor the results of laboratory tests of electrolytes and glucose levels. Electrolyte and glucose imbalances are corrected The nurse is caring for a client with pheochromocytoma. Which of the following must be included in planning the nursing care for this client ? Monitor blood pressure frequently, assessing for hypertension. Assess only for physical stressors present. Collect a random urine sample. Prepare the client for chemotherapy to shrink the tumor. Monitor blood pressure frequently, assessing for hypertension. Rationale: Pheochromocytomas are tumors of chromaffin tissues in the adrenal medulla. These tumors which are usually benign produce catecholamines (epinephrine or norepinephrine) that stimulate the sympathetic nervous system. Although many organs are affected, the most dangerous effects are peripheral vasoconstriction and increased cardiac rate and contractility with resultant paroxysmal hypertension. Systolic blood pressure may rise to 200 to 300 mmHg, the diastolic to 150 to 175 mmHg. # 1 is correct because the careful monitoring of blood pressure is essential. Attacks are often precipitated by physical, emotional, or environmental stimuli, so # 2 is incorrect because more than physical stressors are considered. This condition is life threatening and is usually treated with surgery as the preferred treatment. # 3 is incorrect because it is a random sample and not a 24 hour urine collection. Because catecholamine secretion is episodic, a 24-hour urine is a better surveillance method than serum catecholamines. (Pagana & Pagana, 2002). Surgical removal of the tumor(s) by adrenalectomy is the treatment of choice. # 4 is incorrect because surgery would be the treatment usually completed. A client newly diagnosed with Addison's disease is giving a return explanation of teaching done by the primary nurse. Which of the following statements indicates that further teaching is necessary? ""I need to increase how much I drink each day."" ""I need to weigh myself if I think I am losing or gaining weight."" ""I need to maintain a diet high in sodium and low in potassium."" ""I need to take my medications each day."" ""I need to weigh myself if I think I am losing or gaining weight."" The client is at risk for ineffective therapeutic regimen management. Clients with Addison's disease must learn to provide lifelong self-care that involves varied components: medications, diet, and recognizing and responding to stress. Changes in lifestyle are difficult to maintain permanently. The client needs to take the medications on a daily basis. The client needs to perform daily weights to monitor for signs of dehydration. The client needs to maintain a diet high in sodium and low in potassium, as well as maintain an increased fluid intake. # 2 is incorrect because daily weights need to be performed instead of weighing when a problem is suspected. . The nurse assessing a female client with Cushing's syndrome would expect to note which of the following?a) hirsutismb) hypotensionc) hypoglycemiad) pallor 1) A- An increased production of androgens that accompanies a rise in cortisol levels with Cushing's syndrome produces hirsutism and acne in women. Other clinical findings of Cushing's syndrome include hypertension caused by sodium retention, impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus caused by cortisol's anti-insulin effect and ability to enhance gluconeogenesis, and skin changes including bruising and purplish red striae caused by protein catabolism. 2. A nurse is admitting a client with a diagnosis of Addison's disease to the hospital. On assessment, the nurse would expect to note which finding that is a manifestation of this disorder?a) peripheral edemab) excessive facial hairc) lower than normal blood glucose leveld) high blood pressure 2) C- Blood glucose levels are low in Addison's disease as a result of decreased secretion of glucocorticoids (cortisol). Edema is absent, and aldosterone secretion is decreased so the client develops a deficient fluid volume. Facial hair increases with adrenocortical hyperfunction. Clients with Addison's disease develop hypotension as a result of deficient fluid volume. Options A, B and D are unrelated to Addison's disease. 3. A nurse is preparing to perform an assessment on a client being admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. When performing the assessment, the nurse checks for which significant manifestation of the disorder?a) fluid retentionb) stretch marksc) goiterd) melanosis 3) A- Excessive secretion of adrenocortical hormones results in water and sodium reabsorption, causing fluid retention. Stretch marks (striae) are a common feature and can result in a disturbed body image, but are not significant and do not represent a life-threatening situation. Goiter is not a manifestation of Cushing's syndrome. Melanosis is a common manifestation associated with Addison's disease. 4. A clinic nurse is performing an assessment on a client who has hypothyroidism. The nurse would expect to note which clinical manifestation?a) complaints of difficulty sleepingb) complaints of diarrheac) significant weight loss since the last clinic visitd) complaints of intolerance to cold weather 4) D- An insufficient level of thyroid hormone causes a decrease in metabolic rate and heat production. Intolerance to cold would be noted. Options A, B and C are clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism. 5. A clinic nurse is performing an assessment on a client recently diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Which assessment question is appropriate when assessing the client's degree of adaptation to this disorder?a) you really don't think you caused your disorder, do you?b) your family is helping you stick to your diet, aren't they?c) how do you feel about your progress?d) are you feeling anxious? 5) COpen-ended questions allow the client to take the lead in the conversation. Options A and B denote judgment and may block communication. Option D allows the client to answer with a yes or no response and does not provide the client an opportunity to share feelings. Option C is open-ended and focuses on the subject of the question, the client's degree of adaptation to the disorder. . A client has been diagnosed with goiter. The nurse looks for documentation of which of the following in the client's medical record?a) decreased wound healingb) chronic fatiguec) enlarged thyroid glandd) heart damage 6) C- An enlarged thyroid gland occurs in goiter. Decreased wound healing, chronic fatigue, and heart damage are not specifically associated with this condition. 7. A nurse is assessing a lethargic client who was brought to the emergency department by emergency medical services and notes a fruity odor to the client's breath. The nurse immediately suspects that the client has: a) hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS)b) diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)c) ethanol oxide intoxicationd) hypoglycemia 7) B- Clients with DKA accumulate large amounts of ketone bodies in extracellular fluids. A fruity odor to the breath develops due to the volatile nature of acetone. A fruity odor is not a manifestation associated with the conditions noted in options A, C, and D. 8. A nurse is caring for a client following thyroidectomy and is monitoring for complications. Which of the following if noted in the client, would indicate a need for physician notification? a) surgical pain in the neck areab) voice hoarsenessc) numbness and tingling around the mouthd) weakness of the voice 8) C- Hypocalcemia can develop after thyroidectomy if the parathyroid glands are accidentally removed or traumatized during surgery. If the client develops numbness and tingling around the mouth or in the fingertips or toes, muscle spasms, or twitching, the physician should be called immediately. A hoarse or weak voice may occur temporarily if there has been unilateral injury to the laryngeal nerve during surgery. Pain is expected in the postoperative period. Calcium gluconate ampules should be available at the bedside, and the client should have a patent intravenous (IV) line in the event that hypocalcemic tetany occurs 9. A nurse is monitoring a client for complications following thyroidectomy. The nurse notes that the client's voice is very hoarse, and the client is concerned about the hoarseness and asks the nurse about it. The nurse makes which response to alleviate the client's concern?a) hoarseness and weak voice indicate permanent damage to the nervesb) this complication is expectedc) this problem is temporary and will probably subside in a few daysd) it is best that you not talk at all until the problem is further evaluated 9) CTemporary hoarseness and a weak voice may occur if there has been unilateral injury to the laryngeal nerve during surgery. If hoarseness or a weak voice is present, the client is reassured that the problem will probably subside in a few days. Unnecessary talking is discouraged to minimize hoarseness. The statements in options A, B, and D will not alleviate the client's concern. 10. A nurse provides dietary instructions to a client with a diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism. Which statement by the client indicates the need for further instructions?a) I need to drink 3000 ml of fluid per dayb) I should drink cranberry juice dailyc) I should eat foods high in calciumd) I should eat foods high in fiber 10) C- The client with hyperparathyroidism should consume at least 3000 mL of fluid per day. Measures to prevent dehydration are necessary because dehydration increases serum calcium levels and promotes the formation of renal stones. Cranberry juice and prune juice help make the urine more acidic. A high urinary acidity helps prevent renal stone formation because calcium is more soluble in acidic urine than in alkaline urine. Clients should be on a low-calcium, low-vitamin D diet. High-fiber foods are important to prevent constipation and fecal impaction resulting from the hypercalcemia that occurs with this disorder. 16. A nurse is caring for a client with hyperthyroidism and is instructing the client about dietary measures. The nurse tells the client that it is important to eat foods that are:a) high in bulk and fiberb) low in caloriesc) low in carbohydrates and fatsd) high in calories 16) D- The client with hyperthyroidism is usually extremely hungry because of increased metabolism. The client should be instructed to consume a high-calorie diet with six full meals a day. The client should be instructed to eat foods that are nutritious and contain ample amounts of protein, carbohydrates, fats, and minerals. Clients should be discouraged from eating foods that increase peristalsis and thus result in diarrhea, such as highly seasoned, bulky, and fibrous foods. 17. A client with type 1 diabetes mellitus tells the nurse that mealtimes are not important and that she eats whenever it is convenient. It is important for the nurse to explain that mealtimes:a) must be approximately the same time each day to maintain a stable blood glucoseb) can be varied as long as the time of insulin administration is also variedc) are not important as long as the client monitors the blood glucose regularlyd) are not important as long as snack foods are readily available 17) A- It is important for clients with type 1 diabetes mellitus to correlate eating with insulin administration to prevent hypoglycemia. Insulin should be given at approximately the same time each day, and meals should be eaten at approximately the same time each day. This will establish regular patterns of glucose availability that approximate glucose availability in a nondiabetic body. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they infer that mealtimes are not important. 18. A client with type 1 diabetes mellitus tells the nurse, ""I usually begin to feel sick late in the afternoon; is there something wrong with me?"" The appropriate response by the nurse is which of the following?a) don't worry about that. Most diabetics feel that wayb) can you describe what you mean by feeling sick?c) let me know if that happens todayd) most people feel tired late in the afternoon 18) B- An excess of insulin relative to the amount of blood glucose induces hypoglycemia. Depending on the length of action of the insulin administered, the risk of hypoglycemia may be greatest in the late afternoon. The nurse needs to collect more data to determine if the client is actually experiencing hypoglycemia. Asking the client to describe the sick feeling provides the nurse with more data. Options A, C, and D are nontherapeutic communication statements. 19. A nurse is gathering data from a client newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus concerning events leading to the client's seeking medical attention. The nurse identifies which of the following as the major symptoms of diabetes mellitus?a) polydipsia, polyuria, and polyphagiab) dyspepsia, polyuria, and polyphagiac) hypoglycemia, polyuria, and dysphagiad) hypoglycemia, polyuria, and dysphasia 19) A- Polydipsia, polyuria, and polyphagia are the classic signs and symptoms of diabetes mellitus. Dyspepsia, dysphagia, and dysphasia are associated with other body systems (gastric and neurological). Hyperglycemia also occurs. 20. A husband of a client with graves' disease expresses concern regarding his wife's health because during the past 3 months she has been experiencing nervousness, inability to concentrate even on trivial tasks, and outbursts of temper. On the basis of this information, which nursing diagnosis would the nurse identify as appropriate for the client?a) ineffective copingb) disturbed sensory perceptionc) social isolationd) grieving 20) A- Frequently, family and friends may report that the client with Graves' disease has become more irritable or depressed. The signs and symptoms in the question are supporting data for the nursing diagnosis of Ineffective coping and are not related to options B, C, and D. The question does not provide data to support options B, C, and D. 21. A nurse is caring for a client with hypoparathyroidism. In planning for discharge from the hospital, the nurse identifies which of the following as a potential psychosocial nursing diagnosis?a) impaired comfort related to cold intolerance secondary to decreased metabolic rateb) constipation related to decreased peristaltic action secondary to decreased metabolic ratec) high risk for impaired skin integrity related to edemad) anxiety related to the need for lifelong dietary interventions to control the disease 21) D- Medical management of hypoparathyroidism is aimed at correcting the hypocalcemia. This is accomplished with prescribed medications as well as lifelong compliance to dietary guidelines, which include consumption of foods high in calcium but low in phosphorus. Knowing that the interventions are lifelong can create some anxiety for the client, and this problem needs to be addressed before hospital discharge. The other options are unrelated to this condition and to a psychosocial concern. 22. A nurse is caring for a hospitalized older client with a diagnosis of dehydration who also has diabetes mellitus. The client is alert but disoriented, pale, and slightly diaphoretic, and the nurse suspects that the client is hypoglycemic. The initial nursing intervention would be to:a) administer oral glucoseb) assist the client to bed, put the side rails up, and call the physicianc) seat the client at the nurse's desk while checking the physician's orderd) obtain a fingerstick blood specimen and test the glucose level 22) D- The nurse should confirm that the client is hypoglycemic by checking the blood glucose. Option A is incorrect because hypoglycemia has not been determined. More information should be gathered before calling the physician, so option B is incorrect. Option C does not meet the client's immediate needs. 23. An adult client with diabetes mellitus reports to the health care clinic for a glycosylated hemoglobin A (HgbA1c) level. Which laboratory result indicates client compliance with the prescribed diabetic regimen?a) 5%b) 8%c) 10%d) 15% 23) A- The normal level for HgbA1C is 4.5% to 7.5%. This test measures the amount of glucose that has become permanently bound to the red blood cells from circulating glucose. Elevations in blood glucose will cause elevations in the amount of glycosylation. Elevations indicate continued need for teaching related to prevention of hyperglycemic episodes. 24. A client is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and is started on glyburide (Micronase) 2.5 mg orally. The client smiles and says, ""Oh, good, as long as I take this pill I can eat whatever I want."" In this situation, the nurse's intervention is focused on addressing which coping mechanism?a) denialb) angerc) depressiond) acceptance 24) A- The client is denying the experience of a chronic illness that will require her to make lifestyle changes. There is no evidence of anger or depression in the statement made by the client. The client has not accepted the disease if expectations are unrealistic. 25. A client newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital for evaluation and control of the disease. When analyzing the assessment data, which of the following would the nurse likely expect to find?a) hyperglycemiab) hypoglycemiac) weight gaind) hematuria 25) A- Hyperglycemia is characteristic of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Newly diagnosed diabetic clients present a variety of symptoms, which may include polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, weakness, weight loss, and dehydration. 26. A client with diabetes mellitus says that it is very difficult to adhere to the diabetic treatment plan. The nurse interprets the client's concern and determines that the appropriate response is:a) if you don't take your insulin you will develop diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)b) let's go over your diet again to be sure it contains foods you likec) do you understand what noncompliance can mean to your future health?d) let's check your blood glucose now 26) B- It is important to determine and deal with a client's concerns and to identify measures that will assist the client to comply with the diabetic regimen. The nurse should determine if a knowledge deficit exists and if the client's treatment plan maintains normalcy as much as is possible with the lifestyle. Scare tactics as described in options A and C should not be used. Positive reinforcement is necessary instead of focusing on negative behaviors. Option D does not address the subject of the question. 27. A nurse provides instructions to a client who is scheduled for a radioactive iodine uptake test. Which statement by the client indicates a need for further instructions?a) the test measures the rate of iodine uptake by my thyroid glandb) I will need to drink a small dose of radioactive iodine before the testc) a 24 hour urine specimen will need to be collected to measure iodine excretiond) I need to minimize close contact with others in my family for a period of 48 hours after the test because of the radioactivity in my system 27) D- The client undergoing a radioactive iodine uptake test needs to be reassured that the amount of radioactive iodine used is very small, that it is not harmful to the client, and that the client will not be radioactive. The other options are correct regarding this diagnostic test. 28. A nurse receives a report that an adult client with delirium has a blood glucose level of 33 mg/dL. The nurse analyzes this report as:a) higher than normal, indicating a cause of the deliriumb) a normal reading for this clientc) a lower than normal reading, indicating a cause for the deliriumd) insignificant and unrelated to the delirium 28) C- Blood glucose levels for an adult normally range between 60 and 120 mg/dL. A level of 33 mg/dL indicates hypoglycemia. Metabolic disorders can be an etiological factor of delirium. 29. A nurse is caring for a client with Cushing's syndrome who demonstrates withdrawn behavior. The nurse recognizes that this client's behavior is likely related to which nursing diagnosis? a) deficient diversional activityb) powerlessnessc) hopelessnessd) disturbed body image 29) D- Physical changes in the client's appearance can occur with Cushing's syndrome. Such changes include hirsutism, moon face, buffalo hump, acne, and striae. These changes cause a body image disturbance. Options A, B, and C are not commonly associated with Cushing's syndrome. 30. A client with Addison's disease makes all of the following statements. Which one does the nurse analyze as requiring further discussion?a) I wear a Medic-Alert bracelet at all timesb) I need to weigh myself daily and record itc) It is important that I drink enough fluids and increase my salt intaked) my medication doses will not need to be adjusted for any reason 30) D- The client with Addison's disease is experiencing deficits of mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. Aldosterone deficiency affects the ability of the nephrons to conserve sodium, so the client experiences sodium and fluid volume deficit. The client needs to manage this problem with daily hormone replacement and increased fluid and sodium intake. Clients are instructed to weigh themselves daily as a means of monitoring fluid volume balance. Glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids are essential components of the stress response. Additional doses of hormone replacement therapy are needed with any type of physical or psychological stressor. This information needs to be conveyed to the client and requires that the client wear a Medic-Alert bracelet so that health care professionals are aware of this problem if the client were to experience a medical emergency. A client is admitted for removal of a goiter. Which nursing intervention should receive priority during the post-operative period? A. Maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance B. Assessing the client's airway C. Providing needed nutrition and fluids D. Providing pain relief with narcotic analgesics Answer B is correct. A goiter is hyperplasia of the thyroid gland. Removal of a goiter can result in laryngeal spasms and airway occlusion. The other answers are lesser in priority. A client is admitted for treatment of hypoparathyroidism. Based on the client's diagnosis, the nurse would anticipate an order for: A. Potassium B. Magnesium C. Calcium D. Iron Answer C is correct. The parathyroid is responsible for calcium and phosphorus absorption. Clients with hypoparathyroidism have hypocalcemia. Answers A, B, and D are not associated with hypoparathyroidism therefore they are incorrect. A client with Addison's disease will most likely exhibit which symptom? A. Hypertension B. Bronze pigmentation C. Hirsutism D. Purple striae Answer B is correct. Answer B is correct because a bronze pigmentation is a sign of Addison's disease. Answers A, C, and D are symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, making them incorrect. A client with Cushing's syndrome should be instructed to: A. Avoid alcoholic beverages B. Limit the sodium in her diet C. Increase servings of dark green vegetables D. Limit the amount of protein in her diet Answer B is correct. A client with Cushing's syndrome has adrenocortical hypersecretion, so she retains sodium and water. The client may drink alcohol in moderation, so answer A is incorrect, and there is no need to eat more green vegetables or limit protein, so answers C and D are incorrect. The client with a suspected pituitary tumor will most likely exhibit symptoms of: A. Alteration in visual acuity B. Frequent diarrhea C. Alterations in blood glucose D. Urticaria Answer A is correct. The pituitary is located in the middle of the skull adjacent to the optic nerve and brain. Pressure on the optic nerve can cause an increase in intracranial pressure. Clients frequently complain of headache, nausea, vomiting, and decreasing visual acuity as the intracranial pressure increases. B, C, and D are incorrect because they are not associated with a pituitary tumor. A diabetic client has been maintained on Glucophage (metformin) for regulation of his blood glucose levels. Which teaching should be included in the plan of care? A. Report changes in urinary pattern. B. Allow six weeks for optimal effects. C. Increase the amount of carbohydrates in your diet. D. Use lotions to treat itching. Answer A is correct. Glucophage (metformin) can cause renal complications. The client should be monitored for changes in renal function. In answer B, the medication begins working immediately, so it is incorrect. In answer C, the amount of carbohydrates should be regulated with a diabetic diet, so it is incorrect. The use of lotions in answer D is unnecessary, so it is incorrect. A client with diabetes experiences Somogyi's effect. To prevent this complication, the nurse should instruct the client to: A. Take his insulin each day at 1400 hours B. Engage in physical activity daily C. Increase the amount of regular insulin D. Eat a protein and carbohydrate snack at bedtime Answer D is correct. Somogyi's is characterized by a drop in glucose levels at approximately 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. followed by a false elevation. Eating a protein and carbohydrate snack before retiring prevents the hypoglycemia and rebound elevation. Answers A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not prevent Somogyi's effect. Which item should be kept at the bedside of a client who has just returned from having a thyroidectomy? A. A padded tongue B. An endotracheal tube C. An airway D. A tracheostomy set Answer D is correct. Laryngeal swelling is not uncommon in clients following a thyroidectomy. A tracheostomy tray should be kept available. The ventilator is not necessary, so answer A is incorrect. The endotracheal tube is very difficult, if not impossible, to intubate if swelling has already occurred, so answer B is incorrect. The airway will do no good because the swelling is in the trachea, so answer C is incorrect. Which vitamin is directly involved in the metabolism of the hormones secreted by the parathyroid? A. Vitamin C B. Vitamin D C. Vitamin K D. Vitamin B9 Answer B is correct. Vitamin D is related to absorption of calcium and phosphorus. A, C, and D are incorrect because they are not related to the absorption of calcium and phosphorus. A client with acromegaly will most likely experience which symptom? A. Bone pain B. Frequent infections C. Fatigue D. Weight loss Answer A is correct. Acromegaly is an increase in secretion of growth hormone. The growth hormones cause expansion and elongation of the bones. Answers B, C, and D are not directly associated with acromegaly, so they are incorrect. A diabetic client is taking Lantus insulin for regulation of his blood glucose levels. The nurse should know that this insulin will most likely be administered: A. Prior to each meal B. At night C. Midday D. Prior to the evening meal Answer B is correct. This insulin, unlike others, is most frequently administered at night. Its duration is 24-36 hours. A, C, and D are incorrect they are incorrect times to administer Lantus insulin. A client with polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia is diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. The nurse would expect that these symptoms are related to A. Hypoglycemia B. Hyperglycemia C. Hyperparathyroidism D. Hyperthyroidism Answer B is correct. The client with hyperglycemia will exhibit polyuria, polydipsia, or increased thirst, and polyphagia, or increased hunger. A, C, and D are incorrect because they are not signs of hypoglycemia. Which laboratory test conducted on the client with diabetes mellitus indicates compliance? A. Fasting blood glucose B. Two-hour post-prandial C. Hgb A-1C D. Dextrostix Answer C is correct. The Hgb A-1C indicates that the client has been compliant for approximately three months. Answers A, B, and D tell the nurse the client's blood glucose at the time of the test, so they are incorrect. Acromegaly is most frequently diagnosed in: a. Middle-aged adultsb. Newbornsc. Children ages 2 to 5d. Adults age 65 and older 1. A: Acromegaly results from benign tumors on the pituitary gland that produce excessive amounts of growth hormone. Although symptoms may present at any age, the diagnosis generally occurs in middle-aged persons. Untreated, the consequences of acromegaly include type 2 diabetes, hypertension and increased risk of cardiovascular disease, arthritis and colon polyps. 8. Hashimoto's disease is: a. Chronic inflammation of the thyroid glandb. Diagnosed most frequently in Asian-Americans and Pacific Islandersc. A form of hyperthyroidismd. A rare form of hypothyroidism 8. A: Hashimoto's disease is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. It is an autoimmune disease that produces chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland. More women are affected than men and it is generally diagnosed in persons ages 40 to 60. When treatment is indicated, synthetic T4 is administered. 9. Persons at increased risk of developing Hashimoto's disease include all of the following except: a. Persons with vitiligob. Asian-Americansc. Persons with rheumatoid arthritisd. Persons with Addison's disease 9. B: Along with the above-mentioned groups, persons with type 1 diabetes and persons suffering from pernicious anemia (insufficient vitamin b12) are at increased risk of developing Hashimoto's disease. Because it tends to run in families, there is likely a genetic susceptibility as well. Environmental factors such as excessive iodine consumption and selected drugs also have been implicated as potential risk factors. 10. All of the following statements about Hashimoto's disease are true except: a. Many patients are entirely asymptomaticb. Not all patients become hypothyroidc. Most cases of obesity are attributable to Hashimoto's diseased. Hypothyroidism may be subclinical 10. C: Although weight gain may be a symptom of Hashimoto's disease, the majority of obese people have normal thyroid function; rarely is thyroid disorder the sole cause of obesity. Other symptoms of Hashimoto's disease include fatigue, cold intolerance, joint pain, myalgias, constipation, dry hair, skin and nails, impaired fertility, slow heart rate, and depression. 17. Untreated hyperthyroidism during pregnancy may result in all of the following except: a. Premature birth and miscarriageb. Low birthweightc. Autismd. Preeclampsia 17. C: In addition to the above-mentioned complications of uncontrolled hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, expectant mothers may suffer congestive heart failure and thyroid storm, which is life-threatening thyrotoxicosis with symptoms that include agitation, confusion, tachycardia, shaking, sweating, diarrhea, fever, and restlessness. 19. Endocrine disorders may be triggered by all of the following except: a. Stressb. Infectionc. Chemicals in the food chain and environmentd. Cell phone use 19. D: Endocrine function may be influenced by myriad factors. In addition to the above-mentioned, there is evidence that exposure to naturally occurring and man-made endocrine disruptors such as tributyltin, certain bioaccumulating chlorinated compounds, and phytoestrogens is widespread and in susceptible individuals, may trigger endocrine disorders.",35,Is a ketogenic / keto diet suitable for people with diabetes?,-12.503217697143555,138
95b7f1b1-b67e-4aae-bc24-94fa82c4bef7,"— Many people consider carbs an important part of a balanced diet, while others believe that they should be limited or avoided entirely. However, not all carbs are detrimental to your health. In fact, research shows that they can play an important role in your health and fitness goals, such as by helping build muscle and improving athletic performance (). Whether your diet is high or low in carbs, you may wonder if when you eat them matters. This article discusses whether there’s a best time to eat carbs. Carbs are one of the three , alongside fat and protein. They’re your body’s preferred source of fuel and provide 4 calories per gram. Most carbs are broken down into glucose, a type of sugar that can be easily used for energy (). These contain one or two sugar molecules. Foods that are high in simple carbs include sugar, fruits, fruit juice, honey, and milk. These have three or more sugar molecules. Foods that are high in complex carbs include oats, brown rice, quinoa, and sweet potatoes. Generally speaking, complex carbs are healthier, as they pack more nutrients and fiber and take longer to digest, making them a more filling option (). That said, simple carbs can be a better source of fuel in some instances, especially if you have a workout that starts within an hour. That’s because your body breaks them down and absorbs them more quickly (). Though carbs are an important source of fuel, eating too many can lead to weight gain. If you eat more carbs than your body needs, they’re stored as fat for later use. The two main types of carbs are simple and complex carbs. While complex carbs are generally the healthier option, simple carbs can be useful in situations in which you need energy quickly, such as within an hour before a workout. You may wonder whether timing matters when it comes to eating carbs. The following section reviews the research on the best time to eat carbs for different goals. When it comes to fat loss, research on the best time to eat carbs is inconsistent. In one 6-month study, 78 obese adults were asked to follow a low-calorie diet that involved eating carbs either only at dinner or at every meal. The dinner-only group lost more total weight and and felt fuller than those who ate carbs at every meal (). Conversely, another study in 58 obese men following a low-calorie diet with either more carbs at lunch or dinner found that both diets were similarly effective for fat loss (). Meanwhile, a recent study observed that your body is better at burning carbs in the morning and fat in the evening, meaning that carbs should be consumed earlier in the day for optimal fat burning (). Also, several studies indicate that weight gain tends to occur with eating more calories later in the day, so larger, carb-rich meals in the evening may hinder fat loss (, , ). Due to these mixed results, it’s unclear whether there’s a best time to eat carbs for fat loss. Additionally, your total carb intake is likely more important than timing, as eating too many carbs or calories from other nutrients can hinder (). Aim to choose more fiber-rich, complex carbs like oats and quinoa over refined carbs like white bread, white pasta, and pastries, as the former are generally more filling. Carbs are an important source of calories for people looking to . However, only a few studies have looked into timing carb intake for this purpose. Some studies find that consuming carbs along with protein within a few hours after a workout may help increase protein synthesis, which is the process by which your body builds muscle (, ). Yet, other studies indicate that eating protein on its own post-workout is just as effective at stimulating protein synthesis as consuming protein along with carbs (, , , ). That said, when resistance training, your body relies significantly on carbs as a source of fuel, so a carb-rich may help you perform better in the gym (). In addition, carbs have a protein-sparing effect, which means that your body prefers to use carbs for energy instead of proteins. As a result, it can use protein for other purposes, such as building muscle, when your carb intake is higher (). Moreover, eating carbs after a workout may slow the breakdown of protein that occurs post-workout, which may aid muscle growth (). Still, for most people, eating adequate amounts of healthy complex carbs throughout the day is more important for building muscle than timing. Athletes and people who exercise intensely can benefit from timing their carb intake. Research shows that eating carbs before and after a workout can help athletes perform longer and recover more quickly. It also reduces muscle damage and soreness (). That’s because for long periods can deplete your muscle glycogen stores (the storage form of carbs), which are your body’s main source of fuel. Consuming carbs at least 3–4 hours before a workout can help athletes exercise for prolonged periods, while consuming them within 30 minutes to 4 hours after a workout can help restore your glycogen stores (, ). What’s more, having protein alongside a source of carbs after an intense workout can further help your body replenish its glycogen stores, all while aiding muscle repair (). While athletes and people who exercise multiple times per day can benefit from timing carb intake around workouts, research indicates that it’s less important for the average person. The ketogenic, or keto, diet is a very-low-carb, high-fat, moderate-protein diet, often used to lose weight. It typically involves restricting carb intake to less than 50 grams per day to reach and maintain , a metabolic state in which your body burns fat for fuel instead of carbs (). Currently, evidence to suggest that timing your carb intake to aid weight loss on a keto diet is lacking. However, if you’re an active person, timing your carb intake around your workouts may improve your performance. This is known as a targeted (). Furthermore, if you experience insomnia while on a ketogenic diet, eating carbs closer to bedtime may help you relax and fall asleep faster, according to some research (, ). Eating carbs at certain times does not appear to improve weight loss on low-calorie or ketogenic diets. However, timing carb intake around workouts can benefit athletes and people who exercise heavily. Carbs can play an important role in many health and fitness goals. Athletes and people who exercise multiple times a day may improve their performance by eating carbs before a workout and speed up recovery by eating them afterward. Still, for the average person, timing seems to be less important than choosing high-quality, complex carbs and watching your total calorie intake. — How Many Carbs Should You Eat per Day to Lose Weight? Reducing carbohydrates in the diet is a great way to lose weight and improve health. This page explains how many carbs you should aim for each day. Eating fewer carbs can provide major health benefits, but not everyone knows how to start. Here are 15 easy ways to reduce your carb intake.

""Historically people thought of older persons as tiny and frail,"" said Gordon Jensen, head of the Department of Nutritional Sciences at Penn State, ""but that paradigm has changed for many older persons. Currently, 30 percent or more may be overweight, and by 2030, almost 30 percent are projected to be obese, not just overweight. Recent reports even suggest that there may be survival benefits associated with overweight and mild obesity status among the elderly."" ""We all know that adverse dietary patterns, such as a Western diet containing high amounts of fat or a diet containing high amounts of refined sugar, both of which may contribute to obesity, are associated with adverse medical conditions and health outcomes for many people, but until now, the health effects of these types of poor diets have not been characterized for people who live to 75 years of age and older,"" said Pao Ying Hsao, postdoctoral fellow at Penn State. The team's research is part of a decades-long collaborative study between Penn State and the Geisinger Healthcare System on the effects of nutritional status and diet on the health of more than 20,000 older people living in Pennsylvania. In the current study, the team followed 449 individuals for five years who were on average 76.5 years old at the beginning of the study. ""This is one of the first studies to examine obesity-related health outcomes and dietary patterns in such aged persons,"" Jensen said. At study baseline, the team assessed the participants' dietary patterns by calling each of them by telephone four or five times during a 10-month period and asking them about their diets over the previous 24 hours. The participants were categorized as adhering to one of three different dietary patterns. The ""sweets and dairy"" pattern was characterized by the largest proportions of energy from baked goods, milk, sweetened coffee and tea and dairy-based desserts, and the lowest intakes of poultry. The ""health-conscious"" pattern was characterized by relatively higher intakes of pasta, noodles, rice, whole fruit, poultry, nuts, fish and vegetables, and lower intakes of fried vegetables, processed meats and soft drinks. The ""Western"" pattern was characterized by higher intakes of bread, eggs, fats, fried vegetables, alcohol and soft drinks, and the lowest intakes of milk and whole fruit. Study explores how choice of foods influences aging and lifespan in fruit flies Study offers new insight into the global obesity epidemic Exercise during the first trimester of pregnancy helps avoid gestational diabetes Using outpatient electronic medical records, the researchers identified whether the participants developed cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension () and metabolic syndrome during the five-year period. They found no relationship between dietary pattern and prevalence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome or mortality in the participants; however, they did find an increased risk of hypertension in people who followed the ""sweets and dairy"" pattern. The results appeared in this month's issue of the . ""We don't know if the participants had been following these dietary patterns their entire adult lives, but we suspect they had been because people don't usually change dietary practices all that much,"" Jensen said. ""The results suggest that if you live to be this old, then there may be little to support the use of overly restrictive dietary prescriptions, especially where food intake may already be inadequate. However, people who live on prudent diets all their lives are likely to have better health outcomes.""

It is one of those essential molecules which are important for life and nearly all cells in the body are capable of synthesizing these lipid molecules. It is can also ingested from animal derived foods. Cholesterol is a lipid soluble substance that is even though carried through the bloodstream but does not mix in blood because blood is water soluble. For easy transfer of cholesterol through the blood stream, it is packed in combination with protein molecules. These molecules are called as lipoproteins. Lipoproteins are classified into three types: Low density lipoproteins (LDL) – called as ‘bad’ cholesterol High density lipoproteins (HDL) – called as ‘good’ cholesterol Cholesterol is utilized in the body for a variety of purposes. It acts a precursor in the synthesis of Vitamin D in skin. When exposed to sunlight, through a series of reaction, cholesterol is converted to Vitamin D (Cholecalciferol). It is an important component required for proper nerve functions. Nerves are covered with myelin sheath which is made up of cholesterol and fat. Moreover, adrenal and gonadal hormones are also made up of cholesterol. These hormones are released during stress and are energy handling and reproductive hormones. For the complete and proper development, infant’s brain needs cholesterol. Human breast milk contains a large amount of cholesterol. Recent studies have revealed that it has been helpful in older patients with declining memory. It also helps in making of the digestive bile acids in the intestines. It also helps in the digestion of food in the gastrointestinal tract. To perform many of its functions, the route of cholesterol transfer is that it is transported from liver to cells, tissues and glands on low density lipoprotein carriers. The reverse transport is done by high density lipoprotein carriers. Cholesterol is only found in animal tissues where it is a component of cell membrane. This is the reason why there is more cholesterol in lean tissues rather than in adipose cells. Cholesterol synthesis is increased to a greater extent from the consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids than those synthesized from the consumption of saturated fatty acids. This is primarily because  the polyunsaturated fatty acids are deposited  in the cell membranes as a result of which body needs to add more cholesterol in these membranes to stabilize them and maintain their fluidity. Cholesterol, when animal derived food is consumed, only about 50% is absorbed. When the synthesis of cholesterol is more or the utilization of cholesterol in places where it is used is less, the blood cholesterol levels are raised. The increase in blood cholesterol levels can also be due to high intake of saturated fatty acids. The condition itself does not present any signs or symptoms which is a major drawback because many people are unaware that their blood cholesterol levels are high. It has been recommended that everyone above 20 years of age should get tested for cholesterol every 5 years. This test is commonly known as ‘Lipid Profile’ which is done after 8-10 hours of fasting. This test gives information on For determining the levels of cholesterol on body, a general range is set, which is as follows: The lipoprotein panel will give your healthcare provider information about your: Total cholesterol is a parameter that measures the total amount of cholesterol in your blood, including low-densitylipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. LDL, or “bad,” cholesterol is the main source of cholesterol buildup and blockages in the arteries. HDL, or “good,” cholesterol helps remove cholesterol from systemic circulation. . Triglycerides are  also a type of fat found in your blood. Some studies suggest that a high level of triglycerides in the blood may raise the risk of causing coronary heart disease, especially in women. Hypercholesterolemia or high levels of cholesterol in the blood can be caused by a number of factors, some of which are modifiable such as obesity, diet, stress, exercise and some are non-modifiable such as genetic factors. Apart from there are a number of medical conditions which increase circulating cholesterol levels such as diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, alcohol, monoclonal gammopathy, dialysis, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, anorexia nervosa. Finally there are medications which affect cholesterol metabolism and excretion and therefore they may also cause hypercholesterolemia. Usually a person suffering from hypercholesterolemia is at risk due to presence of multiple risk factors. A small proportion of all people suffering from hypercholesterolemia have an inherited form of hypercholesterolemia. The most common cause of inherited high cholesterol is due to mutations of the gene LDLR.  This condition is known as familial hypercholesterolemia. The LDLR gene is translated for making a protein called low-density lipoprotein receptor. This type of receptor binds to particles circulating low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the blood and removes them from the blood. This way these receptors play a vital role in reducing circulating cholesterol levels. Mutation in this gene will result in either a reduced number of LDL receptors being synthesized or it will disrupt the receptors’ ability to remove low-density lipoproteins from the bloodstream. Other mutations which cause dyslipidemias particularly hypercholesterolemia are mutations in the APOB, LDLRAP1, or PCSK9 gene. Another form of inherited hypercholesterolemia known as familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB) is due to mutations of the APOB gene. Mutations of the LDLRAP1 gene result in another type of inherited high cholesterol called autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH). These genes make proteins which are essential for the normal function of low-density lipoprotein receptors; therefore mutations in any of these genes can alter the receptors’ function or prevent the cell from making functional receptors. Most of these mutations have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance while the LDLRAP1 gene has an autosomal recessive pattern. Despite the identification of these genes, it has been found that mutations in a single gene usually do not result in high cholesterol and it is also the presence of environmental factors which triggers the effect of these genes. Also there is huge variation in the effect of these mutations and these effects vary person to person. Therefore it has been postulated that other genes might also have an impact on the normal function of the LDL receptors and researchers are trying to find out the complete set of genes which is responsible for metabolism of cholesterol. This way they are hopeful of finding the ‘missing link’ between hypercholesterolemia and genetic factors responsible for it. Obesity has been linked with a derangement of the entire cholesterol panel. It has been linked with a decreased amount of HDL (good cholesterol) and increase and increase in triglycerides and LDL (bad cholesterol). Basically the body’s response to the changes in dietary fats is diminished. Following theories have been suggested for this: The pathways which synthesize, use and excrete LDL are disturbed so that more LDL is produced than is excreted. Ideally it should be the opposite when large amounts of dietary fats are consumed however there is hormonal disturbance in obesity and the close regulation of LDL levels is lost leading to hypercholesterolemia. One of the complications of obesity is inflammation. It has been suggested that the cytokines released during inflammation have a role in blunting the metabolic response to consuming fats. Insulin resistance is another common finding in obesity. While the common understanding is that insulin is responsible for storing carbohydrates in the body, however its function is much more than that. This hormone acts as a regulator for a couple of vital steps in the fat metabolism pathways, so when cells become resistant to insulin, insulin no longer reaches the site of metabolism (which is happening inside the cell) and as a result there is a deranged response of body to consuming fats. The relationship between stress and high cholesterol levels has been studied and while the exact cause is unknown, two well-known and currently accepted reasons for this association are as follows: One study concluded that when a person is under stress he is unlikely to care about himself and then develops poor dietary habits and may even put on some extra weight. Both these factors are known to contribute towards high cholesterol. This was found to be particularly true in men. When under stress, there is an inflammatory response in our body. To overcome this and to prepare for a potential ‘fight or flight’ situation, the adrenal glands of our body secrete adrenaline as well as cortisol. The short term beneficial effect of these hormones is that they increase the blood flow to the brain and provide an increase amount of energy for our body. The do so by breaking down the stores of glycogen in the liver. In the presence of stress, these hormones will be secreted for longer periods of time and this prolonged hyperglycemia will activate the pathway which converts glucose to triglycerides and eventually cholesterol. Another theory which stems out from the same concept is that if these hormones stay in the body for longer periods of time, they start to break the fats as well and this will cause the circulating cholesterol levels in our bloods to rise. Smoking is another environmental factor which has been associated with high cholesterol levels. The most well-known effect of smoking on the body is that decreases the levels of the protective cholesterol, HDL. It does so by putting the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) into overdrive.  This protein mediates the transfer of HDL to LDL cholesterol. So the net effect is that HDL levels are reduced and converted to a form of cholesterol which is difficult to excrete causing hypercholesterolemia. When the HDL levels are decreased, their beneficial effects are lost and the smoker becomes susceptible to heart disease. Another effect of smoking is that acrolein in cigarettes inhibit the enzyme which keeps the LDL molecule intact. When this enzyme is inhibited the LDL molecule disintegrates and becomes susceptible to oxidation. After oxidation the molecule structure of LDL is changed and our immune system starts treating the oxidized LDL as a foreign agent releasing white blood cells against it. These cells bring about an inflammatory response which damages the blood vessels, particularly coronary arteries of our heart. Regular exercise causes a decrease in LDL levels and increase in HDL levels. Exercise stimulates the transfer of LDL from the blood to the liver from where it is either converted to HDL or excreted into the bile. Therefore a person not doing enough exercise will lose this beneficial affect that exercise brings and will be at high risk of developing hypercholesterolemia. Severe intensity exercise is more beneficial that moderate intensity, however if you have not being exercising for years now you should consult your doctor first so that he can evaluate for cardiovascular fitness through treadmill test. The two most well-known offenders in our diet which cause an increase in cholesterol levels are saturated fats and trans fats. Saturated fat and cholesterol are found in foods that originate from animals, such as meats, egg yolks, whole milk, butter, and cheese. It is found to raise total blood cholesterol levels and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. They have been linked with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Trans fat is mainly found in packaged foods and fried foods, such as chips, cookies, and crackers and have been linked to increase unhealthy LDL cholesterol and lower healthy high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Diabetic dyslipidemia is the term given to the lipid profile changes seen in diabetes and is classically characterized by high plasma triglyceride concentration, low HDL cholesterol concentration and increased concentration of small dense LDL-cholesterol particles. Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) studied the relationship between total cholesterol and cardiovascular disease mortality. It was found that hypercholesterolemia and mortality are directly related. However, if a person is also suffering from diabetes, the spike in mortality is rather dramatic and hence worrisome. Patients suffering from non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or type II diabetes mellitus show increased amounts of free fatty acids in their plasma. These fatty acids are attributed to inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into muscle and hence cause insulin resistance. Increased amounts of free fatty acids in their plasma would mean that they will now be increased transport of these molecules into the liver. There they are seen to stimulate a cascade of events which will lead to the production and then secretion of VLDL (major source of triglyceride) into the blood. When VLDL is secreted, its triglyceride is exchange for HDL cholesteryl ester. The resultant HDL molecule is triglyceride rich and becomes a substrate for hepatic lipase or lipoprotein lipase. When the TG-rich HDL undergoes hydrolysis by these enzymes, the molecular structure is changed and the major HDL protein, apolipoprotein A-I or apoA-I for short can no longer bind with the lipid-poor HDL. As a result HDL molecule disintegrates and apoA-I is then excreted in the urine. These events are the reason why there is high plasma triglyceride concentration, low HDL cholesterol concentration and increased concentration of small dense LDL-cholesterol particles. Thus, increased free fatty acid transport in plasma which leads to an insulin-resistant states, may be the underlying cause for the lipid abnormalities seen in diabetes collectively called ‘diabetic dyslipidemia’. Hypothyroidism is another endocrine disease which causes an increase in cholesterol levels. It is now a well-documented fact that thyroid hormones stimulate the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase enzyme, which is the first step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Furthermore, triiodothyronine (T) binds with its intracellular receptor and then the hormone-receptor complex binds with the specific thyroid hormone responsive elements on the LDL receptor gene to stimulate the production of LDL receptors. As discussed before, these receptors function to remove the circulating LDL. Therefore hypothyroidism, in which there is decreased plasma thyroid hormone concentration, will lead to hypercholesterolemia. Another interesting idea is that it is actually the high levels of TSH and not a decrease in thyroid hormones which cause increase in cholesterol levels. In this regard, two authentic studies were carried out in China. The inclusion criteria was that only those patients can become part of this who were not taking any medications nor had health problems that could impact the TSH, thyroid hormone or cholesterol tests. Both these studies found that there as the TSH levels rise, the blood cholesterol levels rise too. This holds true even when TSH levels are at the upper limit of the normal range and the patient is not suffering from hypothyroidism. Therefore, these studies hypothesize that TSH levels may also effect on the lipid profile and that this is not dependent on the thyroid hormone levels Nephrotic syndrome is a set of abnormalities in kidney functions that lead to low serum levels of albumin and caused edema in such patients. In patients suffering from such patients there has been, both increased synthesis and has been a decrease in the clearance of lipoproteinemia. This has often complicated the disease and has led to increased lDL molecules. This hyperlipoprotenemia may also be linked with increased levels of triglycerides in blood, thus increasing the concentration of Apo C, Apo E and Apo B molecules. This increase in the synthesis is possibly due to increased availability of mevalonate as a substrate in the synthesis of cholesterol. Moreover, urinary loss of HDL molecules and other major liporegulatory factors causes a decrease in the activity of lipolytic enzymes. All this has led to the impairment in clearance cholesterol and triglyceride thus leading to high blood levels. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder leading to disturbance in a person’s body weight and eventually changes in shape. There have been cases where the patients have suffered from dangerous levels in decrease in body weight. However, it has been observed in such patients that these patients have surprisingly high plasma levels of cholesterol in their bodies. People suffering from anorexia nervosa are basically avoiding the intake of food with calories and since these food also contain enough amounts of cholesterol that can contribute significantly to increase in weight. However, there has been an unusual trend. The high cholesterol levels of cholesterol in these patients are possibly due to genetic mutation. Over 150 genes are linked either directly or indirectly with this disorder. Research has shown that mutation in any one of these genes especially that which is linked which is responsible with the production of cholesterol both due to dietary intake and internal cholesterol. This genetic mutation has also largely contributed towards behavioral changes. In anorexic patients, the assumptions are made that their abilities to withstand severe malnutrition is made easier for the patients to survive. Monoclonal gammopathy as a cause of high cholesterol Patient suffering from monoclonal gammopathy have been observed with low HDL phenotype and there have been accumulation of cholesterol molecules. This accumulation of cholesterol was due to the reduction of HDL capacity of promoting cholesterol efflux from macrophages. When high levels of plasma cytokines (TNFα and IL-6), soluble cytokine receptors were observed in patients suffering from necrobiotic xanthogranuloma with monoclonal gammopathy. This revealed a specific xanthoma which correlated with the plasma levels of anti-inflammatory HDL. These xanthomas are yellowish cholesterol rich material present in large sized foam cells. Studies have recently proved that necrobiotic xanthogranuloma is described by impaired lipid macrophage homeostasis associated with a systemic inflammatory profile. This inflammatory may be a result from possible interaction of Mlg (monoclonal immuglobulin) and lipoproteins. Pathalogically this has caused the formation of lesions on skin or in visceral regions which are due to cholesterol accumulation and monoclonal immunoglobulin (MIg). The lesions were mostly nodules or plaques. Monoclonal gamopathy therapy can be thus a very useful treatment. Liver is the center of metabolism for all pathways; hence it is not surprising that when it is suffering from disease, particularly liver cirrhosis, all its metabolic functions will be disrupted. As a result breakdown of triglycerides and LDL will be reduced leading to both hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceremia. Other possible mechanisms suggested for this decrease are increased supply in diet (people consuming medicine from non-authentic practitioners are found to have a number of adulterations and since their liver is not functionally correctly, there might be accumulation of those adulterations and nutrients). A rather unusual finding in some of these patients is that while their lipid profile is disturbed, they show no increase incidence of cardiovascular events. One of the reasons is that a diseased liver goes into protective mode and secretes more HDL, which is cardio protective. However other studies have found that while in some cases HDL may rise; people suffering from nutritional deficiency or familial hypercholesterolemia still show a lower HDL level so there must be another reason for this. Primary biliary cirrhosis as a cause of high cholesterol Primary biliary cirrhosis is an autoimmune disease of hepatobiliary tract characterized by slow, progressive destruction of the small bile ducts of the liver, causing bile and other toxins to build up in the liver, a condition called cholestasis. Cholesterol is an important constituent of bile, a fluid produced by liver and stored in the gallbladder which aids in the digestion of fats. Destruction of passages, first extrahepatic and then intrahepatic, and then the acini (secretory cells arranged in glandular form are called acini) will setup a situation where cholesterol is no longer utilized for this purposes leading to its accumulation and casing hypercholesterolemia.  is a collection of symptoms and signs shown by the body due to prolonged exposure to cortisol. Cortisol, a glucocorticoid, causes hyperglycemia and prolonged hyperglycemia will activate the pathways which convert blood sugar into lipids including cholesterol. Starting at puberty, men often have lower levels of HDL cholesterol compared to women. As women and men age, their LDL cholesterol levels in blood often rise. Before age 55, women usually have lower LDL cholesterol levels than men. However, after age 55, women can have higher LDL levels than men. There are a number of drugs which can cause hypercholesterolemia. The pathophysiology is different for each drug. Diuretics: Both thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide, metalozone) and loop diuretics (furosemide) can cause hypercholesterolemia. The mechanism is unknown but it is thought to be due to worsened insulin sensitivity and/or reflex activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous system in response to volume depletion. Amiodarone: This drug decreases plasma and tissue triiodothyronine (T) due to which there is hypercholesterolemia Beta blockers: β receptors are present on a number of tissues including pancreas and skeletal muscle. So when β blockers without intrinsic sympathetic activity block these receptors, there is a slight metabolic disturbance in some people causing hypercholesterolemia. Steroids: They cause hypercholesterolemia the same way steroidal hormones cause in stress or Cushing’s syndrome. Anticonvulsants: Phenytoin and carbamazepine are two anticonvulsants notorious for causing raised cholesterol levels. They do so by stimulation of hepatic enzymes, one of which is cholesterase. They also increase the hepatic synthesis of bile acids. These acids increase the amount of cholesterol which is being absorbed in the intestines by facilitating micelle formation. Birth pills: Birth pills contain estrogen and progesterone. Progesterone decreases HDL and increases LDL while estrogen does the opposite. Therefore it is recommended that birth pills should contain more estrogen than progesterone but even after this one should take these pills with caution. Others: cyclosporine and protease inhibitors are other drugs which cause high cholesterol however the mechanism by which they do so is still unknown. The main focus in cholesterol lowering treatment is to decrease the levels of low density lipoproteins (LDL) – the bad cholesterol. The higher the number of LDL molecules, the greater the risk for the person to develop heart diseases. There are two main ways to lower the cholesterol levels this includes a diet consists of food have low cholesterol levels, more physical activity, and proper weight management. This strategy of lifestyle changes is the first and on top most priority for those people who have LDL greater than normal range. when the total cholesterol levels or LDL levels are high in category, drugs either single or in combination of more than one are prescribed along with the recommended changes in lifestyle. Treatment is made depending on which category is the patient falls into: Category I, highest risk: when the LDL is less than 100 mg/dl. The plan is to initiate the low cholesterol diet. This will slow down the process of development of atherosclerotic plaque. If the LDL is 100 or above, it is better to start the drug treatment along with modifications made in lifestyle. However in certain cases here the LDL levels are below 100mg/dl but the patient have recently recovered from heart attack or angina then the doctor will recommend drugs too. Category II, Next highest risk: when the LDL levels are 130mg/dl or above, a plan of drug treatment along with lifestyle changes. If the person is only going for lifestyle changes and the goal of 130mg/dl is not achieved even after 3 months, drug treatment is necessary along with lifestyle changes. When the LDL goals are achieved of reaching 130mg/dl, a need for continuing with the healthy diet, which involves a little more intake of saturated fat and cholesterol than with the lifestyle changes. Category III, Moderate risk: goal is to keep the LDL levels below 130mg/dl. If the LDL levels after testing is 160mg/dl or above even after 3 months of continuous changes of lifestyles, drug treatment should be started in conjunction to lifestyle changes. When the levels of low density lipoproteins (LDL) decrease below 130mg/dl, all those who are at a risk with heart diseases should maintain their healthy diet. Category IV, low to moderate risk: when LDL goals is less than 160mg/dl. If the LDL is 160mg/dl or above, there is a need to start with the recommended lifestyle. However it is preferred to start the drug treatment with physical activities and healthy diet chosen for such a patient, especially when the LDL levels is 190mg/dl or more. Lowering cholesterol levels with lifestyle changes Any changes made in ones’ lifestyle for a therapeutic purpose, these are termed as therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC). TLC include a range of things that can be done to lower the body’s cholesterol levels specifically LDL levels. These include: The TLC diet: for patients with high cholesterol levels a change is diet is required. A saturated fat, low cholesterol plan that only provides less than 7 percent of calories from saturated fat and less than 200mg of dietary cholesterol per day. A proper TLC diet demands to maintain a desirable weight and avoid getting overweighed or obese. If the LDL levels doesnot come to a desirable level only by reducing the intake of saturated or high cholesterol containing foods, an alternate that can be implied is to increase the intake of fiber content in diet. Fiber is rich in peas, beans, lentils etc. Another option to make the diet low cholesterol is to utilize those foods containing plant sterols (a well-known example is margarine) with the aim to lower the LDL levels in body. Protein rich food such as legumes which are full of nutritional riches. Nuts and seeds have shown to lower the LDL levels in blood. However to avoid getting overweighed, one must not consume more than 1 ounce daily. Weight management: when targeting for lowering blood cholesterol levels, taking a maintained diet is not only what it counts, it also depends on how much the person eats. Losing weight is a helpful strategy to lower the risk of heart diseases. Being overweight increases the chances of having a high level of LDL in blood. This is especially recommended to those who have high triglyceride levels or low HDL. Doctors recommend this to those men who have a waist measurement of more than 40 inches and women with more than 35 inches. However other measures can be taken to reduce the weight. While purchasing of food products, one must read the label attached and those giving less calories per serving should be preferred. Having 5-6 meals per day is healthier rather than consuming 3 large meals. Physical activity: a person should on daily basis whether he/she has high cholesterol levels or not, do exercise for at least 30minutes. It not only decreases the body mass but also helps to raise the HDL and lower LDL levels. Medicine is not the first solution to every therapeutic problem. However, when it is necessary the dose of the medicine should be kept as low as possible. However anti-lipids include a variety of drugs. Anti-lipids include statins, bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid, cholesterol absorption inhibitors and fibric acids. Depending on the individual cases, a doctor is at the best position to prescribe which drug is best. The statins are most commonly prescribed. They help to lower LDL but the only drawback is that it can cause myopathy. Bile acid sequestrants can be used alone or in combination with statins. Fibric acid are preferentially given to lower the triglycerides in blood and raise HDL. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors are given to those who have a habit of eating more. The first priority when drug treatment is prescribed is to lower the LDL levels. Once it is resolved, then the levels of triglycerides and HDL are considered. The blood cholesterol levels have a lot to cause heart diseases. It is counted as a risk factor. Risk factor is anything that makes a person prone to get a disease. When cholesterol level is higher, it starts accumulating in the arterial walls. This accumulation leads to the hardening of the walls ultimately constricting the lumen of the artery and decreasing the blood flow. The area where the LDL molecules have accumulated is called as plaque. When accumulated in the coronary artery has the highest chances to cause heart attack. If the flow of oxygen rich blood to heart is reduced or blocked, angina or heart attack can occur. Angina is a chest pain or discomfort. It may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. The pain may also occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw or back. The pain of angina may be mis understood as indigestion. Heart attack occurs when the blood flow is completely cut off. If not quickly restored, the muscle starves and dies. This can prove fatal also. However, accumulation can also occur in other arteries that are responsible for providing oxygen rich blood to upper and lower limbs as well as to brain. This in turn will lead to other problems such a peripheral artery disease, stroke etc. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) occurs when there is buildup of the plaque in the arterial walls those which are supplying blood to kidneys, arms, stomach, legs and feet. With time as PAD progresses, symptoms start to occur more often even when the patient is at rest. People suffering from PAD are more prone to have stroke, heart attack or even limb amputations. Stroke occurs when the blood flow is reduced or cut off due to blockage by plaque in arterial walls. It is a medical emergency which should be immediately treated. Otherwise the part of brain which that specific nerve is supplying the blood will be deprived and the particular function performed that specific part of the brain is affected. Effects such paralysis, slurring of speech occur. “How far in advance should you start taking prenatal vitamins with minerals?” ““ 6 Unconventional Weight Loss Tips That Will Actually Work Popular Heartburn Drug Contains Chemicals Linked To Cancer 10 Diet and Weight Loss Products Available at Urban Outfitters Aspirin Linked To Higher Survival Rates For Head, Neck, and Lung Cancers Vitamin D Supplements May Slow Diabetes Progression Eating Between Certain Hours Can Accelerate Weight Loss 3 Mistakes You’re Making When Exercising In the Heat © 2021 All texts are the intellectual property of this site.

If you answer YES to 3 or more of these questions, you have Syndrome X, which can be confirmed by measuring your fasting blood levels of insulin. They will be higher than normal and that's the main reason you cannot lose weight. High insulin levels are usually accompanied by excessively high leptin levels. These hormones control hunger and fat storing. See my book ""!"" Syndrome X is the most common cause of inability to lose weight. Syndrome X occurs in those with excess fat inside the abdominal cavity and in the abdominal wall. Syndrome X is also known as the Metabolic Syndrome and common associated problems include insulin resistance, unstable blood sugar levels, leptin resistance, high blood pressure and high triglyceride fats in the blood. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas gland. Its action is to put blood sugar (glucose) into the cells where it is used to make energy in the mitochondria (little furnaces inside the cells). Insulin resistance means that your body is resistant to the effects of insulin and this leads to the high levels of insulin which cause Syndrome X. Many people today are resistant to the action of the insulin - that is, it is unable to carry the blood sugar inside the cells as it should - the cell is said to be 'resistant' to the action of the insulin. This means that the pancreas is forced to pump out higher and higher amounts of insulin to compensate for this resistance. Insulin resistance is often hereditary and is triggered by a high carbohydrate diet and/or lack of exercise. Nutritional deficiencies of certain minerals (magnesium, zinc, manganese, chromium) can worsen insulin resistance. Liver dysfunction and/or fatty liver can worsen insulin resistance and like a catch 22, the high insulin worsens the fatty liver. No wonder it is so hard to lose weight! What is the effect of IR on the female reproductive system? In many females, high levels of insulin stimulate the ovaries to produce androgens (male hormones) which worsen Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (See for information on this condition). This interaction of excessive insulin and excess male hormones may cause a lack of ovulation in susceptible women. Absent menstrual periods and reduced fertility can be a result. The high male hormones may cause excess facial and body hair, acne, hair loss from the temples and the crown of the scalp (male pattern baldness). High insulin levels are often associated with high and/or unstable blood sugar levels. Indeed, a patient may be pre-diabetic or have type 2 diabetes. Even though the insulin levels are higher than normal, the insulin does not work efficiently because the body cells are resistant to its effect. The insulin does not work effectively to bring down the high blood sugar levels. Those with Syndrome X usually have abnormalities in blood fat levels (cholesterol and triglycerides) and may have elevated blood levels of uric acid. Syndrome X significantly increases your risk of heart disease.  Excessive insulin levels induce ravenous hunger and those who suffer with this condition often find they are consistently hungry. This makes sticking to conventional weight loss plans very difficult. Professor Gerald Reaven, from Stanford University was an original researcher on Syndrome X and found Syndrome X present in 80% of overweight people. He found that Syndrome X is more common in men than women. Many overweight children have Syndrome X. They are often battling with a fatty liver and a ravenous hunger, which must be addressed, or long-term chances of success are slim; unless you have the 2 missing parts to the jig-saw puzzle: they will need to have - Victims of Syndrome X cannot lose weight because of 2 reasons: Their liver is fat, when it should be fat. In other words they suffer with a dysfunctional liver. A healthy liver is able to burn fat and pump excess fat out of the body through the bile. In those with a fatty liver the reverse happens so they just keep on getting fatter, especially around the abdomen. Hormonal imbalances - the high levels of insulin and leptin make them very hungry. High insulin levels give you a ravenous appetite with cravings for carbohydrates such as sweets, savoury biscuits, chips, and sometimes sweet drinks and alcohol. This high intake of carbohydrates stimulates the insulin levels to become higher, which makes you even hungrier. Furthermore, insulin preferentially converts sugar into fat storage deposits, instead of muscle and liver glycogen stores. This insulin encourages the deposition of fat in your body. Both of the above factors keep you locked into a vicious circle of ever increasing weight. After 30 years of clinical research I have discovered the key to break this destructive cycle and get the weight off permanently. This involves 3 vital strategies - achieved via correct eating principles and supplementation: Improve the liver function so that the liver starts to burn fat again. Reduce the high levels of insulin and leptin, so that excess hunger is prevented Do some regular exercise such as walking, swimming, sports or aerobics; even a small amount of exercise helps a lot. You must eat a diet that is high in protein and low in carbohydrate foods. The eating plans in my books """" and """" provide suitable diet plans and delicious recipes to overcome Syndrome X. Include protein at every meal and good sources of protein are legumes, seeds, raw nuts, fresh red fresh meat, all seafood, eggs and natural unprocessed cheeses and full fat Greek yogurt. A fruit breakfast for example would not be recommended for an overweight person with Syndrome X - this is too much simple carbohydrate without protein. This varies depending upon the degree of fatty change and inflammation in the liver. If you have only a mild degree of fatty liver, weight loss is quicker. If you have a very fatty liver and moderate to severe insulin and leptin resistance, the weight loss will be slower and you may have weight loss plateaus when you find that weight loss stops for 2 to 3 weeks. After the plateau, your weight loss will resume. Remember it takes time to remove the excess fat from the liver, and if you do not do this, long-term weight loss is impossible. Some patients with advanced degrees of fatty liver take up to one year to completely remove all the excess fat from the liver. My liver formulas will speed up weight loss. The key to success is to focus on your health and not on how quickly you lose weight. Just be consistent and you will be successful - never give up! . In this book you will learn; the importance of protein to blood sugar control and weight loss, nutrients that diabetics need, reducing complications such as nerve damage, kidney disease and blindness. You will also learn specific foods, herbs and essential tests that all diabetics must have regularly to maintain good health. Take 1 to 2 capsules twice daily - These capsules contain gymnema sylvestre, bitter melon, chromium picolinate, lipoic acid, carnitine fumarate, selenium, magnesium, manganese and zinc - this is an excellent formula to help balance blood sugar levels and lower insulin and leptin levels, thus reducing hunger and increasing fat burning. Take 1 teaspoon twice daily in water or raw juice, or 1 to 2 capsules twice daily to assist with fat burning and support of liver function and detoxification. Take 1 capsule twice daily with meals. Berberine helps to improve insulin sensitivity, thereby helping to reduce elevated insulin levels. In studies, berberine has proven to be equally effective as the drug metformin. Use as a meal or snack. Slimming Protein powder for Syndrome X is an ideal smoothie or can be sprinkled over cereals or desserts to increase their protein content.

cec3bc15-057d-4b1c-be64-65cd21045871,"— — “Collagen vascular disease” is the name of a group of diseases that affect your connective tissue. Collagen is a protein-based connective tissue that forms a support system for your skin. Connective tissue holds bones, ligaments, and muscles together. Collagen vascular disease is sometimes also called connective tissue disease. Collagen vascular diseases can be heritable (inherited from one’s parents) or autoimmune (resulting from activity of the body’s immune system against itself). This article deals with autoimmune forms of collagen vascular diseases. Some disorders classified as collagen vascular disease affect your joints, skin, blood vessels, or other vital organs. Symptoms vary according to the specific disease. Types of autoimmune collagen vascular disease include: (OI), or brittle bone disease Collagen vascular disease is an . This means that your immune system mistakenly attacks your body’s healthy tissue. No one knows what causes your immune system to do this. The attacks usually cause inflammation. If you have a collagen vascular disease, your immune system causes inflammation in your collagen and nearby joints. Several collagen vascular diseases, including lupus, scleroderma, and rheumatoid arthritis, are more common in women than in men. This group of diseases usually affects adults in their 30s and 40s. Children younger than 15 can be diagnosed with lupus, but it mainly affects people older than 15. Each type of collagen vascular disease has its own set of symptoms. However, most forms of collagen vascular disease do share some of the same general symptoms. People with collagen vascular disorders typically experience: Lupus is a collagen vascular disease that causes unique symptoms in each patient. Additional symptoms can include: People with lupus may have long periods of remission without symptoms. Symptoms can flare up during times of stress or after prolonged exposure to sunlight. Rheumatoid arthritis affects about in the United States, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Inflammation of the connective tissue between the joints causes pain and stiffness. You may have chronic problems with dry eyes and a dry mouth. Your blood vessels or the lining of your heart may become inflamed if you have this form of collagen vascular disease. Scleroderma is an autoimmune disease that can affect your: The symptoms include thickening and hardening of the skin, rashes, and open sores. Your skin may feel tight, as if it’s being stretched, or feel lumpy in areas. Systemic scleroderma can cause: Temporal arteritis, or giant cell arteritis, is another form of collagen vascular disease. Temporal arteritis is an inflammation of the large arteries, typically those in the head. The symptoms are most common in adults over the and can include: The treatment for collagen vascular disease varies according to your individual condition. However, corticosteroid and immunosuppressant medications commonly treat many connective tissue diseases. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation throughout your body. This class of drugs also helps normalize your immune system. Corticosteroids can have major side effects in some people, including weight gain and mood changes. Some people may have an increase in blood sugar while taking corticosteroid medications. Immunosuppressant medication works by lowering your immune response. If your immune response is lower, your body won’t attack itself as much it did before. However, having a lowered immunity can also increase your risk of becoming sick. Protect yourself from simple viruses by staying away from people who have colds or the flu. Physical therapy or gentle exercise can also treat collagen vascular disease. Range of motion exercises help you retain your mobility and may reduce joint and muscle pain. The outlook for collagen vascular disease varies from person to person, and it depends on their specific disease. However, they do have one thing in common: All autoimmune diseases are chronic conditions. They have no cure, and you must manage them throughout your life. Your doctors will work with you to create a treatment plan that will help you manage your symptoms. — — A Ketogenic Diet to Lose Weight and Fight Metabolic Disease A Keto Diet Meal Plan and Menu That Can Transform Your Body Systemic sclerosis (SS) is an autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks the body.

What few doctors understand is that glucose metabolism defects affect virtually all aging people. Steven Joyal, MD, lays out an innovative program to enable diabetics and normal maturing humans to avoid this type of systemic tissue damage. Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on January 2021. Written By Steven Joyal, MD. It may seem inconceivable, but scientists long ago learned why aging people suffer so many disorders related to their eyes, kidneys, brain, and vascular system. While these pathological processes are accelerated in diabetics, they affect all aging people to one degree or another. In a startling revelation, Steven Joyal, MD, lays out an innovative, but remarkably simple program to enable both diabetics and normal aging humans to avoid these horrendous biological consequences. The article you are about to read is a summary of Dr. Joyal’s new book titled What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Diabetes. In fact, this book contains vital information for every aging person. The reason is that most aging people suffer pre-diabetic pathologies and should therefore follow similar strategies to protect against common age-related diseases. Diabetes Is a Form of Accelerated Aging For decades, scientists have been trying to uncover the root causes of premature aging. The fact that diabetes is a form of accelerated aging comes as a surprise to most people. In fact, life expectancy for people with diabetes is four to eight years less than for non-diabetics. Both aging and diabetes share two important biological processes that damage the body: glycation, which results in damage to protein and lipid molecules, and oxidative stress, characterized by increased free-radical activity and damage to tissues by molecules like reactive sugar aldehydes. And many signs and symptoms of diabetes also commonly occur with aging, including: Cardiovascular ailments, such as heart attack,poor circulation in the legs, and atherosclerosis (a general term for several diseases characterized by thickening and hardening of the arteries), and stroke. Increased prevalence of certain types of cancer (pancreas, colon, and liver). Vision problems, including cataracts, glaucoma, and retinal degeneration. Impotence. Hearing loss. Memory loss or other cognitive impairment. Skin conditions, such as rashes, infections, thin skin, and discoloration. Loss of elasticity and flexibility of skin and other tissues. Given that diabetes and aging share so many characteristics, it’s not surprising that they also respond to many of the same prevention and treatment strategies. Glycation and Glycotoxins: AGEs Age You Faster When patients hear that glycation is one of the major consequences of diabetes and a contributing factor in diabetic complications, their typical response is, “I’ve never heard of it. Is it something new?” When they hear that scientists have known about glycation since at least 1912 and of its major impact on diabetes and diabetic complications since the 1980s, their typical response is, “Why haven’t I heard about it? Why isn’t my doctor talking about it?” Glycation is a biochemical process that involves a series of non-enzymatic reactions (those that don’t require enzymes to make them happen) between proteins and/or certain lipids (fats) and glucose. The result is the formation of toxic substances known as AGEs—advanced glycation end products—and ALEs—advanced lipoxidation end products. If you’ve ever made toast, then you’ve experienced glycation firsthand. Toasting bread involves the Maillard reaction—the browning reaction that occurs when food is heated and cooked at high temperatures. This reaction is also commonly observed when we grill lamb chops, broil salmon steaks, and make French fries. Levels of AGEs and ALEs increase as people grow older, and those levels are fueled by the foods we eat. In the past, scientists underestimated the impact of food-derived glycotoxins’ damage on human cells, organs, and tissues. Recent groundbreaking research, however, has uncovered startling evidence of the critical role that food-derived glycotoxins play in contributing to glycation in the body. Furthermore, recent research indicates AGEs play an important role in the aging process as well as in diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and certain types of neuropathy. Glycotoxin levels increase dramatically in people who have elevated blood glucose levels because these noxious substances thrive in high-glucose environments. Thus, glycotoxins are especially prevalent in individuals who have metabolic syndrome, predia-betes, or diabetes. Sites in the body that are especially susceptible to the accumulation of glycotoxins include the renal glomerulus (in the kidney), the retina (the membrane at the back of the eye that helps you see), and important blood vessels like the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply blood to the heart). We also know that glycotoxins play a significant role in causing chronic diseases that are associated with underlying inflammation, such as heart disease and neuropathy. What You Need to Know: Diabetes and Accelerated Aging Both aging and diabetes share two important biological processes that damage the body: glycation, which results in damage to protein and lipid molecules, and oxidative stress, characterized by increased free-radical activity and damage to tissues. Glycation is a biochemical process that involves a series of non-enzymatic reactions (those that don’t require enzymes to make them happen) between proteins and/or certain lipids (fats) and glucose, which result in the formation of dangerous glycotoxins called advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Foods in the fat and meat (protein) groups contain thirty-fold and twelve-fold higher AGE content, respectively, than foods in the carbohydrate group. On the other hand, fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, raw nuts, and other unprocessed, unrefined foods have low levels of glycotoxins. Glycotoxins are also formed during food production and preparation. Foods prepared under high heat (such as broiling, frying, hot-oven roasting, and barbecuing) are loaded with glycotoxins. Preparing food at temperatures less than 250°F avoids the formation of dietary glycotoxins. Such methods use liquids and lower cooking temperatures and include poaching, steaming, braising, stewing, and slow cooking (as in a crockpot cooker). The damage wrought by glycation can be prevented with specific nutrients. Benfotiamine helps prevents the nerve and blood vessel damage—and the resulting complications—that are caused by glycation. Carnosine is an antioxidant that acts as a shield against sugar molecules, thus preventing glycation. Carnosine also stimulates enzymes and other substances to eliminate damaged, glycated proteins, thus helping to reduce the impact of diabetic complications. How Glycotoxins Are Formed in Food Food-derived glycotoxins are formed during a series of chemical reactions that occur between glucose and the proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids derived from food. Glycotoxins trigger cells to send messages that lead to the production of inflam-matory substances called cytokines, which cause tissue damage in the body. Experimental studies show that this is exactly what happens in glycotoxin-induced vascular (blood vessel) damage often seen in diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is an AGE that is created when glucose molecules bind to hemoglobin, a protein in blood. Measurement of this factor in the blood is very helpful in monitoring the level of glycation damage in prediabetes and diabetes. An important strategy to reduce the level of glycation damage is to keep blood glucose levels within a healthy range (below 100 mg/dL premeal or after a fast). We also know from extensive research in this area that fasting blood sugar readings in the 70 to 85 mg/dL range appear optimal for disease prevention and longevity. Glycotoxins are also formed during food production and preparation. Food manufacturers use various heating processes to enhance flavor, color, and texture; to improve food safety (sterilization and pasteur-ization); and to extend shelf-life. Unfortunately, glycotoxins are a byproduct of these processes. Foods as varied as cola drinks, baked goods, caramel, and brewed products contain glycotoxins. Foods high in fat and protein (such as meat and poultry) typically have the highest glycotoxin levels. How you prepare your food (or have it prepared for you if you eat out) can also have a significant impact on the formation of glycotoxins. Glycotoxins are especially harmful to people with diabetes, in whom these molecules are associated with retinopathy (glycotoxins accumulate in the retinal blood vessels), neuropathy (they accumulate in peripheral nerves, resulting in nerve damage), kidney failure (they are found in kidney tissue), heart disease, and blood vessel disease. High blood glucose levels also invite damage from another source—oxidative stress. Oxidative Stress You may remember from high-school chemistry that molecules are composed of atoms, which in turn each consist of a nucleus, protons, neutrons, and electrons. The atoms of a molecule are held together by chemical bonds. When these bonds are broken—which occurs naturally as part of metabolism, for example—highly reactive molecules called free radicals can be produced. Exposure to environmental toxins (pollution, food additives, radiation, pesticides, and cigarette smoke, for example) also stimulates the production of free radicals. The body can often ward off the damage these free radicals may cause by sending in antioxidants, substances to prevent the oxidative damage that free radicals can inflict on the body’s tissues. If, however, the body is under stress, which can be caused by failing to follow a diet that contains enough antioxidants (in other words, lots of fresh fruits and vegetables), the body may not be able to neutralize these damaging molecules. When this happens, the end result may be damage to the body’s cells, tissues, and organs. This damage has been associated with several complications of diabetes, including injury to the heart and blood vessels. In addition, free-radical damage is a well-known cause of the accelerated aging of tissues in the body. Food Item AGE Content Beef boiled for 1 hour 22 kU/g Beef broiled for 15 minutes 60 kU/g Fried chicken breast 61 kU/g Broiled chicken breast 58 kU/g Raw tofu 8 kU/g Broiled tofu 41 kU/g kU/g: units of AGEs per gram of food Oxidative Stress and Metabolism There are many different types of free radicals, but those that play a critical role in cardiovascular and metabolic problems are called superoxide radicals and peroxynitrite. Research has shown that hyperglycemia (high levels of glucose in the blood) promotes the formation of free radicals, especially superoxide radicals, and therefore oxidative stress as well. Situations that can promote oxidative stress include: Hyperinsulinemia (high insulin levels). Elevated fasting and postmeal (postprandial)levels of triglycerides and cholesterol. Elevated levels of superoxide, which in turn generate highly reactive peroxynitrite and can trigger many damaging events in the body, including heart, kidney, blood vessel, and eye problems Repetitive episodes of ischemia (lack of blood flow and oxygen to tissue), which occurs in diabetes patients who have coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease. Oxidative stress, in turn, stimulates the development and progression of complications from diabetes. Some research even suggests that oxidative stress serves as a key trigger for diabetes. In fact, sophisticated experiments on insulin resistance show that repeated exposure of insulin-resistant tissue to oxidative stress can result in hyper-glycemia. As we can see, therefore, reducing food-derived glycotoxins in the diet as well as oxidative stress can have a significant, positive impact on our health. An Anti-Glycation Eating Plan An innovative, easy-to-follow eating plan that reduces the negative impact of age-accelerating dietary glycotoxins in the body is essential. Overall, foods in the fat and meat (protein) groups contain thirty-fold and twelve-fold higher advanced glycation end product (AGE) content, respectively, than foods in the carbohydrate group. On the other hand, fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, raw nuts, and other unprocessed, unrefined foods have low levels of glycotoxins. A key factor in the formation of food-derived glycotoxins is temperature. Foods high in protein and fat (such as animal products like beef, pork, poultry, fish, seafood, and lamb) as well as foods high in fructose that are cooked, heated, or processed at high temperatures are loaded with glycotoxins. High-temperature cooking methods should be used sparingly—certainly not every day and only a few times a week if possible. Instead, preparing food at temperatures less than 250°F minimizes the formation of dietary glycotoxins. Such methods use liquids and lower cooking temperatures and include poaching, steaming, braising, stewing, and slow cooking (as in a crockpot cooker). Be on the lookout for foods that are broiled, barbecued, grilled, fried, or oven roasted—these cooking methods use high temperatures and dry cooking conditions, which generate high levels of dietary glycotoxins. Here’s a quick comparison of different cooking methods and the resulting glycotoxin content of some common foods. Although broiling is believed to be a “healthier” cooking method than frying, it doesn’t make much difference whether you broil or fry a chicken breast; you will end up with about the same amount of glycotoxins: 58 kU/g and 61 kU/g, respectively. The AGE content of beef boiled for one hour is 22 kU/g, while broiling beef for just fifteen minutes results in a value of 60 kU/g, roughly triple the glycotoxin content. This is because the temperature involved in boiling beef is much less than for broiling beef. Typically, beef is broiled at temperatures that exceed 500˚F. Boiling, on the other hand, is a cooking method that uses water and does not exceed a temperature of 212˚F. When it comes to tofu, the choice between raw (8 kU/g) and broiled (41 kU/g) is quite dramatic—broiling generates about five times the glycotoxin level. In comparison, fresh fruits and vegetables barely make the charts for dietary glycotoxins (apples 0.13 kU/g, bananas 0.01 kU/g, and carrots 0.1 kU/g). Diets High in Glycotoxins Induce Endothelial Dysfunction and Inflammation A group of non-smoking patients were divided into two groups: one group consumed a diet high in glycotoxins, the other a diet low in glyco-toxins. Results from the six-week study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2002, showed that patients in the high-glyco-toxin group had a 35% increase in serum levels of C-reactive protein (a marker of inflammation), an 86% increase in serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels (an important inflammatory cytokine), and a 20% decrease in endothelial function. Patients in the low-glycotoxin group, however, showed a decrease in these signs of inflammation. Choose Glycotoxin-Free Foods Glycotoxins found in foods cooked or otherwise prepared under high heat (such as broiling, grilling, and frying) accumulate in tissues and organs throughout the body. But they also remain there for a very long time. Although the rate of absorption of food-derived glycotoxins is not very high, the body’s ability to remove them (through excretion) is limited. Studies show, for example, that although about 70% of the glycotoxins you eat escape being absorbed by the digestive tract (the body does have ways to resist these invaders), only 33% of the absorbed glycotoxins show up in the urine over a 48-hour period. This means that the glycotoxins are deposited in tissues of the body, where they can wreak havoc. So, to help you get started on your anti-glycation eating program, let’s look at how to choose and prepare glycotoxin-free foods. What’s Cooking When it comes to eating to prevent diabetes, please remember that it’s not only what you eat that’s important, it is how it is prepared. For example, if you have diabetes, given a choice between roasting, grilling, or poaching salmon, which cooking method should you select if you want to help avoid the food-derived glycotoxins that promote nerve and blood vessel damage, both of which cause and contribute to major complications of diabetes? If you guessed poached salmon, you’re right. Cooking foods using intense heat and without water or other liquids, such as broth or wine, causes the sugars to bind non-enzymatically with proteins (collagen and elastin fibers) to form glycotoxins. Visual evidence of this chemical reaction is the browning reaction seen in food cooked under high, dry heat. The cookies and cake in the oven, the chicken on the grill, and the potatoes in the frying pan are all browning and manufacturing AGEs and ALEs, increasing your risk of developing cardiovascular complications and speeding up the aging process itself. Whether or not you already have high blood glucose levels, which typically accelerate the biochemical reactions that lead to glycation inside the body, eating foods that are cooked with high heat adds food-derived glycotoxins, which further adds fuel to the fire in terms of glycation. Cooking meats at high temperatures also creates other health hazards, such as the formation of gene-mutating toxins—carcinogens—that significantly increase the risk of cancer. Cooking with liquids, for example steaming or poaching, inhibits the non-enzymatic attachment of sugar and fat to proteins. “The idea that how I cook my food can have such a tremendous impact on my diabetes is just incredible to me,” says Jean, a 51-year-old court clerk. “I was so excited when I learned about glycation and glycotoxins, and how broiling, barbecuing, and grilling are damaging my health. It was enough to make me change how I cook and what I order when I eat out, and now I feel much more in control of my diabetes and my life.” Eating Out Following an anti-glycation eating plan when dining out is easy! One tip is to always verify how a particular menu item is prepared. If you don’t see what you want, ask if a particular item can be made for you. For example, ask if a grilled fish dish can be poached instead. Request steamed vegetables instead of roasted or grilled vegetables. Choose poached chicken instead of the broiled steak or stir-fried chicken. Here are some other tips to consider when eating out: Don’t stop at fast-food establishments. Most items in fast-food restaurants are loaded with glycotoxins. Examples of foods very high in diabetes-accelerating and premature aging-promoting glycotoxins include grilled hamburgers, fried chicken, deep-fried onion rings, and French fries. Call ahead and ask if the restaurant’s chef can prepare a specific entrée for you using low-temperature cooking methods that use liquid, like braising, poaching, and stewing. Be creative. If the restaurant does not have a suitable entrée, order items from the appetizer, soup, salad, and side dish sections of the menu. Bring your own dressing or condiments. Your freshly made olive or flaxseed oil dressing can be the perfect topping for your restaurant salad as opposed to unhealthy commercial salad dressings. Start your meal with broth-based soup or a leafy green salad spritzed with olive oil and vinegar. What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Diabetes also provides details of specific nutrients that can help prevent the damage caused by glycation. Anti-Glycation Nutrients To help protect yourself against the damaging consequences of glycation, there is one supplement that is especially important: benfotiamine. Few people have heard about this special variation of vitamin B1 that has been shown to prevent nerve and blood vessel damage—and the resulting complications—that are caused by glycation. What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Diabetes highlights many experimental studies that show the benefit of benfotiamine in relieving pain due to the nerve and inflammatory damage wrought by glycation, helping alleviate oxidative damage, and preventing glycation-induced damage to the all-important endothelium in blood vessels. One example is a recent study that shows how benfotiamine significantly improves blood flow and reduces oxidative stress in patients who are given meals high in food-derived glycotoxins. What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Diabetes also presents a study recently published in Diabetes Care that points to the amazing effect of benfotiamine in preventing glycotoxin-induced inflammation, endothelial dysfunction in the vascular system, and oxidative stress in human patients. In this important study, patients were given a heat-processed test meal with a high level of dietary glycotoxins and then supplemented with 1,050 mg of benfotiamine daily. Benfotiamine significantly reduced glycotoxin-induced damage to the vascular system in these patients. Yet another impressive study in patients with painful peripheral neuropathy shows that 100 mg of benfotiamine given four times daily significantly improves neuropathy scores, with the greatest effect being a reduction in pain in these patients. This recent study confirms the results of a 1999 study, which showed significant improvements in neuropathy scores after only three weeks in patients suffering from painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy. These patients received up to 320 mg of benfotiamine daily, with greater benefits seen in the high-dose group. Benfotiamine provides tremendous benefit by stopping the accumulation of sugar-derived compounds called triosephosphates that can damage blood and nerve cells. Benfotiamine also activates a key enzyme called transketolase, which renders these triosephosphates harmless, thus inhibiting the damaging action of glycation. Benfotiamine supplementation therefore holds promising potential for patients who have diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and kidney disease and no side effects have been reported from its use. Another important supplement for protecting against glycation-induced damage is carnosine. Carnosine is a molecule (dipeptide) composed of two amino acids—beta-alanine and histidine. Carnosine is valuable because it helps inhibit accelerated aging by interfering with glycation, thus protecting against glycation-induced damage and acting as an anti-oxidant to fight oxidative stress. By binding to protein molecules, carnosine acts as a shield against sugar molecules, thus preventing glycation. Carnosine can also stimulate enzymes and other substances to eliminate damaged, glycated protein, thus helping to reduce the impact of diabetic complications. Evidence of carnosine’s anti-glycation abilities has emerged from several studies. In one recent example involving human cells, carnosine was shown to protect kidney cells against damage from high glucose levels. In another, investigators noted that carnosine and its two precursors—beta-alanine and histidine—may help inhibit the development of atherosclerosis caused by high levels of glycation in diabetes. When carnosine was compared with the anti-glycating drug aminoguanidine in cell culture studies, the supplement proved to be as effective, probably because it inhibits glycation earlier in the process than the drug does. Cook to Your Health and Minimize Glycotoxin Formation from Food DO: Marinate foods in liquids and seasonings: lemon juice, dry wine, broth, olive oil, cider vinegar. Feel free to add herbs and spices, including garlic, mustard, thyme, sage, tarragon, and others. Marinating foods can help delay the reactions that lead to glycotoxin formation. DO: Eat foods prepared using low-heat cooking methods that employ water or liquid, like poaching, stewing, braising, boiling, steaming, slow-cooker cooking, and so on. Include a raw vegetable salad (and fruit) every day. AVOID: Broiling, frying, hot-oven roasting, grilling, and barbecuing. While healthy people usually take 1,000 mg a day of carnosine in two divided doses (500 mg two times daily), diabetics may consider taking 1,000 mg of carnosine two to three times a day. Summary As we age, all of us face an onslaught of damage from oxidative stress and glycation. Whether you have diabetes, want to prevent diabetes, or want to minimize the age-accelerating impact upon your body from free-radical damage and glycation, What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Diabetes provides a wealth of information including a comprehensive, integrated plan that includes nutritional supplements, an anti-glycation eating plan, pharmacologic options (when appropriate), and lifestyle modification to help you combat several insidious factors of aging to live healthier and longer.

Here we show how to determine your risk for metabolic syndrome, and how to guard against this deadly condition. Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on January 2021. Written By Steven V. Joyal, MD. Dropping dead from a heart attack, being crippled by a catastrophic stroke, having limbs amputated as a result of peripheral vascular disease—these are among the frightening consequences of vascular disease, the number-one killer of Americans. Metabolic syndrome and its associated condition of insulin resistance pose a major threat to cardiovascular health that most health care practitioners do not even discuss with their patients. Remarkably, the public knows very little about this silent but deadly condition, and many affected individuals are not even aware that metabolic syndrome is inflicting severe damage to their arteries and brain cells. The news media and health care providers pay almost no attention to the epidemic of insulin resistance, the fundamental cause of metabolic syndrome. To avoid the potentially disastrous cardiovascular consequences of metabolic syndrome, you need to understand: What metabolic syndrome is and how to determine whether you meet its diagnostic criteria (a tape measure, a blood pressure cuff, and some simple blood tests are all you need). How to identify the risk of insulin resistance through simple blood tests. Why body weight is not very important for metabolic health, but body composition is critical. How a simple but very effective program—and not the latest fad diet—can dramatically reduce your risk for insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Which nutritional supplements can help reduce your risk of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. (These include two promising supplements derived from water-soluble extracts of cinnamon and coffee—one of which targets the same hormone that multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical companies tout as key to the next breakthrough therapy for metabolic disease.) Gauging Your Risk for Insulin Resistance Metabolic syndrome is characterized by insulin resistance. Before explaining insulin resistance, we need to understand what insulin is and how it acts in the body. A hormone produced in the pancreas, insulin’s major function is to regulate blood sugar, or glucose, levels. Insulin helps to shuttle glucose molecules from the blood into the cells of the body. When blood sugar levels increase, insulin output increases. Insulin resistance means that insulin does not work optimally at its target tissue—such as muscle, fat, or liver tissue—to drive glucose into cells. This has numerous adverse consequences, including glucose and insulin levels that are much higher than normal. As the body attempts to overcompensate for poor insulin action by pumping out more insulin from the pancreas, insulin levels rise. Eventually, over time, the pancreas can “burn out” and no longer produce enough insulin to control blood sugar. When insulin levels are not sufficient to bring blood sugar levels down to the normal range, type II diabetes mellitus can result. The gold standard for measuring insulin resistance is a very complex procedure called a “hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp” that is offered at specialized academic medical research centers. In this two-hour procedure, insulin is infused intravenously at a constant rate according to body weight. At the same time, glucose is infused intravenously at a variable rate to balance out the insulin infusion. The rate of glucose infusion into blood during the last 30 minutes of the test determines insulin sensitivity. Fortunately, to help determine your risk of insulin resistance, you do not have to travel to an academic medical center to have the “hyper-insulinemic euglycemic clamp” performed; instead, you need only undergo some simple blood tests. Certain blood tests such as fasting insulin can serve as surrogate markers for insulin resistance. Excess insulin (fasting hyperinsulinemia) is defined when levels equal to or greater than 15 µU/mL are found. These higher fasting insulin levels are associated with insulin resistance.1 Other blood tests that are very useful in evaluating the risk of insulin resistance include serum triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Triglycerides equal to or greater than 130 mg/dL and a triglyceride:HDL ratio equal to or above 3.0 suggest a high risk of insulin resistance.1 In fact, the Life Extension Foundation has consistently advocated even lower levels of triglycerides (less than 100 mg/dL) as being optimal. ARE YOU AT RISK FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME? Having your fasting insulin, triglycerides, and HDL checked can help you determine whether you are at risk for insulin resistance. The following values indicate that you are at risk for insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome:1 Fasting insulin >= 15 µU/mL Triglycerides >= 130 mg/dL Triglycerides:HDL ratio >= 3.0. Age-Adjusted Prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome. Source: Ford ES, Giles WH, Dietz WH. Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome among US adults: findings from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. JAMA. 2002 Jan 16; 287(3):356-9. Do You Have Metabolic Syndrome? Afflicting one of every five Americans (with even higher rates in certain ethnic populations), metabolic syndrome has ominous implications for cardiovascular disease risk.2 More than 20 years ago, scientists identified the constellation of conditions that characterizes metabolic syndrome in a group of patients with a drastically elevated risk of heart disease and stroke. Initially called “Syndrome X” by scientists, it is now known as metabolic syndrome. This dangerous condition is characterized by insulin resistance, which leads to abnormally high serum lipids and cholesterol, high blood pressure, abnormally high blood sugar, and increased blood-clotting tendencies.3 Metabolic syndrome dramatically increases cardiovascular disease risk.4 Recent trial results in more than 1,200 men followed for 11 years found that those with metabolic syndrome were up to 360% more likely to die from coronary heart disease.5 The diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome can differ slightly depending on the medical experts consulted. A standard, accepted definition was established by the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III).6 According to its definition, you have metabolic syndrome if you have three or more of the following criteria: Central obesity as measured by waist circumference: Men: > 40 inches. Women: > 35 inches. Fasting blood triglycerides: > 150 mg/dL. Blood HDL: Men: < 40 mg/dL. Women: < 50 mg/dL. Blood pressure: >= 130/85 mmHg. Fasting glucose: >= 100 mg/dL (recently changed from >= 110 mg/dL to reflect the revised American Diabetes Association criterion for impaired fasting glucose). A Program for Averting Metabolic Syndrome The following step-by-step program can help you avert the potentially deadly consequences of metabolic syndrome. Taking these simple steps can help you lead a long, healthy life and avoid succumbing to a multitude of life-threatening diseases. Step 1: Assess Your Body Composition. The first step involves knowing and understanding your body composition and its importance in helping to prevent metabolic syndrome. Surprisingly, stepping on a scale and seeing what you weigh does not tell very much about your risk of developing metabolic disease. Body mass index (BMI) is a standard measure of overweight and obesity. BMI is obtained by dividing your body weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared (kg/m2). However, BMI fails to account for body composition. Your body composition is a measure of how much lean body mass (muscle) and adipose tissue (body fat) you have. Compare two 40-year-old men, both of whom stand six feet tall and weigh 200 pounds. One man is very muscular (about 7% body fat) and has a waist circumference of 32 inches. By contrast, the other man is out of shape (about 30% body fat) and has a waist circumference of 40 inches. The key point is, both men have the same BMI. Does this mean that both men have the same risk of developing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome? No! DETECTING METABOLIC SYNDROME To determine whether you have metabolic syndrome, ask your doctor to measure your waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose, serum triglycerides, and HDL. By Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, you have metabolic syndrome if you have three or more of the following criteria: Central obesity as measured by waist circumference: Men: > 40 inches. Women: > 35 inches. Fasting blood triglycerides: > 150 mg/dL. Blood HDL: Men: < 40 mg/dL. Women: < 50 mg/dL. Blood pressure: > or = 130/85 mmHg. Fasting glucose: > or = 100 mg/dL. The man who has poor body composition (low level of lean body mass, high level of fat mass) and carries his body fat around his waist (central obesity) is at risk of developing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. The physically fit man with a low amount of body fat and a slim waist is at very, very low risk of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Unfortunately, many individuals pay more attention to body weight than to body composition. Scientists, however, know better. The easiest surrogate assessment of body composition is central obesity, and the easiest way to determine central obesity is to measure waist circumference—if you have a big waist, your risk of metabolic disease is increased. Step 2: Maintain Good Body Composition. How do you obtain and maintain good body composition? Maintaining lean body mass and decreasing body fat is easier than you think. First, do not fall for the latest fad diet. Maintaining a stable body weight is not magic. Ignore any diet “guru” who promises “magical” weight loss, vilifies “forbidden foods,” and promotes excluding certain food “types” based on the latest round of misunderstood and misinterpreted science. Do not buy into it! Instead, simply eat more whole foods and fewer processed foods. Prioritize eating high-quality foods like salmon, vegetables, wild rice, berries, and citrus fruits. De-emphasize eating foods that are highly processed or of low nutritional value, such as cakes, cookies, bagels, fried chicken, and American cheese. In fact, studies show that diets that emphasize whole foods, such as the Mediterranean diet, help maintain lean body mass while also improving metabolic markers like insulin, cholesterol, fibrinogen, and uric acid.7 Other studies of people eating Mediterranean-type diets show a strong reduction in cholesterol levels, increased psychological and physical well-being, and a trend towards weight loss even without trying to diet.8 A great-tasting, healthy diet is abundant in whole foods, much like the traditional diets of Africa, Asia, and the Mediterranean. This style of eating is rich in whole grains, whole fruits, and green vegetables, incorporates low to modest amounts of protein, and is high in “good fats” from sources such as sesame seeds, walnuts, almonds, and olives. Moderate amounts of high-fiber carbohydrates and “good fats” predominate in traditional diets of the Mediterranean, Asia, and Africa. Randomized clinical trials have shown that this type of diet may be best for people at risk for metabolic disease. For example, a trial in patients with type II diabetes mellitus showed better blood sugar control and cholesterol levels in people consuming a diet comprising 40% carbohydrates, 45% fat, and 15% protein compared to those who consumed a diet consisting of 55% carbohydrates, 30% fat, and 15% protein.9 In other studies, a diet moderate in carbohydrates and relatively high in monounsaturated fat from olive oil and polyunsaturated fat from fish—such as the Mediterranean diet—actually decreased insulin resistance and inflammation.10 Furthermore, this diet is better than the step I National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) diet in preventing heart disease and stroke.11 Second, if you are not physically active, start moving your body! Simply walking at a brisk pace three to five days each week for at least 20 minutes will help. If and when you get more ambitious, you can engage in more demanding physical activities at a higher level of exertion. In addition, consider weight training to build more muscle mass and to stimulate your metabolism. Step 3: Improve Metabolic Function with Nutritional Supplements. Smart supplementation can have a significant impact on metabolic health. A number of nutritional supplements hold great promise for normalizing blood sugar and metabolic control. Chromium. Chromium is a critically essential cofactor for glucose control. Chromium helps insulin shuttle blood sugar (glucose) into cells. In fact, without chromium, insulin cannot work properly. Unfortunately, most Americans are deficient in this critical nutrient. Some experts believe that Americans ingest less than half the recom-mended daily amount of chromium.12 This may be partly due to the nation’s over-reliance on processed foods, which are generally rich in calories but poor in nutrients. Another factor contributing to widespread chromium deficiency is food grown in soil containing a low content of minerals such as chromium. In fact, the 1992 Earth Summit report showed that North American soils have been depleted of 85% of their mineral content in the past 100 years—the highest rate of mineral depletion in the world.13 Thus, it should come as no surprise that the foods we consume are deficient in trace minerals such as chromium. Some scientists have postulated that rising rates of metabolic syndrome and diabetes in the US may result in part from declining levels of chromium in American soil and diets. Many clinical studies of patients with and without metabolic disease have shown metabolic benefits—including improved blood sugar control, cholesterol, and insulin—with supplemental chromium doses from 200 to 1000 mcg daily.14-17 Recently, a bioavailable and biologically safe form of chromium called chromium 454™ has attracted the attention of nutritional scientists seeking ways to promote metabolic health. Derived from plant and biological extracts, this distinct form of chromium is water soluble, allowing for outstanding absorption. Insulin-deficient diabetic rats that received chromium 454™ for three weeks demonstrated an impressive 38% reduction in blood glucose levels. These findings led scientists to suggest that chromium may provide metabolic support for individuals seeking to optimize their blood glucose levels.18 DHEA. In both middle-aged and older men and women, suboptimal hormone profiles are not unusual. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a critical hormone that is involved in many metabolic processes, both directly and indirectly (through its conversion to testosterone and estrogen). Low levels of DHEA are associated with an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome. For example, a cross-sectional study of 400 men, aged 40-80, showed that the lower the DHEA level, the greater the risk of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.19 DHEA dosing should be individualized based on blood testing. A simple blood test known as DHEA-sulfate (DHEA-S) will provide important information about your DHEA levels. However, even relatively low doses can provide benefit. A study of elderly men and women showed that a daily dose of as little as 50 mg of DHEA for six months was associated with significant fat loss and improvements in insulin sensitivity.20 DHA/EPA. The long-chain omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) have a multitude of health benefits, including increased fat burning and improved glucose metabolism.21 In addition, EPA and DHA decrease the expression of genes involved in fat storage,22 down-regulate genes involved in inflammation,23 and lower levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation.24 Be careful, however, if you consume large amounts of fish, as you may be unwittingly ingesting large amounts of mercury, a kidney toxin that is found in high amounts in fish such as swordfish, shark, and even tuna.25,26 Supplementing with a high-quality omega-3 fatty acid product that has been tested and found to be free of contaminants and pollutants is a smart alternative to eating mercury-contaminated fish. Bioflavonoids. Inflammation is an important factor in the development of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.27,28 Bioflavonoids like quercetin, resveratrol, and olive polyphenols have natural anti-inflammatory properties and may offer protection against metabolic syndrome. Quercetin, a potent bioflavonoid found in vegetables, inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines (proteins involved in immunity and inflammation).29 Resveratrol, found in the skin of red fruits like grapes, has been shown to inhibit the expression of genes involved in inflammation better than the potent prescription corticosteroid dexamethasone.30 GREEN TEA’S REMARKABLE METABOLIC BENEFITS Green tea is a super-nutrient. Life Extension members have long known about the anti-cancer benefits of green tea rich in epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Green tea also has valuable metabolic advantages. Green tea promotes healthy blood sugar (glucose) metabolism in humans and obese, diabetic mice without increasing insulin levels.32 Life Extension has long warned about the dangers of excess insulin levels. Green tea rich in EGCG enhances insulin action instead of promoting insulin release.33 Furthermore, green tea and EGCG reduce fat cell creation and growth, as well as blood levels of triglycerides and cholesterol.34 As an added bonus, green tea protects against protein oxidation and glycation (the process by which tissues become damaged by high levels of circulating blood glucose).35 In addition to having potent anti-inflammatory effects,31 olive polyphenols have beneficial benefits on the cardiovascular system. Studies show that olive polyphenols dramatically increase the resistance of cholesterol to oxidation.36 This is very important, as oxidized cholesterol serves as a trigger for atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).37 Olive polyphenols also benefit the vascular endothelium, the lining of blood vessel walls. Hydroxytyrosol, a principal polyphenol in olives, reduces the “stickiness” of cells in the vascular endothelium.38 Cell “stickiness” may increase the tendency to form blood clots in the arteries. Carotenoids and retinoids. Carotenoids (found in foods like carrots, squash, and tomatoes) and retinoids, which are beneficial to eye health, also play an important role in preventing metabolic disease. Interestingly, experiments in early growth and development show that low vitamin A intake decreases insulin-producing cells,39 pointing to the importance of adequate vitamin A intake for development of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that even after adjusting for confounding factors like age, sex, ethnicity, education, smoking status, and physical activity, people with metabolic syndrome had significantly lower concentrations of carotenoids and retinyl esters (a type of vitamin A).40 Evidence suggests that there may be a threshold for vitamin A consumption in terms of metabolic benefit. In one study, daily vitamin A intake of more than 10,000 IU significantly lowered blood sugar and insulin levels in healthy human volunteers, while daily intake of less than 8000 IU was associated with higher blood sugar levels.41 Water-soluble cinnamon extracts. Exciting data show that a special extract from cinnamon holds tremendous promise for normalizing blood sugar levels naturally. A 2003 study of patients with type II diabetes examined the effects of cinnamon on blood sugar. Participants received one, three, or six grams per day of cinnamon or placebo. After 40 days, the three groups receiving cinnamon demonstrated significant reductions in blood sugar of up to 29%, in triglycerides of up to 30%, and in cholesterol of up to 26%.42 So, all you need to do to prevent metabolic disease is consume large amounts of cinnamon, right? Wrong! Whole cinnamon contains volatile oils, which are well-known irritants that may trigger allergic reactions. Even more worrisome is that toxicology studies in mice show that consuming raw cinnamon rich in these oils can cause tumors, including squamous cell papillomas.43 Therefore, the best strategy is to avoid the danger of cinnamon’s volatile oils while still obtaining the remarkable benefits of cinnamon. Fortunately, these oils are not responsible for cinnamon’s impressive effects in stabilizing blood sugar. Instead, cinnamon’s water- soluble polyphenol polymers are the key components responsible for its beneficial metabolic effects.44 The polyphenol type-A polymers from cinnamon up-regulate genes involved in blood sugar control.45 Other cinnamon polyphenol polymers such as methylhydroxychalcone have additional beneficial effects on blood sugar control.46 Recent studies consistently show the anti-diabetic effects of cinnamon extracts in validated animal models of metabolic disease.47,48 Cinnamon extract not only supports healthy blood sugar levels, but also has excellent antioxidant properties. The natural water-soluble cinnamon extract inhibits oxidation even better than the powerful synthetic antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene, or BHT.49 Coffee polyphenols. Who would have ever thought that a water-soluble extract of coffee acts to boost the key target hormone that multi-billion-dollar pharmaceutical companies are targeting as the next breakthrough treatment for metabolic disease? A very large study (14,629 men and women) published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2004 showed that the greater your coffee consumption, the lower your risk of metabolic disease, including type II diabetes mellitus.50 Another very large study that followed 41,934 men showed a similarly powerful association between increased coffee intake and decreased risk of type II diabetes, even after adjusting for age, body mass index, and other risk factors.53 BANABA LEAF OFFERS BLOOD SUGAR SUPPORT A traditional folk remedy from Southeast Asia, banaba leaf extract may offer powerful support for people seeking to maintain healthy blood sugar levels. Banaba (Lagerstroemia speciosa L.) contains an active ingredient called corosolic acid. Laboratory, animal, and human studies show that corosolic acid effectively helps to support optimal glucose metabolism.51 Adults with diabetes or impaired glucose metabolism who received corosolic acid prior to an oral glucose tolerance test demonstrated significantly lower post-challenge glucose levels than people who did not take corosolic acid.51 A randomized clinical trial showed that banaba leaf extract rich in corosolic acid benefited adults with type II diabetes. When the diabetic individuals took a standardized corosolic acid supplement each day for two weeks, their blood glucose levels decreased by 20-30%.52 These findings suggest that banaba leaf extract standardized for corosolic acid content may benefit the millions of Americans who seek support for optimal blood sugar levels. Before you decide to drink a pot of coffee a day or open your own Starbucks, be advised that drinking large amounts of coffee is not the best strategy for preventing metabolic disease. Coffee can cause insomnia and may induce high blood pressure in some people, largely due to its caffeine content. Moreover, results of the 2004 ATTICA study showed that coffee consumption dramatically increases markers of inflammation like C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha.54 A smart strategy is to identify and isolate the components of coffee that are responsible for its beneficial effects on metabolism, including blood sugar control. Scientists have found that water extracts of roasted coffee residues, including the primary coffee polyphenols caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid, are key components responsible for coffee’s beneficial metabolic effects. Preclinical studies show that chlorogenic acid improves blood sugar control and decreases cholesterol and triglycerides.55 In human studies, chlorogenic acid, a major polyphenol in water extracts of coffee, has improved the release of hormones critical to blood sugar control. For example, in healthy human volunteers, consuming coffee polyphenols like chlorogenic acid dramatically increased glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion.56 This finding is remarkable because several GLP-1-related pharmaceutical agents are targeting this hormone as a treatment for metabolic disease, including the recently FDA-approved GLP-1 analog BYETTA™ (exenatide). Chlorogenic acid acts to increase GLP-1.57 Coffee extracts offer other benefits as well. Water-soluble coffee polyphenols like chlorogenic acid scavenge free radicals and provide powerful protection against lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage by proteins.58 SEVERAL SUPPLEMENTS FOR SUPPORTING OPTIMAL BLOOD SUGAR (GLUCOSE) LEVELS DHEA: 10-50 mg daily to start (men); 10-30 mg daily to start (women). Assess the effects of supplementation via repeat blood tests. EPA: 1400 mg daily; DHA: 1,000 mg daily. Take with meals. Double these doses to combat high triglyceride levels. Mixed bioflavonoids: 1400 mg twice daily. Vitamin A: 4000 IU daily; mixed carotenoids (for example, lutein: 15-20 mg daily; lycopene: 3-30 mg daily; zeaxanthin: 3-10 mg daily) Water-soluble cinnamon extract: 125 mg three times daily, 30 minutes before meals. Chromium: 400-800 mcg daily. Conclusion With so much focus on cholesterol, little attention has been paid to the critical role of insulin resistance in the development of cardiovascular disease. Insulin resistance is the root cause of metabolic syndrome, a serious risk factor for heart disease and stroke that has received little attention until recently. Identifying your risk for metabolic syndrome involves only a series of very simple tests. If you are found to be at risk, decreasing your body fat—particularly around your waist—is critically important. Avoid fad diets, eat a whole-food diet like those consumed by Mediterranean cultures, and get some physical exercise—your body will thank you for it! Nutritional supplements can help improve blood sugar control and metabolic health naturally, without danger or stress to your body. Particularly compelling are polyphenol-rich, water-soluble extracts of cinnamon and coffee, along with green tea extract, chromium, and banaba leaf-derived corosolic acid. Documented evidence demonstrates the ability of these agents to help normalize blood sugar levels. Avoiding the perils of metabolic syndrome is simple. First, get tested to see whether you are at risk. If laboratory testing and a physical examination reveal that you are at risk, immediately take the necessary steps—including exercise, a healthy diet, and targeted nutritional strategies—to prevent the dire cardiovascular consequences of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. PHARMACEUTICAL OPTIONS FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME Drug companies are keenly interested in developing new drug treatments for people with metabolic syndrome. Unfortunately, due to the overwhelming drive by multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical companies to continually make profits, one of the very best drugs to help increase insulin sensitivity and improve blood sugar control (without promoting weight gain) is rarely mentioned. This drug, metformin, is currently off patent and very cost-effective. Metformin, which belongs to a class of drugs called biguanides, works in several different ways to improve insulin’s ability to work at the cellular level in tissues such as muscle and the liver. Metformin is not associated with weight gain—a major advantage over all other drugs used to treat diabetes. Of additional interest is that gene-chip research funded by Life Extension showed that metformin influences gene expression in ways similar to those of caloric restriction. This suggests that metformin may have potential anti-aging benefits in addition to its documented effects on blood sugar control. Other currently available drugs that may be useful in treating metabolic syndrome include the thiazolidinediones, a class of drugs approved for the treatment of diabetes. Thiazolidinediones include GlaxoSmithKline’s rosiglitazone (Avandia®) and Takeda/Eli Lilly’s pioglitazone (Actos®). Thiazolidinediones work by targeting PPARs (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors), which are attractive drug targets for treating metabolic disease. PPARs help regulate the expression of genes involved in the storage and use of dietary fats. Two subtypes, PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma, have insulin-sensitizing effects. Among the new drugs in development for metabolic syndrome are AstraZeneca’s tesaglitazar, and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s muraglitazar. Individuals with kidney disease should not use metformin. Rosiglitazone (Avandia®) and pioglitazone (Actos®) should not be used by people with a history of congestive heart failure or liver disease. Please consult your doctor before using any pharmaceutical drug to treat metabolic syndrome. References 1. McLaughlin T, Abbasi F, Cheal K, et al.

Causes of hypoglycemia include blood-sugar-lowering medications and large post-meal fluctuations in glucose. Severe hypoglycemia, defined by blood sugar below 40 mg/dL, requires immediate treatment. In this protocol you will learn about the causes and symptoms of hypoglycemia, as well as the natural strategies for maintaining blood sugar levels within a normal, healthy range. When coupled with conventional treatment and at-home blood sugar monitoring, a healthy diet along with the supplements outlined in this protocol may help stabilize blood sugar levels in a healthy range. Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) have been shown to significantly improve glucose profiles and may help manage post-meal glucose levels. What is Hypoglycemia? Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can cause significant and life-threatening consequences if not treated immediately. Hypoglycemia is often caused by overly aggressive treatment with glucose-lowering drugs in diabetic patients—glucose levels drop too low, causing an episode of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can also be reactive; if glucose is absorbed too rapidly after eating, it can cause sudden spikes in insulin levels in people with diabetes or prediabetes, which then cause glucose levels to plummet. For patients with diabetes, proper dosing of medications is essential to avoid hypoglycemic episodes. Also, maintaining healthy glucose levels is a proactive step that is important for everyone. Natural interventions such as fructooligosaccharides and Irvingia gabonensis can help slow glucose absorption to prevent the sudden spikes and dips associated with hypoglycemic episodes. What Causes Hypoglycemia? Iatrogenic hypoglycemia: caused by diabetes medications that reduce blood glucose levels Reactive hypoglycemia: insulin hypersecretion after meals (common in people who have undergone gastric bypass) Other causes such as fluoroquinolone use, Addison’s disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, and advanced liver or kidney disease What are the Signs and Symptoms of Hypoglycemia? Shaking or tremors Pounding heart Anxiety Sweating Tingling If insufficient glucose is available in the brain, warmth, confusion, or drowsiness may occur. Prolonged hypoglycemia can lead to coma and/or death. Note: Symptoms of hypoglycemia do not always manifest; some people may be unaware they are hypoglycemic until glucose levels drop dangerously low. Proper glucose level monitoring is essential in those with diabetes or prediabetes. What are the Conventional Medical Treatments for Hypoglycemia? Immediately restoring normal blood glucose levels by administering glucose Long-term management to prevent future episodes, such as changing medications or dosing What Novel Therapies Exist for Hypoglycemia? Implantable continuous glucose monitoring devices Improving patients’ awareness of hypoglycemia with medications such as naltrexone or fluoxetine Treatment with acarbose to slow the breakdown of carbohydrates into glucose What Dietary and Lifestyle Changes Can Help Manage Hypoglycemia? Increase intake of dietary fiber to slow the rate of carbohydrate absorption Eat less refined carbohydrate-rich foods Eat several small meals and snacks throughout the day Do not drink alcohol without eating What Natural Interventions Can Help Manage Hypoglycemia? Fructooligosaccharides. Fructooligosaccharides are prebiotic fibers found in many plant foods that can help stabilize post-meal glucose levels. One study demonstrated that supplementation with fructooligosaccharides significantly improved glucose profiles and reduced episodes of hypoglycemia. Chromium. Chromium supplementation can help control blood glucose levels and improve the metabolism of carbohydrates. Green coffee bean extract. The extract from unroasted coffee beans and a derived compound, chlorogenic acid, have been shown to temper post-meal glucose spikes, reduce glucose absorption, and inhibit the intestinal enzyme alpha-glucosidase. White bean extract. White bean extract blocks alpha-amylase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down sugars. Blocking this enzyme slows the rate of glucose absorption. Irvingia gabonensis. African mango tree extract ( Irvingia gabonensis ) also blocks alpha-amylase . This extract may also help with weight loss. Seaweed extracts. Extracts from kelp and bladderwrack inhibit alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, the enzymes that help with breaking down dietary starches. L-arabinose. An indigestible plant compound, L-arabinose inhibits the enzymatic activity of sucrase, the enzyme that breaks down sucrose. L-arabinose can therefore prevent the spike in blood sugar that follows sugar-rich meals. 2 Introduction Glucose is a chief energy source for cells throughout the body. However, too much or too little of it can cause serious adverse consequences (Berber 2013; Shrayyef 2010). Despite the rampant, interrelated epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes, most Americans remain regrettably unaware of the long-term damage from chronically elevated glucose levels, also called hyperglycemia. Conditions like kidney damage, nerve damage, and often irreparable damage to the eyes that result from continuously elevated glucose take time to manifest (Campos 2012). However, even less well-appreciated than the long-term risks due to chronically elevated blood sugar is that very low blood sugar, termed hypoglycemia, can cause significant, acute,  life-threatening consequences if not treated immediately (Berber 2013). Blood sugar levels at or below 40 mg/dL characterize severe hypoglycemia (Desouza 2010; Tsai 2011; Carey 2013; Lacherade 2009). Low blood sugar levels in this range can cause a variety of symptoms ranging from weakness, sweating, fast heart rate, and tremors to confusion, irritability, or in severe cases, even coma and death (Sprague 2011; Berber 2013; McCrimmon 2012). With overly aggressive pharmaceutical treatment, patients with diabetes, both type 1 and type 2, are at risk for episodes of severe hypoglycemia. For type 1 diabetics, hypoglycemia can result from overtreatment with injectable insulin (Cryer 2010). In fact, hypoglycemia represents a serious barrier to successful management of type 1 diabetes; about 2-4% of acute death among type 1 diabetics are likely caused by hypoglycemia (Briscoe 2006; Cryer 2008). Type 2 diabetics can also develop hypoglycemia as a result of overtreatment with glucose-lowering drugs, in particular the class of drugs known as sulfonylureas (Kalra 2013; Bodmer 2008). In contrast to the potentially devastating consequences of over-aggressive drug treatment of hyperglycemia in diabetes patients with insulin and/or sulfonylureas, reactive hypoglycemia (or postprandial hypoglycemia) is a phenomenon in which blood sugar levels drop a few hours after eating (UW Health 2013). Typically, reactive hypoglycemia strikes people who are not diabetic but nevertheless manifest less than optimal glucose control (eg, individuals with prediabetes). These individuals are more prone to reactive hypoglycemia than healthy people. Reactive hypoglycemia is also more common in people who have undergone gastric bypass surgery for severe obesity. The drop in blood sugar level (or “crash”) observed in reactive hypoglycemia is the result of an overly exaggerated insulin spike following ingestion of carbohydrate, with a subsequent reactive plunge in blood sugar level due to the exaggerated spike in insulin (Brun 2000; Roslin 2011; Middleton 2012; Bell 1985). There are other, less common causes of hypoglycemia as well. For example, pancreatic tumors that result in excess insulin being released into circulation or inherited genetic defects in metabolism. In addition, excess alcohol, if consumed while fasting, can cause hypoglycemia, as can several medications (Berber 2013). Proactively taking steps to maintain glucose levels within a healthy range is an important long-term strategy. For diabetics, this includes ensuring medications are dosed appropriately and combined with careful monitoring of glucose levels. Among people who experience reactive hypoglycemia, effective prevention hinges upon avoidance of post-meal surges in glucose concentrations through diet modulation and a variety of natural interventions. For example, the rate of carbohydrate absorption can be slowed by inhibiting the alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase enzymes via supplementation with green coffee extract and Irvingia gabonensis (Ishikawa 2007; Oben 2008). Moreover, the prescription anti-diabetic drug acarbose also inhibits the alpha-glucosidase enzyme and slows the absorption of glucose. Unfortunately, many physicians overlook the potential of this well-studied drug to stabilize post-meal glucose levels and mitigate the exaggerated insulin spike that leads to hypoglycemia (Bavenholm 2006; Hanefeld 2007; Ozgen 1998). In this protocol you will learn about the physiology of glucose control and how the body orchestrates a complex system of checks and balances to keep blood sugar levels in a healthy range. You will also learn about some of the ways these regulatory mechanisms can fail and lead to hypoglycemia and what kind of symptoms this can cause. Hypoglycemia management strategies will be outlined along with integrative approaches and dietary considerations to help stabilize glucose levels and avert episodes of low blood sugar. 3 Understanding Glycemic Control Maintaining glucose balance is critical. When blood sugar is too high for too long (chronic hyperglycemia), irreversible damage can be done to various tissues. On the other hand, severe hypoglycemia may cause a person to become comatose or even die. To prevent these complications, the body has adopted a variety of mechanisms to maintain plasma glucose levels within certain values, a process known as homeostasis, which is controlled by a symphony of interrelated checks and balances within the body, including neurotransmitters, hormones, and organ systems  (Klement 2012).  Blood glucose is mainly derived from two sources: diet and synthesis in the liver via a process known as hepatic blood sugar production (Boden 2004). Excess dietary glucose can be stored in the liver as glycogen. Glucose can be released from glycogen in a process known as glycogenolysis. Another critical mechanism for glucose production in the liver is when glucose is newly synthesized from precursors; this process is known as hepatic gluconeogenesis (Cersosimo 2011). During gluconeogenesis, the liver converts certain amino acids or metabolites, such as alanine, glycerol, and lactate into glucose (Watford 2006).  Hormonal Regulation Islets are specialized clusters of hormone-secreting cells in the pancreas. Within the islets are alpha cells that secrete glucagon and beta cells that secrete insulin. The major effect of glucagon is to stimulate glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver, which results in an increase in the blood levels of glucose (Lee 2012). During carbohydrate ingestion, insulin inhibits glucagon and stimulates glucose uptake primarily in skeletal muscle, effectively lowering the blood glucose concentration (Lee 2011; Roth 2007).  Glucagon, as well as growth hormone, cortisol, and epinephrine all oppose the action of insulin and are known as “counter-regulatory hormones” (Lager 1991). In the absence of dietary carbohydrate, (eg, during starvation) hepatic glucose production by gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis guards against hypoglycemia (Rothman 1991; Cahill 2006). Upon carbohydrate ingestion, hepatic glucose production is reduced and blood glucose levels are maintained by dietary glucose absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract.  Dietary Contribution to Glucose Levels The contribution of diet to glucose levels is relatively straightforward: dietary carbohydrates are broken down into glucose and absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract after ingestion. Thus, eating a meal containing large amounts of carbohydrate contributes to a rapid elevation of blood glucose levels. Ingestion of a pure glucose solution causes detectable elevations in blood glucose levels in as little as 15 minutes (Shrayyef 2010). On the other hand, the more complex or “fibrous” the carbohydrates ingested are, the slower the subsequent glucose elevations. Moreover, the addition of fats and proteins to a meal can also slow glucose absorption (Gemen 2011; Bajorek 2010; Riccardi 1991). This is why a high-fiber diet with moderate amounts of slowly-digested carbohydrate, good quality protein, and healthy fats (eg omega-3 fatty acids from fish) is recommended for people with impaired glucose control, such as those with type 2 diabetes. With regard to hypoglycemia, the contribution of diet is somewhat counterintuitive. If too much rapidly-digested carbohydrate is consumed and absorbed quickly, an ensuing hypoglycemic episode can follow if the body generates an exaggerated insulin response to bring post-meal glucose levels back down (Kuipers 1999). This is called reactive hypoglycemia (Bell 1985). Thus, interventions aimed at reducing the rapid absorption of dietary carbohydrate can help avoid the reactive drop in blood sugar following an overly exaggerated insulin spike. Regulation of Glucose Levels Following a Meal Once glucose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream, the body must keep blood sugar from rising to levels above normal since too much glucose in the blood can damage tissues and contribute to inflammation and vascular stress (Averill 2009). The process of controlling after-meal glucose levels is a complex interplay of several organs, hormones, and neurotransmitters (Shrayyef 2010). When glucose levels rise following a meal, the pancreas releases the hormone insulin. Insulin triggers numerous tissues throughout the body to initiate the breakdown and/or storage of glucose, thus bringing blood glucose levels back down. Insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose from the blood into muscle and fat tissue, where it can either be stored or broken down and used to meet cellular energy demands. Insulin also suppresses the release of glucose from the liver, a significant source of glucose between meals (Shrayyef 2010). 4 Causes of Hypoglycemia Causes of hypoglycemia can broadly be classified as reactive or fasting, insulin-mediated or non-insulin-mediated, and drug-induced or non drug-induced (Merck 2012). Drug-Induced Hypoglycemia Iatrogenic (treatment-related) hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is most commonly associated with the treatment of diabetes, either with insulin or oral drugs that reduce blood sugar levels (Merck 2006; Cryer 2009). This is known as “iatrogenic hypoglycemia,” meaning it occurs as an adverse effect of treatment. In addition to glucose-lowering drugs, other drugs such as pentamidine (Nebupent®) or quinine may cause hypoglycemia (Merck 2006). Insulin injections, which are the staple treatment for type 1 diabetes and are also used in type 2 diabetes, contribute to hypoglycemia directly by causing glucose disposal into peripheral tissues such as fat and skeletal muscle. Several reviews of published studies reveal that attempts to aggressively lower blood glucose levels with intensive insulin therapy are associated with a 2-2.5-fold higher risk of severe hypoglycemia (Bloomfield 2012). One study found that the incidence of severe hypoglycemia was 3-fold higher among type 2 diabetic patients receiving insulin compared to those not receiving insulin (Samann 2012). The severity of this is evidenced by the ACCORD trial, wherein type 2 diabetics assigned to the intensive glucose-lowering treatment group experienced significantly more hypoglycemia and an increase in all-cause mortality (Gerstein 2008). In fact, for the group receiving the intensive treatment approach, the clinical trial was stopped after a 3.4-year follow-up period because the investigators noted a 22% higher all-cause mortality (Riddle 2010). Another type of drug often used to treat type 2 diabetes, sulfonylureas, are well-known causes of hypoglycemia (Holstein 2010). These drugs work by increasing pancreatic insulin secretion without regards to glucose level. Although the risk of hypoglycemia associated with sulfonylurea drugs is well known, studies suggest that this risk may be underappreciated, especially in patients who are older or have reduced kidney function (Holstein 2010). Metformin, an anti-diabetic drug that works by suppressing gluconeogenesis, is effective at controlling glucose levels in type 2 diabetic patients and has been shown to be far less likely to cause hypoglycemia. In fact, one study involving more than 50 000 subjects showed that the risk for developing hypoglycemia was 179% greater among diabetics receiving sulfonylureas compared to those taking metformin (Bodmer 2008). Antibiotics. Certain antibiotics are known to cause hypoglycemia. For example, the fluoroquinolone levofloxacin (Levaquin®) enhances insulin secretion by a mechanism similar to sulfonylureas and induces hypoglycemia, which sometimes may be life-threatening (Kelesidis 2009). Hypoglycemia has also been observed after the administration of norfloxacin (Noroxin®), another fluoroquinolone drug (Mishra 2012). Non Drug-Induced Hypoglycemia Reactive hypoglycemia. Reactive hypoglycemia occurs after eating, usually 2-5 hours after food intake, and is caused by insulin hypersecretion (McCool 1977; Hofeldt 1989; Altuntas 2005; Meier 2006; Bell 1985). This form of hypoglycemia is also more prevalent in people who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery; it was reported to occur as a late complication in about 72% of the patients who underwent gastric bypass surgery (Meier 2006; Mingrone 2012). This is thought to occur, at least in part, as a result of nesidioblastosis, excessive function of the cells of the pancreas that produce insulin (Rabiee 2011). Reactive hypoglycemia may also occur in people who have not had gastric bypass surgery (Mayo Clinic 2012a). In some cases, individuals have symptoms similar to reactive hypoglycemia without the corresponding low blood sugar levels. Nevertheless, these patients often reduce their risk of this condition by avoiding rapidly-absorbed carbohydrates and eating a high-fiber diet with moderate amounts of quality protein and fat (eg, omega-3 fatty acids) (Gaby 2011; Bell 1985). Reactive hypoglycemia is more common in overweight and obese individuals, people that are insulin-resistant as well as those with a family history of type 2 diabetes (Hamdy 2013). Glucagon deficiency. Glucagon deficiency can cause hypoglycemia, and together with other hormones such as epinephrine, glucagon represents a primary defense against hypoglycemia (Hussain 2005). One of the challenges in treating iatrogenic hypoglycemia is that in some diabetic patients with more pronounced damage to the pancreas, their glucagon response to hypoglycemia is defective, which can make their hypoglycemic episodes more severe and prolonged (Cryer 1983; Cryer 2009; Taborsky 2012). Addison’s disease. Cortisol is an anti-inflammatory hormone produced by the adrenal glands that also helps sustain glucose levels. Addison’s disease is a condition of adrenal insufficiency wherein the production of cortisol is impaired (MedlinePlus 2011). Addison’s patients often develop hypoglycemia, among other symptoms (Meyer 2012).   Fasting-induced hypoglycemia. Fasting-induced hypoglycemia is usually associated with either an insulin-secreting tumor, known as insulinoma, or with genetic mutations. Alternatively, excess alcohol consumption after a period of fasting could also trigger a bout of hypoglycemia. This is because alcohol cannot be excreted from the body as is, but it first needs to be metabolized in the liver (Berg 2002). Alcohol metabolism prevents the production of pyruvate, which is an important building block of gluconeogenesis (Berg 2002; Devenyi 1982; Watford 2006). Alcohol alone does not necessarily cause hypoglycemia, but it does when combined with the additional insult of fasting-induced depletion of liver glycogen reserves. Something similar is seen when fasting and alcohol ingestion are combined with sulfonylureas, drugs which enhance the secretion of insulin. In elderly individuals with type 2 diabetes, even a small amount of alcohol during a short-term fast were shown to lower blood glucose levels. In this case, the effect is compounded by sulfonylureas (Burge 1999). Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is associated with obesity and an exaggerated insulin response, and reactive hypoglycemia is significantly more prevalent in PCOS sufferers than the general population (Kasim-Karakas 2007).  Congenital/genetic causes. Fasting-induced hypoglycemia is associated with a number of congenital disorders, many of which are diagnosed in childhood and persist in adulthood. Some examples of conditions in this group are glycogen storage or fatty acid metabolism diseases and gluconeogenesis disorders (Douillard 2012).  Exercise-induced hypoglycemia. Exercise-induced hypoglycemia may be caused by pyruvate-related mutations that result in a massive insulin hypersecretion in response to anaerobic exercise (Meissner 2005). It causes hypoglycemia specifically during anaerobic exercise because pyruvate in the blood is increased by the high intensity activity. Another cause of exercise-induced hypoglycemia is hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF), which may be mediated by an exaggerated endorphin response to exercise. Other Causes Additional causes of hypoglycemia include (Toth 2013): Advanced liver or kidney disease Autoimmune disease Sepsis Hypopituitarism 5 Symptoms Symptoms of hypoglycemia can be organized into 2 primary categories: neurogenic and neuroglycopenic. Neurogenic symptoms are the result of activation of the sympathetic nervous system when glucose levels drop too low. These include shaking or tremors, a pounding heart, nervousness or anxiety, sweating, and tingling. Neuroglycopenic symptoms arise when insufficient glucose is available to fuel the brain. These include warmth, confusion, and drowsiness. During prolonged, severe hypoglycemia dramatic brain dysfunction can occur, potentially leading to coma and death (Towler 1993; MedlinePlus 2012). Hypoglycemic symptoms including anxiety, sweating, tremors, and fatigue do not always correlate with glucose levels (Nippoldt 2013). Individuals with low glucose levels may be asymptomatic or unaware of their hypoglycemia, and others with normal glucose levels may display hypoglycemic symptoms (Bakatselos 2011; Alken 2008; Palardy 1989).  6 Diagnosis and Conventional Treatment   Diagnosis A set of diagnostic criteria called Whipple’s Triad are used to establish a diagnosis of hypoglycemia. Whipple’s Triad includes 1) clinical symptoms/signs consistent with hypoglycemia; 2) low blood glucose levels at the time of the symptoms; and 3) relief of symptoms after the administration of glucose (Ng 2010; Bjelakovic 2011; Cryer 2009; Mayo Clinic 2012b). If onset is associated with a drug known to lower blood glucose, such as insulin, then the cause is deemed to be iatrogenic (treatment related) (Cryer 1992; Martorella 2011). If the underlying cause of hypoglycemia is not immediately obvious, several tests can be conducted to help determine the cause. Laboratory tests that may be helpful include: fasting glucose and insulin, an oral glucose tolerance test (which measures the body’s ability to react to ingestion of sugar), C-peptide levels (which may be elevated with use of sulfonylureas), cortisol (which can measure adrenal insufficiency), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (which can help identify an insulin-secreting tumor), and other blood tests (Cryer 2009; MedlinePlus 2013; Toth 2013; Hamdy 2013). Conventional Treatment Management of hypoglycemia includes two priorities: 1) immediately restoring glucose levels in a patient who presents with severe hypoglycemia, and 2) taking steps to help stabilize long-term glucose control and prevent additional episodes of hypoglycemia. Immediate treatment of hypoglycemia involves the administration of glucose (Merck 2007). Another option, in some cases, is to administer glucagon. However, this is ineffective in people who have been fasting or have experienced prolonged hypoglycemia. This is because glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis to restore blood glucose levels, but in fasting or prolonged hypoglycemic patients, liver glycogen stores have already been used up (Merck 2007; Roach 2012; Dohm 1986; Butler 1989; Koubi 1991; Kimmig 1983; Castle 2010). From a long-term management perspective, prevention of hypoglycemia encompasses treatment of the underlying cause. Since hypoglycemia most often occurs in diabetics being treated with glucose-lowering therapy, modification of dose or switching to a different drug is typically considered. For example, use of sulfonylureas for glucose management in type 2 diabetics is associated with increased frequency of hypoglycemia compared to metformin (Bodmer 2008). 7 Novel and Emerging Therapies   Implantable Continuous Glucose Monitoring Devices Many type 1 diabetics who use insulin have made the transition from self-injections and adjustable glucose infusion pumps to continuous glucose monitoring systems, also known as “closed-loops,” in which an implantable device measures blood glucose and constantly adjusts the insulin infusion rate. These systems allow for continual monitoring and adjustment of the insulin infusion rate without the need for patient predictions (Hovorka 2011). In one study, type 1 diabetics on implantable insulin pumps were randomly assigned in crossover fashion to their standard therapy or a closed-loop system. The closed-loop system achieved better overnight control of insulin and reduced the risk of hypoglycemia (Hovorka 2011). The use of integrated closed-loop control has been shown to reduce hypoglycemic episodes 2.7-fold over traditional insulin therapy. Moreover, it provided a 6-fold reduction in overnight hypoglycemia. This represents an important step toward improving patient safety and decreasing the risk of complications (Breton 2012). In another study, a closed-loop delivery system combining glucose monitoring with insulin and glucagon infusions dramatically reduced the number of participants who developed at least one hypoglycemic episode from 53% to 7% (Haidar 2013). Improving Hypoglycemia Awareness A major problem in the treatment of type 1 diabetes is patient unawareness of hypoglycemia. This occurs due to defects in the neural response that normally accompanies low blood glucose levels. The result is that individuals with type 1 diabetes may not be aware their glucose levels are falling too low (Cryer 2008). This phenomenon is called hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (Vele 2011). Some evidence suggests that naltrexone (Revia®), a drug used in the management of addictive disorders, may help improve hypoglycemia awareness (Feeney 2001; Blasio 2013). It works by blocking opioid receptor signaling. Studies show that blocking opioid receptor signaling helps improve the perceptibility of hypoglycemia (Vele 2011). As of the time of this writing, naltrexone, at a 25-50 mg/day dose, is being tested in type 1 diabetics to determine whether it can prevent hypoglycemia unawareness (Kumar 2012). Fluoxetine (Prozac®), the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used as an antidepressant, may also be useful for increasing hypoglycemia awareness. In one study, 20 healthy patients were subjected to an experimentally controlled bout of hypoglycemia, treated with 40-80 mg/day fluoxetine for 6 weeks, and then re-tested. The study found that this treatment increased several categories of counter-regulatory responses to hypoglycemia and resulted in an increase in endogenous glucose production (Briscoe 2008). The increased counter-regulatory response may allow patients to be more aware of an impending hypoglycemic episode. The Overlooked Potential of Acarbose in the Management of Reactive Hypoglycemia Individuals who suffer from reactive hypoglycemia may not realize that glucose levels going too high after a meal may be the culprit driving their symptoms. This seemingly counterintuitive phenomenon is the result of ingesting large amounts of carbohydrate, which are then quickly broken down to glucose by enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract before being absorbed. The subsequent spike in blood glucose levels triggers an exaggerated release of insulin from the pancreas, which then causes glucose levels to plummet to a hypoglycemic state (Brun 2000). One way of avoiding post-meal hypoglycemia is reducing carbohydrate consumption. However, this can be difficult in modern society where so many starchy foods are readily available. Fortunately, there is another method that most people who suffer from hypoglycemia are probably unaware of, and which is overlooked by many physicians: the anti-diabetic drug acarbose (Bavenholm 2006; Hanefeld 2007; Gerard 1984; Hasegawa 1998; Ozgen 1998; Derosa 2012). One of the key enzymes that break down carbohydrate into glucose is alpha-glucosidase. Acarbose inhibits alpha-glucosidase, thereby slowing the rate of glucose absorption into the bloodstream. This drug is typically used to help type 2 diabetics keep their blood sugar from going too high, but it may also benefit those who suffer from reactive hypoglycemia by suppressing the post-meal glucose surge that triggers excess insulin release and subsequent hypoglycemia (Bavenholm 2006; Hanefeld 2007; Derosa 2012). Several studies have investigated the efficacy of acarbose in managing reactive hypoglycemia. In one study, 21 subjects with reactive hypoglycemia were treated for 3 months with acarbose. Before the treatment, the subjects’ lowest glucose level 3 hours after an oral glucose challenge was 39 mg/dL. After 3 months of treatment with acarbose, the lowest glucose level 3 hours after the glucose load was 67 mg/dL. Moreover, the subjects’ insulin levels were reduced within the first few hours following a meal after treatment with acarbose. The researchers concluded “These results confirm that acarbose may be of value in preventing reactive hypoglycemia by reducing the early hyperglycemic stimulus to insulin secretion…” (Ozgen 1998). Another study demonstrated the immediate benefit of acarbose. Twenty-four subjects with postprandial hypoglycemia symptoms were given an oral sucrose challenge. Along with the sucrose solution, participants were given either 100 mg acarbose or a placebo. Compared to subjects who received placebo, those who took acarbose experienced significantly less reactive hypoglycemia after the sucrose challenge. Also, in some of the subjects who took acarbose, the post-challenge glucose level variance was attenuated: both the highest and lowest glucose levels were closer to baseline than in those who took the placebo. This indicates that acarbose blunted the post-challenge spike in glucose levels and the subsequent drop that characterizes reactive hypoglycemia. Insulin levels were also reduced in subjects who took acarbose (Gerard 1984). Additional evidence comes from a small study in which subjects with type 2 diabetes and symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia were treated with acarbose for one month. In this study, each subject took either 50 or 100 mg of acarbose 3 times daily before meals. Before treatment, all the subjects in the study experienced symptoms such as weakness, palpitation, and dizziness after meals. After one month of treatment with acarbose, these symptoms subsided and subjects’ post-meal glucose and insulin levels stabilized (Hasegawa 1998). For those who want to avoid prescription drugs, there are nutrients described later in this chapter that suppress alpha-glucosidase and other functions in the digestive tract that can cause too much glucose to be rapidly absorbed. 8 Dietary and Lifestyle Considerations   Life Extension® suggests that most healthy people strive to maintain fasting glucose levels between 70 and 85 mg/dL and 2-hour post-meal glucose levels no more than 40 mg/dL above fasting levels, or a maximum of 125 mg/dL. Adjustment of dietary habits can help stabilize glucose levels and achieve these goals for many people. In addition to the strategies outlined in this protocol, readers are encouraged to review the protocol on Diabetes. One dietary strategy for avoiding a rapid spike in blood sugar levels after a meal is increasing intake of dietary fiber, which slows the rate of carbohydrate absorption. For example, a study on 63 patients with type 1 diabetes assessed the effect of 24 weeks of a high- or low-fiber diet. Compared to 15 g of fiber daily, those who ate 39.1 g on average exhibited half as many episodes of hypoglycemia (Giaco 2000). The increased fiber intake in this study was accomplished by eating more fruits and vegetables. A more direct way to reduce the glycemic impact of the diet is to consume fewer carbohydrates. This was tested in a group of subjects with severe reactive hypoglycemia who had recently undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for weight loss (Kellogg 2008). In this study, the high-carbohydrate meal contained 79% carbohydrates, 11% fat, and 10% protein, and the low-carbohydrate meal contained 2% carbohydrates, 74% fat, and 24% protein.  Of 12 participants, 10 (83%) showed improvement in their symptoms, and of these, 3 (25%) had complete resolution of their symptoms (Kellogg 2008). These findings suggest that a low-carbohydrate diet attenuates pathological glycemic excursions in this population (Cui 2011). Typical dietary suggestions for reactive hypoglycemia include (Gaby 2011; Hamdy 2013; Nippoldt 2013): Avoid refined carbohydrates (eg, white rice, white flour). Eat several small meals and snacks throughout the day (6 small meals or in-between meal snacks). Avoid excess alcohol while fasting (or at least consume food while drinking alcohol). Eat foods with a lower glycemic index. These are foods that raise blood sugar levels more slowly (eg, lean protein, high-fiber foods). 9 Targeted Natural Interventions   Stabilization of glucose levels following a meal may help avert reactive hypoglycemia. Several natural interventions may help reduce post-meal glycemic variability. Fiber Supplementation of the diet with fiber such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS) may help stabilize post-meal glucose levels by prolonging carbohydrate absorption (Wursch 1997; Sabater-Molina 2009; Gietl 2012). This may be beneficial for people prone to reactive hypoglycemia. Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are fermentable prebiotic fibers found in plant foods such as onion, garlic, chicory, asparagus, artichokes, and bananas (Sabater-Molina 2009; Gietl 2012). A study found that supplementation with 20 g of FOS daily for two weeks in people with reactive hypoglycemia resulted in significantly improved blood glucose profiles and fewer episodes of hypoglycemia (Sorensen 2010). Chromium Chromium is an essential trace mineral that plays a significant role in sugar metabolism. Chromium supplementation helps control blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes and improves metabolism of carbohydrates (Ghosh 2002; Jovanovic 1999). A small, double-blind, crossover trial assessed the effects of chromium on 8 women with symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia. Supplemental chromium, at a daily dose of 200 mcg for 3 months, led to improvements in both blood sugar metabolism parameters and hypoglycemic symptoms such as sweating, trembling, and blurred vision (Anderson 1987).  Green Coffee Bean Extract Green coffee bean extract, an antioxidant-rich mixture from unroasted coffee beans, may temper post-meal spikes in glucose (Nagendran 2011). Chlorogenic acid, a compound derived from green coffee extract, has been shown to reduce glucose absorption in healthy volunteers (Thom 2007). One compelling study showed that people not taking green coffee extract had glucose levels of 130 mg/dL one hour after sugar ingestion. In this same study, glucose levels of subjects taking 400 mg of green coffee extract dropped to 93 mg/dL after sugar ingestion (Nagendran 2011). Chlorogenic acid may reduce postprandial hyperglycemia both by shutting down excess liver glucose production and also stimulating glucose uptake into skeletal muscle (Ong 2012; Ong 2013). Another means by which chlorogenic acid acts to suppress post-meal glucose surges is by inhibiting alpha-glucosidase. This intestinal enzyme breaks apart complex sugars and enhances their absorption into the blood (Pusztai 1998). Slowing the absorption of common sugars (including sucrose) limits after-meal glucose spikes (Alonso-Castro 2008). White Bean Extract (Phaseolus vulgaris) and Irvingia Gabonensis White bean extract (Phaseolus vulgaris) and Irvingia gabonensis are powerful blockers of the enzyme alpha-amylase, which is secreted by the pancreas (Mosca 2008; Obiro 2008). Alpha-amylase breaks down long-chain, complex starch molecules into simple sugars and short-chain oligosaccharides for absorption in the small intestine. Blocking alpha-amylase inhibits the metabolism of starches and slows the rate at which free sugars are absorbed (Udani 2004; Celleno 2007; Oben 2008; Ngondi 2009). In one double-blind, placebo-controlled study of obese but otherwise healthy adults, one month of supplementation with Irvingia gabonensis produced a 5.3% body weight loss in supplemented patients compared with only a 1.3% loss in the control group (Ngondi 2005). These individuals also saw significant improvement in their lipid profiles. Additional studies confirm these findings, demonstrating significant reductions in body fat  waist circumference, blood sugar levels, and markers of fat tissue regulation (Oben 2008; Ngondi 2009). White bean extract shows enormous potential for preventing the blood sugar and insulin spikes associated with many chronic health disorders (Preuss 2007). Slowing starch digestion prolongs the amount of time it takes for the stomach to empty its contents, reducing the amount of carbohydrate calories released at any one time into the intestine (Layer 1986). White bean extracts operate along numerous overlapping pathways in multiple, related physiological systems. Laboratory research shows that supplementation with white bean extract promotes weight loss in obese animals, with dramatic reduction in fat accumulation without loss of muscle mass (Santoro 1997; Pusztai 1998). Plasma insulin levels also dropped substantially following a high-carbohydrate meal including white bean extract in pre-clinical studies, reflecting a much more gradual rise in blood sugar levels (Pusztai 1998). Seaweed Extracts Extracts from kelp (Ascophyllum nodosum) and bladderwrack (Fucus vesiculosus) have been demonstrated to inhibit the activity of the digestive enzymes alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase (Paradis 2011). Inhibition of these enzymes interferes with the digestion of dietary starches and may reduce or slow the absorption of high glycemic carbohydrates (Preuss 2009). L-arabinose  Sucrose (table sugar) is composed of 2 simple sugar molecules, glucose and fructose. It is poorly absorbed in the intestine in this form. In order to be utilized, it must first be broken down by the digestive enzyme sucrase. Blocking the enzymatic action of sucrase therefore reduces uptake of sucrose. Researchers have identified a potent sucrase inhibitor called L-arabinose. L-arabinose, an indigestible plant compound, cannot be absorbed into the blood. Instead, it remains in the digestive tract and is eventually excreted (Seri 1996; Osaki 2001). By blocking the metabolism of sucrose, L-arabinose inhibits the spike in blood sugar and fat synthesis that would otherwise follow a sugar-rich meal (Osaki 2001).

Researchers have discovered an enzyme known as transglucosidase that reduces the rapid conversion of starch to sugar—and transforms some of it into beneficial fiber—right in your digestive tract. Laboratory studies have shown that with transglucosidase, as much as 40% of the starch ingested is less likely to be rapidly absorbed into your bloodstream. Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. April Parks, MD, MS, on July 2020. Written By Scott Rackinow.   About 35 years ago, the federal government revised their dietary guidelines to advise Americans to increase the amount of carbohydrates they consume to around 60% of their daily food intake. The objective was to achieve a healthier lifestyle.1 The latest guidelines from the Institute of Medicine recommend a daily carbohydrate intake of up to 65% of daily food intake.2 The catastrophic result has been an epidemic of life-threatening obesity, type II diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and other diseases.2 The reason is simple. Starch is one of the largest dietary sources of blood sugar and dangerous after-meal blood glucose spikes.3,4 Even if you eat so-called “healthy grains” such as whole wheat and brown rice, these all convert into sugar during digestion.5 Fortunately, researchers have uncovered a dual-action enzyme known as transglucosidase (pronounced trans-gluco-side-ace) that blocks the conversion of starch into sugar and tranforms it into beneficial fiber.6 While you can’t eliminate all starch from your diet, you can neutralize its negative impact on your body. Transglucosidase represents a novel mechanism for protecting against the harmful effects of dietary starch. Impressive laboratory studies have shown that when transglucosidase comes in contact with starchy foods and natural enzymes in the digestive tract, there’s a 31% reduction in rapidly digested starch (the kind that causes blood sugar to spike right after a meal) and an 11% increase in slowly digested starch (which gets converted to sugar more slowly, if at all).7 Together, that means approximately 40% of the starch you ingest is less likely to be rapidly absorbed into your bloodstream. Human clinical studies have confirmed the ability of transglucosidase to reduce blood glucose and insulin levels. For the typical aging adult, this offers a powerful way to help prevent crossing the line into prediabetes or overt diabetes, preserving pancreatic function, protecting against deadly glucose/insulin surges—and ultimately leading to a longer, healthier life. Hidden Dangers of a High-Starch Diet If you’re a diabetic—or experiencing even slightly elevated blood sugar—you probably know that sugar is one of the worst things you can put into your body. What you might not know is that one of the biggest sources of sugar in your diet is starch.7 Because even whole grains are converted to sugar during digestion, every gram of starch you eat could represent one gram of free glucose in your blood.5,8 That means that even seemingly healthy food choices (whole grain bread, brown rice, and whole wheat pasta, for example) can lead to increases in blood sugar and insulin—and ultimately an increased threat to your health—especially if you already suffer from insulin resistance (prediabetes) or diabetes. Starchy foods are rich in glucose precursors such as amylopectin, which is the main form of rapidly digestible starch in the human body.9 Because the starch in various foods is converted into sugar at different rates, it results in variable rates of blood sugar elevation, insulin response, and satiety (the sense of fullness you get after eating a portion of each food).5,10 Regardless of the form of starch you eat however, be it whole grain bread and brown rice or cookies and cake, the fact remains that all digestible starch gets turned into sugar as it passes through the digestive tract.5,7,8 And that results in elevations in blood sugar and dangerously higher insulin levels—whether you suffer from diabetes or not. When sugar (glucose) binds to your body’s proteins, it produces advanced glycation end products, which are “sugar-coated” proteins that have become stiff, inflexible, and dysfunctional.11-13 Advanced glycation end products trigger inflammation and oxidization, leading to massive amounts of the tissue damage that underlies chronic disease—and aging itself.12,13 Impact of Insulin Excess In response to surplus blood sugar, your body has to pump out far too much insulin.6,14,15 Insulin is a hormone that’s essential for carbohydrate and fat metabolism. But when it’s secreted in excess, insulin becomes a “death hormone.” Chronically elevated insulin levels put you at increased risk of dying from diseases as diverse as cancer, obesity, heart attacks, and strokes, and can ultimately lead to a “burnt-out” pancreas incapable of any glucose control at all.14,16-18 Even people with “normal” fasting blood sugar levels are at an increased risk if their after-meal glucose levels rise too high, too fast.19,20 That’s why, even if you’re not diabetic, you need to be doing all you can to keep your blood sugar and insulin levels under control. Too many Americans are living in a dangerous “gray zone” with their health. Even though they think they’re safe from harm, their glucose and insulin levels are precariously approaching abnormal. You could be living on the brink of a major health disaster—and not even know it.20 Conventional Doctors Missed the Boat Modern-day physicians aren’t helping the situation because they typically wait far too long before they respond to a patient’s “pre-diabetic” state (technically called impaired glucose tolerance, or insulin resistance). And when they do respond, it’s often with costly prescription drugs that don’t fully address the underlying problems. In the end, prevention makes the most sense. Fortunately, researchers have discovered a unique enzyme that can help prevent you from crossing the line into prediabetes or overt diabetes by mitigating the harmful effects of dietary starch.6 This transformative enzyme is called transglucosidase. Aided by your body’s own starch-digesting enzymes, transglucosidase literally rearranges the molecular structure of starch. Instead of allowing starch to be converted into free sugars that spike your blood glucose and trigger deadly insulin release, transglucosidase converts starch into beneficial, indigestible, prebiotic fiber—right in your own digestive tract.6,7,21-23 With the help of transglucosidase, you can achieve multiple life-saving goals with a single supplement: You’ll convert less starch to sugar, ensuring a smaller glucose load, especially in the critical after-meal period.6,21,22 You’ll release less insulin, thus reducing your risk of excess insulin’s deadly health effects.6,21,22 You’ll be providing yourself with additional prebiotic fiber, further reducing your risk of diabetes and enhancing intestinal health.7,23-29 What You Need to Know Transglucosidase: Reducing Sugar Surges High blood sugar and the resulting high insulin levels pose a grave threat to Americans’ health, even for non-diabetic people. The biggest source of glucose in the diet is not sugar or sweeteners, but rather starch, which is made up of hundreds of individual glucose molecules that break off and are absorbed during digestion. Slowing starch digestion is one important way of reducing dangerous spikes in blood sugar following a meal, as is increasing one’s intake of prebiotic dietary fiber. Transglucosidase offers a revolutionary approach to managing high blood sugar and insulin surges by converting starch into prebiotic fiber directly in the intestinal tract. Studies show that transglucosidase can stop the progression of prediabetes to diabetes, while limiting tissue damage and lowering cardiovascular and cancer risk factors among diabetics. If you are concerned about the risks of high blood sugar, you should take a transglucosidase supplement before every starch-containing meal. Neutralize Dietary Starch As stated earlier, regardless of the form of starch you eat, all digestible starch gets turned into sugar as it passes through the digestive tract.7,8 And that results in elevations in blood sugar and a rise in insulin levels into the danger zone. The riskiest period is the two hours immediately following a meal; studies show that this after-meal blood glucose and insulin surge is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.12 Fortunately, transglucosidase can help eliminate the dangers of this after-meal period. So what does happen to the starch you just ate? That’s the second part of the transglucosidase story. In addition to blocking the conversion of starch into sugar, transglucosidase converts that harmful sugar into beneficial prebiotic dietary fiber.6,23,30 We know that the more fiber you consume, the better your health. High-fiber diets may help you live longer for several reasons.31 Prebiotic fiber feeds the beneficial bacteria living in your colon; those bacteria in turn convert other types of fiber into healthy molecules that lower levels of inflammation in your body, slow excessive weight gain, reduce your blood cholesterol, shrink your risk of cancer, and—importantly—help normalize blood glucose and insulin levels.32-36 But despite the American Dietetic Association’s recommendation that healthy adults should consume 20 to 35 grams/day of dietary fiber, most people don’t come anywhere close to this level of intake, partly because it’s hard to find good, palatable sources of fiber.32 When you supplement with transglucosidase, however, you are capable of converting unhealthy starches with high sugar release and low fiber content into healthy prebiotic fiber—directly in your own digestive tract.6,21,22 Human data confirms the benefit of transglucosidase for improving the health of the beneficial bacteria that reside in the digestive tract. In a group of forty type II diabetics receiving transglucosidase for 12 weeks, 67% had considerable improvement in the health and balance of bacterial colonies in their digestive tract.37 Researchers believe that the modulation of gut bacteria by transglucosidase may be one of the main mechanisms by which transglucosidase supports control of glucose levels and promotes weight loss in type II diabetics. That means transglucosidase has the potential to radically change the equation when it comes to the dangers of starch in your diet. Given its dual mechanism of action—blocking the release of harmful sugar from starch and converting it instead into beneficial fiber—transglucosidase has the power to help prevent you from crossing the line into prediabetes (insulin resistance) or overt diabetes, preserving your pancreatic function and protecting you from dangerous insulin surges—and ultimately prolonging your life. Table 1: The Impact of Common Starchy Foods on Glucose, Insulin, and Satiety Scores 45,46 Because one gram of starch could be converted by digestive enzymes into one gram of sugar, foods that are high in starch are also high in sugar.5,8 Sugar is released more easily from some foods than from others, resulting in very different blood sugar and insulin profiles. In this table, various foods are compared with white bread, a starchy food that is rapidly converted to sugar. The “glucose score” indicates how much glucose a food contains compared to white bread; the “insulin score” indicates how much a given food raises blood insulin compared to white bread; and the “satiety score” indicates how full you feel after eating identical portions of each food, compared to white bread.45,46 Food Glucose score Insulin score Satiety score White bread (baseline) 100 100 100 Whole-grain bread 97 96 157 White rice 110 79 138 Brown rice 104 62 132 White pasta 46 40 119 Brown pasta 68 40 188 Potatoes 141 121 323 Baked beans 114 120 168 Crackers 118 87 127 Mars bars 79 122 70 Bananas 79 81 118 Cornflakes 76 75 118 Porridge 60 40 209 Apples 50 59 197 Reduce Your Risk of Developing Diabetes Transglucosidase has been studied around the world, and it’s one of the only known natural enzymes that can prevent the progression of prediabetes to full-blown diabetes.6 People with prediabetes often have fasting glucose levels near the upper limits of “normal” (near or above 100 mg/dL) and have already lost the ability to control after-meal glucose and insulin surges. Prediabetics have a high risk of progressing to full-blown diabetes—but even if they don’t, these “mild” elevations in blood sugar still correlate strongly with diseases such as heart attack, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer.6,38 In a study including prediabetics, one group received a “low dose” of 450,000* units of transglucosidase, one group received a “high dose” of 900,000 units of transglucosidase, and a third group received a placebo.6 The subjects took the supplements along with a test meal of white rice (high in starch) that is readily converted to glucose. Over the course of three hours following the control meal, the subjects’ total blood sugar rose into dangerous territory, as would be expected for people with prediabetes.6 But the people who supplemented with transglucosidase at either dose had significantly lower total blood sugar concentrations over the three-hour period, along with a trend towards lower insulin levels. There were no significant side effects. What this means for you is that, if you are a prediabetic, you can safely limit the negative impact of a starchy meal—and can slow your rate of progression towards diabetes.6 Shield Your Body from Chronically Elevated Insulin Anyone whose blood sugar is not under optimum control is exposed to the dangers of chronically elevated insulin levels. That’s because your body will pump out insulin so long as blood sugar levels are above normal—and can result in an insulin level that may be dangerously elevated in its effort to keep blood sugar at a normal level, making it a truly hidden danger. Insulin, of course, is a useful and necessary hormone. It is responsible for driving blood sugar into cells, where it’s burned for energy. Without properly regulated amounts of insulin we couldn’t survive. But insulin, like many hormones, has multiple functions. The little-known “dark side” of insulin is that it is a powerful growth factor.41 And in the healthy adult body, there’s limited usefulness in growth factors. Excessive growth factor production triggers cell replication in places we don’t want it. Insulin and other growth factors are implicated, for example, in cancer, where unregulated cellular reproduction produces deadly malignancies.42And imbalanced growth factors, including insulin, are also implicated in the thickening and poor responsiveness of smooth muscle cells lining arterial walls, contributing to cardiovascular disease.41 Excessive insulin production is the result of insulin resistance, which is another way to say “prediabetes.” High insulin levels are associated with a 37% increase in the risk of dying from cancer—whether or not you have diabetes.40,43 Doctors are finally learning to pay attention to insulin levels as well as to blood sugar levels when evaluating new treatments and when advising their patients. And they are starting to seek therapies that increase insulin sensitivity and lower overall insulin levels.44 Most antidiabetic drugs aim only to drive down blood sugar levels and have no effect on insulin; others are actually intended to increase your insulin levels in the attempt to reduce blood sugar. But transglucosidase works in part by lowering insulin levels as blood sugar normalizes. In human studies in which healthy subjects with evidence of insulin resistance ate a test meal of white rice (high in starch), placebo recipients saw their insulin levels rise along with their after-meal blood sugars (the expected response), while those receiving transglucosidase had small decreases in insulin over the same time period.6 And in patients with diabetes, who already had elevated insulin levels, 12 weeks of transglucosidase supplementation led to significant drops in insulin concentration overall. These are remarkable findings, given that these subjects made no other changes in their diets or lifestyles. Reduce the Impact of Diabetes Another clinical study looked at patients who already had type II diabetes, and the researchers found that the benefits of transglucosidase are just as exciting for those with full-blown diabetes as they are for prediabetics.22 Diabetics not only have elevated blood sugar and often high insulin levels, but also have detectable evidence of advanced glycation end products in the form of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). This blood test is an indication of total blood sugar levels over an approximate two to three-month period. Patients in the study received total daily doses of 900,000 units of transglucosidase, 2.7 million units of transglucosidase, or a placebo.22 Both doses produced respectable reductions in hemoglobin A1c, lowering it by an average 0.18 and 0.21%, respectively (normal measurements for this test should not exceed 5.5%). Patients’ insulin concentrations fell significantly as well, by 2.79 and 3.59 mIU/mL, respectively.22 And while transglucosidase does not replace metformin if internal overproduction of glucose by the liver is the culprit behind elevated fasting glucose (>85 mg/dL) or elevated HbA1C (>5.5%), its dramatic insulin reductions are similar to those seen with the drug metformin, which can reduce fasting insulin by about 38% in obese, insulin-resistant people.39,40 But the benefits of transglucosidase for diabetics don’t end there. The patients taking transglucosidase also had significant increases in a beneficial cytokine called adiponectin and significant reductions in triglycerides and diastolic blood pressure.22 On the other hand, the placebo patients experienced significant increases in their body mass index (a measure of total weight for height) and also had increases in markers of fat-induced liver damage. Neither group of patients taking transglucosidase had such changes.22 If you already have type II diabetes, the availability of this novel enzyme is excellent news. It means that supplementing with transglucosidase not only helps protect against dangerous glycation reactions taking place in your tissues (which will cause heart, kidney, nerve and eye disease, given time), but also blunts excessive insulin levels (which raise your risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases). In addition, it can also help protect you from further weight gain and other measures of poor health. And it’s all done without taking a single drug. Dosing Enzymes *Unlike many other nutrients, enzymes are dosed according to their unit of activity. One enzymatic unit is the amount of enzyme needed to convert one micromole (µmol) of a substance per minute. This is not to be confused with the International Unit (IU), which is an unrelated measure of other biologically active substances such as vitamin D. Because transglucosidase is an enzyme, the dosages are measured in “units of enzyme activity” not milligrams or International Units (IU). A 450,000 unit dose is typically the amount found in one capsule. Summary Chronically elevated glucose and insulin levels, especially those immediately following a meal, should be a major concern of any adult—even if you have no known history of high blood sugar. High insulin and glucose blood levels are at least as dangerous as high cholesterol when it comes to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition, chronically elevated glucose and insulin sharply elevate cancer rates. That’s why it’s important to take all possible steps to prevent dietary starch from converting into deadly sugar calories. Transglucosidase is a groundbreaking supplement that is the first of its kind. Its dual mechanism of action helps manage high blood sugar and excess insulin by blocking the release of harmful sugar from starch…converting it instead into beneficial fiber. This is a medical breakthrough capable of mitigating the growing diabetes epidemic—and is a critical new tool in our kit for managing dangerous metabolic conditions. If your fasting glucose is over 85 mg/dL (which most adults are), or you have other indicators of glucose impairment such as elevated hemoglobin A1c or elevated fasting insulin, take transglucosidase before your two heaviest starch-containing meals of the day. Human clinical trials have established its value in healthy as well as diabetic individuals. And that translates to lower risks for cancer, vision problems, and heart disease.

Fortunately, transglucosidase can help manage glucose levels in dogs as well as in humans. When researchers in Japan studied transglucosidase in animals, they found that the results were virtually identical with what we’ve seen in human studies.21 Healthy non-diabetic control dogs receiving transglucosidase experienced lower total after-meal glucose and insulin levels compared with those receiving the control diet alone. And the usual “spike” in after-meal glucose levels was virtually eliminated, allowing the dogs to maintain normal glucose concentrations of 85 to 95 mg/dL.21 Editor's Note Science continues to evolve, and new research is published daily.

This cinnamon extract has demonstrated beneficial effects against elevated blood sugar and metabolic syndrome. Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Vanessa Pavey, ND, on March 2020. Written By Cynthia Williams. A staggering number of Americans suffer from a disorder called “metabolic syndrome” that is characterized by a combination of:1 High blood sugar Increased blood pressure Abdominal obesity Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels Those with metabolic syndrome are at increased risk for heart attack, stroke, type II diabetes and early death.2 A root cause of metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance.2,3 This article describes natural substances that work together to promote healthy fasting blood sugar and insulin sensitivity. In the United States there are 86 million adults with prediabetes.4 A substantial number of those with poor glucose control convert to full-blown type II diabetes. Before diabetes is diagnosed, chronically elevated glucose damages tissues throughout the body. The Power of Prevention Insulin resistance means the body’s cells cannot respond normally to insulin. That causes blood sugar levels to creep up gradually – entirely without symptoms in most people. In those with prediabetes or insulin resistance, risk of progression to type II diabetes can be reduced by about 58% with lifestyle interventions, including diet, that lower blood-sugar levels.2 In addition, studies have identified multitargeted nutrients capable of reducing blood glucose via a variety of mechanisms. What You Need to Know Targeted Blood-Sugar Control More than a third of Americans suffer from metabolic syndrome, which raises their risks of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and other life-shortening conditions. Metabolic syndrome has many components, but scientists agree that a root cause is insulin resistance. Physicians rarely prescribe sugar-lowering drugs to anyone who is not already diabetic, placing millions of Americans at real risk for a host of life-threatening complications. Six natural compounds have been shown to work independently and together to prevent blood sugar increases, to enhance insulin sensitivity, and combat the effects of the occasional carbohydrate overindulgence. Chromium, amla, shilajit, cinnamon, iodine, and seaweed promote healthy blood sugar levels and prevent insulin resistance through a wide variety of related and complementary mechanisms. Any adult, even those with normal blood sugar levels, should consider regular supplementation with these nutrients, to prevent or slow the age-accelerating effects of borderline or high blood sugar by increasing insulin sensitivity, decreasing fasting blood sugar and preventing the effects of the occasional carbohydrate indulgence. Cinnamon Acts on Multiple Glucose Targets   Cinnamon is an effective tool for lowering blood sugar and reducing the risk of type II diabetes. A water-soluble, oil-free cinnamon extract has been identified that has demonstrated beneficial effects on blood sugar, glycation, and metabolic syndrome.5,6 The US Department of Agriculture filed a patent application on this extract based on its glucose- lowering properties.7,8 One of the primary ways cinnamon impacts blood sugar is by increasing production of GLUT4, a molecule that is responsible for transporting sugar from blood plasma into the cell, which enhances insulin sensitivity and therefore glucose uptake.9-11 Without effective GLUT4 transporters, sugar levels in the blood steadily rise, eventually producing damage to tissues through the chemical reaction known as glycation, in which glucose molecules bind to vital proteins, deleteriously altering both their structure and function.12 Increased production of PPARs is another critical mechanism of some antidiabetic drugs.13 When activated, PPARs promote insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake. PPARs also suppress fat accumulation and glucose production.13-15 Clinical trials have shown that cinnamon supplementation boosts insulin sensitivity and lowers blood sugar.16-20 Cinnamon also helps to induce satiety, the feeling of fullness after a meal that prevents us from overeating.21 Together, these effects have been shown to reduce evidence of long-term glucose overexposure in blood, as measured by hemoglobin A1C, a measure of chronic exposure to sugar.22 Cinnamon has other properties that help combat metabolic syndrome, such as lowering blood pressure and improving body fat distribution.23,24 Cinnamon has also shown that it could reduce disruptions associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, the liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome.25,26 Lower Blood Sugar With Chromium Another nutrient that improves blood-sugar levels and insulin sensitivity is chromium. Studies show there is a powerful connection between chromium and diabetes. For example, people with diabetes and heart disease are relatively deficient in chromium levels, compared with healthy people. And people with known chromium deficiencies develop symptoms associated with type II diabetes.27-33 Human studies show chromium’s impact on both short- and long-term blood-sugar control. When diabetic patients receive chromium supplements, their fasting blood glucose and insulin levels drop promptly, while their long-term sugar levels improve, as indicated by reductions in hemoglobin A1C.34,35 Unlike glucose-lowering drugs and insulin, chromium poses no danger of producing dangerously low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which is a major advance in safety.36,37 Chromium works in multiple ways to boost glucose uptake from the blood.38 It boosts production of GLUT4 transporter molecules, and triggers the GLUT4 movement from the cell’s interior to its membrane—both of which help move glucose out of the blood and into cells.39-42 This has the dual benefit of lowering blood-sugar levels while providing much-needed chemical energy inside cells. These glucose uptake-promoting properties mean that chromium fights insulin resistance by enhancing the impact of insulin on a cell’s sugar-absorbing capabilities—and that’s a very good thing for anyone with borderline or high blood sugar. Ancient Remedies Prevent Tissue Damage Amla While chromium produces outstanding sugar-lowering effects, it is also a highly reactive metal ion that is capable of inducing oxidative stress that could damage tissue. That’s why scientists now recommend that chromium supplements be stabilized with organic compounds that can reduce the oxidative stress and allow chromium’s major benefits to emerge. Two such compounds are amla and shilajit. In addition to enhancing chromium’s benefits, these two ancient natural remedies have some impressive protective properties of their own that make them a perfect complement to chromium. Modern science has revealed that amla extracts powerfully oppose oxidative stress of all kinds. Amla protects against glycation of proteins, which helps prevent the damage that otherwise occurs in tissues throughout the body (eye lens and retina, heart muscle, kidney, nerves, and blood vessels).43,44 Amla also directly prevents blood-sugar levels from rising after a starch-containing meal by blocking the enzymes that convert starch into sugar in the intestine.43 This can help to prevent the effects of the occasional carbohydrate overindulgence and may also help address unhealthy fasting blood-sugar levels. Shilajit is an adaptogen that helps cells and tissues survive oxidative and other stresses.45 Research shows that shilajit promotes efficient glucose “burning” in mitochondria.46 Efficient-running mitochondria produce fewer chemically stressful byproducts, reducing cell damage. Their energy output is also maximal, helping cells to meet their needs.47 And clean-burning mitochondria are less vulnerable to outside oxidative stress.48,49 Studies show that amla and shilajit provide the tissue protection that is not found in many pharmaceutical drugs.50,51 Providing supplemental chromium stabilized with amla and shilajit is an effective, safe way of lowering blood sugar, minimizing glucose-induced tissue damage, and promoting efficient energy production—all of which are known to mitigate prediabetes and diabetes. Seaweed Regulates Blood Sugar Seaweed Seaweed is a sea vegetable that works in many ways to lower blood sugar and help protect against metabolic syndrome.52-55 Like cinnamon and chromium, seaweed increases levels of the glucose-transporting GLUT4, and increases activity of the energy-sensing PPAR system—both of which promote insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake.56,57 In addition, sea vegetables are rich in iodine, which plays a role in maintaining insulin sensitivity.58 Animal studies have shown that oral supplementation with iodine reduces glucose levels.59,60 And one recent human study showed that in obese, iodine-deficient women, iodine supplements reduced high cholesterol.61 Many of seaweed’s sugar-lowering effects occur directly in the digestive tract. There, seaweed components block the enzymes needed to release sugar molecules from starch.62-66 As a result, glucose is not released, never contributing to rising blood sugar levels.52 Another important way seaweed extracts help combat insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome is by reducing body weight and fat mass. When obese animals were given seaweed supplementation, it was found to lower blood sugar, diminish food intake, reduce body weight, and slow weight gain.67 One reason for these benefits could be because seaweed contains compounds that have been shown to activate systems that cause fat to be burned off rather than stored in the body.68,69 Seaweed supplementation also reduces the development and maturation of new fat cells, which helps prevent weight gain caused by a high fat diet.70,71 As a result, supplemented animals were exposed to far lower levels of the inflammation-promoting molecules (cytokines) that fat tissue pours out into the circulation.72 An Underlying Cause of Insulin Resistance Insulin resistance, a crucial factor in the development of prediabetes, occurs when the body’s cells cannot respond normally to insulin. That causes blood sugar levels to creep up gradually—and, in most people, entirely without symptoms.74 One of the key dysfunctions in developing insulin resistance is a reduction in movement of glucose-transporting molecules from deep within a cell out to its membrane. These transporters, known as GLUT4, are responsible for transferring sugar from blood plasma into the cell. Once there, its chemical energy is released to keep the cell working.75-77 Without adequate transportation out of the blood and into the cells, sugar is left in the blood, causing blood-sugar levels to steadily rise. Over time, this damages tissues through the chemical reaction known as glycation, which occurs when sugar reacts chemically with vital molecules, including proteins, causing them to become stuck together and preventing them from functioning properly.78 Glycation also creates harmful advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are known to be a root cause of aging.12 The good news is that if it is caught early enough, insulin resistance can be alleviated. Studies have shown you can reduce the risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes by about 58% within three years simply through lifestyle interventions.2 And of course, people who already have diabetes need to control their blood-sugar levels just as urgently as those with prediabetes. That’s why virtually everyone—diabetic or not—can benefit from recent discoveries about multitargeted nutrients capable of improving insulin sensitivity and reducing fasting blood glucose through a variety of mechanisms of action. Summary   More than one-third of Americans have metabolic syndrome, an insulin-resistant state in which borderline high blood sugar and other metabolic abnormalities signal ever-growing risks for heart disease, stroke, cancer, and a host of other age-accelerating conditions.73 Sugar-lowering drugs are not generally prescribed until after a person develops diabetes, which leaves millions of us in a dangerous, prediabetic state without treatment. Natural supplements have long been shown to reduce the risks of metabolic syndrome by lowering blood-sugar levels before they reach dangerous concentrations. Cinnamon, chromium, amla, shilajit, and seaweed provide sugar-lowering, energy-burning, and fat-reducing properties, and should be considered as a regular part of a healthy supplement regimen. While diabetics are well aware of the risks of elevated blood sugar, ultimately anyone—even those with normal blood sugar levels—should be keenly interested in maintaining healthy blood-sugar levels.

In an exclusive excerpt from his new book The Perricone Weight-Loss Diet, Dr. Nicholas Perricone provides innovative techniques to suppress inflammatory reactions and induce weight loss. Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on January 2021. Written By Nicholas V. Perricone, MD. Nicholas Perricone, MD Nicholas Perricone, MD, is the author of the New York Times bestsellers The Wrinkle Cure™, The Perricone Prescription™, and The Perricone Promise™. A board-certified clinical and research dermatologist, adjunct professor of medicine at Michigan State University’s College of Human Medicine, and long-time member of the Life Extension Foundation, Dr. Perricone has been the subject of a member profile (April 2003) and has shared his expertise in an “Ask the Doctor” column in Life Extension magazine (June 2004). Much like the Life Extension Foundation, Dr. Perricone focuses on preventing the effects of aging and extending the healthy human life span by applying dietary and nutritional strategies to minimize inflammation, glycation, and oxidative stress. The following article is excerpted from his new book, The Perricone Weight-Loss Diet (Random House, 2005), which explores the link between inflammation and excess weight, and outlines a detailed strategy for losing fat, preventing wrinkles, and alleviating the effects of aging.

However, I believe this will be the first book that will clearly demonstrate how this subclinical, microscopic, invisible inflammation is responsible for a great number of metabolic problems, resulting in accelerated aging, serious health threats, unwanted weight gain, and obesity. If this was not bad enough news for adults, there is now alarming new evidence that this diet-related inflammation is also causing weight gain and obesity in young children and adolescents, resulting in diseases and conditions such as type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome, which normally do not manifest until much later in life. My research has shown that the chief therapeutic intervention to prevent weight gain (regardless of age) is the anti-inflammatory diet. I have observed significant weight loss in thousands of individuals who follow the simple formula of avoiding foods that are pro-inflammatory and choosing in their place foods with anti-inflammatory properties. What is of particular interest to me is the fact that the same foods (those with anti-inflammatory properties) that fight many diseases, aging, sagging skin, and wrinkling, also cause significant weight loss—and they are safe for everyone, children and adults alike. At the same time, the foods that accelerate aging and put us at risk for disease and the loss of cognitive abilities (the pro-inflammatory foods) also cause weight gain. These foods and beverages also interfere with the body’s natural ability to metabolize foods properly, making it increasingly difficult to lose unwanted weight. Perhaps the worst dietary craze belongs to the 1980s, which heralded the age of the no-fat diet. Supermarket shelves were flooded with high-glycemic carbohydrate foods, offering little in the way of nutrients, but plenty in the way of empty calories. These foods became dietary mainstays for many people, especially women, who found themselves indulging in snack foods such as reduced-fat “baked” potato and corn chips, and fat-free rice and corn cakes, cookies, pretzels, and crackers. Suddenly millions of Americans were placing themselves in a chronic inflammatory condition. Why? Because eating these foods provokes a pro-inflammatory rapid rise in blood sugar, resulting in elevated insulin levels. Insulin is an important hormone that helps the body utilize blood sugar for energy or store it as glycogen or fat. But if the insulin is released too quickly, it has a pro-inflammatory effect. After a rapid rise, there will be a precipitous drop in blood sugar, resulting in feelings of hunger, which can lead to a vicious cycle of overeating. This is why a diet centered on breads, baked goods, snack foods, sweets, and other sugary, starchy foods results in unwanted weight gain and great difficulty in losing weight. Ironically, in this instance, it is not the caloric value of the foods causing the weight gain. In fact, a rice cake only has around 40 calories. However, because it is rapidly converted to sugar in the bloodstream, resulting in the insulin release, it will cause you to store body fat. An insulin release can result in the storage of body fat. Keeping It Simple Some scientists and researchers believe that many of the health problems of today are caused by our departure from the hunter-gatherer diet, which consisted of nuts, seeds, berries, wild greens, roots, fruits, fish, fowl, and game. This is a fascinating theory and I do agree with the premise that natural, unprocessed foods are always the best choices. To be healthy and maintain normal weight, we need all of the food groups—but not those that come from the laboratory. Our protein source needs to be pure, fresh (when possible) wild fish and other seafood, and free-range chicken and turkey that are hormone and antibiotic free. Our carbohydrates need to be fresh fruits and vegetables, preferably organic. And we need good fats, such as those found in salmon, sardines, and other cold-water fish, extra virgin olive oil, nuts, seeds, avocado, and açaí (a Brazilian berry whose fatty-acid ratio resembles that of olive oil). These “good” fats will help us absorb nutrients from our vegetables and fruits, keep our cells supple, our skin glowing and wrinkle-free, our brains sharp, and our mood upbeat. We also need dietary fat to burn fat. By upsetting the delicate balance with extreme fad diets and ridiculous concepts, whether it is no-carb or no-fat or whatever, we create ongoing physical and mental health problems, including obesity, accelerated aging, and wrinkling, sagging skin. It is no coincidence that the rise of antidepressants such as Prozac® occurred during the nonfat food craze of the 1980s—after all, our brains are comprised mainly of fat, and when we starve our brains of valuable nutrients, we become depressed. Salmon, with its rich complement of essential fatty acids, has been shown to be an excellent treatment for depression. Some studies have shown that it is more effective than powerful drugs in treating depression—without the side effects (moderate regular exercise is also great for depression, especially when combined with the salmon-rich anti-inflammatory diet). Inflammation 101 Let’s take a look at what I mean by inflammation. Inflammation, which is the response of the body’s immune system to infection or irritation, exists in a very wide spectrum. At the extreme end, it causes visible redness and swelling, such as in sunburn or an injured finger. On the low end of the spectrum, the inflammation is invisible; we can’t see it and we can’t feel it. But it does exist, and it causes a host of health-related problems. The bright red and painful sunburn that exists at the extreme high end is usually present for only a short period of time. Physicians refer to this type of inflammation as “acute inflammation.” The invisible inflammation that exists at the low end of the spectrum is usually present for longer periods of time and is termed “chronic inflammation.” The question you may be asking is, “If it is invisible, and we can’t feel it, then how do we know that this low-grade inflammation exists?” The answer is simple: some of this inflammation can be detected under the microscope. However, low-grade inflammation can also be invisible even with a microscope because it exists on a molecular level, but it can be detected through chemical tests using special instruments. Research indicates that the effects of this chronic, low-grade, invisible inflammation is at the basis of aging and age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, certain forms of cancer, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and autoimmune diseases—and even wrinkled, sagging skin. However, it doesn’t stop there. I am now categorically stating that this same chronic, low-grade, invisible inflammation is at the very basis of excess body fat, out-of-control appetites, food cravings, food addictions, diabetes, and the inability to lose excess body weight. If that is the case, you may be thinking, “Why don’t I just go ahead and take an ibuprofen tablet and get thin?” Unfortunately, it is not that simple—especially when you consider this inflammation is not just a one-time event reacting to a one-time cause. Our bodies are under a constant barrage, a continual assault of physical insults resulting in this inflammation—beginning with that bag of potato chips and ending with the creation of a veritable factory in our body whose one job is to grow more fat cells and produce more inflammatory chemicals. The effect of this low-grade, invisible inflammation (also referred to as “subclinical” inflammation) has been at the cutting edge of medical science for the last decade, and it has been the focal point of my own research for the past two decades. After years of either being ignored or relegated to a “by-product” of the disease process, cellular inflammation is finally coming to the attention of the mainstream media, and in fact, was the topic of a cover story in Time magazine. THE MECHANISM OF A VICIOUS CYCLE What follows the damage to the cell plasma membrane is a kind of domino effect that, in the end, causes a vicious cycle of increased inflammation. Here’s how it goes: • The cell plasma membrane is made up of a double layer of fats called a “lipid bi-layer,” and this fragile film is easily and rapidly oxidized by the free radicals. This leads to the breakdown of the membrane that produces a substance known as “arachidonic acid.” • Arachidonic acid is further oxidized by enzyme systems to produce very active chemical products with pro-inflammatory activity such as “prostaglandins.” Arachidonic acid can also leak into the interior of the cell and get into the mitochondria, the tiny furnace used for energy production. • Arachidonic acid then disrupts energy production of the cell, which is critically needed for cellular repair. • The fats in the cell plasma membrane can also become oxidized and mimic chemical messengers in the body, such as platelet-activating factor (PAF), which also triggers a series of inflammatory events on a cellular level. • All of these events, cumulatively known as “oxidative stress,” lead to increased production of free radicals inside the cell, with the activation of tiny messengers called transcription factors such as AP-1 and nuclear factor kappa B, or NfkB for short. When NfkB detects oxidative stress, it translocates to the nucleus of the cell, which contains the DNA (which in turn contains the master instructions of the cell). NfkB attaches to a portion of the DNA and instructs the cell to make inflammatory chemicals such as interleukins 1 and 6 and tumor necrosis factor, types of cytokines (intercellular chemical messenger proteins released by white blood cells as well as other cells) that create further inflammation and damage. • When NfkB is activated in skin cells along with another transcription factor called AP-1, it can lead to wrinkles in the skin. • When NfkB is activated in the brain, it can lead to Alzheimer’s disease, and activated in other organs it can lead to cancer. • When NfkB is activated in the pancreas, it can lead to the destruction of the B-cells of the pancreas, which are the sole source of insulin, resulting in diabetes. • NfkB blocks the ability to utilize insulin effectively, which leads to the storage of body fat, causing us to gain weight and have great difficulty shedding the pounds. Dangers of Inflammation Acute inflammation is a protective response of tissue to irritation, injury, or infection and is characterized by pain, redness, swelling, and sometimes loss of function. It is, under normal circumstances, beneficial, and helps the body repair the effects of trauma or infection. However, prolonged, excess, or chronic inflammation becomes harmful. When low-grade invisible inflammation occurs in the very cells that comprise our organ systems, a concept I introduced in my first book, The Wrinkle Cure (2000), we are placed at great risk for a host of degenerative, age-related diseases. This is because cells that are attacked by self-generated inflammation will not function properly (meaning that we did something to precipitate a pro-inflammatory response in our cells, thus causing malfunction and sometimes complete breakdown). In other words, cells respond to the way we treat them. If we keep them healthy and free of injury, if we give them the proper nourishment, they keep us alive and running at top form. If we don’t, if we expose them to too much sun, to environmental toxins, to extended periods of stress, or to high-glycemic sugars and starches, the cells will react by producing inflammatory chemicals as a deviation of the normal defense mechanism. And if we mistreat our cells in this way on a regular basis, we can end up with organ system failure and diseases like the ones listed, including metabolic syndrome, which can lead to diabetes and obesity. This hidden inflammation is a novel and previously unrecognized “missing link” in our obesity epidemic. This past decade has seen a complete turnaround in the way scientists regard white adipose tissue—better known as body fat. They no longer look upon it as an inert deposit of fat cells, stored as the result of overeating. They now realize that areas of fat storage are actually an active endocrine organ. Fat produces hormones, as do our pancreas, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenals, pineal, pituitary, and testes/ovaries, the organs that comprise the endocrine system. We are beginning to define body fat as a group of cells communicating with other organ systems such as the brain, the liver, the bone marrow, skeletal muscle, the adrenal cortex, the sympathetic nervous system, and the complete immune system. And the message they are communicating is not good. This is extremely important because the body fat itself controls how much body fat is going to be stored. It also affects our appetite, our energy expenditure, and our immune system. Body fat accomplishes this by secreting hormones known as adipokines. Adipokines are proteins that act as messengers throughout the body (more examples of the communications network). Like certain types of cytokines, those chemical messengers that have pro-inflammatory activity, adipokines can contribute to systemic, low-grade, chronic inflammation. This becomes even more frightening when we begin to understand that the greater amount of fat we have stored, the greater its negative influence on the entire body, an extremely destructive, inflammatory influence. In fact, it would not be too great a stretch to compare excess body fat storage to a tumor, for several valid reasons. A large store of body fat can be so overwhelming to the system that the fat cells have to secrete hormone-like substances to increase blood vessel growth necessary to feed the accumulation of fat. In addition, like a tumor, blood vessel growth cannot keep up with the rapidly growing mass of fat cells, which then begin to become oxygen-starved. These oxygen-starved cells start releasing inflammatory chemicals to further trigger blood vessel growth. These same events are seen in tumor growth, as well. Most overweight people, especially the obese, have chronic high levels of insulin that will begin to drop as soon as they start dieting. This is a two-edged sword, as low insulin levels decrease inflammation, which allows us to utilize body fat for energy. However, insulin is required to bring protein into the cells to maintain muscle mass. The overweight or obese person has cells that are insensitive to insulin due to their chronic high levels. That is, their body is so used to the overly high levels, it cannot recognize these new lower levels, thus it is unable to trigger the amino acid uptake needed to maintain muscle mass (insulin is needed to take up both sugar and amino acids into the muscle). This is why it is critical to take a powerful anti-inflammatory approach to dieting. Remember, it is the inflammatory chemicals, such as NfkB, that block the effects of insulin—whether it is to metabolize blood sugar or to nourish muscles with amino acids. Over-exercising can further put us into a catabolic state (in which complex molecules are broken down into simpler ones) because of the higher requirement of nutrients needed for active muscles. Inflammation, Body Fat, and Heart Disease Scientists and physicians now recognize that heart disease is mediated by inflammatory chemicals. In fact, forward-thinking cardiologists are now measuring C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, to identify patients at risk for heart disease. This is proving to be significantly more accurate than looking at cholesterol. In fact, many cardiologists now report that elevated C-reactive protein is four times more accurate in predicting heart disease than elevated cholesterol. C-reactive protein is a special type of protein produced in high amounts by the liver during episodes of acute inflammation. High circulating levels of C-reactive protein also indicate stomach inflammation. Researchers at UC Davis recently found that endothelial cells (the delicate lining of the circulatory system) also produce C-reactive protein, a key finding that helps to explain how plaque formation is initiated. This is particularly important because endothelial cells are supposed to protect the arteries from the effects of C-reactive protein. Researchers also found that C-reactive protein can cause these endothelial cells in our arteries to produce a substance called plasminogen activator inhibitor, which leads to blood clot formation. C-reactive protein can also lead to activation of white blood cells in the lining of the arteries to promote plaque formation. These findings begin to explain why those individuals with excess body fat are at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease. Scientists have discovered that excess weight leads to low-grade chronic inflammation; low-grade, chronic inflammation leads to mildly elevated C-reactive protein, which can lead to heart disease. As the pieces of the puzzle began to come together, I began to understand why people were losing weight on my anti-inflammatory diet. The foods and supplements that I had been recommending to reduce wrinkles and slow down the aging process were also inhibiting the inflammation that causes insulin resistance and body fat storage. DANGERS OF ELEVATED NfkB What happens (besides elevating our risk for disease) when people who are carrying excess fat have elevated levels of NfkB? • It interferes with the body’s ability to use insulin, • increasing our blood sugar levels, • which then further increases inflammation, • and makes us store body fat. As mentioned, I advocated eating ample quantities of cold-water fish like wild Alaskan salmon, sardines, anchovies, mackerel, herring, shad, and trout—ideally, one fish meal per day. I also strongly recommended the use of nutritional supplements like omega-3 fish oil, alpha lipoic acid, carnitine, CLA (conjugated linoleic acid), glutamine, coenzyme Q10, astaxanthin, and dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE). Why are these foods and supplements so effective? Because they all have high anti-inflammatory properties. Brightly colored fruits and vegetables signal the presence of antioxidants, nature’s natural anti-inflammatories. Wild Alaskan salmon also contains a powerful antioxidant, anti-inflammatory (responsible for its deep pink/red coloring) known as astaxanthin, reported to be more than 100 times stronger than vitamins C and E combined. Further, I realized that the single most powerful causative agent for reducing inflammation was the high levels of essential fats that I was recommending. These fats, particularly the omega-3 essential fatty acids found in high-fat fish and fish oil, act as powerful, natural anti-inflammatories. Recognizing that a great many Americans were overweight, and their diets were practically devoid of the omega-3s, I asked myself the following questions: Could it be that low levels of the essential fatty acids exacerbate inflammation and promote weight gain? And could it then be that high levels of essential fatty acids also reduce the inflammation that is found in people with excess body fat, thereby accelerating that loss? Perhaps we can find the answer in the huge increase of overweight people that has its roots in the no-fat and low-fat craze of the 1980s and continues to escalate to this day. Women in particular have suffered from the ridiculous and dangerous notion that all fat is bad and must be avoided at all costs. Not only did they not lose weight, this dangerous fad accelerated the development of wrinkles and contributed to an epidemic of mental depression and obesity. The reason for this is twofold. First, the onset of the low-fat diet deprived brain cells of the critically essential healthy fat needed for normal brain function. When I say “normal” brain function, I refer to the production of those important chemical messengers known as “neurotransmitters” that allow brain cells to communicate with one another. We all know from television and magazines that low levels of serotonin, the classic “feel good” neurotransmitter, can lead to chronic depression. By depriving the brain of the healthy fats it needs to produce serotonin and other neurotransmitters, we are effectively opening the door to depression and a host of other mental, behavioral, neurological, and psychological maladies. Second, in addition to the damage done by the deprivation of healthy fats, the 1980s saw the rise in the ingestion of massive quantities of fat-free, high-glycemic carbohydrates, such as the ubiquitous rice or corn cake, baked potato chips, nonfat cookies, and so on, which has played a significant role in the epidemic of both obesity and type II diabetes. When we eat these high-glycemic carbohydrates, we deplete our precious reserves of serotonin. For example, a breakfast consisting of a low-fat muffin or bagel with fat-free cream cheese and jam, and a glass of fruit juice, will cause a rapid rise in blood sugar. This results in a release of serotonin in the brain, giving us a warm, fuzzy feeling as the carbohydrates are rapidly converted to glucose (sugar) by our digestive system. High levels of sugar are now circulating in our bloodstream, which signals the pancreas to secrete insulin to help bring down these high levels of sugar. The problem begins when the insulin pushes the blood sugar levels down to levels too low. The result is a rapid decline in serotonin levels, a quick drop in energy—and an almost irresistible craving for more sugar and carbs. In other words, we need another “fix” in order to get back the warm, fuzzy feeling. In fact, many women “self-medicate” with high-glycemic carbs in their rational desire to simply feel good. I say “women” here because women generally tend to have lower levels of serotonin than men. And these levels drop even lower during parts of the menstrual cycle and when they are postmenopausal. To compensate for this, women resort to consuming larger amounts of high-glycemic carbohydrates than their male counterparts. Since many women place themselves on calorie-restricted diets, they then tend to forgo healthy proteins and healthy fats to make up for the calories contained in the carbohydrates. This often results in women looking older than men of their same age group, because healthy fats and protein are necessary for cellular repair, while high-carb diets accelerate the aging process. The fluctuating blood sugar and insulin levels place them in a constant battle with excess weight gain, while the depletion of their serotonin leaves women at greater risk for depression. This sorry state of affairs is contributing to the breakdown of the mental and physical health of men, women, and children at an escalating rate. We are overweight, we are depressed, we are fatigued, and we are stressed. And more and more of us, children and adults alike, are turning to chemical and pharmacological solutions to the problem. However, these “solutions” treat the symptom while ignoring the underlying problem. There is a better way. I soon learned that when you consume food, its energy (measured as calories) can take one of two paths in the body: Food calories can be burned in the mitochondria for production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), a high-energy phosphate molecule used to store and release energy for work within the body. This entire process is known as “oxidative phosphorylation.” More often as we get older, the food can go on to be stored as body fat (triglycerides in adipose tissue) or stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles (glycogen is the form in which foods are stored in the body as energy). If we can “uncouple” the oxidation from the phosphorylation, food calories can be burned off by thermogenesis. Thermogenesis bypasses the ATP-mediated energy. If the majority of food we ate was transformed into body heat, we would stay slim and trim. This research led me to create the anti-inflammatory diet, where I discovered that the omega-3 essential fatty acids (EFAs) were powerful anti-inflammatories. One important role of EFAs turned out to be their effect on insulin levels. High levels of insulin are pro-inflammatory; this is one of the reasons people gain excess weight and cannot seem to lose it when they diet. Chronically high levels create an “insensitivity” to the insulin. Excess insulin continues to be released into the bloodstream, resulting in the storage of fat. When we add omega-3 essential fatty acids to our diets, we begin to “sensitize” our cells to insulin. Insulin receptors are found in the cell’s plasma membrane, which controls the passage of substances in and out of the cell. Essential fatty acids keep this critical and fragile portion of the cell flexible, thereby keeping these receptors intact and sensitive to fluctuations in insulin levels. The correct balance of dietary EFAs enables the receptors to respond to even small amounts of insulin, helping us to maintain healthy blood sugar levels and ensure an adequate uptake of sugar and amino acids into cells to build muscle and minimize fat storage. I then discovered that the essential fatty acids found in cold-water, high-fat fish and fish oil possess a number of even more astonishing properties. These essential fats, particularly the omega-3s, are extremely important in energy production within the mitochondria. Omega-3 EFAs also inhibit the production of the enzyme fatty acid synthase, which plays a role in the storage of calories as body fat. In addition, the essential fatty acids are responsible for a phenomenon known as “fuel partitioning.” When fuel partitioning is working efficiently, EFAs direct our bodies to store carbohydrates in the form of glycogen, rather than as hard-to-lose body fat. Glycogen is mainly stored in the liver and muscles and releases sugar (glucose) into the blood when needed by cells. It is the chief source of stored fuel in the body, and is the first place the body turns to when it needs quick energy between meals or when energy needs cannot be met by food intake alone, such as during intensive bouts of physical or mental activity. It is the glycogen stored in the muscle that directly affects how hard and how long we can exercise. In short, omega-3s facilitate the temporary storage of calories as glycogen, which is used for immediate energy needs, while encouraging the burning of stored body fat. The most exciting moment of my quest, however, has to be when I came across a groundbreaking study that held the long-awaited answer I had been searching for—clear evidence that omega-3 fatty acids can increase thermogenesis, thereby dissipating calories in the form of increased body heat, instead of storing them as body fat. Ongoing research suggests that EFAs may be able to directly influence important metabolic genes in our cells—genes that control how we synthesize glycogen and how we store and burn fat. This may be due to a steroid-like substance in our bodies called PPARs (perixosome proliferator-activated receptors), which, when bound to fats like EFAs, can “switch on” key genes involved in burning fat. Further research also suggests that omega-3s switch on a protein called uncoupling protein-3, which plays an important part in energy metabolism. Higher levels of uncoupling proteins result in more energy being dissipated as heat, increasing energy expenditure and decreasing stored fat. This is a critical function because stored body fat is very difficult to lose, as millions of unsuccessful dieters know. Could omega-3s be the uncoupling agent I had been searching for? Nutritional Factors Hold the Key Amazingly, it seems that we don’t need some new super-drug as the solution to the weight-loss problem. For the first time, science had proven beyond a doubt that nutritional components of our diet can directly control and influence key metabolic genes in our cells. That means the EFAs we consume can significantly affect the way we store and burn fat. This nutritional aspect was particularly compelling because it meant that the effects would be physiological—that is, they would work with the body, as opposed to against it, the way a drug would. This also meant that the positive, beneficial effects of these essential fatty acids would always have efficacy; unlike a drug, we would not build up a tolerance or resistance to their therapeutic properties. These omega-3 fatty acids would always be on the job, helping us to burn excess fat, while simultaneously decreasing our propensity for fat storage. Unfortunately, when most of us do consume essential fatty acids, they tend to be omega-6, which is found in grains and vegetable oils such as corn and safflower. In fact, very few of us are getting the proper ratio of omega-3 to omega-6, which may account for the growing prevalence of serious health conditions like heart attacks, cancer, asthma, lupus, schizophrenia, depression, accelerated aging, ADHD (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder), Alzheimer’s disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes in our society. This imbalance upsets the proverbial fat-metabolizing apple cart. An overabundance of omega-6 is inflammatory and interferes with the body’s ability to use omega-3s—a serious situation because of the positive effects of omega-3s we talked about earlier: they inhibit the calories we consume from being stored as body fat, while promoting the burning of body fat we already have. It’s important to realize that the processes described here do not happen overnight. As soon as you begin taking in omega-3s (from foods and/or supplements), they start exerting their anti-inflammatory effects. It does take time, however, for EFAs to influence your thermogenesis and fuel partitioning, which is why I recommend that you do not delay introducing omega-3s into your diet. The reason that traditional low-calorie diets fail is that they lack omega-3s, which are essential for healthy metabolism. If you follow the anti-inflammatory diet and ensure the intake of plenty of omega-3 fatty acids, you will successfully lose weight. The powerful anti-inflammatory properties of the omega-3 essential fatty acids hold the key to the weight-control puzzle. HOW OMEGA-3s AID WEIGHT CONTROL As you can see, essential fatty acids affect and trigger a number of different obesity-fighting processes. Here is a short but comprehensive overview of what they are and what they do: • Reduce inflammation that promotes weight gain. • Enable burning of dietary fats by transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria of our cells for burning as fuel. • Enhance “fuel efficiency” by exerting positive influences on the process of fuel partitioning. • Improve blood sugar control by sensitizing our cells and enabling receptors to respond to even small amounts of insulin. • Stimulate the secretion of leptin, a peptide hormone that is produced by fat cells. Leptin acts on the hypothalamus to suppress appetite and burn fat stored in adipose tissue (fat cells). • Improve fatty acid balance by reducing conversion of dietary omega-6 EFAs to arachidonic acid. • Influence key anti-obesity genetic switches (nuclear transcription factors) that govern both inflammation and conversion of food to body fat. They: — Activate perixosome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which increases the burning of body fat, increases thermogenesis, increases insulin sensitivity, and decreases levels of inflammation. — Prevent activation of NfkB. — Omega-3 (and omega-6) block the release of sterol response element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), which switches on the gene that codes for fatty-acid synthase, an enzyme that helps create body fat. • Omega-3 and omega-6 enhance the body’s ability to transport glucose from our blood to our cells via an “insulin responsive transporter” called GLUT4; they do this by optimizing the fluidity of cell membranes. Stress, Stress-Related Weight Gain, and Obesity Stress is highly destructive—not just emotionally, but also physically. Unfortunately, in today’s world, we all experience significant amounts of stress, and it does not appear to be going away anytime soon. Many circumstances create stress in our daily lives. Arguing with family, friends, or colleagues, not getting enough sleep, worrying about everything from our family to our finances, constant pressure to keep up with the home and office demands; even playing too hard can all create stress. Weekend warriors, making up for a week of inactivity by spending hours engaged in strenuous activity, are also setting themselves up for a stress response. Cortisol, the Stress/Death Hormone When we are under stress, our adrenal glands produce hormones. These include the fight-or-flight hormones, epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline), as well as cortisol. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid, one of a group of steroid hormones that include cortisone. Cortisol is involved in carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism, and has anti-inflammatory properties. As we age, the “youth” hormones such as testosterone, estrogen, and human growth hormone decline. Cortisol, however, increases as we age and too much cortisol can also become pro-inflammatory. When we experience stress (whether from fear, anxiety, physical or emotional trauma, or overexertion), the stress hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine will return to normal levels as the stress subsides. In a young person, cortisol levels will also return to normal within a few hours. Because cortisol levels continue to rise with age, the older person’s cortisol levels will remain elevated for long periods of time. This has earned cortisol the dubious distinction of being known as a “death” hormone, because high levels of cortisol exert a catabolic or muscle-wasting, deteriorating action on the body. Simply put, it breaks down tissue. How Stress Promotes Weight Gain Cortisol stimulates fat and carbohydrate metabolism for fast energy (the fight-or-flight response), thereby stimulating insulin release to keep pace with the rising blood sugar levels. This results in an increase in our appetite. If we experience chronic stress, with chronically high levels of cortisol, we may end up hungry all the time, causing us to overeat. Cortisol also influences where that weight will be deposited. A fascinating study on the effects of the release of cortisol during acute and chronic stress in non-overweight women was published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine in 2001. The study clearly demonstrated that this excess cortisol contributes to the deposition of visceral fat, particularly in the abdominal region. As we know, there are two types of fat: subcutaneous (under the skin) and visceral (found in the abdomen and surrounding our vital organs). Central obesity sets the stage for a host of health concerns such as heart disease, strokes, and diabetes. Because of its serious threat to health, this has also been referred to as “toxic fat.” Traditionally, women worried about the size of their hips. However, when it comes to overall weight gain, it is preferable to have it on the hips as opposed to the stomach area—if not from an aesthetic point of view, then from a health point of view. Studies indicate that women (and men) who store their weight in the abdominal area have higher cortisol levels and higher stress levels than those whose weight is stored on the hips. The Cholesterol Component In addition, visceral fat is metabolized by the liver, which turns it into cholesterol that circulates in the blood. This is the so-called “bad” cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein or LDL, which collects in the arteries forming plaque (deposits of fats, inflammatory cells, proteins, and calcium material along the lining of arteries). The plaque builds up and narrows the artery, resulting in atherosclerosis. Researchers have also found that consuming a lot of saturated fats such as butter and the fats found in red meats can lead to the accumulation of visceral fat. The high omega-3 content found in wild Alaskan salmon, anchovies, sardines, and other cold-water fish, along with fish oil capsules, will help you to get rid of this deadly form of fat because the essential fatty acids found in these foods can decrease cortisol levels. To sum up, elevated cortisol levels produce a host of negative effects that include: increased inflammation increased insulin secretion increased appetite storage of fat, particularly in the abdomen increased risk of acne flare-ups. Acne is a systemic inflammatory disease and stress precipitates and aggravates acne breakouts. the death of brain cells. High levels of stress actually shrink the brain and other organs. destruction of the immune system decreased muscle mass accelerated aging. 10 FOOD “SUPERGROUPS” In order for any weight-loss program to 1) work, and 2) become a lifelong lifestyle, there have to be plenty of options available. If you feel hungry or deprived, you are on the wrong program. I have put my favorite foods into what I call “SuperGroups.” Each SuperGroup is comprised of a different family of healthy, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity choices. The food I consider to be the healthiest choice in each group is labeled “Top Choice(s)” and is followed by other healthy (and tasty) choices I call “Runners-Up.” SUPERGROUP #1: RICH COLD-WATER FISH FUNCTIONAL WEIGHT-CONTROL FACTOR: Omega-3s TOP CHOICE: Wild Alaskan Salmon RUNNERS-UP: Sablefish, Sardines, Anchovies, Herring, North Atlantic Mackerel, Trout, Tuna SUPERGROUP #2: FAVORITE FRUITS FUNCTIONAL WEIGHT-CONTROL FACTORS: Fiber, Anti-inflammatory Antioxidants, and other Phytonutrient Obesity-Fighters TOP CHOICES: Apples, Pears, Grapefruit RUNNERS-UP: All Berries, Peaches, Plums, Cherries, Pomegranates SUPERGROUP #3: FATS FROM FRUITS TO FIGHT BODY FAT FUNCTIONAL WEIGHT-CONTROL FACTORS: Anti-inflammatory Antioxidants, Monounsaturated Fats TOP CHOICES: Avocado, Açaí, Olives RUNNER-UP: Coconut SUPERGROUP #4: SPICE THINGS UP TO KEEP WEIGHT DOWN FUNCTIONAL WEIGHT-CONTROL FACTORS: Anti-inflammatory Antioxidants and other Phytonutrient Obesity-Fighters TOP CHOICE: Cinnamon RUNNERS-UP: Turmeric, Fenugreek, Cloves, Allspice, Nutmeg, Bay Leaf SUPERGROUP #5: HEAT THINGS UP FOR BURNING FAT FUNCTIONAL WEIGHT-CONTROL FACTORS: Anti-inflammatory Antioxidants, Fiber, and Phytonutrient Obesity-Fighters TOP CHOICE: Chili Peppers RUNNERS-UP: Cayenne, Chili Powder, Red Pepper Flakes SUPERGROUP #6: SEEDS AND NUTS TO FILL YOU UP FUNCTIONAL WEIGHT-CONTROL FACTORS: Anti-inflammatory Antioxidants, Essential Fats, Protein, Fiber, Lignans TOP CHOICES: Sesame Seeds, Flaxseed RUNNERS-UP: Almonds, Walnuts, Hazelnuts, Sunflower Seeds, Pumpkin Seeds SUPERGROUP #7: BEANS AND LENTILS (LEGUME FAMILY) FOR STABILIZING BLOOD SUGAR FUNCTIONAL WEIGHT-CONTROL FACTORS: Fiber, Resistant Starch, Starch Blockers, and Phytonutrient Obesity-Fighters TOP CHOICES: Dried Beans, including Kidney, Pinto, Navy, Red, and Black Beans, Lentils, Chickpeas, Mung Beans RUNNERS-UP: All are recommended SUPERGROUP #8: LOW-FAT PROBIOTIC DAIRY FOODS WITH CALCIUM FOR WEIGHT LOSS AND BONE HEALTH FUNCTIONAL WEIGHT-CONTROL FACTOR: Nutraceutical Obesity-Fighters TOP CHOICE: Low-Fat Yogurt RUNNERS-UP: Low-Fat Kefir, Acidophilus Milk SUPERGROUP #9: OLD-FASHIONED WHOLE GRAINS FUNCTIONAL WEIGHT-CONTROL FACTORS: Fiber, Anti-inflammatory Antioxidants, and Other Phytonutrient Obesity-Fighters TOP CHOICES: Buckwheat, Oats RUNNER-UP: Barley SUPERGROUP #10: VIBRANT VEGETABLES FUNCTIONAL WEIGHT-CONTROL FACTORS: Fiber, Low-Calorie/Low-Glycemic Nutrition, Anti-inflammatory Antioxidants, and other Phytonutrient Obesity-Fighters TOP CHOICES: Garlic, Spinach, Kale, Broccoli Sprouts, Cruciferous Vegetables RUNNERS-UP: Aromatic Culinary Herbs (e.g., Parsley, Mint, Rosemary, Thyme, Basil, Oregano) 12 Nutritional Supplements That Facilitate Weight Loss While Maintaining Muscle Mass The Perricone Weight-Loss Diet anti-inflammatory nutrients work in a special way to enhance loss of body fat, preserve muscle mass, and regulate levels of blood sugar and insulin, which are critical in the prevention and treatment of obesity. These nutrients all have powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. They’re an important adjunct to any health regimen, and particularly important for a weight-loss program. Many of my patients have asked me over the years if it is possible to get all of the necessary nutrients from a healthy diet. Unfortunately, the answer is no. Alpha lipoic acid, for example, is one the most powerful and beneficial anti-inflammatory antioxidants and a very important nutrient for fighting aging and weight problems. However, there are no really adequate food sources for this nutrient. For optimum health and weight management, we do need to supplement. I always recommend that my patients take a complete spectrum of vitamins and minerals. Fortunately, there are a number of outstanding supplements that really do help facilitate weight loss and maintain muscle mass. Each supplement has a distinct function, and they are all an important part of my own personal daily supplement regimen. SUPERSTAR SUPPLEMENT #1: OMEGA-3 FISH OIL Omega-3 fish oil supplements (as well as eating the fish itself) are extremely important to the success of any weight-loss plan, the Perricone Weight-Loss Diet included. I truly believe that they may be one of the most perfect anti-inflammatories we have discovered thus far. However, it is still important to take a variety of nutritional supplements to ensure optimum protection and benefit. The incredible anti-inflammatory power of omega-3 essential fatty acids found in the high-fat fish and in fish oil can accomplish the following: reduce inflammation in all organ systems accelerate the loss of body fat elevate mood improve attention span stabilize blood sugar levels lower insulin levels create and maintain healthy serotonin levels stop the roller-coaster effects of the carbohydrate highs and lows decrease appetite increase radiance to skin increase health of the immune system increase energy levels decrease symptoms and severity of rheumatoid arthritis reduce symptoms and severity of chronic skin conditions such as eczema decrease cardiovascular risk Omega-3 Fish Oil Tips To avoid any dietary side effects from the omega-3 fish oils (such as belching or stomach upset), divide the dose into three. For example, if you are taking 3,000 mg per day of fish oil, take one 1,000 mg capsule with a meal three times per day. Even though fish oil is basically a “food,” always check with your primary health-care professional before embarking on any new supplement. Any therapeutic intervention, even nutritional supplements, can be contraindicated in certain health conditions. This is especially true with heart patients. Numerous studies have shown that fish oil helps protect against sudden cardiac death and abnormal heart rhythms called arrhythmias. However, according to a study in the June 2005 Journal of the American Medical Association, fish oil supplementation actually increased the rate of arrhythmia among patients who had an implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). DOSAGE RECOMMENDATION: For a regular weight-loss diet, take one 1000-mg capsule three times per day. If you need to lose a lot of weight or are trying to improve athletic performance, take three 1,000-mg capsules three times per day for a total of nine per day. Check with your physician before taking the larger dose. SUPERSTAR SUPPLEMENT #2: ALPHA LIPOIC ACID (ALA) Alpha lipoic acid is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. It is found naturally in the body, locked inside the mitochondria. Lipoic acid is part of an enzyme complex called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, making it intimately involved in the energy production of the cell. Alpha lipoic acid, like many of the other nutrients including acetyl-L-carnitine, carnitine, and CoQ10, enhances our ability to metabolize food into energy. Unlike many other antioxidants such as vitamin C, which is strictly water soluble, or vitamin E, which is strictly fat soluble, alpha lipoic acid is soluble in both water and fat. This means that alpha lipoic acid can go to all parts of the cell, including the lipid (fat) portions such as the cell plasma membrane, as well as the interior of the cell (known as the cytoplasm) where water-soluble chemicals reside. Because of this unique property, alpha lipoic acid is often referred to as “the universal antioxidant.” Needless to say, the amazing properties of alpha lipoic acid have placed it near and dear to my heart, both as a powerful ally in the anti-aging realm and also as an integral part of the Perricone Weight-Loss Diet. On a cellular level, alpha lipoic acid exerts a wide variety of positive actions, all of them anti-inflammatory. It also blocks the activation of transcription factor NfkB as well, if not better than, any other antioxidant/anti-inflammatory thus far discovered. In addition to its function as a powerful antioxidant/anti-inflammatory, alpha lipoic acid increases the body’s ability to take glucose into the cells. This insulin-sensitizing effect is also seen in some of the other nutrients that we have discussed. These nutrients all work synergistically to increase sensitivity to insulin, resulting in decreased blood sugar levels. Like carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine, alpha lipoic acid is also very powerful in preventing glycation. ALA works synergistically with CoQ10, carnitine, and acetyl-L-carnitine to protect and rejuvenate the mitochondria. If we recognize that an aging cell is characterized by decreased energy production, it is easy to see the importance of any substance that can increase energy levels in the cell, allowing the cells to repair themselves in the same way that young cells do. ALA also works synergistically with other antioxidants to raise levels of vitamins C and E, CoQ10, and glutathione in the cell. Alpha Lipoic Acid Tips In the metabolic cycle, alpha lipoic acid acts as a coenzyme in the production of energy by converting carbohydrates into energy (ATP). ALA is the only antioxidant that can boost cellular levels of glutathione, the body’s most important antioxidant to overall health and longevity. Take with meals. DOSAGE RECOMMENDATION: Because alpha lipoic acid is found only in trace amounts in food, it must be taken as a supplement. SUPERSTAR SUPPLEMENT #3: ASTAXANTHIN Astaxanthin comes from the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis, found in abundance in arctic marine environments, and is a natural carotenoid (any of a class of yellow to red pigments, including the carotenes and the xanthophylls). Carotenoids are one of the most abundant molecules in the world and give nature its wide variety of colors—from carrots to flamingos. Astaxanthin is an amazingly powerful antioxidant and is often referred to as “red gold from the sea.” Astaxanthin is one of the xanthophyll group of the carotenoid family. Xanthophylls help to protect vitamin A, vitamin E, and other carotenoids from oxidation. It is the most potent of all of the carotenoids—in fact, it is 10 times stronger than beta-carotene and 100 times stronger than vitamin E. Wild Alaskan salmon, lobster, rainbow trout, shrimp, crawfish, crab, and red caviar all owe their rich colors to their astaxanthin-rich diets—just one of the reasons wild salmon tops my SuperFood list. The variety of wild Alaskan salmon known as “sockeye” delivers the greatest amount of astaxanthin, with 4.5 mg per four-ounce serving. To put this in antioxidant perspective, 4.5 mg of astaxanthin is equal to 450 mg of vitamin E. Astaxanthin is also superior to many other antioxidants due to the unique role it may play in protecting the cell membrane. Astaxanthin Tips Because astaxanthin has been proven to cross the blood–brain barrier (see carnitine), it offers protection to the brain, the central nervous system, and the eyes. It increases physical endurance and reduces muscle damage. It reduces eye fatigue and improves visual acuity. It provides wrinkle reduction by internal supplementation. It reduces hyperpigmentation (better known as age spots). It provides cytokine regulation, inhibiting the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. It improves gastric health and reduces infection/inflammation of H. pylori, spiral-shaped bacteria that can damage stomach and duodenal tissue, causing ulcers. Astaxanthin is an exceptional anti-inflammatory, making it an important component of the Perricone Weight-Loss Diet. Its ability to protect muscles and increase physical endurance is a wonderful asset for everyone needing to start and maintain a regular exercise program. DOSAGE RECOMMENDATION: One to two capsules, 2 mg each, per day. SUPERSTAR SUPPLEMENT #4: CARNITINE Carnitine is a nutrient that was once classified as an amino acid, but we now know that is incorrect. Carnitine is a water-soluble nutrient, very much like a B vitamin, that allows us to convert fat into energy. Carnitine and its derivative, acetyl-L-carnitine, are two of the most important nutrients for weight loss. However, for carnitine to have optimum effect, we must have adequate essential fatty acids (such as omega-3s) present in the diet. Carnitine is critical for energy formation and an active metabolism. Small amounts of carnitine can be obtained from foods such as meats and dairy products, but to get an adequate supply, we must take carnitine supplements. You’ll remember that fats provide an important source of energy within the body, especially for muscles such as the heart, as well as vital organs such as the liver. In order for fat to be turned into fuel, it has to be carried into the energy-producing portion of the cell known as the mitochondria. It is the role of carnitine to transport the fatty acids from our blood into the cell for this energy production. Carnitine also provides anti-aging benefits in that it enhances energy production in the cell, which is needed for cellular repair. Studies have also shown that carnitine helps prevent muscle loss during illness and also prevents the muscle loss associated with aging, known as sarcopenia. Carnitine is protective of liver function and enhances and protects the immune system, especially under stressful conditions. Carnitine Tips For carnitine to have optimum effect, make sure you have an adequate omega-3 intake. Do not take carnitine in the evening, as it may interfere with sleep. Carnitine may be taken with or without food. For better utilization of fat for energy, take omega-3 fish oil with carnitine. DOSAGE RECOMMENDATION: The recommended dose for an adult under the age of 30 without ill health or obesity is approximately 500 mg per day. For those who are obese or have other health problems, the recommendation is 1500 to 2000 mg per day, taken in 500-mg doses three or four times per day. DAMAGING EFFECTS OF GLYCATION You have been advised to avoid high-glycemic foods as a surefire way to decrease inflammation and facilitate weight loss. However, there is another reason to steer clear of these foods. I have explained that these foods cause sudden spikes in blood sugar levels, resulting in the release of insulin into the bloodstream that then causes us to store, rather than burn, fat. However, that is not the only negative by-product. As we know, when sugars and starches are eaten, they cause a burst of inflammation throughout the body. These sugars (and foods that rapidly convert to sugar) can permanently attach to the collagen present in our skin and other parts of the body through a process known as “glycation.” At the point of attachment, there is a small mechanism creating inflammation, which then becomes a source of inflammation in its own right. This inflammation produces enzymes that break down collagen, resulting in wrinkles. In addition to inflammation, glycation also causes cross-linking in our collagen, making it stiff and inflexible where it was once soft and supple. But it is not just the skin we have to worry about. These “sugar-bonds” can occur throughout the body as we age. The sugar molecule attaches itself to our collagen as well as our arteries, veins, bones, ligaments, even our brains, resulting in the breakdown of organ systems and the deterioration of the body. Glycation creates “free radical” factories known as advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which also increase cellular inflammation. Because the Perricone Weight-Loss Diet is anti-inflammatory, it will prevent glycation, stop inflammation, keep the brain functioning properly, and facilitate weight loss. The alternative? Being wrinkled, depressed, and overweight. SUPERSTAR SUPPLEMENT #5: ACETYL-L-CARNITINE Acetyl-L-carnitine is synthesized from carnitine by the addition of an acetyl group to the carnitine molecule. While this synthesis means that it cannot be found in food, the good news is that this form of carnitine can pass through the blood–brain barrier, which separates the blood vessels from the central nervous system. The barrier has a protective effect, but it can stop the passage of therapeutic substances along with the harmful ones. Since acetyl-L-carnitine can penetrate this barrier, it has a particularly beneficial effect on the brain cells. In fact, acetyl-L-carnitine is extremely neuroprotective and should be used on a daily basis to prevent the neurological decline seen with aging. Like carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine improves mitochondrial function, but to an even greater degree, because it can pass through the mitochondrial membrane. And like carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine functions best when there is adequate dietary intake of omega-3 essential fatty acids. Acetyl-L-carnitine is a natural anti-inflammatory that enhances the effects of antioxidant systems within the body. These anti-inflammatory properties protect the cell plasma membrane (the cell’s first line of defense) and prevent the conversion of arachidonic acid into inflammatory chemicals. Acetyl-L-carnitine can also help repair the mitochondria, boost levels of the antioxidants glutathione and coenzyme Q10, and work synergistically with alpha lipoic acid, another powerful antioxidant/anti-inflammatory. Both acetyl-L-carnitine and carnitine have been known to actually improve the lipid profile within our blood by reducing the level of triglycerides and raising levels of HDL (good) cholesterol. Both forms of carnitine are important in a weight-loss regimen because they act as natural anti-inflammatories, and they aid in transportation of fats into the mitochondria to be burned. They also enhance the sensitivity of insulin receptors, helping to decrease blood sugar and circulating levels of insulin. As we have learned, high levels of insulin are inflammatory and “lock” our body fat in place. Both carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine help prevent glycation. Acetyl-L-Carnitine Tips Carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine are not to be used by people with bipolar disease (manic depression) or those who are susceptible to seizures (epilepsy) unless recommended by their physician. Do not take acetyl-L-carnitine after 3 p.m., to prevent any difficulties with sleeping. Exercise naturally increases our levels of acetyl-L-carnitine; however, if we are obese, over 30, or have other health problems, it will not raise them to therapeutic levels; therefore supplementation is necessary. Acetyl-L-carnitine may be taken with or without food. For better utilization of fat for energy, take omega-3 fish oil with carnitine. DOSAGE RECOMMENDATION: 500 mg per day; however, individuals on a weight-loss program may take up to 1500 mg daily. SUPERSTAR SUPPLEMENT #6: CONJUGATED LINOLEIC ACID (CLA) CLA is a fatty acid that is found in many of the foods we eat. At one time, beef and lamb were exceptional sources; however, when their diet was changed from grass to grain, levels of CLA dramatically decreased in meat and dairy products. When CLA is present, it is found in the fatty portion of milk. Drinking skim milk prevents us from receiving the benefits of CLA. However, since CLA levels are now so low in animal products, skim vs. full-fat milk is a moot point. When taken in effective doses, CLA decreases body fat, especially in the area of the abdomen. There are several mechanisms of CLA’s activity that accomplish these feats: CLA actually concentrates in the cell membrane, stabilizing it and thus preventing the breakdown of arachidonic acid into a pro-inflammatory prostaglandin. It helps the insulin receptors remain intact, thus increasing insulin sensitivity, which will then decrease blood sugar and circulating insulin levels. Remarkably, studies show that CLA also helps block the absorption of fat and sugar into fat cells (adipocytes). It even induces a reduction in the actual size of the fat cells (one reason people gain weight as they age is that their fat cells literally become fatter). CLA Tips When taken with sesame seeds, the effects of CLA are enhanced. The average diet provides no more than a gram (1000 mg) of CLA per day. CLA may be taken with meals. DOSAGE RECOMMENDATION: 1000 mg, up to a maximum of 4000 mg per day, taken in one or two doses. SUPERSTAR SUPPLEMENT #7: COENZYME Q10 (COQ10) Coenzyme Q10, also called ubiquinone, is a powerful antioxidant/anti-inflammatory with many benefits for treating and preventing obesity. It acts similarly to acetyl-L-carnitine in that it assists in energy production within the mitochondria. As we have learned, energy production declines as a cell ages, and that means that the cell’s ability to repair itself also declines. Working synergistically with acetyl-L-carnitine, carnitine, and alpha lipoic acid in the mitochondria, CoQ10 enhances the metabolism, giving us greater energy and endurance, and a greater ability to lose body fat, while preventing the energy decline seen in aging cells. CoQ10 also works synergistically with other antioxidants to elevate cellular levels of vitamins C and E and glutathione and to help regulate blood sugar and enhance insulin sensitivity. CoQ10 also maximizes the burning of foods for fuel, helping to normalize fats in our blood. Hundreds of studies document the effectiveness of CoQ10 in protecting all vital organs of the body, including the brain, heart, and kidneys. Because of its powerful anti-inflammatory effects, CoQ10 is extremely protective of the cardiovascular system. It keeps the heart muscle healthy and also prevents inflammation in the arteries, which leads to arteriosclerosis. Although CoQ10 can be found in small amounts in fish such as sardines or salmon, as well as in nuts, I recommend supplementation for optimal anti-aging and weight-loss benefits. CoQ10 supplementation is of particular importance for women because they tend to have lower levels than their male counterparts. CoQ10 Tips This supplement should be taken by anyone over 40, as tissue levels of CoQ10 decrease as people get older. CoQ10 is best taken with food. DOSAGE RECOMMENDATION: I recommend a minimum of 30 mg per day. For those with health problems, under the supervision and recommendation of their physician, up to 300 mg per day. About three weeks of daily dosing are necessary to reach maximal serum concentrations of CoQ10. SUPERSTAR SUPPLEMENT #8: CHROMIUM Chromium is a critical nutrient in our effort to control and reduce excess body fat. By supplementing our diets with chromium, we can effectively lower blood sugar and insulin levels—the key to the anti-inflammatory weight-loss diet. The reason people are overweight is because they’re in an inflammatory state that has put a “lock” on their fat-burning mechanism. Our goal is to reverse this. Chromium helps decrease inflammation, thereby unlocking the enzymes that aid in fat metabolization. Chromium not only affects blood sugar and insulin levels, it can also help normalize blood lipids such as triglycerides and cholesterol, increasing levels of the HDL “good” cholesterol and lowering total cholesterol and triglycerides, making it cardioprotective. Experts in the field of nutrition report that the general population of the United States is deficient in chromium, and low levels of chromium are associated with type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Studies have also been published noting that increased consumption of sugar depletes our body stores of chromium, placing us at further risk for hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia (too much blood sugar, too much insulin). Chromium Tips Chromium is an essential nutrient required for normal sugar and fat metabolism. Chromium is important for energy production, and also plays a key role in regulating appetite, reducing sugar cravings, and lowering body fat. Chromium absorption is made more difficult when milk, as well as foods high in phosphorus, are eaten at the same time. Don’t take chromium with foods rich in phytic acid (unleavened bread, raw beans, seeds, nuts, grains, and soy isolates) as this may decrease its absorption. The recommended type of this supplement is chromium polynicotinate. DOSAGE RECOMMENDATION: I suggest 100 micrograms (mcg) per day for the average person over 40 and up to 200 mcg per day for those on the Perricone Weight-Loss Diet. Borage (Borago officinalis) SUPERSTAR SUPPLEMENT #9: GAMMA LINOLENIC ACID (GLA) GLA is an important omega-6 essential fatty acid. The average Western diet has an excess of the omega-6 EFAs. And this is true when we are speaking of linolenic acid, found in many vegetable oils, grains, and seeds. However, GLA is an omega-6 that is well worth taking in a supplemental form. The body rapidly converts GLA into dihomogamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), the precursor of prostaglandin E1, a powerful anti-inflammatory hormone-like compound that helps to regulate inflammation, blood pressure, and many other bodily processes. Because of the increased production of prostaglandin E1, GLA has been found in many studies to lower total cholesterol, as well as lower blood pressure. GLA can also increase the metabolic rate, an effect that causes the body to burn fat, resulting in weight loss. The average American diet causes a deficiency of GLA because of the large amounts of trans fatty acids, sugar, red meats, and dairy products that are consumed. GLA is very difficult to find in the diet, but is found in high amounts in borage, black currant, and evening primrose oils. GLA Tips Take GLA with meals to increase absorption. GLA improves cell sensitivity to insulin, reducing our chance of developing diabetes, heart disease, and excess body fat. Borage oil is the richest supplemental source of GLA. As with omega-3 fish oil supplementation, results do not happen overnight and may take up to six months. Don’t let this dissuade you from adding this vital essential fatty acid to your diet as soon as possible. DOSAGE RECOMMENDATION: 200 to 400 mg of GLA per day—one to two 1,000-mg capsules of borage oil. SUPERSTAR SUPPLEMENT #10: GLUTAMINE Glutamine is an extremely important dietary supplement for anyone wishing to lose weight. It is an amino acid that is classified as “conditionally essential,” meaning that we are able to synthesize it, but only within certain limits that are controlled by a variety of factors (including the dietary supply of the appropriate precursors and the maturity and health of the individual). Glutamine is primarily stored within muscles and is the body’s most abundant amino acid. (Amino acids are the basic building blocks of a protein. There are 20 different amino acids commonly found in proteins. There are eight essential amino acids: isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Our bodies actually need 20 different amino acids, but we are able to make the other 12 kinds from these eight, which we must get from food.) While the majority of the glutamine we need is synthesized in our muscle cells, we can also obtain a significant amount of glutamine from several dietary sources, including poultry, fish, dairy products, and legumes. However, under certain stressful conditions, glutamine is used up very quickly and our body cannot make as much as it needs. For example, prolonged and intense cardiovascular workouts, such as running and aerobics, can cause the body to burn muscle for energy, exhausting our glutamine supply. It appears that glutamine plays an important role in keeping the muscles functioning properly and in helping to reduce muscle deterioration. One reason is that glutamine is the only amino acid that contains two nitrogen molecules. Because of this additional molecule, glutamine can transport, or shuttle, the nitrogen to where it is needed most. Nitrogen is one of the building blocks of muscle cells; glutamine is the delivery system for getting the nitrogen to those cells. Glutamine can also transport excess nitrogen out of the body—a critical function because nitrogen can act as a toxin. The optimal state for muscle growth is when glutamine is working properly, and nitrogen intake is greater than nitrogen output. When we are overweight and in an inflammatory state, we need even more glutamine—so the body breaks down the muscle tissue to get the extra glutamine it needs—and we lose muscle mass. Making sure we have enough glutamine enables us to both lose weight and retain muscle mass. Glutamine plays a number of vitally important roles in many other functions as well. It is absolutely essential to the support of our immune system and immune response, where it is utilized by white blood cells. Glutamine is also anti-catabolic, which means that it is critical in the prevention of muscle breakdown caused by extreme stress, including physical trauma or injury, severe burns, disease, mental or psychic stress, overwork or overexertion, poor nutrition, and dieting. Glutamine has such extraordinary anti-catabolic properties that it has been used to help prevent stress ulcers in severe burns. Scientists have also found that patients who have had major surgery or trauma do not lose muscle mass during the recuperative period when they are given supplemental glutamine, even if they are inactive! This prevention of muscle breakdown is the reason that I so strongly recommend that you take glutamine throughout the day as part of the anti-inflammatory diet. Glutamine is also very supportive of our digestive system. The health of the gut is of critical importance because it is the point of fuel and nutrient entry. Glutamine nourishes the cells that line the stomach, intestines, and digestive track, which actually use glutamine as a fuel. Studies have shown that supplemental glutamine may protect against aspirin-induced gastric lesions and enhance healing of painful peptic ulcers. In fact, an old folk remedy for ulcers is fresh cabbage juice—which is high in glutamine. Glutamine may also be helpful in healing the stomach problems arising from colitis and Crohn’s disease. In summary, glutamine can be used whenever there are any stomach problems, as simple as overindulging in alcohol (alcoholic-induced gastritis) to ulcers, viral-induced diarrhea, or even severe problems such as inflammatory bowel disease. It is difficult to overstate the importance of glutamine to our body’s antioxidant system. In combination with other amino acids, N-acetyl cysteine and glycine, glutamine promotes the synthesis of glutathione in the liver. Glutathione is the body’s primary antioxidant defense system; it is required for the smooth functioning of all cells. It is involved in protein synthesis, amino acid transport, and in the recycling of other antioxidants, such as vitamin C. In fact, it is so effective in preventing inflammation in the body that glutathione is being used to treat people with HIV infection who suffer from high levels of inflammation and body wasting. Glutamine will reduce cravings for high-glycemic carbohydrates and will make your weight-loss program much easier. Glutamine can help prevent both depression and fatigue and can also help us synthesize neurotransmitters in the brain, which naturally relax us while elevating our mood. In the brain, it is converted to glutamic acid and increases the concentration of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). Both glutamic acid and GABA can be considered “brain fuel,” as they are essential for normal mental function. Studies have also shown that glutamine supplementation helps prevent the damaging effects of alcohol on the brain and may also reduce alcoholic (as well as food) cravings. Glutamine Tips Once mixed in water, glutamine deteriorates rapidly, so take it immediately upon mixing in the water. Do not store glutamine solution, as it may become inactive or possibly toxic. Mix fresh for each serving. Check with your primary care physician before beginning any supplementation program—this is mandatory if you are being treated for any disease or kidney, liver, or other health problem, are pregnant, or nursing. Glutamine may cause constipation in some individuals; to protect from this, increase your water and soluble fiber intake. This can be accomplished by adding one gram of pectin to a glass of water. DOSAGE RECOMMENDATION: One-half teaspoon of glutamine dissolved in water three times a day. ANABOLIC VS. CATABOLIC The term “anabolic” means to build up tissue; the term “catabolic” means to break down tissue. Our goal is to always be in an anabolic state. Anabolic stimulating substances are made by the body and they include the growth hormones and the sex hormones such as testosterone. The catabolic state is also termed as “the clinical wasting syndrome or cachexia,” a syndrome that is characterized by unintended and progressive weight loss, weakness, and low body fat and muscle. This catabolic state can occur in diseases such as cancer and AIDS. Inflammation puts our body in a catabolic state, even though we may not be seriously ill. The anti-inflammatory diet and anti-inflammatory supplements, such as alpha lipoic acid, CoQ10, and glutamine, are extremely important forms of protection as we embark on a weight-loss program. SUPERSTAR SUPPLEMENT #11: MAITAKE MAGIC The Maitake SX-Fraction™ is a special supplement derived from the maitake mushroom. There is a solid body of scientific evidence establishing it as a powerful tool in preventing metabolic syndrome, a dangerous quartet of metabolic imbalances that increase our risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes: 1) high blood pressure, 2) elevated levels of insulin, 3) excess weight (especially around the abdomen), and 4) “dyslipidemia” (low levels of HDL “good” cholesterol, high levels of LDL “bad” cholesterol, and high levels of triglycerides [meta-bolized dietary fats that end up in our blood, organs, and tissues]). Metabolic syndrome is a by-product of Americans’ sedentary lifestyles in conjunction with an inflammatory diet high in sugars, starches, and processed “junk” foods. The Maitake Grifron SX-Fraction™ has been developed based on a newly discovered active fraction from the Maitake mushroom (Grifola frondosa) in collaboration with Harry G. Preuss, MD, of Georgetown University. The study at Georgetown University started in 1997 based on a previously discovered compound, X-Fraction, which Japanese scientists demonstrated had anti-diabetic activity. Searching for a better compound, researchers developed an improved method to successfully fractionate and identify another active compound from maitake, named SX-Fraction.™ Studies on SX-Fraction™ have been conducted at Georgetown University and New York Medical College. Results show that SX-Fraction™ does indeed possess a more potent ability to enhance insulin sensitivity for controlling blood sugar levels and lowering high blood pressure than X-fraction. This is another exciting, therapeutic tool to add to our arsenal of substances that can positively affect out-of-control blood sugar and all of its negative ramifications. Leading experts believe that the Maitake SX-Fraction™ may be very helpful not only in prevention, but also for those who suffer from chronic disorders associated with the aging process due to malfunction of blood glucose/insulin metabolism. A recent study conducted at four clinics in Japan gave 33 diabetic people, who were on a stable drug regimen, nine tablets of SX-Fraction™ daily. Both blood sugar and cholesterol markers were improved significantly. In addition, they lost six pounds in a two-month period, without dieting. While this is not dramatic, it is statistically significant and future studies may show that in addition to preventing metabolic syndrome, SX-Fraction™ may serve as a safe and reliable weight-loss supplement—even without additional behavior modifications, such as decreased caloric intake and increased exercise. It appears that the Maitake SX-Fraction™ may be the first dietary supplement of this kind specifically targeting metabolic syndrome with abundant scientific validation behind it. And the research continues to this day. Maitake SX-Fraction™ Tips Recent studies suggest that this active constituent may help maintain healthy cardiovascular function and a healthy circulatory system. For optimum effect, take between meals. DOSAGE RECOMMENDATION: I recommend that you select the Grifron SX-Fraction™ of Maitake Mushroom Extract Supplement because this is the standardized product used in the studies. For general support for healthy blood sugar maintenance, take one tablet within 30 minutes after each meal. For maximum impact, you may double or triple the general dose. A WORD ABOUT ANTIBIOTICS According to the Union of Concerned Scientists (www.ucsusa.org), more than 68% of all seafood consumed in the United States is imported, and most of it is industrially produced. Many of these commodities are farm-raised and often involve little oversight regarding antibiotic drug use. While the US government has standards that should ban imports with high levels of antibiotics in seafood, there is essentially no enforcement. Farmed salmon has more antibiotics administered by weight than any other form of livestock. HOW TO EAT TO LOSE WEIGHT • Remember, every meal or snack must include: protein, low-glycemic carbs, AND essential fatty acids. • Always eat your protein first. Reach for that shrimp cocktail or smoked salmon appetizer first—and when your Thanksgiving dinner entrée arrives, eat the turkey first, followed by your green salad and vegetables. Why? Because by eating your protein first at every meal, you are helping to suppress your appetite. Proteins are digested much more slowly than carbohydrates—even carbohydrates that are high in fiber. Also, protein is neutral in terms of its effect on blood sugar. • Save the fresh fruit for the end of the meal. This way, you will prevent the natural sugars found in the fruit from causing a spike in blood sugar. Our goal is to avoid spikes in blood sugar, which trigger insulin release. Remember this fact: insulin release = stored fat! SUPERSTAR SUPPLEMENT #12: DIMETHYLAMINOETHANOL (DMAE) DMAE is a naturally occurring nutritional substance with powerful anti-inflammatory properties. It is found in fish, including wild Alaskan salmon, anchovies, and sardines. Back in the 1950s, DMAE was a prescription drug used as a treatment for central nervous system problems such as attention deficit disorder. Although it is no longer used for this purpose, it is being sold as a nutritional supplement for improving cognitive function, with additional benefits of improved memory and increased problem-solving ability. DMAE is important in the production of neurotransmitters, especially acetylcholine, which is essential in the communication from one nerve to another and between nerves and muscles. In order for your muscles to contract, the message must be sent from your nerves to your muscles via acetylcholine. DMAE also has membrane-stabilizing effects and can also help reduce body fat, most likely from its activity as a precursor to acetylcholine as well as its anti-inflammatory activity. Taking DMAE as a supplement will not only improve your cognitive function, it will help increase skin firmness and muscle tone. In fact, recent studies have confirmed that topically applied DMAE lotion turned out to be extremely efficacious—in other words, it had positive effects on the skin, greatly increasing the appearance of radiance, tone, and firmness, while decreasing the micro-inflammation in the skin. DMAE Tips For optimum health, beauty, and weight-loss benefits, I recommend eating fish rich in DMAE, taking DMAE supplements, as well as applying a topical lotion containing DMAE to face, neck, and body. It is thought that DMAE can make epilepsy and bipolar depression worse; thus, it is advised that those with these health problems avoid DMAE. DMAE can also be over-stimulating for some people, perhaps causing muscle tension or insomnia, so individuals experiencing such difficulties are advised to discontinue use of DMAE. Take with meals for optimum effect. DOSAGE RECOMMENDATION: My recommended dose is 50 to 100 mg per day. For certain therapeutic uses, such as lowering cholesterol, larger doses may be recommended. As always, consult your physician. EAT FIBER TO FIGHT FAT •For maximum fiber, eat lots of raw fresh fruits and vegetables. Adding fiber to the diet helps regulate blood sugar levels, which is important in avoiding diabetes, metabolic disorders, and unwanted weight gain. Eat the skins of your fruits and vegetables if they are organic and unwaxed; the greatest fiber and antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties are in the skin. •The recommended fiber intake per day is 25–30 grams. Do not forget to drink six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water every day—this is vitally important—especially because increased fiber can cause constipation if you don’t drink enough water. •Fiber can help prevent gallstones and kidney stones as well as high cholesterol. Fiber-rich foods slow down the digestive process, preventing a rapid release of glucose (sugar) into the bloodstream. •Fiber can offer protection from certain types of cancer, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and uterine cancer. •Fiber can help prevent heart disease. Soluble fiber, which is found in oats, for example, can exert a positive effect on cholesterol, triglycerides, and other particles in the blood that influence the development of heart disease. The Perricone Weight-Loss Diet is not just about the foods we do or do not eat. It is also about understanding the actions we do in our daily lives that are pro-inflammatory, and learning how to change them. Many have a direct link to obesity and weight gain, as well as accelerated aging, wrinkles, the thinning of skin, the killing of brain cells and shrinking of the brain, and a weakened immune system. PRO-INFLAMMATORY FOODS TO AVOID A simple rule of thumb is to consider the following: if it contains flour and/or sugar or other sweetener, it will be pro-inflammatory. For the most part, avoid the following foods: • Bagels • Baked goods • Breads, rolls • Cake • Candy • Cereals (except old-fashioned oatmeal) • Cheese (except, sparingly, hard cheeses such as Romano and Parmesan, soy, feta, and cheese made with goat or sheep’s milk) • Cookies • Corn bread, corn muffins • Cornstarch • Corn syrup • Crackers (except flaxseed crackers) • Croissants • Egg rolls • Donuts • Fast food • French fries • Fruit juice—eat the fruit instead • Granola • Flour • Fried foods • Honey • Hot dogs • Ice cream, frozen yogurt, Italian ices • Jams, jellies, and preserves • Margarine • Molasses • Muffins • Noodles • Pancakes • Pasta • Pastry • Peanut butter made with hydrogenated oils • Pie • Pita bread • Pizza • Popcorn • Potatoes • Pudding • Relish • Rice • Sherbet • Shortening • Snack foods, including potato chips, pretzels, corn chips, rice and corn cakes • Soda • Sorbets • Tacos • Tortillas • Vegetable oils (other than olive or coconut) • Waffles Foundations of health & wellness Learn more Subscribe to Life Extension Magazine® Subscribe Now Advertise in Life Extension Magazine® Learn More Sign Up for Free Health News For your security, please follow the reCAPTCHA instructions below Top Affiliate Program Become a Reseller Careers Website Map California Privacy Shipping Information Terms of Use GDPR Privacy Notice Cookie Statement Privacy About Us Contact Us FAQs Blog Website & Technology Accessibility Statement California Privacy Contact Form Life Extension does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Learn how this dangerous sweetener, so ubiquitous in the Western diet, can create health problems throughout your body. Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on January 2021. Written By Dana Flavin, MS, MD, PHD. Americans are being poisoned by a common additive present in a wide array of processed foods like soft drinks and salad dressings, commercially made cakes and cookies, and breakfast cereals and brand-name breads. This commonplace additive silently increases our risk of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. The name of this toxic additive is high-fructose corn syrup. It is so ubiquitous in processed foods and so over-consumed by the average American that many experts believe our nation faces the prospect of an epidemic of metabolic disease in the future, related in significant degree to excess consumption of high-fructose corn syrup. The food industry has long known that “a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down in the most delightful way.” And cane sugar had been America’s most delightful sweetener of choice, that is, until the 1970s, when the much less expensive corn-derived sweeteners like maltodextrin and high-fructose corn syrup were developed. While regular table sugar (sucrose) is 50% fructose and 50% glucose, high-fructose corn syrup can contain up to 80% fructose and 20% glucose, almost twice the fructose of common table sugar. Both table sugar and high-fructose sweetener contain four calories per gram, so calories alone are not the key problem with high-fructose corn syrup. Rather, metabolism of excess amounts of fructose is the major concern. The alarming rise in diseases1,2 related to poor lifestyle habits has been mirrored by an equally dramatic increase in fructose consumption, particularly in the form of the corn-derived sweetener, high-fructose corn syrup.3-12 In this article, we’ll examine the evidence for these associations, and we’ll attempt to determine if high-fructose corn syrup is a benign food additive, as the sweetener industry has lobbied us (and the FDA) to believe, or a dangerously overlooked threat to public health. Rising Concern While cardiovascular disease remains the number one killer in America,1 scientists have noted that “we are experiencing an epidemic of [heart and kidney] disease characterized by increasing rates of obesity, hypertension, the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and kidney disease.”2 Add to this list a disturbing rise in new cases of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and you have a public health crisis of enormous proportions. With a growing sense of urgency, scientists are examining the relationship between consumption of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and numerous adverse medical conditions. And they’re coming away with a sour taste in the mouth. Emerging research shows that excessive dietary fructose, largely from consumption of HFCS, represents “an important, but not well-appreciated dietary change,” which has “…rapidly become an important causative factor in the development of the metabolic syndrome,”9 a conglomeration of risk factors that greatly elevates the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Other research suggests that high dietary fructose consumption contributes to obesity and insulin resistance,5,7 encourages kidney stone formation,13 promotes gout,14-17 and is contributing to an upsurge in cases of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.4,18,19 Furthermore, high dietary fructose consumption is associated with increased production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are linked with the complications of diabetes and with the aging process itself.2,5,7 Stealthy Insertion Into the Food Chain With little fanfare, and even less scrutiny, HFCS was introduced into the food supply decades ago. It is now commonly found in an astounding array of popular food and beverage products. Sweetened, carbonated soft drinks are considered by many to be the worst offenders.4,7 Food manufacturers embraced HFCS wholeheartedly because it is substantially cheaper than sucrose (table sugar) and mixes well with a variety of products, including beverages, baked goods, jams and jellies, candies, and dairy products. In fact, between 1970 and 1990, the annual intake of HFCS increased by more than 1,000%, greatly exceeding the change in intake of any other food or food group. High-fructose corn syrup is now the primary caloric sweetener added to soft drinks in the United States, and comprises more than 40% of caloric sweeteners added to foods and beverages.20,21 While it is derived from a natural source, HFCS is essentially an unnatural product, in the sense that for most of human history we consumed no more than about 15 grams of fructose per day (approximately one-half ounce), mostly from fruits and vegetables. In contrast, daily consumption in 1997 was estimated to have increased to 81 grams (nearly three ounces) per day.7 For the first time in history, humans are consuming fructose at extraordinarily high levels. The Dangers of Fructose High dietary intake of fructose is problematic because fructose is metabolized differently from glucose. Like fructose, glucose is a simple sugar. Derived from the breakdown of carbohydrates, glucose is a primary source of ready energy. Sucrose (table sugar) comprises one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose. Thus, excessive sucrose intake also contributes to the rise in overall daily fructose consumption. Glucose can be metabolized and converted to ATP, which is readily “burned” for energy by the cells’ mitochondria. Alternatively, glucose can be stored in the liver as a carbohydrate for later conversion to energy. Fructose, on the other hand, is more rapidly metabolized in the liver, flooding metabolic pathways and leading to increased triglyceride synthesis and fat storage in the liver. This can cause a rise in serum triglycerides, promoting an atherogenic lipid profile and elevating cardiovascular risk. Increased fat storage in the liver may lead to an increased incidence in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and this is one of several links between HFCS consumption and obesity as well as the metabolic syndrome.7 Fructose may have less impact on appetite than glucose, so processed foods rich in fructose can contribute to weight gain, obesity, and its related consequences by failing to manage appetite.20 Additionally, loading of the liver with large amounts of fructose leads to increased uric acid formation, which may contribute to gout in susceptible individuals.7 What You Need to Know: Health-Damaging Effects of Excess Dietary Fructose Dietary intake of fructose, particularly in the form of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), has dramatically increased in the US in recent decades. Increased HFCS consumption has paralleled increasing rates of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and other conditions associated with poor lifestyle habits. High-fructose corn syrup is found in sweetened carbonated soft drinks as well as in many packaged foods such as cakes, cookies, jams, jellies, and crackers. Excess fructose intake has been associated with adverse health effects such as metabolic syndrome, elevated triglyceride levels, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, excess uric acid levels (associated with gout), and elevated levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs; linked with aging and complications of diabetes). Minimizing intake of dietary fructose is essential to mitigating its potentially dangerous effects. Sources of dietary fructose include HFCS, fruit juices, honey, and table sugar (sucrose; comprising fructose and glucose). Targeted nutritional strategies can help avert some of the damaging effects of excess fructose intake. Beneficial nutrients include benfotiamine, alpha-lipoic acid, carnosine, pyridoxamine, acetyl-L-carnitine, vitamin C, and fish oil. Fructose Linked With Insulin Resistance and Diabetes The high flux of fructose to the liver, the main organ capable of metabolizing this simple carbohydrate, disturbs glucose metabolism and uptake pathways and leads to metabolic disturbances that underlie the induction of insulin resistance,9 a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. In fact, the effect of HFCS on insulin resistance has been shown to have an impact on the prevalence of diabetes. In 2004, investigators conducted an ecological correlation study, in which they compared the relationship between food consumption of refined carbohydrates and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the US from 1909 to 1997. They found that during this period, the use of corn syrup sweeteners, which were almost non-existent at the turn of the century, increased by more than 2,100%. During the same period, the prevalence of diabetes skyrocketed. After controlling for total energy intake from other foods such as fats and proteins, only the increase in corn syrup and a decrease in fiber intake correlated positively with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes.22 Scientists have therefore come to realize that all sugars are not created equal, which has been borne out in a number of studies. In one study, investigators looked at whether reduction in insulin sensitivity was caused by glucose or fructose components of the diet. They took two groups of young healthy men and fed one group a high-glucose diet, while the other received a diet high in fructose. At the end of one week, high-fructose feeding was accompanied by a significant reduction in insulin sensitivity and insulin binding, whereas no significant changes were seen in the high-glucose group.23 Another study found that diets containing a moderate amount of fructose produced undesirable changes in glucose metabolism in both normal and hyper-insulinemic men.24 Strategies to Prevent or Minimize Dangers of Excess Dietary Fructose Today, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has become nearly ubiquitous in the food supply. The sticky stuff features prominently in everything from packaged cereals and convenience drinks to ketchup and baked goods. Sugary soft drinks are thought to be the single largest source of this fructose-rich sweetener. The best way to avoid the dangers of excess dietary fructose is to avoid foods with added sugars as well as processed or pre-packaged foods and undiluted fruit juices. Instead, focus on a heart-healthy diet—such as the Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes whole grains, fresh vegetables, low-fat dairy, fresh fish, and limited meat. Other tips to protect yourself against the danger of excess fructose include: Avoid all sweetened soft drinks. Consider switching to an alternative, such as sparkling water, herbal tea, or green tea (stick to home-brewed teas, since most commercially available bottled tea is brimming with HFCS). Read product labels carefully. Avoid any products containing “high-fructose corn syrup” or fructose. Fruit juices—even unsweetened juices—contain fructose and should not be consumed in excess. Fruit juice diluted with sparkling water is delicious and contains less fructose than undiluted juice. Find ways to cut your overall intake of table sugar. Sucrose consists of one molecule of glucose and one of fructose. Thus, sucrose consumption can contribute to unnaturally high fructose levels.7 Furthermore, research suggests that sucrose may have similar adverse metabolic effects as fructose, thus contributing to obesity and metabolic syndrome.49 Try using the natural non-caloric sweetener stevia extract in your coffee, tea, or homemade desserts. Consider writing a letter to the manufacturers of your favorite products; ask them to market alternatives to HFCS-sweetened products. If enough people vote with their pocketbooks, manufacturers may eventually respond with more healthful products. Consider taking supplements that may prevent or ameliorate the damage associated with elevated blood sugar. Fructose-Induced Hypertension Very few people realize that excess fructose intake may contribute to hypertension.25 High blood pressure is a well-known comorbidity associated with obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia.12 Hypertension is part of a cluster of dangerous disorders called the metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by insulin resistance and is a key factor in the development of many vascular diseases. Excess fructose contributes to hypertension by inhibiting a key enzyme called endothelial nitric oxide synthase,26 which is located in blood vessels walls and is essential for the production of the vasodilator, nitric oxide. By allowing healthy blood vessels to relax and ensuring smooth blood flow in vessels, nitric oxide is absolutely necessary for preventing hypertension, coronary artery disease, and erectile dysfunction. Atherogenic Lipid Profiles and Coronary Artery Disease Unlike glucose, fructose is readily converted to fat by the liver, leading to an excessive concentration of fats and lipoproteins in the body.9 High and prolonged fructose ingestion increases unfavorable lipid profiles in the body. By increasing triglyceride levels12,27—an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease—fructose promotes potentially dangerous lipoprotein changes that increase atherogenic risk. For example, fructose increases apoB100—the primary lipoprotein responsible for carrying cholesterol to the tissues—which leads to the formation of fatty deposits. Conversely, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is responsible for carrying cholesterol particles back to the liver to be eliminated, is decreased by fructose.28 Fructose ingestion therefore contributes to fat deposits in the liver (fatty liver)7 and increases the amount of dangerous lipoproteins that enhance cholesterol deposits in blood vessels walls.29 This can lead to plaque buildup and narrowing of the blood vessels—a ticking time bomb for the development of both stroke and heart attack. Potential Consequences of Excess Dietary Fructose Consumption Accelerated aging Insulin resistance Type 2 diabetes Diabetic complications – Retinopathy (may lead to blindness) – Nephropathy (may lead to severe kidney disease, requiring chronic dialysis) – Neuropathy (may involve numbness, pain, impotence, speech impairment, loss of bladder control, etc.) Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Abnormally high blood uric acid levels (hyperuricemia; may result in the development of gout; implicated in the development of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome) Abnormally high triglyceride levels (hypertriglyceridemia; implicated in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease).5,7,15 Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Once a relatively rare clinical oddity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is now estimated to affect 20-30% of adult populations in developed countries.19 Like obesity and diabetes, the rise in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease cases has paralleled the rise in consumption of dietary fructose.4 For example, a recent study by scientists at the University of Florida, Gainesville, determined that fructose consumption in patients with established non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was about two to three-fold higher than among normal control subjects.4 As its name suggests, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a constellation of conditions affecting the liver, characterized by excessive accumulation of fat in the organ, and unrelated to alcoholism. It is associated with higher rates of death from liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and liver cancer, and with cardiovascular disease.30-32 It is intimately linked to insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome, and often progresses to an inflammatory condition known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.33 The AGE Connection The adverse effects of excess dietary fructose are not limited to detrimental effects on blood sugar meta-bolism, lipid profiles, or liver health. Excess fructose also encourages the formation of toxic advanced glycation end products (AGEs). These are aberrant hybrid proteins, formed when sugars and lipids react with these molecules, altering their structures and damaging their functionality. As AGEs accumulate they encourage inflammation and oxidative stress. They have also been linked to accelerated aging. Advanced glycation end products are believed to play a key role in the development of hypertension as well as complications associated with type 2 diabetes like neuropathy and retinopathy.5,7,34-37 Neuropathy afflicts the nerves and can cause tingling, prickling sensations, numbness, and pain, while retinopathy damages the eye’s retina and may lead to blindness. In terms of the reactions that lead to the development of AGEs, fructose is far more reactive than glucose, so even a small amount of fructose circulating in the bloodstream is potentially damaging. In the laboratory, it has been shown that the rate of fructose/protein cross-linking is 10 times greater than the linkage rate associated with glucose.38 This suggests that excess dietary fructose is intimately linked to accelerated aging, as this type of protein cross-linking is a common manifestation of aging.7,39-41 These aging-accelerating effects of dietary sugars were investigated in lab rats fed diets featuring sucrose, glucose, or fructose. Three measures of aging, including the cross-linking of collagen (a protein that provides structure and support for the skin and other tissues), were each significantly greater in rats that were fed fructose than rats that consumed glucose or sucrose. “The data suggest that long-term fructose consumption induces adverse effects on aging,” concluded researchers.42 Advanced glycation end products are also known to induce acute endothelial dysfunction.43 Endothelial dysfunction is implicated in the development of atherosclerosis, and thus cardiovascular disease.44 Scientists also believe that AGEs may contribute to the development and progression of chronic heart failure by inducing vascular and myocardial stiffening.45 Supplements that May Protect Against Fructose-Induced Damage Excessive intake of dietary fructose from sources such as high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) may contribute to myriad adverse health effects ranging from metabolic syndrome to kidney stones to the complications of diabetes. In addition to limiting exposure to dietary fructose, nutritional supplements may offer important protection against these harmful effects. Protect against Advanced Glycation End Products. Fructose promotes the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are clearly linked to some of the worst side effects of diabetes.5,50 Advanced glycation end products are also linked to accelerated aging, even among the healthy.7,39,40 Benfotiamine: This highly bioavailable vitamin B1 analog has been shown to prevent some of the damage associated with diabetes-related high blood sugar levels. Benfotiamine blocks three of the “major molecular pathways” by which hyperglycemia damages cells.51 A recent study of patients with type 1 diabetes confirmed that benfotiamine, in combination with supplemental alpha-lipoic acid, “…completely normalized increased AGE formation…” associated with diabetic complications. Benfotiamine also corrected endothelial cell deficits associated with high blood glucose levels.52 Benfotiamine similarly shows promise against the adverse effects of type 2 diabetes.5 Benfotiamine also acts as an antioxidant. According to new research published by German scientists, “benfotiamine shows a direct antioxidant action. This effect of benfotiamine may be involved in the improvement of diabetic late complications, including peripheral neuropathy.”54 Alpha-lipoic acid: Recommended to preventglycation and reduce the accumulation of AGEs as well as enhance glucose utilization.55 Alpha-lipoic acid may decrease the development or improve the symptoms of neuropathy in diabetic patients.56 Alpha-lipoic acid offers powerful antioxidant effects in both aqueous and lipid environments. Only lipid-soluble antioxidants readily enter cells’ organellesto prevent damage from free radicals. Alpha-lipoic acid is a mitochondrial metabolite; it is particularly effective at protecting these vulnerable cellular “powerhouses” from oxidative damage.57-61 Carnosine: This dipeptide acts as an anti-glycating agent that inhibits AGE formation as well as protein glycation, oxidation, and cross-linking associated with aging and its associated pathologies. Animal studies suggest that carnosine suppresses the complications of diabetes.62-65 Late research suggests that carnosine may prevent diabetes-associated atherosclerosis.66 Pyridoxamine: Harvard-based researchers recently showed that pyridoxamine, an advanced formulation of vitamin B6, acts as a “broad inhibitor” of advanced glycation to benefit patients with diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease).67,68 Fight the Metabolic Syndrome. Excessive fructose intake is intimately linked with metabolic syndrome and its components such as elevated triglycerides, high blood pressure, and increased cardiovascular risk. Supplement regularly with omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil). Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are omega-3 fatty acids, found primarily in fish oil, which have been shown to decrease inflammation, improve the lipid profile, reduce insulin resistance, and improve cardiovascular health.69-73 Alpha-lipoic acid: Ameliorates several components of the metabolic syndrome in animal studies, including insulin resistance, atherogenic lipid profiles, and high blood pressure.74 Acetyl-L-carnitine: In combination with alpha-lipoic acid (also a mitochondrial antioxidant), acetyl-L-carnitine has been shown to improve blood pressure in patients with coronary artery disease.75 Reduce the Risk of Elevated Uric Acid Blood Level. High dietary intake of fructose—particularly in the form of HFCS—is associated with elevated blood levels of uric acid, which are linked with gout. Supplemental vitamin C: A recent study of more than 1,300 men showed that a greater intake of vitamin C decreases the risk of abnormally high blood levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia).76 Hyperuricemia is strongly linked to the risk of developing gout. Intakes of 500 mg vitamin C per day or more were associated with correspondingly low levels of uric acid in the bloodstream.76 Uric Acid Elevation, Gout, and Kidney Stones A recent study by Canadian researchers clearly shows that drinking high-fructose sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with elevated blood levels of uric acid. Known as hyperuricemia, this condition is incontrovertibly linked to elevated risk of suffering from the painful joint disease, gout. Researchers drew their conclusions based on data gathered from nearly 15,000 adult Americans who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994). “Serum uric acid levels increased with increasing sugar-sweetened soft drink intake,” wrote the scientists. Tellingly, drinking diet soft drinks, which do not contain HFCS, was not associated with elevated uric acid levels.15 “Fructose-induced hyperuricemia might have a causal role in metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and other chronic disease,” noted Harvard-based scientists in 2007.46 In 2008, Canadian researchers narrowed the focus of their previous inquiries, examining the relationship between soft drinks, fructose consumption, and the risk of gout in men. In this study, more than 46,000 men with no history of gout were followed for a dozen years. Writing in the influential British Medical Journal, they concluded: “Prospective data suggest that consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks and fructose is strongly associated with an increased risk of gout in men.”17 In a recent study, researchers at Harvard Medical School analyzed data gathered from literally hundreds of thousands of subjects, comparing fructose intake with risk of developing kidney stones. While “non-fructose carbohydrates” were not associated with increased risk, the relative risks of kidney stones “significantly increased” for subjects with the highest intake of dietary fructose, compared with subjects who had the lowest intake. It should be noted that sucrose (table sugar) acts as a source of dietary fructose, as it comprises fructose and glucose. “Our study suggests that fructose intake is independently associated with an increased risk of incident kidney stones,” researchers concluded.13 This information is so new few scientists have had time to even attempt to replicate it. But the enormous sample size of the study, and the prestige of its authors, lends credence to the results. Abnormally elevated levels of blood uric acid have been cited as one potential mechanism by which HFCS precipitates the undesirable metabolic changes leading to conditions such as the metabolic syndrome.47,48 It is likely that this fructose-driven increase in serum uric acid also plays a role in the increased risk of kidney stones. The ability of fructose to induce an increase in uric acid may be a major mechanism by which fructose can cause cardiorenal (heart and kidney) disease. Conclusion High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) quietly and grimly entered the food supply decades ago. Today HFCS is ubiquitous in a wide variety of foods, including pasta sauces and salad dressings. High-fructose corn syrup has been linked to an increased risk of a broad range of metabolic diseases and conditions. Fructose is preferentially stored in the liver as fat, and is associated with abnormal spikes in blood levels of uric acid. High levels of fructose consumption are also associated with the development of AGEs, which, in turn, are linked to accelerated aging and some of the worst side effects associated with type 2 diabetes. Despite assurances of safety by the corn sweetener industry, prudent health-conscious consumers would do well to decrease their intake of sweeteners containing HFCS. The nutritional content of HFCS offers “empty calories” - calorie-dense, with no micronutrient (e.g. vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients) value. Because sucrose (table sugar) is half fructose, intake of this sweetener should also be limited whenever possible. The best way to reduce your intake of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is to read the label of food products before you purchase them. One can slash their dietary intake of HFCS by avoiding foods that contain it and other added sugars such as sucrose.
