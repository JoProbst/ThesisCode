Everyone wants a cure for diabetes. Or do they? Some people think so much money is made from that nobody in power really wants to “cure” it. Is there any truth to this? Could there be a cure? I’m not sure it’s possible to find a cure for something without knowing what causes it or how it works. At least in the case of Type 1, we have a general idea. The immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells and destroys them. For this reason, Type 1 is called an “autoimmune” disease, although nobody seems to know exactly . We don’t know why beta cells come under attack, but environmental exposure to something — a food, a virus, a chemical — seems to set the process off. According to (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation), to cure Type 1, we would have to turn off the immune system attack, or somehow protect beta cells from the immune system. Then we would need to find a way to restore new, functioning beta cells. These cells could perhaps be grown from other remaining healthy cells in the pancreas, or they could be manufactured in a lab or obtained from another animal and put into the body. If this all sounds extremely difficult, it is. Until now, no autoimmune disease has been cured. But perhaps it is possible. University of Colorado researchers say they have . They created a peptide that stops the immune system’s T-cells from attacking the beta cells. One researcher, Dr. David Wagner, said the effect could be huge, if it works in humans. The drug is effective at both preventing the mice from developing diabetes as well as reversing the effects of diabetes in mice that already have the condition. These effects “last for as long as we administer the drug,” Wagner noted. JDRF is certainly looking for a Type 1 cure. They fund research on protecting the pancreas and also research on Type 1 prevention, which they call “the most cost-effective cure.” They have a sophisticated fundraising program. Unfortunately, Type 2 is more complicated and less well understood. As with Type 1, the causes are probably genetic and environmental, but we don’t know exactly what they are. The process of Type 2 is also poorly understood. There can be problems in the pancreas, the liver, or the intestines. Besides insulin defects, there may also be problems with , which tells the liver to pump glucose into the blood. Glucagon problems one of the issues the drug is supposed to control, but it doesn’t always work. Other hormones including amylin, ghrelin, leptin, and incretins and can go wrong. Glands that are supposed to tell the pancreas to produce insulin may not be working. Muscle cells may stop producing proteins needed for insulin to get glucose into cells. With all these possible targets for treatment, it’s not surprising that drug companies are pursuing Type 2 with all they’ve got. In 2010, in the US alone, according to the National Diabetes Information Clearing House (NDIC). Roughly 95% of them had Type 2, so Type 2 drugs have a huge potential market. New drugs and whole new categories of diabetes drugs are developed all the time. The drugs seem to remedy the intestines’ failure to signal the pancreas to produce insulin. Metformin and others try to keep the liver and glucagon under control. and tell the pancreas to produce more insulin. Others like the work on the muscles and other cells to get them to cooperate with insulin and take in more glucose. And there are other categories of glucose-lowering drugs, over ten in all. People with Type 2 often have problems with lipids (fats) and blood pressure as well, so there are a dozen ways to “treat” or “control” Type 2 with drugs, but none of them come close to a cure. The cost of these drugs is over $14 billion a year in the US, and rising. In America, we have been raised to think there is a pharmacological cure for everything. But because Type 2 diabetes is so complex, damaging so many body processes, I think it’s highly unlikely such a medical cure will ever be found. If there is such a medicine, it would most likely cause other problems that could be even worse. That doesn’t mean there’s no possible cure; just that it won’t be a drug. I in June about the thousands of people who have “reversed” their Type 2, getting off all medicines, mostly with self-management measures. We have read that and often seem to cure Type 2 in a matter of days or weeks, at least temporarily. Unfortunately, the research looking for cures or treatments is contaminated by the larger goal of making money. Surgeons profit from bariatric surgery, drug companies from drugs, equipment makers from needles and glucose strips, but nobody except people with diabetes profits from effective self-management. And we don’t have a lot of money to fund studies or research better methods. What do you think? Is there a cure? Why aren’t more people looking?

08c707de-23a6-4354-ad9c-a8a1f817b4a1,"Type 2 diabetes, the most common type of this disease, has no known cure. There are specific risk factors for the disease, including genetics, race, age and obesity, although the specific cause remains unknown. The disease, characterized by the body’s inability to effectively utilize insulin, is treatable and preventable by maintaining the right weight for your height, eating a heart-healthy diet and participating in a steady regimen of physical activity. Research into cures for the disease is ongoing, funded by several organizations including the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. Massachusetts General Hospital is known for having the largest research department of any academic hospital. Led by several top researchers, the department has spent 30 years looking into programs to prevent and to cure the especially complex type 2 diabetes. Although the general concensus among its researchers is that a cure for the disease does not seem likely in the short-term, research continues. Since the insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes eventually destroys the beta cells in the pancreas responsible for insulin production, current research centers around the regeneration and new growth of beta cells. Recent discoveries include a co-activator of Bridge 1, also known as the insulin gene, and new functions of the Hedgehog protein. These discoveries are central to the design of new drug therapies intended to boost insulin production, and in restoring beta cell function in people with diabetes. Dr. Marc Hammerman is leading the research in curing type 2 diabetes at Washington University in St. Louis. Hammerman and his co-researcher, Sharon Rogers, are known experts in the field of organogenesis, a science that focuses on growing new organs from stem cells and embryonic cell clusters. Their research was successful in curing a disease that closely resembles type 2 diabetes in lab rats by transplanting primordial cells that grew into insulin-producing cells without setting off attacks by the animals’ immune systems. One of the keys to the success of their research was using pig pancreatic primordia. They found that when harvested early in the pigs’ development stages, the cells became invisible to the rats’ immune systems. This research continues to show promise, although human trials have not yet been undertaken. Focusing on the problems caused by obesity in many type 2 diabetics, UK researchers Dr. Carel la Roux and Dr. Richard Welbourn used bariatric surgery as the basis for their research into a cure for type 2 diabetes. They performed gastric bypass surgery on 34 type 2 diabetics. Within two years, most patients saw weight loss of up to one-third of their body weight, and 72 percent of the patients saw their diabetes go into full remission. Follow-up research concluded that insulin resistance in the patients had decreased and insulin production overall had increased. It is well-known that there are clear links between obesity and type 2 diabetes, but La Roux’s research showed that obesity alone is not the cause. During the study, most patients’ diabetes began to go into remission well before significant weight loss was seen.

Seriously, what are all of us with diabetes actually complaining about? Today we’re sharing our Top 10 faves: Our furry little friends seem to be getting cured every week. For instance, take this recent example from the University of Toledo where — oh boy! Those very same researchers acknowledge that “there are more than 125 different therapies that cure type 1 diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice… Clinical trials were developed because of that model, but none have worked in humans.” Right. OK, so a substance called FAHFA (fatty acid hydroxyl acid) helps cells secrete insulin. But really, ? Did you have to put the ‘C word’ in the headline? And what’s with the fat mouse photo? Yup, this is one of with CURE in ALL CAPS. This one states that “a probiotic pill… could spell the end for diabetes agony.” Thank you, British tabloid. The pill, btw, is Lactobacillus, something used to prevent and treat diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Now wouldn’t that be a novel source of the CURE? This one’s an especially big tease: All you need is to restore blood sugar levels to a healthy range for two days. How exactly is that a cure? The article says, “scientists believe this could lead to a new generation of safer, more effective diabetes drugs.” Which of course is not a cure at all, but just more drugs… We hear this all over the place – just eat a raw food diet, and lose the diabetes. But this guy Gabriel Cousins had the audacity to write a book about it, with the title “” Eyes. Rolling. Back. In. Head. The description says, “this book introduces and proposes a raw food diet to control diabetes.” And since when is “control” equivalent to “cure”? We know you want to sell books, but seriously, pull your head out, Cousins. It’s that everything nice spice that of course would have eliminated diabetes by now if it could have. But some continue to And of course, cinnamon must cure diabetes. After, all . Seriously, People. If you just ate better, exercised harder, and were more “compliant,” you could reverse your diabetes in… a matter of weeks. What is wrong with you People? What are you whining about? Or if that’s all too hard, you could get . Yeah, kiss my… adherence. These are especially fun to discuss with well-meaning relatives who send you the articles, right? “No, Aunt Rose, that probably isn’t going to help me any time soon.” It’s good to know there are “amazing treatments” accompanied by long-winded videos that have actually been used by enthusiastic, marathon-running patients. It’s also good to know that this all-natural “” comes with a 60-day money back guarantee, which makes it completely risk free! But beware (and I quote): “The Diabetes Miracle Cure comes in a digital format only, which is probably its only downside. However even this downside has its positives, because anyone who buys the program will get an access to it immediately after the purchase and does not have to wait for days or weeks, until the program arrives by regular mail. Not to mention, that there is also no need to pay anything extra for shipping.” Oh yay! Last not least – – you can just drink water to cure your diabetes. Seriously, there is a whole out there. The tragedy, according to this movement? “Not recognizing adult-onset diabetes as a complication of dehydration.” Funny, I’ve been guzzling loads of water every day since my diagnosis, and nothing cure-ish yet. Guess I’m not doing it right. Maybe I DO need to purchase those Water RX audiotapes containing the 10-hour educational program. Or… NOT! Anyway, with all these cures out there, who needs treatments?!

ffa5a018-effd-4478-9320-63bbd0a43e4d,"Just a Little Weight Loss Can Put Diabetes Into Remission FRIDAY, Oct. 4, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- British researchers have good news for people with type 2 diabetes -- you don't need to lose a ton of weight to make a difference in your health. In fact, they found that losing just 10% of your body weight during the first five years you have the disease can lead to remission of type 2 diabetes. That weight loss would be 18 pounds for someone who weighs 180 pounds. It doesn't matter what diet helps you lose the weight. And it doesn't matter how slow or how quickly those pounds come off, the investigators found. ""Even small amounts of weight loss can help you achieve remission. Extreme dieting and exercising are not necessary,"" said study author Dr. Hajira Dambha-Miller, a general practice physician and clinical lecturer at the University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, in the United Kingdom. ""Type 2 diabetes should no longer be seen as a lifelong disease,"" she added. The disease can essentially be cured if you lose weight and keep it off, according to Dambha-Miller. The researchers said that type 2 diabetes affects 400 million people around the world. It's typically considered a chronic, progressive disease. But significant weight loss through extreme dieting (less than 700 calories a day) can bring about remission in almost 90% of people with type 2 diabetes, the study authors noted. Weight-loss surgery also tends to bring on remission. Intensive exercise coupled with a modest weight loss of 7% or less of body weight brought on remission in almost 12% of people in one study, according to the new report. But maybe bringing on remission didn't need to be so hard, the researchers surmised. ""The existing evidence for achieving remission suggests extreme levels of exercise and rather restrictive diets. This is simply not realistic or achievable for my patients, especially in the longer term,"" Dambha-Miller said. ""It is also demotivating for my patients when they are unable to achieve large amounts of weight loss. Accordingly, we decided to look at modest weight loss over a longer period in a real-world population without any crazy diet or exercise requirements,"" she explained. For the new study, the researchers followed the health of almost 900 people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for five years. The study participants, aged 40 to 69, provided information on weight, activity levels, diet and alcohol consumption. Thirty percent of the group had achieved type 2 diabetes remission at the five-year follow-up. Those who had achieved a 10% weight loss were 77% more likely to be in remission after five years, the findings showed. There was no specific intervention in the study. ""This means there were no mandatory exercise or dietary requirements. All our participants did different things and still managed to lose weight and beat diabetes into remission,"" Dambha-Miller said. She said that experts don't know exactly how losing weight helps, but they hypothesize that as people lose weight, the beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin start to work again. That means the body can properly use sugar from foods instead of letting it build up in the blood. Dr. Berhane Seyoum, chief of endocrinology at Detroit Medical Center and Wayne State University in Michigan, wasn't involved in the current research, but said the findings are encouraging. ""People with type 2 diabetes can be encouraged to lose weight, and it doesn't matter how. They can do whatever is convenient for them. Controlling diabetes keeps you healthy, gives you more energy and makes you feel better,"" he said. Seyoum also noted that any amount of weight loss can help the body use insulin better and will help with diabetes management. The study was published online recently in the journal .

The Intersection of Diabetes Research and Politics The Intersection of Diabetes Research and Politics I was diagnosed with diabetes when I was 15. I always figured that by now, it would have effectively been cured — not necessarily meaning science would have found a way to reverse the condition and restore the body to complete self-sufficiency, but I assumed that by now management would mean something along the lines of a once-a-month shot that would then be self-regulating. I know that might sound naive, but that assumption was based at least in part on the research I was reading then. It seems to me that in mice was basically cured in 1998! Study after study showed unbelievably promising results or flat-out cures that never seemed to actually lead to real-life results for those of us living with diabetes. And yet, here we are. The closest we have to a cure are pump/CGM combinations that are starting to run artificial pancreas algorithms. And that’s a big step, but far short of perfect. I am one of those lucky folks who seem to have a lot of trouble with a pump — when I tried one, absorption proved terribly inconsistent, infusion sites started to hurt more and more, and my skin reacted to the adhesive IV dressings I would have to put over the cannula sites since the adhesive on the actual cannula often failed to hold for a full two days. I went back onto multiple daily injections and haven’t looked back. I continue to read promising studies using nanotechnology, genetically engineered implantable insulin producing cells, and so on, but as before, it all seems to be forever trapped in that stage of “promising new research” that can’t seem to make that leap into the category that might actually be useful for US. It’s a frustrating cycle to be caught up in. And in the midst of it all, I have some real concerns for the future of diabetes research as the political winds seem to be shifting. Massive cuts are coming in whatever budget this Congress passes. They may not be as drastic as the initial offering, but there will be cuts. And diabetes funding will almost certainly be among them. Research will still be funded, and I don’t think all government funding will dry up, but it’s going to shrink. And that puts us in a tenuous situation. You see, when the funding has to shift to private companies, it can do two things, neither of which are good. First, it can very easily lead to higher prices for drugs — and insulin is ALREADY skyrocketing. With a combination of deregulation AND less public funding, those prices could become truly outrageous. Second, when the funding is private, the outcomes need to generate the revenue to make up for that upfront expenditure. And it’s very easy to see a scenario where companies begin prioritizing research that leads to costly (and continuous) treatments, while deemphasizing treatment options that are one-time, or only once every few months. Let’s face it, as treatment becomes more self-regulating, it becomes cheaper. It seems to me that we are creating a situation where discovering a cure will be harder. If we take money away from public institutions and ask private companies to lead the way, that cure may be even further off in the horizon. Because public institutions, while not perfect, don’t stand to lose out when a cure is found. But a number of private companies DO. We are talking about taking the money AWAY from those with a natural instinct to find a cure and giving it to those institutions with a nature all instinct to find PROFIT. Here’s what all of this means — we must advocate for ourselves. All of us living with diabetes need to make our voices heard. We need to call our Congress. We need to write them. We need to e-mail them. We need to find those institutions like the American Diabetes Association and inform ourselves on what the budget will mean for diabetes research. We can’t afford to sit on the sidelines here. Whatever your political affiliation, if you care about the future of diabetes research, it’s time to stand up and be heard. The future will be what we allow it to be, folks. Let’s not just watch from the sidelines. Want to learn more about ongoing diabetes research? Visit our .

I’m glad we take our time testing things before rushing them to market. I’m glad medical advances are thoroughly vetted before being widely adopted and used in the general population. However, when it comes to research on “Type 1 diabetes cures,” it is enough to drive you mad! That is, if you’re one of the people living with Type 1 diabetes. Today I read about a new implantable, artificial pancreas that is actually able to sense insulin levels and put out insulin or glucagon to automatically keep balanced blood sugar. It does this by housing actual islet cells, and houses them in such a way that the immune system does not attack them. That means that immunosuppressive therapy, which can cause all kinds of unwanted side effects and only works for a finite amount of time, is not needed. Basically, it is a viable option for an actual “cure” for Type 1 diabetes. Well, OK, not a cure exactly. But a very far cry from the world we live in today of constant monitoring and manual balancing of blood sugar, counting of carbs, and the whole deal. It represents a life where all one has to do is supply this implanted device with a small amount of oxygen (needed to keep said islet cells alive) once every 24 hours. So still a daily shot, but one is easier than four or five, right? Here’s the thing, though. This is new. And I’ve read about similar new things that sounded very promising and then disappeared. I have always thought that there simply HAS to be a cure someday for this disease. There HAS to be an innovation like this someday that transforms diabetes. And I suppose I still do. But I have to admit, when I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes over 20 years ago, I figured that time would have come by now. We all have an instinct to predict the future. We can’t help it, really. And it makes sense. We kind of have to predict the future to a point. What we do in the present has to take into account probable outcomes. Failing to consider the future at all would lead to all kinds of unfortunate decisions. We don’t have to fantasize about what we HOPE MIGHT happen in the future, of course, but we do that, too. We do that with our jobs, with our partners, with our families. We imagine the future we hope will come true someday. Part of the future that every single one of us Diabetians imagines is one where diabetes is no longer the involved daily maintenance routine that it is now. But imagining a future without diabetes is different than imagining a future where you’ve made partner at work, become a world-famous touring musician, or had 2.5 kids and moved to a house in the suburbs. Diabetes is such an all-pervasive thing, such a constant thing, and such a serious thing. And that makes envisioning the future so agonizing! We’re not just imagining a future with a “nice bonus” we’d like, we’re imagining a future with a That’s what makes teasers like the story I just related so tough. I know testing has to happen. I know it might not work in the end. I know that even if everything goes great, implementation is probably 5–10 years in the future. And I know this is the right way to go about things, but what I wouldn’t GIVE for a time machine on this one! Wouldn’t you? Wouldn’t you give almost anything to hurry up that process and just get that true treatment/cure HERE already? But we don’t have a time machine, do we? We’ve only got the present. And the present still means living with diabetes. It still means checking our blood sugar before each meal, using all available resources to calculate our carbs before we eat, and being conscientious about our stress and activity. It means keeping that “diabetes computer” running all the time in the back of our heads plugged in and running as best we can. Someday, we’ll be able to unplug that sucker. That day isn’t here yet, but we’ll get there…eventually.

a03b6fba-1a0a-489d-b258-3ec1639f8562,"Monday, 5 January 2015 Could the cure for type 1 diabetes lie in the eyes of the beholder? Scientists have discovered the eyes hold a different immune system to the body which could lead to a breakthrough for type 1 diabetes. It has long been known that the immune system of humans does not have the same access to the eye – or the testis, brain and placenta for that matter – as it does to other organs of the body. However, only as of recently have scientists and researchers started looking into the possibility of using this “immune privilege” in their pursuit of a cure for type 1 diabetes. The eye is not only interesting to researchers guided by Per-Olof Berggren PhD, professor in experimental endocrinology at Karolinska Institute in Sweden, because of its potential to act as a shield, but also because it is the only perfectly transparent tissue in the body. So what does all this mean? Essentially, this means that instead of injecting insulin into the body through the bloodstream, people living with type 1 diabetes could transplant pancreatic islet cells into their eyes, protecting the new cells from being attacked by the immune system. The transparency allows scientists to see into the body, observing the integrity and survival of the islets, as well as how the immune system responds during attack. Type 1 diabetes is caused by our immune system destroying beta cells that produce insulin. The program, called , has had some success in mice and baboons, but has also revealed that the eye is not fully ‘privileged.’ While immune invasion in the eye is much lower than in other parts of the body, it still does exist. Diabetes NSW& ACT said that the research was nevertheless full of promise. Key findings are that the eye is attacked with much less aggression than other organs and that we have full view of the body responding. This is fantastic research and could be a real turning point in the plausible cure for type 1 diabetes.

6c36e4c0-f508-4f41-b072-4ae9b2d1d97b,"What's New in Diabetes Cure Research Efforts for 2019 — JDRF is establishing a string of type 1 diabetes cure research “Centers of Excellence” around the country, with the first already launched in Northern California. In the biggest cure-focused acquisition ever, Boston-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals has acquired nearby diabetes stem cell biotech startup Semma Therapeutics. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have discovered mysterious “Hybrid X Cells” that may play a big role in the development of autoimmunity and possibly trigger type 1 diabetes. New research shows that eating too much gluten in the first 18 months of life may also be a trigger to developing T1D. Newsflash, Folks: We aren’t expecting to see a cure for diabetes at any point soon. But there are dedicated researchers out there working non-stop to pave the path, and they’ve made some interesting headway recently. Among the progress is JDRF’s launch of a new model for a cure research center, a bio-startup working on beta cell replacement that was just acquired by a large established Pharma company, and new research results presented at the big EASD (European Association for the Study of Diabetes) conference in Spain last week. That event also produced some key new information about the impact of gluten on type 1 diabetes. Here’s a brief look at these diabetes cure topics making headlines at the moment: JDRF launches first cure-focused ‘Center of Excellence’ The JDRF that it’s opened the first “Center of Excellence” aimed at T1D cure research, and plans to establish more at already-existing university and other research spots around the country and world. The first one is a collaboration between Stanford University and the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), based on their shared work in immune system, beta and stem cell research. Specifically, researchers there will concentrate on “the interaction of immune cells with insulin-producing beta cells; generating islets and immune cells from stem cells for next-generation therapies; and developing ways to transplant insulin-producing cells into people with T1D without requiring immunosuppression.” Since insulin cell transplantation isn’t widely available for a variety of reasons — including organ and cell donation limitations, and immunnosuppresion drugs that must be taken afterward for life — the JDRF Northern California Center of Excellence will try to address those obstacles through continued research in beta cell biology and immunology. The new designation means the JDRF and California researchers will work together to make sure the best people and necessary funding are funneled to this particular center. The same rationale will apply to future centers the JDRF opens and whatever their particular focus is. For its part, the JDRF says this new model will provide these Centers of Excellence with “the stability to drive longer-term projects, as well as the flexibility to be nimble as new science emerges. The innovative funding model promotes collaboration and provides longer-term stability to institutions that have demonstrated excellence in T1D research. Each will be initially funded for five years. Funding beyond year three will be confirmed after a review and evaluation.” The T1D organization also notes that these centers will serve as central pillars of JDRF’s broader strategy on cure research, and they’re sponsored through donor contributions. For this first Northern California center, the JDRF credits these individual donors: Karen and Jeff Jordan, Michelle Griffin and Tom Parker, and Karen and Joe Niehaus. Of course, we’re curious how this will transform JDRF’s cure research and better focus the resources and efforts happening around the U.S. and globally, and what this will mean for scientists and entites already working in these areas. In the past, cure research efforts definitely seemed a bit scattered, with many dots nots effectively connected. Hopefully, this new model will eliminate duplication and help hone in research where it matters most. Also announced at the start of September, made headlines in the arena of diabetes cure research. Boston-based company Vertex Pharmaceuticals, largely focused on cystric fibrosis to date, bought the diabetes stem cell biotech startup in Cambridge, MA, known as . That company was started in 2014 by high-profile researcher and D-Dad Dr. Douglas Melton, who’s been working for over a decade on the creation of new insulin-producing cells. You may remember that Melton made huge news back in 2013 with what was largely hailed as a breakthrough, though a few years later his research was . His startup Semma came about in 2015 and was interestingly one of the first funding projects for JDRF’s venture philanthropy in 2017. Vertex has now shelled out $950 million to tap into the work Semma’s been doing. The JDRF describes this as likely the largest T1D cure-focused transaction to ever occur. Working to create a new supply chain of beta cells from human-derived stem cells, with the aim of transplanting these new cells directly into the liver, where they can produce insulin to naturally regulate BG levels. Creating a device that can be implanted with the new insulin-producing cells housed inside, protecting them from the immune system attack. (Others working on this include , with Sigilon Therapuetics, and the Diabetes Research Institute with its ). Semma’s work remains in early clinical trials involving animals at this time, and there’s certainly no guarantee it will pan out. But it’s a huge potential boost to have a company like Vertex now devoting energy and resources to the effort. Melton says, “Semma was founded to dramatically improve the lives of patients with type 1 diabetes. Vertex is ideally suited to accelerate the achievement of this goal.” “This is a major milestone in our fight to cure type 1 diabetes, in two respects,” says the T1D Fund’s Executive Chairman . “First, a terrific company like Vertex has the resources and expertise to achieve Dr. Melton’s vision, which JDRF shared and supported for many years. Second, we think that investors and industry will take notice of such a substantial value placed on promising type 1 diabetes therapies and look for opportunities to invest in other T1 diabetes efforts in a new, developing market.” Researchers at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore a mysterious group of “previously unknown cells” lurking in the body that may play a big role in the development of autoimmunity and possibly trigger type 1 diabetes. They’ve named this enigmatic new entity “Immune Cell X” because of its ability to morph into two other types of cells. Supposedly, scientists have long believed these hybrid cells could not exist, but if they did, then they were likely just a tiny population along the lines of 7 out of every 10,000 white blood cells. Per Dr. Abdel-Rahim A. Hamad, an associate professor of pathology at Johns Hopkins who co-authored this latest study. For whatever reason, these so-called “rogue cells” get confused and transition into another type that the body deems foreign, and that starts the immune attack that eventually leads to T1D. Not everyone in the research community is convinced of this, though. Because while other environmental and genetic triggers for T1D may also be at play, it’s also possible that the apparent hybrid X cells are actually some of the other “normal” cells and not rogue imposters at all; they may simply serve two functions. What’s clear is that more research is needed on this front, and no doubt that will take time. Whether these hybrid X cells are important or not, presented at the present a way to combat whatever the true T1D-triggering culprit may be at the cellular level. Belgian clincial-stage company is developing immunotherapeutics that might help treat and prevent chronic conditions like T1D, by developing peptides that could be injected or implanted into the body in order to identify and kill off the cells that attack the immune system — as in the case of T1D. Early trial data suggests that Imcyse’s does indeed increase the number of protective cells in the body. These results are now expected to buoy the company’s efforts and help fund a next-phase of research in 2020. One more new study presented at EASD caught our eye — more in the realm of prevention than cure, but important nonetheless. The impact of gluten on T1D has been a long-explored topic. It goes along with cow’s milk and other potential environmental triggers of type 1 diabetes (especially in children). This newest study shows that a child’s intake of gluten at 18 months old led to a whopping 46% increased risk of developing T1D for each extra 10g of gluten consumed per day. However, there was no link between the prospective mother’s intake of gluten during pregnancy and type 1 in her child. This research came from Oslo University Hospital and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in Norway. The study authors note, “Our observations may motivate future interventional studies with reduced gluten intake to establish whether there is a true causal association between amount of gluten intake in the child’s early diet and type 1 diabetes in susceptible individuals.” The researchers suggest it could be based on and inducing inflammation in a so-called fashion. It could also be that gluten sometimes works with other triggers or environmental factors at play — including a virus or genetic predispostion in children — to push a child toward type 1. Interestingly, the study authors specifically say their findings are not enough to push people away from eating gluten, especially cereal and bread that are such common gluten sources. And of course, more research is necessary. The headlines around “diabetes cure” never seem to stop. It’s important to be realistic about the incremental nature of scienfitic discoveries and not inflate false hope. But it’s equally important to know just how much research is underway, and follow the progress being made. So much investment and effort is bound to lead us at least to some effective interventions and ‘‘ in the near future. — I Tried It: Tandem’s New Control-IQ Automated Diabetes Technology DiabetesMine reviews Tandem Diabetes exciting new Control-IQ system that partially automates insulin delivery.

e7eefaea-13ca-45ba-b752-fec4845e9ab0,"Let us take a look at what’s inside the Done with Diabetes program Blood glucose plays a vital role in various bodily functions. However, if the level of glucose in the blood gets too high, it could lead to a condition called diabetes. It is a condition that is common all over the world. As common as it could be, someone should never underestimate this health condition as it claims many lives every year. If the blood sugar level is not managed the right way, it could lead to other medical conditions, especially if you reach the old age.If you have diabetes, you have it for the rest of your life. It cannot be cured but it can be managed. Part of diabetes management includes eating the right foods, avoiding foods that can cause blood sugar spike, living a healthy life, and taking the right supplement (vitamins and minerals). One product that claims to be effective in the management of blood sugar is Done with Diabetes. () Image 1: Done with Diabetes (DWD) is a program that aims to manage and reverse diabetes mellitus type 2. Picture Source: i2.wp.com/healthyusa.co Picture 2: Taking in the right foods and leading a healthy life are just some of the methods stressed in the Done with Diabetes program. Photo Source: asuventurecatalyst.org Done with Diabetes is a program created by Dr. Koprowski that aims to manage diabetes and reverse your condition so that you can live your life to the fullest. Dr. Koprowski’s Done with Diabetes is helpful in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus, pre-diabetes, and other medical conditions that have something to do with diabetes. () He is a medical practitioner and the man behind Done with Diabetes. Being a doctor, he was concerned about how the healthcare industry manages diabetes. They perceive it as something incurable. This has motivated him to do his research and in-depth study on the possible cure for diabetes. His research was successful as he was able to formulate a program that can finally put an end to the suffering of people with diabetes mellitus. () Photo 3: Done with Diabetes addresses not only the blood sugar level but as well as pain and other health conditions secondary to diabetes mellitus type 2. Image Source: howafrica.com Done with Diabetes is not a supplement that you are going to take in your body. It is a program consists of techniques and methods that are tested and proven effective in reversing diabetes and other related health conditions. If you follow the program religiously, the natural insulin production of the body will be increased which could eventually lead to a healthy level of glucose in the blood. () Let us take a look at what’s inside the Done with Diabetes program The content of Done with Diabetes program is divided into several modules. They are presented in a way that even people with no medical background can easily understand. The detailed structure of the module is as follows: It contains the basic facts about diabetes mellitus. It tackles everything you need to know about diabetes mellitus. It helps you understand the different treatment and management modalities for diabetes used by the current healthcare system. It stresses the ineffectiveness of such treatment and management modalities and how it’s keeping you from getting real cure from diabetes. This is where the actual work happens. It comprises of a seven-day plan and that you need to consume foods that have anti-diabetic properties. Diabetes causes pain too. How diabetes pain can be effectively managed will be also discussed in this module. In this phase, you are conditioned to live a life that is free from diabetes. You will also be taught of ways on how to prevent diabetes forever. Aside from stressing the importance of eating the right foods, you will also be given a list of supplements that you can pair with your foods so that you can say goodbye to diabetes forever and prevent it from coming back. () Diabetes is a lifestyle health condition. Once you have it, you can no longer perform the activities you used to do or eat the foods you used to enjoy without being cautious. Managing diabetes can be extremely expensive. More so, if you have come to a point wherein diabetes starts to affect other parts of your health. Diabetes complications are difficult to manage and in most cases, it would cost you not only money but your life too. Done with Diabetes seems like a promising program. If you take a look at the modules, you will notice that what it does is to basically educate you about your condition and make you understand the very nature of it. The powerful point of Done with Diabetes program is the seven-day plan wherein you get to know what foods should you be adding to your diet to keep your blood sugar level within the normal range. The last part of the module will give suggestions as to what type of supplements you can add to your daily food intake. Many diabetic patients are enticed to take supplements that claim to help manage blood sugar level. However, there is really no guarantee that these supplements work. If you would rely on the advertisements from the television, then you can fall a victim of a marketing hype. It is best to have your doctors check the supplement first to find out whether or not it really helps in the management of diabetes. Done with Diabetes is a program that modifies your eating habit and suggests supplements that you can pair with your food. There is really nothing harm in trying this program, after all, everything that is in there is natural. The possibility of side effects is not there. It is either the program work or not. When it comes to all natural approach, there is nothing harm in trying. () Disclaimer: This is an independent review.

Diabetes can go into . When diabetes is in remission, you have no signs or symptoms of it. But your risk of is higher than normal. That's why you make the same daily healthy choices that you do for active type 2 diabetes. There is no known cure for type 2 diabetes. But it can be controlled. And in some cases, it goes into remission. For some people, a diabetes-healthy lifestyle is enough to control their blood sugar levels. That means losing weight if you are overweight, eating healthy foods, and being more active. But most people with type 2 diabetes also need to take one or more medicines or insulin. Of those people who don't need diabetes medicine, some find that their diabetes does ""reverse"" with weight control, diabetes-healthy eating, and exercise. Their bodies are still able to make and use insulin, and their blood sugar levels go back to normal. Their diabetes is in remission. ""Complete remission"" is 1 year or more of normal A1c and fasting glucose levels without using diabetes medicine. When you have complete remission, you still get tested for high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and kidney and eye problems. You do regular foot checks. ""Prolonged remission"" is 5 years or more of normal A1c and blood sugar levels without using diabetes medicine. You might have lab tests less often. But your doctor will still check on any heart, eye, foot, or other health problems you have had from diabetes, even if they are better than before. Remission is in the early stage of diabetes or after a big weight loss. It can also happen after for weight loss, which can trigger healthy changes in the body's insulin system. Remission is in the later stages of diabetes, because the body may slowly lose its ability to make insulin over time. Whether your diabetes is under control or in remission, the keys to keeping high blood sugar down are weight control, exercise, and a diabetes-healthy diet. There's no way to know in advance if your body can ""reverse"" your diabetes. It happens for some people and not for others, despite the same diet, exercise, weight loss, or even bariatric surgery. Experts don't fully understand why. Your goal is to do whatever it takes to keep your blood sugar in your target range. You may go into remission, or you may not. Keep these guidelines in mind. Carbohydrate raises your blood sugar higher and more quickly than any other nutrient. Eat foods with protein, fat, and fiber—they don't raise your blood sugar as much. To help take charge of your diabetes, manage how much and what type of carbohydrate you eat. Spread carbs throughout your day. When you are active, your body uses sugar. You can use activity to help lower your blood sugar and manage your diabetes. Exercise also can help you lose weight and stay at a healthy weight. If you use medicine, you may find you need less of it when you increase your exercise. Over time, exercise helps some people stop using medicine. The A1c test gives you your average blood sugar level over the few months before the test. Generally, A1c is checked at least 2 times a year. Talk with your doctor about how often you should have this test. Some risks related to diabetes, such as heart disease, are still higher than normal even when your blood sugar is controlled. So work closely with your doctor, and go to all of your appointments. Buse JB, et al. (2009). Consensus statement: How do we define cure of diabetes? , 32(11): 2133–2135.

The discovery, made at The University of Texas Health Science Center, now called UT Health San Antonio, increases the types of  that secrete . UT Health San Antonio researchers have a goal to reach human clinical trials in three years, but to do so they must first test the strategy in large-animal studies, which will cost an estimated $5 million. Those studies will precede application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Investigational New Drug (IND) approval, Bruno Doiron, Ph.D., a co-inventor, said. The scientists received a U.S. patent in January, and UT Health San Antonio is spinning out a company to begin commercialization. “It worked perfectly,” Dr. Doiron, assistant professor of medicine at UT Health, said. “We cured mice for one year without any side effects. That’s never been seen. But it’s a mouse model, so caution is needed. We want to bring this to large animals that are closer to humans in physiology of the endocrine system.” Ralph DeFronzo, M.D., professor of medicine and chief of the Division of Diabetes at UT Health, is co-inventor on the patent. He described the therapy: “The pancreas has many other cell types besides , and our approach is to alter these  so that they start to secrete insulin, but only in response to glucose [sugar],” he said. “This is basically just like beta cells.” Insulin, which lowers , is only made by beta cells. In Type 1 diabetes, beta cells are destroyed by the immune system and the person has no insulin. In Type 2 diabetes, beta cells fail and insulin decreases. At the same time in Type 2, the body doesn’t use insulin efficiently. The therapy is accomplished by a technique called gene transfer. A virus is used as a vector, or carrier, to introduce selected genes into the pancreas. These genes become incorporated and cause digestive enzymes and other cell types to make insulin. Gene transfer using a viral vector has been approved nearly 50 times by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration to treat various diseases, Dr. DeFronzo said. It is proven in treating rare childhood diseases, and Good Manufacturing Processes ensure safety. Unlike beta cells, which the body rejects in Type 1 diabetes, the other cell populations of the pancreas co-exist with the body’s immune defenses. “If a Type 1 diabetic has been living with these cells for 30, 40 or 50 years, and all we’re getting them to do is secrete insulin, we expect there to be no adverse immune response,” Dr. DeFronzo said. The therapy precisely regulates blood sugar in mice. This could be a major advance over traditional insulin therapy and some diabetes medications that drop blood sugar too low if not closely monitored. “A major problem we have in the field of Type 1 diabetes is hypoglycemia (low blood sugar),” Dr. Doiron said. “The  we propose is remarkable because the altered cells match the characteristics of beta cells. Insulin is only released in response to glucose.” People don’t have symptoms of  until they have lost at least 80 percent of their beta cells, Dr. Doiron said. “We don’t need to replicate all of the insulin-making function of beta cells,” he said. “Only 20 percent restoration of this capacity is sufficient for a cure of Type 1.” This article was provided by University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.

Now, the group looks poised to double down on its quest for a cure, launching a new JDRF Northern California Center of Excellence with a mission to “accelerate high-impact research” toward that goal. To get cutting-edge diabetes news, strategies for blood glucose management, nutrition tips, healthy recipes, and more delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our free newsletter[3]! Announced in a JDRF press release[4] earlier this month, the new center will help coordinate research projects at Stanford University and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) — two of the leading institutions for medical research in the country. The focus of the center will be “delivering first-generation cures for T1D in areas with the potential for significant breakthroughs,” including the interaction of immune cells with insulin-producing beta cells[5], generating beta cells from stem cells, and techniques to transplant insulin-producing cells without the need for immunosuppression. JDRF hopes that its new concept of Centers of Excellence, involving partnerships with major research institutions, will allow for stable funding of key projects at a time when advances in type 1 diabetes research are accelerating. It also hopes to promote collaboration among the partnering institutions. Each participating institution will initially receive funding for five years, with a review and evaluation after three years to confirm that the partnership is achieving its aims. The new center “will allow my colleagues and me to accelerate our efforts” toward a potential cure, says Matthias Hebrok, PhD, director of the Diabetes Center at UCSF and co-leader of the new center. “We are focused on generating new insights into the complex interactions between the immune system and … the insulin producing beta cells that are destroyed in people with T1D, and on translating these findings into creating novel therapies to improve the lives of patients and their families as soon as possible.” Want to learn more about type 1 diabetes?

People with Type 2 diabetes can reverse their condition with diet and exercise, although remission is not very common, according to a new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After one year of regular counseling sessions to encourage weight loss and physical activity, 11.5 percent of obese adults with Type 2 diabetes saw their condition at least partially reverse — meaning their blood sugar levels decreased to those of a prediabetic, without the need for medication.  Just 2 percent of those who did not receive intensive counseling partially reversed their diabetes. After four years, the rate of partial diabetes remission in the counseling group declined slightly, to 7 percent. Full remission — achieving normal blood sugar levels — was rarer, with just 1.3 percent of people in the counseling group and 0.1 percent in the non-counseling group meeting this goal after one year. Type 2  diabetes has traditionally been seen as a progressive disease that is managed rather than cured. Recent studies have suggested it can be reversed with , or by following an that mimics surgery. However, until this study, little was known about the rate of long-term diabetes reversal without surgery or extreme dieting. About , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study confirms that complete Type 2 diabetes remission is rare, but that partial remission is an obtainable goal for some patients, the researchers said. Experts said that, because the definitions of complete or partial diabetes remission are arbitrary, researchers should not focus on these measures. What's more important is that patients improve their weight and blood sugar levels, as people in this study did, said Dr. Pieter Cohen, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a general internist at Cambridge Health Alliance. ""If the great majority of people are losing weight and their sugars are going down, whether or not we call that a remission…it's great news,"" said Cohen, who was not involved in the study. Although most patients in the study didn't meet the strict criteria for remission, they are moving in the right direction, he said. The study involved about 4,500 obese adults with Type diabetes ages 45 to 76, who were followed for four years. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to complete an intensive lifestyle- change program, which included weekly counseling sessions for six months, and at least twice-monthly sessions for the remainder of the study period. People in this group were given specific and physical activity goals. The rest of the participants were offered just three sessions on diet and physical activity per year, and did not have any goals to meet. People in the counseling group lost 8.6 percent of their weight after one year, compared with just 0.7 percent in the non-counseling group.  After four years, the counseling group lost 4.7 percent of their weight, compared with 0.8 percent in the non-counseling group. Rates of remission were about 15 to 20 percent higher among those who lost substantial weight, improved fitness, had lower blood glucose levels at the study start, or had been diagnosed with diabetes more recently, compared to those who did not meet these criteria. It's important to note that people in the study had been living with Type 2 diabetes for an average of five years before it began. If diabetes is detected early, and interventions started soon thereafter, Cohen said he would expect that more people could be ""cured"" with lifestyle changes. In addition, people who received counseling were provided with meal replacement drinks to help them meet their weight-loss goals. The results might have been better if real fruits and vegetables had been provided, Cohen said. So far, improving through diet and exercise has not been shown to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in people with diabetes. Future studies will examine whether or not lowering blood sugar with lifestyle changes reduces rates of kidney and eye disease, Cohen said.

The Last Few Miles Are the Longest: Waiting for a Diabetes Cure The Last Few Miles Are the Longest: Waiting for a Diabetes Cure You know the old adage — the closer you get to the finish line, the longer the distance feels. Week after week, when I sit down to figure out just what I’m going to write about, I fall into the same pattern: I sit down, I think for a bit, and then I do a Google search for “diabetes research.” And every week I see the same thing — article after article, piece after piece, sharing the news that a potential cure “may have been uncovered,” or may even be “in initial trial phases.” It’s just such a tease! I have been waiting for the day that a diabetes cure “has been found, tested, and shipped to your local doctor’s office” for about 20 years now. I was diagnosed at age 15. I’m 36 now. In my imaginations of the future, I always figured by the time I reached 40, a cure would have been not only found, but implemented. There’s still time for that 40-year deadline, but the gap is closing quick! It does seem that the research is getting more and more promising — that we may be on the cusp of that golden era when a cure finally becomes something more than a distant dream to organize walks in support of. The research is diversifying, and intensifying, and specifying. I’m reading about actual trials, even if they’re merely in lab rats, rather than hypothetical and vague ideas about things that “might work.” And I’m reading more and more of them, with multiple viable avenues being explored by various teams of researchers. But that’s the kicker! As we close in, we all know it’s just going to get more excruciating to wait! Can you imagine what it’s going to be like waiting those last few years, when human trials are underway? When we all KNOW a viable cure (or, at the least, a substantially better, more stable, and less demanding form of ongoing treatment) has BEEN identified, but won’t be available for another few years? Of course, there’s nothing we can do but wait. And waiting… Well, that’s something that we Diabetians know how to do. We know how to sit with something we don’t like, or sit with a situation that’s short of what we would have hoped for. We know how to do it with a fair amount of grace under pressure, too. And that’s kind of what I return to when this whole “we’re-so-close-to-a-real-option-for-a-cure” thing comes up over and over. It’s like one extended high blood sugar spike. Who knows what the next 10 years will bring us. I still have a great deal of hope that by my 40th birthday the landscape will be very different. And I certainly believe that if I ever have children, they will live in a time when diabetes has been put behind us. In the meantime, all we can do is wait, and return to the moment. We can continue to live each day as it comes, meeting that day’s challenges, and learning how to handle tomorrow’s challenges just a little better. Worried about knee pain?

A generic blood pressure medicine healed beta cells, curing diabetes in mice. Scientists are now recruiting for a human study to see if it works in people. It might heal both Type 1 and Type 2. The drug is called . It costs $4 a month at Walmart. It has been used for high blood pressure, migraine headaches, and irregular heartbeats for decades, but it turns out to have a side effect. It lowers levels of a protein called . TXNIP (stands for “thioredoxin interacting protein”) inhibits the antioxidant thioredoxin and suppresses tumors. But too-high levels of the substance in insulin-producing beta cells leads to their destruction. Apparently verapamil lowers the level of TXNIP. According to Medical News Today, “In mice with established diabetes and blood sugars over 300 mg/dl [very high], the disease.” Researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), led by Dr. Anath Shalev, have been working on this research for over ten years. They studied beta cells in test tubes to find what made them die. They eventually found excess TXNIP killed the cells. Then they tried a series of chemicals on the cells to look for one that lowered TXNIP. This is the way science was done in the old days, more driven by results than profit. These days, most researchers would have tried to create a new molecule from scratch to block TXNIP. This would be a fabulously expensive process. Instead, Shalev’s team tested existing molecules to find one that worked. Now, the UAB researchers have received a three-year, $2.1 million grant from to conduct a clinical trial in 2015 in humans. JDRF focuses on Type 1 (formerly called juvenile-onset) diabetes. JDRF sponsorship may be why the study is enrolling only newly diagnosed people with Type 1. But it seems like the treatment might be equally effective or more effective in Type 2. We always hear that Type 2 diabetes is a result of insulin resistance. But people’s blood sugar doesn’t rise to diabetic levels until large numbers of beta cells die off. The UAB research indicates that it may be high glucose levels that lead to high TXNIP levels, which then kill the beta cells and bring on diabetes. If we could bring the , the diabetes would go away. Dr. Shalev told Medscape that, “When we started treating [mice] with verapamil, blood sugars normalized, and this was due to the reappearance and normalization of insulin-producing beta cells.” What causes the high glucose levels in the first place? Shalev’s team thinks that in Type 2, it may be occasional high-sugar or very-high-calorie meals that temporarily raise glucose. These high post-meal readings could be enough to start the TXNIP process in people who are sensitive to it. They’re not sure, but it’s certainly a hopeful line to investigate. I like this therapy because it is simple. More complicated high-tech therapies have been at best partially effective in autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes. We just don’t understand the immune system well enough. In contrast, UAB is looking at a much simpler, downstream place to stop the beta-cell destruction. If it works, it could be more like a cure than a chronic treatment. It probably won’t be a quick cure though. Beta cells will need time to regrow, probably years. Dr. Shalev told Medscape, “We’re not with this study, since we will be treating patients for only one year and we know that for any intervention to [regenerate beta cells] after such a large number of beta cells have died will take a long time.” So there is some new hope for medical treatment for diabetes of all types. The body can heal itself given the right support. Self-management is crucial now and for the foreseeable future, but there may be a cure coming.

38226475-9c84-45a7-ba0a-47d2f9be2493,"— Researchers in Scotland say people with diabetes can reverse their disease by losing weight, but most aren’t aware that this is possible. Being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes can be difficult, especially since the disease is perceived as incurable. But experts say diabetes can be reversed early on. “If you follow the advice of your doctors and nutritionist and make an effort to lose weight, diabetes can be reversed by normalizing your blood sugar levels without medication early in the course of the disease, that is the first three to five years,” Dr. , endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic, told Healthline. Researchers at the University of Glasgow in Scotland agree and want to promote this message. In a recent published in The BMJ, Scottish researchers report that patients and doctors may not be aware that type 2 diabetes can be reversed. They said that weight loss of around 33 pounds often produces total remission of the disease, yet remission is often not coded in medical records. They point to a U.S. study that found remissions in less than 1 percent of 120,000 patients who were tracked for seven years. Similarly, a database that includes all patients in Scotland shows less than 1 percent of type 2 diabetes coded as being in remission. The researchers argue that greater awareness, documentation, and surveillance of remissions would improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Researchers say that the reasons why remission isn’t coded may be due to medical professionals’ disagreement on criteria and guidance as well as the fact that few patients are trying to gain remission or actually achieving remission. Dr. Ashwin Patel, the chief medical officer of InquisitHealth who also sits on the Community Leadership Board of the American Diabetes Association, agrees. “There’s a ‘fixed’ criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes, so it makes diabetes seem like it’s a very clear, binary diagnosis. In that, either you have it or you don’t,” Patel told Healthline. “Importantly, not only is there ongoing debate on what the right criteria should be, there is a growing realization that diabetes, especially type 2, isn’t binary physiologically. It’s much more of a continuum.” Another reason, Kashyap points out, is that even if blood sugars reach normal levels due to weight loss achieved by dieting, exercising, or surgery, they may not stay normal for a long period of time. “Blood sugars can come back into the diabetes range, and so some people feel like this isn’t reversing diabetes, [but rather] silencing the disease,” said Kashyap. “I call this a ‘honeymoon period,’ meaning the blood sugars normalize, there’s no meds needed, and things look great, but we don’t know how long that will last.” She notes that in up to 60 percent of people who have bariatric surgery, their diabetes comes back within 15 years. “I tell people it’s a nice vacation from their disease and we hope it does slow down developing complications from diabetes, such as heart, eye, kidney, and nerve disease,” said Kashyap. The reasons aren’t known, but it may be due to weight gain or genetics. “Part of the reason that the pancreases fails to produce insulin over time is genetic. Also, as you age, your pancreatic function declines. That’s why it’s common to see diabetes in people in their 60s and 70s,” Kashyap explained. Whether or not a person stays in remission from diabetes long term, researchers say that noting their remission is still worth it. “When someone works really hard to lose 15 percent of their body weight, they’ve put a lot of work in. If blood sugar is normalized and they’re not on medications, it can be a big psychological boost to put in their chart that they are in remission,” said Kashyap. “It reinforces the message that if you work hard to lose weight you can see results.” Think of someone with breast cancer who undergoes treatment and then goes into remission. When this occurs, remission is almost always documented in their records. “This gives the person hope. They may even forget about cancer for a while,” said Kashyap. When it comes to diabetes, recognizing remission may also give a person a sense of control since weight and diabetes are strongly tied. “Weight is the root cause of people developing diabetes at a young age. More than 82 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight,” said Kashyap. “Now we have a lot of tools to help people to lose weight, such as nutritionists, exercise physiologists, medications, and surgery. You can’t control your age or who your parents are, but you can modify your weight.” From the physician’s perspective, documenting remission is a way to back the importance of lifestyle changes. “Like The BMJ article said, we physicians often push drugs, but give lip service to lifestyle modification. This is a way to not do lip service. By putting it in the chart, we’re recognizing patients’ efforts and keeping them motivated to keep it up,” Kashyap said. If lifestyle changes are implemented successfully during the early stages of being officially diagnosed with diabetes, and if medications are no longer required, Patel says documenting diabetes “remission,” diabetes “being reversed,” or simply that someone’s diabetes is now “diet-controlled” can have impact beyond the patients themselves. “These might seem like semantics, but they have real downstream implications for research, budget/cost analyses, and most importantly, for the individuals having, or not, the potentially stigmatizing label of diabetes,” noted Patel. — How Diabetes Affects Women: Symptoms, Risks, and More Diabetes in women is much like diabetes in men.

Acontroversial experimental cure for type 1 diabetes, using a tuberculosis vaccine invented a century ago, appears to temporarily vanquish the disease, according to a study in a handful of patients led by a scientist long criticised by her peers. There is no guarantee the results from this early-stage trial will stand up in larger studies, which are now under way. Other diabetes researchers criticised it for going beyond the evidence in its claims about what caused the observed effects. If the findings do hold up, however, they would mean that the generic bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, in use since 1921, can regenerate insulin-secreting cells in the pancreas, whose loss causes the disease. ""We think we're seeing early evidence of effectiveness,"" said immunology researcher Denise Faustman of Massachusetts General Hospital, who led the trial. ""This simple, inexpensive vaccine attacks the autoimmunity underlying type 1 diabetes."" That autoimmunity, in which the immune system turns on the body's own cells rather than invaders, destroys insulin-producing 'islet' cells in the pancreas. As a result, patients have to regularly inject themselves with insulin to control their blood sugar, or glucose. ""We found that even low doses of the vaccine could transiently reverse type 1 diabetes, and this was in patients who have had the disease for 15 years,"" said Faustman. The effect lasted for about one week. ""Our measurements showed that autoimmune T cells that destroy the islet cells died, and we saw evidence that insulin production was restored."" Other diabetes experts have their doubts. ""There is a bit of magical thinking here,"" said Dr. Domenico Accili of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Centre at Columbia University Medical Centre. The idea that BCG wipes out autoimmune cells ""is totally unproved."" The study is nevertheless within the mainstream of current efforts to cure diabetes, said cellular immunologist Raphael Clynes of the Berrie Centre, who was not involved in the research. ""Folks had presumed that by the time patients had overt diabetes, all their islet cells had been destroyed,"" Clynes said. ""We now know there are preserved islet cells many years out. The presumption is, if you can get rid of the inflammatory, autoimmune response, the islet cells could regenerate."" Faustman's research on lab mice, begun in the 1990s, suggested that one way to get them to do that was with a compound in the body called tumor necrosis factor. TNF is difficult to obtain commercially, but the BCG vaccine increases the body's production of it. Raising levels of TNF through the vaccine cured type 1 diabetes in mice, Faustman reported a decade ago: With the autoimmune T cells out of the picture, islet cells regenerated and began producing healthy amounts of insulin. By 2006, other scientists -- including some who had attacked Faustman's claims of regeneration -- had replicated key findings of her mouse studies, laying the foundation for the clinical trial. Three patients with longstanding diabetes received two injections, four weeks apart, of BCG. Three others received saline injections, serving as the placebo control. In two of the three BCG patients, levels of islet-attacking T cells fell, the scientists reported. Dead autoimmune cells were released into the bloodstream, a hint that TNF was killing them as intended. A measure of insulin production rose. The only placebo patient with similar results had become infected with the Epstein-Barr virus, which also triggers production of TNF. No patients had adverse side effects. The scientists also reported marked increases in a marker of the body's own insulin production. (They did not measure insulin itself because insulin made by the pancreas cannot be distinguished from the injected form.) ""It wasn't to the level where they could throw away their syringe, but it was a significant elevation,"" said Faustman. ""And this was in patients 15 years out: Their islet cells weren't dead, as most people said."" The restored insulin production lasted only a week. In the trial for which Faustman is recruiting the first of hundreds of patients she therefore plans to give more frequent BCG shots. Faustman has already faced significant challenges to her theory. JDRF rejected her funding requests and circulated a 2003 letter from two of her colleagues at Harvard Medical School, casting doubt on her work and apologizing to diabetics for ""having their expectations cruelly raised"" by stories about her research. Reaction to this study was not much better. ""The paper shows that BCG is associated with a transient improvement in a couple of patients, but it's hard to conclude that TNF is the causative factor,"" said Columbia's Clynes.

I, really, really, really hate those words — “another major breakthrough,” “another promising study,” “another major step forward.” I hate them because as someone living with for over 20 years now, it seems I read one of those headlines every other week, as we inch excruciatingly slowly toward a cure (or at least a mode of treatment for this disease that can give truly normal blood glucose). As I often do, I was perusing recent research articles in deciding what I wanted to write about. I found a few, including a very interesting article about researchers in Australia who managed to modify cells in a lab mouse. These cells were modified to secret insulin in response to blood glucose, essentially turning them into , the ones that our Type 1 bodies killed off to land us with Type 1 diabetes. Because they were modifying cells already within the body, the immune system didn’t respond to them as foreign, and so the mouse is still non-diabetic a full year later. Anyway, that’s all great. But I’ve got to admit, my reaction was one of muted irritation; muted irritation because I know what that actually means. It means that they will move to human trials next — limited human trials that will need a number of years to play out. Then they’ll need FDA approval. Then, maybe 10 years from now, it will START to become available for real patients. And there are about 1.25 million of us with Type 1 in the U.S. alone. We’re not all going to be able to get whatever procedure they come up with on day one. And of course, while we live in a country with more wealth than any in history, universal medical coverage is still somehow regarded as either an “impossible dream” by those of us on the left or a socialist government overreach by those on the right. And so not everyone will be able to AFFORD the cure. And this is what will happen if the human trials GO WELL! Diabetes has been cured a number of times in mice — heck, if we were all mice, this website wouldn’t need to exist! It’s staggering how many Type 1 diabetic mice have been cured in my lifetime! There’s no guarantee that this new approach will survive that crucial step from clinical experiments with lab mice to actual human implementation. And so, we keep moving forward with our pumps and our and our multiple daily injections. We keep pricking our fingers for blood drops 4–5 times a day. We keep calculating and monitoring and treating our food like obsessive carbohydrate accountants (well, if I have 45 carbs, that’s X units, but I was exercising this morning, so I better lower that rate just a little bit… of course, it’s higher fat, so I’ll have a surge later…). And somewhere, in that far-off future that never seems to come, there’s a cure. We’ve been teased so many times, and we’ll be teased again. My bet for this latest news? — 3:1 against. That’s actually pretty darned good compared to my usual odds. I give most “promising breakthroughs” in the search for a Type 1 cure about 10:1 against. But the odds are still steep, and tomorrow morning, I’ll still check my blood glucose, give my shot, and keep living a pre-cure life. We all will. Sigh….

A new paper says that diabetes can be reversed for many people through weight loss. Ricardo Ramirez Buxeda/Orlando Sentinel/MCT via Getty Images If you've been diagnosed with , no doubt you've been told to change your eating habits (more veggies, less sweets) and get more exercise. These actions were thought to control your diabetes but not to reverse it. But a paper published says that Type 2 diabetes is indeed reversible for many patients who lose around , or 33 pounds. Diabetes is a chronic disease that has been rising rapidly throughout the world. It affected of the world's population in 2014 (about 422 million people), up from 4.7 percent in 1980. The most common form of diabetes is Type 2 diabetes, also known as adult-onset diabetes. It occurs when the body doesn't effectively use the insulin it produces (insulin is the hormone that regulates blood sugar.) If your blood sugar level is too high and not treated, it can lead to severe problems, like blindness, stroke, kidney failure and foot amputations. Type 2 diabetes is almost always directly tied to physical inactivity and extra body weight. ""The belief amongst doctors and scientists is that Type 2 diabetes is irreversible, always gets steadily worse, demanding more and more drugs, then insulin. Patient groups advise that the first step for someone newly diagnosed is to get used to the idea of dealing with a life-long illness,"" explains paper co-author , professor of medicine and metabolism at Newcastle University in the United Kingdom in an email interview. His research is the latest chapter in years' worth of investigation about Type 2 diabetes. In 2006, he noticed that liver function tests done in Type 2 patients were usually abnormal or on the high side. Then, he saw research that Type 2 patients who'd undergone bariatric surgery enjoyed normal fasting glucose levels within one week of the operation. ""Although it became widely believed that this was an effect of special hormones produced by the gut, it was clear to me that it might simply be the sharp decrease in food intake,"" Taylor says. ""I published a hypothesis — the Twin Cycle hypothesis — suggesting how everything might be explained by too much fat in [the] liver and pancreas, then set about testing the hypothesis."" His hunch was proved in 2011, and after that the group conducted a larger study to find out if those benefits continued long-term. The scientists were pleased to discover that remission does stay constant after a return to normal eating, provided subjects maintain a steady weight. Unfortunately, a lot of patients and doctors haven't clued into this finding that diabetes can go into remission. The BMJ paper was actually written to draw more attention to the reversibility of the condition and to incentivize everyone to strive for remission. ""[Remission] is a great advantage to people with Type 2 diabetes. Although many are content to continue taking the tablets or insulin and risk loss of eyesight, feet, etc., there are large numbers desperate to escape from Type 2 diabetes,"" Taylor says. The authors call for doctors to record patients who have gone into remission. ""In the UK [National Health Service], there is a special coding category to describe 'diabetes in remission.' It allows physicians still to be paid, ex-sufferers not to have to call themselves diabetic, and annual checks to be done to help motivation to keep weight steady,"" he says. To achieve remission, Type 2 diabetes patients must get their (Hemoglobin A1C, blood) level to normal levels for one year. This means below (U.K.) or (U.S.) or an A1C of below 6 percent without assistance from diabetes medication. On its website, the notes that it's very rare for patients' diabetes to go into remission unless they've had bariatric surgery. However, the European diabetes forum is more upbeat, saying that low-carb diets (like the Mediterranean diet), very low-calorie diets and commitment to exercise, as well as bariatric surgery, have all helped some diabetics to achieve remission. affect 15 percent of diabetes patients. In fact, 50-75 percent of U.S. lower-limb amputations are caused by diabetes-related complications! Is American wheat the cause of gluten sensitivity?

5ec5ba22-0068-4b68-9c4e-d806ecc2b24e,"Scientists May Have Answer for Why Some People Go Into Type 2 Diabetes Remission — Patients who improved beta cell function after weight loss went into remission. If we’ve learned anything about type 2 diabetes from mainstream media, it’s that weight loss and exercise ought to be the perfect cure — unfortunately, it’s not that simple. A recent clinical , referred to as the United-Kingdom-based Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT), placed patients with type 2 diabetes on a yearlong calorie-restrictive diet and found that close to half of the participants achieved nondiabetic blood sugars, qualifying them as “in remission.” All of these patients had been diagnosed within six years prior to the study. A secondary study confirms that the reason these patients achieved remission is not because of “reversing insulin resistance” like many diabetes articles and diets would have you believe, but instead because the weight loss resulted in improved function of their pancreatic beta cells. Beta cells are housed by the islet cells of the pancreas and are solely responsible for the production of insulin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the actual root of the condition can vary. For some, it is overall insulin resistance, and for others, it is impaired beta cell function. “This observation carries potentially important implications for the initial clinical approach to management,” explains senior study author Dr. Roy Taylor, professor of medicine and metabolism at Newcastle University. “At present, the early management of type 2 diabetes tends to involve a period of adjusting to the diagnosis, plus pharmacotherapy with lifestyle changes, which in practice are modest. Our data suggest that substantial weight loss at the time of diagnosis is appropriate to rescue the beta cells.” Approximately 46 percent of the participants following the weight-loss protocol were able to achieve nondiabetic blood sugar levels and maintain that control. In the 54 percent who didn’t achieve remission, the study reports that while some simply didn’t lose enough weight, others didn’t respond to the weight loss like the other participants. When testing each group’s overall beta-cell function, the study did find that only those in the 46-percentile group showed an improvement. “Undoubtedly, intervening in the progression of type 2 diabetes as early as possible before advanced end-organ damage occurs is the optimal approach,” Dr. Eric Sodicoff, author of , told Healthline. “Identifying such patients early is ideal, and this study clearly established that the longer a patient has lived with type 2 diabetes, the less likely they are going to respond to a calorie-restriction method.” Sodicoff cautions against severe calorie-restrictive dieting, however, because while it may lead to results initially, the rebound most people experience is severe. “I see patients all the time, unfortunately, who do just that,” explained Sodicoff. “They dip their A1C into nondiabetic range and rebound right back up. They put their diabetes into remission via low-carb, high-fat, ketogenic diets, and then rebound disturbingly fast.” The rebound Sodicoff is describing is a rapid weight gain that brings with it the return to high blood glucose levels. “I clearly and frequently remind people that returning to their old pattern of eating is not an option. Dieting is capable of normalizing blood glucose levels but returning to the carbohydrate tolerance they may have once enjoyed is gone forever.” Sodicoff also points out that lifelong calorie restriction is essentially impossible. “Just look at what happened to Ancel Keys subjects in his starvation studies,” suggests Sodicoff. Keys was an American physiologist in the early 1900s who became well-known for his starvation studies. “His patients suffered depression, anxiety, thinning hair, loss of sex drive, and incessant food cravings,” explains Sodicoff. Christel Oerum, a diabetes health coach and co-founder of , also cautions against rapid weight loss and severe calorie restriction, referencing a “They found that losing dramatic amounts of weight in a short amount of time had devastating impact on a person’s basal metabolic rate (BMR),” Oerum told Healthline. Your BMR is the amount of calories your body burns simply to keep itself alive and function. Anything additional, like the calories you burn when you go for a jog, is not part of your BMR. A significant decrease in your BMR, explains Oerum, is not a good thing, because it means your body is now burning fewer calories — sometimes even 600 fewer calories per day — which means the amount of food you can eat without gaining weight is 600 calories fewer, too. “Diet is at least 80 percent of the equation when it comes to weight loss,” explained Oerum, “but this most recent study didn’t seem to acknowledge exercise at all.” Referencing the , Oerum explained that losing 7 percent of your bodyweight (which is 15 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds) and exercising merely 20 minutes per day can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by nearly 60 percent. “I do believe that extreme deprivation and extreme restriction and rules around food will lead to other issues and rebounding later on,” said Oerum. “When you go extreme in one direction, you’ll eventually have an extreme response in the other direction.” The rebound of the participants in this most recent study is unknown since they were only observed for one year. Instead of severe calorie restriction and too many “food rules,” Oerum recommends putting the protein on your plate first, then a good serving (or three) of vegetables, and then a small serving of carbohydrates. Most of all, Oerum says to look beyond the calories and the macronutrients like fat and carbohydrates. “Cut out the processed junk, and aim for real food.” Ginger Vieira is an expert patient living with type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and fibromyalgia.

Recently, 500–800 people gathered in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, for the 18th annual Tour De Cure, a fundraising event for the . The event includes cycling routes from 12–100 miles (more on that in a minute), as well as the option to walk or run. This particular event is one of 51 that the ADA will host across the country this year. According to Nathan Hughes, Development Manager for the Pennsylvania chapter of the American Diabetes Association, this year’s campaign is expected to generate over 18 million dollars. As the name suggests, the Tour De Cure raises money for diabetes research. The long-term goal for the American Diabetes Association, of course, is a cure. But until that day comes, the money raised for diabetes research will still help improve the lives of those living with the condition. After all, it is through pioneering research that we have developed better insulin, continuous glucose monitoring, and pumps, to name a few. And there are new avenues on the horizon everyday. I participated in this event, riding 63 miles around Bucks County, PA, with other committed fund-raisers. Here I present , along with those of and . I was diagnosed with at the age of 15, and I’ve lived with the disease for 25 years now. Even though I’ve had diabetes for 25 years, contribute to an online , and have followed the work of the ADA for many years, it was cycling, not diabetes, that started this journey for me. I started cycling about a year-and-a-half ago as a way to help and improve my general health. I wasn’t really thinking specifically about diabetes when I started. As I continued cycling, I discovered how much I enjoy it — it gives me energy, it’s fun, and it HAS helped me slowly drop some weight (though I have plenty more to lose). And of course, it also promotes better , and lowers the amount of insulin I take. When I saw the Tour de Cure, it was a perfect fit — a great cycling goal, and a cause I care deeply about. What challenges have you faced living with diabetes? Living with diabetes is so hard to describe to people who don’t have it. I wrote a of this disease — the way in which we carry an emotional, logistical, and sometimes physical burden that simply can’t be translated to the people around us. That may be one of the biggest challenges for me. As my own wife has said to me during moments of frustration and , “I wish I could know what it feels like to live with this!” We don’t often talk about the positives of diabetes, but they exist. Diabetes has taught me a great deal about balance — physical, emotional, and even spiritual. It has been, as my mother likes to say, “a forced practice.” In that way, it can be a spiritual practice, in which we learn to let go, to accept what is beyond our control, and to embrace what is within it. What issues affecting the diabetes community most concern you? I worry a great deal about the cost of insulin, and access to health care. Watching the dismantling of the limited gains made under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is a daily heartbreak for me, because I know how cruel and devastating the old system was for people with preexisting conditions. I am a working musician and music teacher, a devoted husband, and a “father” to four cats with my wife, who may be the most supportive, compassionate, and wonderful human being on this planet! I have had Type 1 diabetes for over 49 years since being diagnosed at the age of 15 months A friend who is an avid cyclist told me about the Tour de Cure and I thought it made a lot of sense to ride for a cause that affected me. What challenges have you faced living with diabetes? My biggest challenge is trying to stay as healthy as possible in the midst of a busy lifestyle. It means making , getting , , and dosing my insulin so that I avoid going too high or too low. I have gained a few things living with diabetes for almost 50 years. I have gained discipline, as the consequences of being sloppy with this disease are not fun. I have also gained a sense of empathy for those who struggle with their health, as I understand how difficult a day can be when you don’t feel well. What issues affecting the diabetes community most concern you? One is access to affordable health insurance for people with diabetes. I am the owner of a pet store called Spot’s — The Place for Paws, in Narberth, PA. I was able to open the shop about 15 yeas ago after having been an attorney. At that time, I was grandfathered into an insurance policy due to my prior job, but that policy was getting prohibitively expensive as the years went by. No other insurance company would even consider quoting me for a policy because of my diabetes. I was effectively being squeezed out of the health-insurance market, as well as my role as a store owner, because of the lack of access to affordable health insurance. When the Affordable Care Act was implemented, and I could no longer be discriminated against as a person with a pre-existing condition, I had access to affordable health insurance, and I could continue to run my business. It was life changing for me. If those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes are once again denied access to affordable health insurance, it is essentially telling any children that are diagnosed with this condition (or many others for that matter) that they will never grow up to work for themselves and that they will always have to rely on others who can provide coverage for them. It makes a bad situation much worse. I am a small business owner and am the current mayor of Narberth, PA — I am the first woman to ever hold this position. I have many interests, including advocating on behalf of the ADA, The Pennsylvania Health Access Network, and The Small Business Majority for health-care policy that makes sense; being on the Volunteer Board of the Tour de Cure; and being the pet mom of my wonderful rescue dog, Daisy. I’ve had Type 1 diabetes for 30 years. I was diagnosed at age 22. I’m an avid cyclist. I started cycling soon after my diagnosis to help control blood sugar and maintain fitness. What challenges have you faced living with diabetes? It’s a daily “job.” There are no vacations. It can take a toll physically, as well as mentally. I had a fellow Type 1 ask me, “What’s the best thing about diabetes.” I initially thought that was a silly question, until I thought about it a bit. I think of what my life would be without diabetes. I may have never gotten into fitness and taking care of myself. It’s interesting to think about what I would look and feel like if I were not diagnosed. What issues affecting the diabetes community most concern you? I think the cost of insulin is very concerning. I have health-care coverage that covers a good portion of the costs. But for folks who do not have coverage, the costs of insulin can be astronomical. I work for an engineering software company in finance. I’ve worked there for almost 20 years. I’m married with no children, but my wife’s parents recently moved in with us, due to her father having a stroke. I enjoy working around the house, and obviously, cycling. I ride about 3,000 miles a year. I also do a couple days a week, as well as rowing and TRX work outs a couple of mornings a week. My wife also started raising ducks this spring, so we have four ducks, as well as two cats, and my in-laws’ dog living with us. Thank you to Andrea and David for sharing their stories and to Nathan for reaching out to find fellow riders participating in the event. Want to learn more about preparing for the Tour de Cure?

By: | Weight loss can be beneficial for heart health of type-2 diabetic patients. © Shutterstock People who achieve weight loss of 10 per cent or more in the first five years after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes have the greatest chance of seeing their disease go into remission, says a study. Also Read - Weight loss diet: How to use coconut oil to reduce belly fat The findings, published in the journal Diabetic Medicine, suggest that it is possible to recover from the disease without intensive lifestyle interventions or extreme calorie restrictions. Also Read - Fitness matters: Increase your step counts when you are indoors “We’ve known for some time now that it’s possible to send diabetes into remission using fairly drastic measures such as intensive weight loss programmes and extreme calorie restriction,” said study researcher Hajira Dambha-Miller from the University of Cambridge. Also Read - Adverse events post Covid-19 vaccination: AIIMS' security guard admitted to ICU “These interventions can be very challenging to individuals and difficult to achieve. But, our results suggest that it may be possible to get rid of diabetes, for at least five years, with a more modest weight loss of 10 per cent,” Dambha-Miller said. Type 2 diabetes affects 400 million people worldwide and increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, blindness and amputations. While the disease can be managed through a combination of positive lifestyle changes and medication, it is also possible for the high blood glucose levels that define diabetes to return to normal – through significant calorie restriction and weight loss. An intensive involving a total daily intake of 700 calories for eight weeks has been associated with remission in almost nine out of ten people with recently diagnosed diabetes and in half of the people with longstanding disease. For the findings, the research team studied data from the ADDITION-Cambridge trial, a prospective cohort study of 867 people with newly diagnosed diabetes aged 40 and 69 years recruited from general practices in the eastern region. The researchers found that 257 participants were in remission at five-year follow-up. People who achieved weight loss of 10 per cent or more within the first five years after diagnosis were more than twice as likely to go into remission compared to people who maintained the same weight. In order to clarify the best way to help patients with type 2 diabetes achieve sustained weight loss, the team is currently undertaking a study called GLoW (Glucose Lowering through Weight management).

89cc8227-da2a-4c12-9483-d76be15d5cfd,"Who will profit from the cure for Type 1 diabetes?  Opinions expressed in this editorial piece are my own. This is written and shared as a member of the Type 1 diabetes community, not in any official capacity related to my position at Beyond Type 1. Read the news announcement on this partnership . Today, Eli Lilly and Company announced a large investment in a small cell-encapsulation research company called Sigilon Therapeutics. Today, I realized something I’d never before considered: the same company profiting from the insulin people with Type 1 diabetes must take to stay alive may be the gatekeeper of a one-day cure. I received the press release announcement in my email inbox. As the Communications Manager at Beyond Type 1, I often help cover industry news announcements. Sometimes that’s straightforward. This week it wasn’t. I’ve lived with Type 1 diabetes for 16 years — I just celebrated my diaversary this weekend. My dad has Type 1. My maternal grandfather also has Type 1. I have taken insulin via injection or infusion now for 5,842 days. Averaging about 60 units a day, that’s about $100,000 worth of insulin (at the current list price) just to make it to 24 years old. Because I’ve enjoyed the privilege of health insurance, the bulk of this money hasn’t typically come directly out of my family’s pockets. But for millions of uninsured or underinsured Americans, it does. Lilly, one of the “big 3” insulin manufacturers alongside Sanofi and Novo Nordisk, has increased the list price of insulin over 1,123% since 1996. Last year, the list price for Lilly’s popular fast-acting insulin Humalog was To add insult to injury, these increases have occurred in lock-step between the three companies — prompting multiple (pharmacy benefit managers) and health insurers for rising costs. Yes, the system’s totally broken. Killing people, actually. And no, it’s not just the manufacturers, but pointing fingers will not excuse them from their share of the blame. The CEO of Lilly made $14.4 million last year. It was his first year on the job. Because of the skyrocketing and prohibitively expensive price of insulin, I live in fear of finding myself without work that includes health insurance benefits. Changing insurance plans is a nightmare. The politics around pre-existing conditions are terrifyingly personal. I still know I’m lucky. Because of my work at Beyond Type 1, I’m all too aware of people in our community who are struggling to afford insulin. Of because they do not have access to a drug that has been around for almost 100 years. These stories break my heart and make me so angry. And scared. There is nothing that separates me or my dad or my grandfather from the more extreme cases in our community except that we happen to have access to affordable insulin today. So covering that press release announcing Lilly’s new investment in the cure space? Not simple. My response to the press release was exceptionally emotional. You know, like ugly-crying in the office after realizing the role Lilly might play in my future. I have questions. Like — why is Lilly investing in technology that could hypothetically eliminate the need for one of their most popular drugs? Is Lilly putting a stake in the ground — marking the beginning of its claim to a corner of the future cure market? Perhaps this is an attempt to position themselves as an ally working on a cure for Type 1 diabetes rather than a company profiting from a life-sustaining medication many with diabetes struggle to afford? Worse, even – is this Lilly investing in cure research as a first step to killing this technology? I am angry and I am confused because today I learned a difficult truth about the nature of our healthcare system and the pharmaceutical industry. And that is this: There’s a significant chance that the very same companies profiting from the drug we take to stay alive will own (and profit from) the future cure for Type 1 diabetes. Of course I knew that someone would own and profit from implantable cell therapies – but never did I consider that it would be Lilly. Or Novo Nordisk. Or Sanofi. I don’t know why I didn’t consider it, I just didn’t. I guess I’m naive. A biology major who did lab work at my University, I pictured scientists at the bench, driven by a desire to help people and by a love for scientific discovery. I pictured Frederick Banting and his colleagues selling the patent for insulin for $1 each. The press release from Lilly announcing their “exclusive worldwide license” to the cell encapsulation technology for islet cell transplantation burst my idyllic bubble. The cure will not be a magic solution that makes Type 1 diabetes disappear forever. And it will not be attributed to the humble scientist in a lab altruistically saving lives. The cure will have a pharmaceutical company’s name on it. The cure will make that company money. Industry players like Lilly will be the ones to facilitate a cure because they’re the companies with enough money fuel the years-long intensive research, development, and go-to-market preparation it will require. These companies have the money because that’s what they do — make money. By charging prohibitively expensive prices for drugs from the same people who may one day stand to benefit. Maybe. If we’re lucky. Which leads me to one last line of questioning: when there is a cure, who will have access to it? How much will it cost? Will health insurance cover it? What if I can’t afford health insurance? What if, when a cure is finally a reality, people in the United States with pre-existing conditions no longer have access to affordable health insurance? And exactly how much money will the executives at that pharmaceutical company make? Because of my work at Beyond Type 1, not only do I know people whose lives are impacted by the cost of insulin … I also know people who work at Lilly. I know that they are kind, good people and that many of them are also personally impacted by Type 1 diabetes. They are probably hoping that this is a genuine investment by their employer to bring a real, functional cure for Type 1 diabetes to as many people as possible. I am hoping the same thing. But today I’m finding it difficult to feel optimistic. Read the news piece on Lilly investing in cell encapsulation technology.

e805fd5a-6734-47b3-ba37-193ae08e228c,"— A study finds evidence that exercise and diet can put type 2 diabetes into remission. Here’s how it works. Diabetes now affects more than adults in the United States. The disease increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, nerve damage, and kidney damage for those who have it. But what if a medically supervised crash diet could help put this chronic condition in remission? Experts in the United Kingdom are looking into whether a strict diet program — a kind of crash diet — can put this normally chronic condition into remission. To study this treatment, researchers from and the University of Glasgow studied 306 people between the ages of 20 to 65. The participants had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within the past six years, were overweight, and hadn’t started to use insulin. About half the participants were put into a weight loss program. The other half received normal diabetes care with their general practitioner or primary care physician. The weight loss program study was called , the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial. The regimen is a low-calorie diet via shakes and soups for a period of weeks, and then a gradual reintroduction of normal foods. No exercise was recommended in the beginning of the study. It was introduced as the participants worked to maintain their weight loss. After one year, the researchers found that of the participants in the weight loss program went into remission from diabetes. In the group that received normal diabetes care, just six participants went into remission. Remission was defined as having blood sugar levels below 6.5 percent and being off all diabetes medication for at least two months. More than half — — of participants who lost a lot of weight went into remission. They had lost between 10 and 15 kilograms (kg), or between approximately 22 and 33 pounds. Another 34 percent of participants who lost less weight — between 5 and 10 kg (11 to 22 pounds) — still went into remission. “Our findings suggest that even if you have had type 2 diabetes for six years, putting the disease into remission is feasible,” Michael Lean, a professor and chair of human nutrition at the University of Glasgow and a co-leader of the study, said in a . “In contrast to other approaches, we focus on the need for long-term maintenance of weight loss through diet and exercise and encourage flexibility to optimize individual results,” he noted. Obesity is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, but simply losing weight doesn’t mean someone will go into diabetes remission. Type 2 diabetes when the body either resists the effects of insulin or when the body doesn’t produce enough insulin for what the body demands. This disruption strains cells in the pancreas, called beta cells. They can eventually become increasingly impaired, leading to less and less insulin being released. One participant who took part in the program said it “transformed” her life. Isobel Murray, 65, was reportedly on the low-calorie diet for 17 weeks and able to shed 16 kg, or approximately 35 pounds. “When the doctors told me that my pancreas was working again, it felt fantastic, absolutely amazing,” Murray said in a . “I don’t think of myself as a diabetic anymore. I get all my diabetes checks done, but I don’t feel like a diabetic. I am one of the lucky ones to have gone into remission.” However, this approach to combatting diabetes is still being studied. The researchers at DiRECT advise people to seek medical advice before starting any approach to reversing diabetes. “If you’re thinking about trying a low-calorie diet, it’s really important you speak to your GP and get referred to a dietitian,” Dougie Twenefour, DiRECT deputy head of care said in a . “This is to make sure you get tailored advice and support.” Dr. Goutham Rao, chair of family medicine and community health at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, said the study adds to a growing body of evidence that steps should be taken to reverse type 2 diabetes. “The old-school thinking is once a diabetic, always a diabetic,” he said. “But we know from some significant portion of patients who undergo bariatric surgery, for example, that their diabetes goes into remission.” However, Rao said it’s key that a patient starts to combat type 2 diabetes earlier rather than later if they want to be in remission. “There is no question, however, that the earlier in the process that you actually make those changes the more likely you are to go into remission,” he said. He explained that “beta cells in the pancreas, they only have a certain life span per se — and they start to deteriorate year after year after year.” In particular, Rao said that the new study showed how key it was to have primary care doctors involved in helping people achieve weight loss to combat diabetes. “Why primary care doctors? The number one reason is that we have ongoing relationships with patients,” Rao told Healthline. “Obesity and diabetes are not onetime things.” Rao said that it’s important that people with diabetes get support from their doctors and nutrition experts to help them try and get into remission quickly after their diagnosis. Dr. Ryan Farrell, a pediatric endocrinologist at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, said he hopes this kind of study also sheds light on how to help children and teens who develop type 2 diabetes. “Type 2 diabetes in pediatrics tends to be a much more aggressive form of diabetes compared to the more latent onset” in adults, Farrell told Healthline. However, he questioned whether this kind of low-calorie diet approach could work in growing children. While type 1 diabetes is generally more common in children, rates of type 2 diabetes have been going up dramatically in children. One found a nearly 5 percent increase year over year in children with type 2 diabetes Farrell said he’d like to know how the study participants do in the future and if they’re able to maintain their remission. “It would be interesting to see to what degree that weight loss is perpetuated and if diabetes reoccurs in any of these patients in subsequent years,” he said. — Researchers in Scotland say people with diabetes can reverse their disease by losing weight, but most aren’t aware that this is possible.

c8389590-a6cb-49ef-a089-94a27703dc25,"Diabetes is a disease that affects how the body uses , the main type of sugar in the blood. Our bodies break down the foods we eat into glucose and other nutrients we need, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract. The in the blood rises after a meal and triggers the to make the hormone and release it into the bloodstream. But in people with diabetes, the body either can't make or can't respond to insulin properly. Insulin works like a key that opens the doors to cells and lets the glucose in. Without insulin, glucose can't get into the cells (the doors are ""locked"" and there is no key) and so it stays in the bloodstream. As a result, the level of sugar in the blood remains higher than normal. High blood sugar levels are a problem because they can cause a number of health problems. The two types of diabetes are and . Both make blood sugar levels higher than normal but they do so in different ways. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas loses its ability to make insulin because the body's  attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. No one knows exactly why this happens, but scientists think it has something to do with genes. But just getting the genes for diabetes isn't usually enough. A person probably would then have to be exposed to something else — like a virus — to get type 1 diabetes. In , the pancreas still makes insulin but the body doesn't respond to it normally. Glucose is less able to enter the cells and do its job of supplying energy (a problem called ). This raises the blood sugar level, so the pancreas works hard to make even more insulin. Eventually, this strain can make the pancreas unable to produce enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels normal. Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented, and there is no real way to predict who will get it. Nothing that either a parent or the child did caused the disease. Once a person has type 1 diabetes, it does not go away and requires lifelong treatment. Kids and teens with type 1 diabetes depend on daily or an to control their blood glucose levels. A person can have diabetes without knowing it because the symptoms aren't always obvious and they can take a long time to develop. Type 1 diabetes may come on gradually or suddenly. But kids or teens who develop type 1 diabetes may: The respond to high levels of glucose in the blood by flushing out the extra glucose in urine (pee). Kids with high blood sugar levels need to pee more often and make more pee. Because they're peeing so often and losing so much fluid, they can become very thirsty and drink a lot in an attempt to keep the levels of body water normal. This is because the body can't use glucose for energy properly. (or not gain weight as they grow). Kids and teens with type 1 diabetes may have an increased appetite, but often lose weight because the body breaks down muscle and stored fat in an attempt to provide fuel to the hungry cells. In some cases, other symptoms can be the signal that something is wrong. Sometimes the first sign of diabetes is in a child who has been dry at night. Diabetes also should be suspected if a girl who hasn't started puberty yet gets a . Doctors can say for sure if a person has diabetes by testing blood samples for glucose. When high blood sugars show that a child has diabetes, other blood tests are usually done to help doctors find out if the child has type 1 or type 2 diabetes, because management and treatment of the diabetes may differ based on type. If diabetes is suspected or confirmed, the doctor may refer your child to a , a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of kids with diseases of the endocrine system, such as diabetes and growth disorders. means good to minimize symptoms; prevent health problems; and help kids have normal physical, mental, emotional, and social growth and development. To do this, parents and kids should aim to keep blood sugar levels within the goal range as much as possible. eat a healthy, balanced diet with accurate carbohydrate counts Following the treatment plan helps kids stay healthy, but treating diabetes isn't the same as curing it. Right now, there's no cure for diabetes, so kids with type 1 diabetes will need treatment for the rest of their lives. But with proper care, they should look and feel healthy and go on to live long, productive lives, just like other kids. If early symptoms of diabetes are missed and treatment isn't started, chemicals called ketones can build up in the blood and cause stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, fruity-smelling breath, breathing problems, and even loss of consciousness. Sometimes these symptoms are mistaken for the flu or appendicitis. Doctors call this serious condition , or DKA. Diabetes also can cause in some people, including heart disease, stroke, vision impairment, and kidney damage. It also can cause other problems throughout the body in the blood vessels, nerves, and gums. While these problems don't usually show up in kids or teens who've had type 1 diabetes for only a few years, they can affect them in adulthood, particularly if their diabetes isn't well controlled. There's good news, though — proper treatment can stop or control these diabetes symptoms and reduce the risk of long-term problems. Doctors and researchers are developing new equipment and treatments to help kids cope with the special problems of growing up with diabetes. Some kids and teens are already using devices that make blood glucose testing and insulin injections easier, less painful, and more effective. One of these is the , a mechanical device that can deliver insulin more like the pancreas does. There's also been progress toward the development of a wearable or implantable ""artificial pancreas."" This consists of an insulin pump linked to a device that measures the person's blood glucose level continuously. Doctors and scientists are investigating a potential cure for diabetes. This involves transplanting insulin-producing cells into the body of a person with diabetes. Researchers are also testing ways to stop diabetes before it starts.

Our bodies break down the foods we eat into glucose and other nutrients we need, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract. The in the blood rises after a meal and triggers the to make the hormone and release it into the bloodstream. But in people with diabetes, the body either can't make or can't respond to insulin properly. Insulin works like a key that opens the doors to cells and lets the glucose in. Without insulin, glucose can't get into the cells (the doors are ""locked"" and there is no key) and so it stays in the bloodstream. As a result, the level of sugar in the blood remains higher than normal. High blood sugar levels are a problem because they can cause a number of health problems. The two types of diabetes are and . Both make blood sugar levels higher than normal but they do so in different ways. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas loses its ability to make insulin because the body's  attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. No one knows exactly why this happens, but scientists think it has something to do with genes. But just getting the genes for diabetes isn't usually enough. A person probably would then have to be exposed to something else — like a virus — to get type 1 diabetes. In , the pancreas still makes insulin but the body doesn't respond to it normally. Glucose is less able to enter the cells and do its job of supplying energy (a problem called ). This raises the blood sugar level, so the pancreas works hard to make even more insulin. Eventually, this strain can make the pancreas unable to produce enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels normal. Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented, and there is no real way to predict who will get it. Nothing that either a parent or the child did caused the disease. Once a person has type 1 diabetes, it does not go away and requires lifelong treatment. Kids and teens with type 1 diabetes depend on daily or an to control their blood glucose levels. A person can have diabetes without knowing it because the symptoms aren't always obvious and they can take a long time to develop. Type 1 diabetes may come on gradually or suddenly. But kids or teens who develop type 1 diabetes may: The respond to high levels of glucose in the blood by flushing out the extra glucose in urine (pee). Kids with high blood sugar levels need to pee more often and make more pee. Because they're peeing so often and losing so much fluid, they can become very thirsty and drink a lot in an attempt to keep the levels of body water normal. This is because the body can't use glucose for energy properly. (or not gain weight as they grow). Kids and teens with type 1 diabetes may have an increased appetite, but often lose weight because the body breaks down muscle and stored fat in an attempt to provide fuel to the hungry cells. In some cases, other symptoms can be the signal that something is wrong. Sometimes the first sign of diabetes is in a child who has been dry at night. Diabetes also should be suspected if a girl who hasn't started puberty yet gets a . Doctors can say for sure if a person has diabetes by testing blood samples for glucose.

But with proper care, they should look and feel healthy and go on to live long, productive lives, just like other kids. If early symptoms of diabetes are missed and treatment isn't started, chemicals called ketones can build up in the blood and cause stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, fruity-smelling breath, breathing problems, and even loss of consciousness. Sometimes these symptoms are mistaken for the flu or appendicitis. Doctors call this serious condition , or DKA. Diabetes also can cause in some people, including heart disease, stroke, vision impairment, and kidney damage. It also can cause other problems throughout the body in the blood vessels, nerves, and gums. While these problems don't usually show up in kids or teens who've had type 1 diabetes for only a few years, they can affect them in adulthood, particularly if their diabetes isn't well controlled. There's good news, though — proper treatment can stop or control these diabetes symptoms and reduce the risk of long-term problems. Doctors and researchers are developing new equipment and treatments to help kids cope with the special problems of growing up with diabetes.

At the 79th American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions on San Francisco, Dan Drucker, MD, of the University of Toronto highlighted the over the last year. Here are seven of them. remission through weight loss works, if people keep the weight off. Dr. Roy Taylor of Newcastle University in the UK has showing that very-low-calorie diets can put diabetes into remission, defined as an (a measure of glucose control over the previous 2&ndassh3 months) below 6.5% without taking diabetes medications. But he had never done long-term follow-up to see if the results can last. Now, the has followed about 270 diabetes patients for two years. All participants had been diagnosed within the last six years. After an initial rapid weight loss with a 700-calorie-a-day liquid diet, patients were helped with a stepped food reintroduction, and then given structured support for weight maintenance. A control group got regular diabetes care. After , 11.4% of the intervention group maintained a 15-kilogram (33-pound) weight loss, down from 24% at one year. Twenty-four percent of the intervention group maintained a 10-kilogram (22-pound) weight loss. Diabetes was in remission for 35.6% of the intervention group and 3.4% of the controls. The average weight loss of those in remission was 10.4 kilograms (23 pounds), and of those not in remission was 3.2 kilograms (7 pounds). , and levels all improved in the intervention group. Remember that the intervention group received ongoing support for weight management, and some went back on the very-low-calorie liquid temporarily. Most people don’t have that kind of support. Still, only 24% of the group maintained a 22-pound weight loss, and over 64% of them were no longer in remission after two years. So don’t expect a cure, but do be aware that a supported weight-loss program like this does seem to help some people for a couple of years.

That’s the exciting news out of the UK! , funded by Diabetes UK, has demonstrated for the first time that remission of type 2 diabetes is possible and the long held view of diabetes being a ‘life sentence’ isn’t necessarily accurate. The DiRECT study found that almost half of participants in the overweight or obese range who followed an intensive low-calorie diet of around 850 calories a day, for between 8 and 20 weeks, were able to put their type 2 diabetes into remission. The more weight that an individual lost, the more likely it was that they achieved remission. Nine out of 10 participants who lost 15kg or more were able to put their diabetes in remission and come off all diabetes medications. In a follow up 12 months later, over one third were still in remission. Remission in adults with means that their symptoms of diabetes are no longer present and their blood glucose levels no longer need to be managed with diabetes medication. Remission may not be permanent, so ongoing review and support continue to be important. The results of the DiRECT study are extremely encouraging which is why Diabetes NSW & ACT is raising research funding for the Australian T2 Remission Project. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate that an intensive, supported, weight loss program can lead to the remission of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes NSW & ACT believes that if the same results are achieved in Australia, as in the UK, then the treatment of type 2 diabetes and the longer term health of the country will be transformed. That’s why we want to conduct the study in Australia. “This ground-breaking research has major implications for Australia both for the health of people with type 2 diabetes and the cost savings achievable, if we can replicate this study and deliver comparable results,” said T2 Remission Project Program Director, Ian Corless. If we can demonstrate success in the Australian context, it may have a lasting influence on the direction of national health policy. Positive outcomes may lead to a national program funded by Governments aimed at reducing the incidence of Type 2 diabetes, and the escalating costs of diabetes health care. This program provides the possibility of a life truly free of the complications of diabetes. “If the DiRECT study is replicated in the Australian context, this can lead to a significant paradigm shift in primary health care nationally.”  Professor Stephen Colagiuri, Professor of Metabolic Health and Director of The Boden Institute at the University of Sydney.

68bcb575-41d0-4f04-a369-bf74f05ca52e,">> Interested in Volunteering? for more information Diabetes is a disease that affects how the body uses , the main type of sugar in the blood. Our bodies break down the foods we eat into glucose and other nutrients we need, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract. The in the blood rises after a meal and triggers the to make the hormone and release it into the bloodstream. But in people with diabetes, the body either can't make or can't respond to insulin properly. Insulin works like a key that opens the doors to cells and lets the glucose in. Without insulin, glucose can't get into the cells (the doors are ""locked"" and there is no key) and so it stays in the bloodstream. As a result, the level of sugar in the blood remains higher than normal. High blood sugar levels are a problem because they can cause a number of health problems. The two types of diabetes are and . Both make blood sugar levels higher than normal but they do so in different ways. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas loses its ability to make insulin because the body's  attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. No one knows exactly why this happens, but scientists think it has something to do with genes. But just getting the genes for diabetes isn't usually enough. A person probably would then have to be exposed to something else — like a virus — to get type 1 diabetes. In , the pancreas still makes insulin but the body doesn't respond to it normally. Glucose is less able to enter the cells and do its job of supplying energy (a problem called ). This raises the blood sugar level, so the pancreas works hard to make even more insulin. Eventually, this strain can make the pancreas unable to produce enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels normal. Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented, and there is no real way to predict who will get it. Nothing that either a parent or the child did caused the disease. Once a person has type 1 diabetes, it does not go away and requires lifelong treatment. Kids and teens with type 1 diabetes depend on daily insulin injections or an insulin pump to control their blood glucose levels. A person can have diabetes without knowing it because the symptoms aren't always obvious and they can take a long time to develop. Type 1 diabetes may come on gradually or suddenly. But kids or teens who develop type 1 diabetes may: The respond to high levels of glucose in the blood by flushing out the extra glucose in urine (pee). Kids with high blood sugar levels need to pee more often and make more pee. Because they're peeing so often and losing so much fluid, they can become very thirsty and drink a lot in an attempt to keep the levels of body water normal. This is because the body can't use glucose for energy properly. (or not gain weight as they grow). Kids and teens with type 1 diabetes may have an increased appetite, but often lose weight because the body breaks down muscle and stored fat in an attempt to provide fuel to the hungry cells. In some cases, other symptoms can be the signal that something is wrong. Sometimes the first sign of diabetes is in a child who has been dry at night. Diabetes also should be suspected if a girl who hasn't started puberty yet gets a vaginal yeast infection. Doctors can say for sure if a person has diabetes by testing blood samples for glucose. When high blood sugars show that a child has diabetes, other blood tests are usually done to help doctors find out if the child has type 1 or type 2 diabetes, because management and treatment of the diabetes may differ based on type. If diabetes is suspected or confirmed, the doctor may refer your child to a , a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of kids with diseases of the endocrine system, such as diabetes and growth disorders. means good to minimize symptoms; prevent health problems; and help kids have normal physical, mental, emotional, and social growth and development. To do this, parents and kids should aim to keep blood sugar levels within the goal range as much as possible. eat a healthy, balanced diet with accurate carbohydrate counts Following the treatment plan helps kids stay healthy, but treating diabetes isn't the same as curing it. Right now, there's no cure for diabetes, so kids with type 1 diabetes will need treatment for the rest of their lives. But with proper care, they should look and feel healthy and go on to live long, productive lives, just like other kids. If early symptoms of diabetes are missed and treatment isn't started, chemicals called ketones can build up in the blood and cause stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, fruity-smelling breath, breathing problems, and even loss of consciousness. Sometimes these symptoms are mistaken for the flu or appendicitis. Doctors call this serious condition diabetic ketoacidosis, or DKA. Diabetes also can cause in some people, including heart disease, stroke, vision impairment, and kidney damage. It also can cause other problems throughout the body in the blood vessels, nerves, and gums. While these problems don't usually show up in kids or teens who've had type 1 diabetes for only a few years, they can affect them in adulthood, particularly if their diabetes isn't well controlled. There's good news, though — proper treatment can stop or control these diabetes symptoms and reduce the risk of long-term problems. Doctors and researchers are developing new equipment and treatments to help kids cope with the special problems of growing up with diabetes. Some kids and teens are already using devices that make blood glucose testing and insulin injections easier, less painful, and more effective. One of these is the insulin pump, a mechanical device that can deliver insulin more like the pancreas does. There's also been progress toward the development of a wearable or implantable ""artificial pancreas."" This consists of an insulin pump linked to a device that measures the person's blood glucose level continuously. Doctors and scientists are investigating a potential cure for diabetes. This involves transplanting insulin-producing cells into the body of a person with diabetes. Researchers are also testing ways to stop diabetes before it starts. For example, scientists are studying whether diabetes can be prevented in those who may have inherited an increased risk for the disease. Parents can help their kids lead happier, healthier lives by giving constant encouragement, learning what they can about diabetes, and making sure their children eat properly, exercise, and stay on top of blood sugar control every day. Kids and teens with diabetes need to monitor and control their glucose levels. They need to: check blood sugar levels a few times a day by testing a small blood sample give themselves insulin injections, have an adult give them injections, or use an insulin pump eat a balanced, healthy diet and pay special attention to the amounts of sugars and starches in the food they eat and the timing of their meals get regular to help control blood sugar levels and help avoid some of the long-term health problems that diabetes can cause, like heart disease work closely with their doctor and diabetes health care team to get the best possible diabetes control be watched for signs of complications and other diabetes-related health problems Living with diabetes is a challenge for anyone, but kids and teens often have special issues to deal with. Young kids might not understand why they need blood tests and . They might be scared, angry, and uncooperative. Teens may feel different from their peers and want a more carefree lifestyle than their diabetes allows. Even when they faithfully follow their treatment schedule, they might feel frustrated if the natural body changes of puberty make their diabetes somewhat harder to control. Having a child with diabetes may seem overwhelming at times, but you're not alone. If you have questions or problems, reach out to the diabetes health care team — they can help with medical issues, and are there to support and help you and your child.

608394bf-6ebc-49fc-a8be-c42ea9cf5b04,"Award-winning filmmaker Lisa Hepner has lived with Type 1 diabetes for 25 years. She’s produced films and programs for some of the biggest networks in the industry — Sony Pictures Classics, HBO, A&E, PBS, Lifetime, Discovery, MTV, TLC and the CBC to name a few. In 2003, she created that profiled women peacekeepers in Afghanistan, Argentina, Burundi, Bosnia-Herzegovina and the US. The film premiered at the UN, giving world policy makers a glimpse into war-torn nations and showing them how women are playing a vital humanitarian role in the aftermath of war. Looking for heroism in the forgotten corners of our globe and from those least likely to claim the spotlight, Lisa turns her eye to the stem cell research (regenerative medicine) being done by — a biotech company based in San Diego that is currently conducting the first-ever clinical trial to implant stem-cell derived beta cells into humans. The desired result is the end of insulin dependence, or in other words — a practical cure for diabetes. “As we film, we’re learning what it takes to push medical research forward,” says Hepner. “I admire the researchers who are dedicating their lives to curing a chronic disease, especially because all research is incremental — it’s such a long and expensive process.” ViaCyte’s trial is the third ever embryonic stem cell trial in the US, and only the sixth ever in the world. It’s also one of the first feature documentaries to be made on diabetes, a disease estimated to be one of the leading causes of death by 2030 (). Lisa Hepner, along with her partner Guy Mossman, (of ) have been given real-time access to the ViaCyte labs and are following the progress of this unprecedented medical endeavor that has the potential to change the lives of millions. The story of has us all on the edges of our seats, and here is Lisa Hepner to tell it. : You said that your partner, Guy Mossman, was the one who encouraged you to tackle the subject matter after a difficult hypo in the night. Although you’ve had Type 1 for 25 years, you were hesitant to take on the project. Why is that? : I think I wanted to think of my chronic illness; I didn’t want it to define me. My attitude has been that I wanted to focus on my career, my family and my friends. I was on my own when I was diagnosed at age 21, studying at the University of Edinburgh in 1991. I always felt like it [diabetes] was mine alone. And it’s so exhausting living with it every day, I didn’t want to dedicate any more effort and brain resources to it. [She laughs.] Maybe I was drinking the Type 1 Kool-Aid of wanting to keep it invisible. And making a film certainly makes it public. While I shared the fact I had diabetes with people before, I didn’t stand on a soap box like this — until now. : Your documentary  (2003) premiered at the UN and aired on PBS. It was a big deal to say the least. How is this film compare in terms of scope? Is it more personal because of your diagnosis? : This is a  bigger film than that one. has the potential to make a huge difference in people’s lives and how they deal with the disease. We also hope to change how stem cell research is perceived. To be honest, diabetes is not a sexy disease to support. How many blue ribbons do you see at the Golden Globes? I’m not pitting diseases against each other. But I think maybe people take diabetes less seriously because it’s an invisible disease to many, and the smaller the devices get that we use to stay alive, the more invisible it appears to others. Only when you are touched by it do you see it and get it. It’s a ton of work to do a passion project like this, but it does hit close to home. I have a lot of people donating their time to the film because they either have Type 1 or someone they love has it. There’s been so much interest and support from the Type 1 community. : It’s said that one donated human embryo might be the cure for millions of people suffering from diabetes. How is this possible? : It all starts with a blastocyst or 5-day old embryo. These microscopic embryos are incredibly powerful as they can differentiate into any type of cell in your body. So in the case of ViaCyte, they received donated blastocysts from a couple who had gone through IVF and who decided to donate their leftover embryos to science. It took several years, but ViaCyte’s researchers were able to create beta cells from this stem cell line that originated from one donated embryo. Incredible, right? : So esare implanted into a patient (this is called islet cell replacement therapy), and the hope is that the beta cells not only survive but also multiply (as stem cells do) and mature into a properly-functioning (insulin-producing) islet cells of the pancreas. Now that 12 patients have had the cells implanted, is there any sign that the trial has been successful in some way, even in its early phase? In January, Paul Laikind, CEO of ViaCyte, announced that one of the patients in Cohort 1 showed cell survival 12 weeks after the VC-01 device was implanted in him. This is a significant finding because the huge hurdle for encapsulation has always been to keep the transplanted beta cells alive and reproducing. :  : It’s a great question. I would immediately say it’s because a lack of education and understanding of the process. If these microscopic embryos weren’t being donated to science, they would probably be discarded. Isn’t it better to use them for cure research? : People are weary of companies that claim to have “a cure” for diabetes, having waited for decades and been disappointed by unfulfilled promises yte hopes to have a cure, but what type of cure are we talking about? Is it a “functional cure” or a “biological cure”?  If ViaCyte’s product works, it will mean the end of insulin injections and blood sugar testing. That sounds like a practical cure to me.   : It’s groundbreaking that ViaCyte has made it to human trial (you’ve mentioned that 5 in 5,000 drugs get approval from the FDA for clinical trial). How long will the trial take? : We are looking to release the film in 2017, but it’s difficult to say when the trial ends — it all depends on the results. : What do you want to tell people before they see the film? : That it’s not just a film about diabetes. It’s about a universal quest to make difference, and to help millions of people live better lives. ViaCyte is breaking new ground in the field of embryonic stem cell research (regenerative medicine), and they are showing early signs of success. This is amazing as their findings will not only help people with insulin-dependent diabetes, but they will also help people with a myriad of other chronic diseases. Fundamentally, we have access to a great story, and we can’t wait to share it. : What do you hope — if there is one thing — that people take away from the film? : That diabetes should be taken seriously, and that the scary headlines shouldn’t be ignored. It’s an invisible disease that can shorten your life by 12-18 years. We need to support more cure research, specifically stem cell research. : What have you learned in the process of making the film that really inspired you or gave you a deeper understanding of Type 1? : In the first phase of ViaCyte’s trial, the patients are receiving a sub-therapeutic dose of insulin-producing cells. So they won’t see much of a difference in their blood sugar control, if any. And because they’ve been a part of the trial’s early phase, they can’t participate later when the patients get enough insulin-producing cells to impact their blood sugars. So these first patients are truly heroes. They are “taking one for the team,” to test the safety of the device while not benefitting from it, at least not right away. Beyond Type 1 is a proud outreach and branding partner of The Human Trial. As a partner, we have contributed financially to the production, and will work to promote and engage viewers of the documentary upon its release.  Other work from Lisa Hepner and Guy Mossman at ViaCyte is a grantee of Beyond Type 1. .

60b234fc-bb61-4452-8e95-2631e8a44d9b,"Ask D'Mine: On Easter, Beta Cell Resurrection with Diabetes? — Welcome back to our weekly diabetes advice column, , hosted by veteran type 1 and diabetes author  in New Mexico. Here, you can ask all the burning questions you may not want to ask your doctor. Today, we’re taking a reader question with an interesting tie-in to Easter. {Got your own questions? Email us at } So the Easter season got me thinking about resurrection, only in this case—rather than a two-thousand-year-old religious miracle—I’m wondering what hope there is for the resurrection of my (insulin-producing) . What’s the latest on the cure front, Wil? There’s a metaphorical Easter Basket full of potential cures. And just like the eggs in the typical basket, each one looks pretty different from the next. Here’s a recap of a few of my favorites, just to show you how widely different the colors of possible cures are: This is a holiday weekend, so let’s start with a cocktail! And in keeping with the quasi-biblical theme today, this drink is on Mount Sinai Hospital researchers. They’ve combined two classes of drugs to create a cocktail that induced “the highest rate of proliferation ever observed in adult human beta cells,” . What sort of rate would that be? Well, don’t put all your eggs in one basket, but this is looking pretty good: Five to eight percent per day. At that speed it wouldn’t take long to re-grow a full complement of beta cells. But, wait, you say. I don’t have any beta cells left! How will this super-sizing formula help me? Well, the researchers that their cocktail works on both normal human beta cells stem cell-derived human beta cells. Because it’s Easter, you can think of a stem cell as a beta cell egg. So if you don’t have any beta cells left, a few of these beta cell eggs can be added first, hatched into chicks, and then be turned loose to be fruitful and multiply. So when can we order the cocktail? Well… There are some problems. Apparently, this pair of drugs affect other organs in the body, too, so the Mount Sinai team is trying to figure out how to deliver the cocktail directly to the beta cells. Or maybe they don’t have to, because on the other side of the country, the folks at Stanford may have already solved that problem…  I find this ironic, in that we just covered John Burd’s OTC with zinc—which he says has the potential to stop type 2 diabetes in its tracks—but zinc is back in the diabetes news again, this time with implications for us type 1s. Instead of a cure-all, however, this time zinc is posed to serve as a unique transport medium to deliver targeted therapy to the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Here’s the deal: zinc is like cat nip for beta cells. Yep. They suck up zinc at a rate of 1,000 times more than the surrounding cells. That got Stanford endocrinologist and researcher thinking that zinc could be used to guide targeted regeneration meds to the beta cells. Think of it as the other side of the radioactive iodine coin, where the thyroid’s thirst for iodine to deliver killing radiation to thyroid tissue to wipe out cancer cells without killing everything else in the neighborhood. And speaking of cancer, Annes’ team—who apparently haven’t talked to the Mount Sinai team—are now linking the zinc to a cancer drug called JNK inhibitor CC-401, which to help regenerate beta cells. The zinc is needed because the CC-401, as well as boosting beta cells, apparently flips on the switches of unexpressed genes throughout the body. The scientists dryly say that this could cause serious side effects. I picture Bruce Banner turning into The Incredible Hulk. There’s still a long way to go, but the stuff you spray in your throat for the common cold may someday guide beta cell fertilizer to the barren fields of your pancreas. Which, of course, brings many of our readers back to bemoaning the crucifixion of all their beta cells by the immune system. What good will fertilizer do if there are no sprouts? There are two things to consider here, and the first is that just like the famous Monty Python “” scene, maybe not all the beta cells after all. Or if they are, maybe it doesn’t matter as much as we thought, because University of Miami scientists might have just over-turned the last few decades of thinking when it comes to how beta cells grow in humans. They’ve beta cell seeds in the pancreas, that just need to be watered to grow. Well, OK, they didn’t call them seeds. They called them progenitor cells. But you get the idea. Or how about, instead of taking three, four, or five shots a day, you just take one and you’re done? Actually, this won’t work for those of us who already have type 1 diabetes, but as a way to eradicate T1D diabetes going forward, scientists in Stockholm are working on a diabetes vaccine. Hey, it worked for smallpox and polio. In a pilot study by the company , their lymph node-injected vaccine Diamyd held 11 out of 12 newly diagnosed type 1s in their honeymoon period for by preserving a portion of the endogenous insulin production. More of a partial cure than a full cure, it nonetheless greatly reduced the amount of injected insulin needed to maintain normal blood sugar, and is thus a step in the right direction. is underway currently. So how does the vaccine work? It’s a so-called “antigen-specific intralymphatic immunotherapy” based on the protein GAD65. Sorry you asked, aren’t you? It’s high-tech bordering on magic, but the vaccine reprogram the immune cells to leave the beta cells quite safe. Right now, it’s only being investigated with recently diagnosed type 1s, but I can’t help but wonder how it would work as a preventative vaccine for those at high risk. And going forward, there may be a way this vaccine could help those of us who already have T1D. In the spirit of Easter, which is a religious holiday marking death and resurrection, we should note that in the diabetes world, there is some evidence that the dead can be raised. I’m talking about the here, where cadaveric pancreatic tissue—that’s pancreas parts from recently dead folks—is implanted into the living to continue life. Both the life of the tissue, and of the recipient. And there’s more: Like the famous curing touch of you-know-who, these resurrected cells confer a miracle cure to the recipient. The Edmonton Protocol cures type 1 diabetes. Of course, it comes with its own biblical plague of locusts. To keep cells alive in a body that they weren’t born into, the recipient has to take powerful anti-rejection drugs. Permanently. And the transplant does nothing to address the underlying (and still not fully understood) causes of type 1 diabetes. There’s nothing to prevent a relapse, and in fact, most Edmonton recipients T1 again down the road. Still, researchers continue to dig into this approach, and if one of the other eggs in the Easter basket—maybe the vaccine, for instance—could be combined with the Edmonton Protocol in the future, our dead beta cells might have the chance to rise again, and stay alive.

The findings suggest that it is possible to achieve remission without intensive lifestyle interventions or extreme calorie restrictions. To find out whether less intensive interventions work, a team of researchers studied data from the ADDITION-Cambridge trial, a prospective cohort study of 867 people with newly diagnosed diabetes aged 40 and 69 years recruited from general practices in the eastern region. The researchers found that 257 participants (30 per cent) were in remission after five years. People who achieved weight loss of 10 per cent or more within the first five years after diagnosis were more than twice as likely to go into remission compared to people who maintained the same weight. “We’ve known for some time now that it’s possible to send diabetes into remission using fairly drastic measures such as intensive weight loss programmes and extreme calorie restriction,” said Dr Hajira Dambha-Miller. “These interventions can be very challenging to individuals and difficult to achieve. But, our results suggest that it may be possible to get rid of [type 2] diabetes, for at least five years, with a more modest weight loss of 10 per cent. This will be more motivating and hence more achievable for many people.” The research paper was published in .

Since you need to lose weight fast, instead of starving yourself, just eat more of other foods and cut down on your carbs intake.   A ketogenic diet may work for you as it forces your body to burn fat instead of carbohydrates for energy. This accelerates weight loss and may send your diabetes into remission. This will help you lose a lot of weight. But again, don’t starve yourself. Just eat healthy. Have low-calorie foods. Veggies and fruits are a good choice. These will fill you up and prevent you from eating too much. Have a lot of protein and high-fibre foods. But whatever you do, choose a diet that you can sustain. Losing weight for quick gains and then going back to normal will not help. You have to be consistent to enjoy the remission of your diabetes. It has to become a part of your daily routine.

c354fd43-5555-4723-8210-8ff361b35d5e,"When kind people like you donate to Diabetes NSW & ACT you are helping to ensure no-one has to deal with diabetes alone. Thanks to your generosity, we can deliver advocacy support, psychological care and up to date expert advice to people living with diabetes. All while challenging public perceptions about diabetes and searching for better treatments and a cure. When you consider that people living with diabetes are two to three times more likely than the general population to suffer from depression, having access to psychological care is critical to their health and wellbeing. That’s why we have a Psychologist on Call – for people who are experiencing, or at risk of, mental health issues like diabetes distress and depression. The service provides specialist psychological support to people living with diabetes, their families and carers. The psychologist also provides advice to allied health professionals like dietitians and diabetes educators – including our own staff – so they are better equipped to help their patients too. Tasnia, who lives with type 1 diabetes, welcomed the news that our Psychologist on Call is on hand to help people by phone or email. “Unfortunately, educators and dietitians don’t have the time to talk to you about your mental health issues. You can feel so alone. So it’s really important as a person with diabetes to be able to check in with a psychologist regularly about how things are going.” Diabetes NSW & ACT lobbies governments to draw attention to barriers that people living with diabetes can face in their personal and business lives. Our policy and advocacy team works on individual complaints and common problems people living with diabetes routinely face. For example, hospital rules that prevent self-care of diabetes which can put people’s health in grave danger. One of the calls to our Helpline was from the husband of a woman whose diabetes was not managed well in hospital. He told us, “She wasn’t allowed to inject her own insulin. It wasn’t being given at the right time. Her blood glucose levels weren’t being tested often enough. She collapsed because she wasn’t getting her meds on time. They’ve had to rush her to emergency.” When someone from our diabetes community comes to us with stories of diabetes management Rebekah Henricksen, our Policy and Advocacy Manager, is the person who champions their cause. Here is what Rebekah says about her work and its importance for our community, “When a person is diagnosed with diabetes, they are diagnosed with a health issue.  But what they are often faced with is a lot of non-health issues that surround their diabetes.  Diabetes is hard enough to manage without the additional difficulties of discrimination, access to services, increased bureaucratic hurdles, isolation, and prejudice.  When a person contacts us about one of these issues, we help them through an individual problem.  But, if we have many people contacting us about the same issue, we know that there is something wrong in the system that is making life harder for people living with diabetes.  We will then use the experience of these people to try to change the system and make life a little bit easier for other people living with diabetes.” Diabetes NSW & ACT supports and develops outstanding diabetes research to help find better treatments and a possible cure so that future generations can live a life free from diabetes and its complications. Each year we award grants to a range of research projects focused on studies across the spectrum of diabetes prevention, management and finding a cure. “Our research can only make progress if funding is provided to help us. My own lab is totally dependent on grant funding. Your donations are absolutely critical to finding better treatments for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. On behalf of all diabetes researchers, I sincerely thank you and assure you that without your continued support, we cannot make the discoveries that will ultimately translate to a better, healthier lifestyle for people with diabetes.” Associate Professor Charmaine Simeonovic, Grant recipient The DiRECT study, funded by Diabetes UK, has demonstrated for the first time that remission of type 2 diabetes is possible and the long held view of diabetes being a ‘life sentence’ isn’t necessarily accurate. The results of the DiRECT study are extremely encouraging which is why we are looking to establish the Australian T2 Remission Project. The purpose of the project will be to demonstrate that an intensive, supported, weight loss program can lead to the remission of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes NSW & ACT believes that if the same results are achieved in Australia as in the UK, then the treatment of type 2 diabetes and the longer term health of the country will be transformed. That’s why we want to conduct the study in Australia. “This ground-breaking research has major implications for Australia both for the health of people with type 2 diabetes and the cost savings achievable, if we can replicate this study and deliver comparable results,” said T2 Remission Project Program Director, Ian Corless. “Securing the funding to run this project will give new hope to people living with type 2 diabetes and a life without the complications of diabetes for many. Even if remission isn’t achieved, participants who lose weight can expect to lower their blood pressure and cholesterol, need fewer medications, and enjoy a higher quality of life – all of which benefit, the individual, society and the public purse.” Donate today to deliver assistance to people living with diabetes Our Ambassador Program currently has members of all ages and at all stages of their diabetes journey, each of whom has an inspiring story to share. We hope they provide support and encouragement and help ... A gift in your Will is a gift that lives on.

31cbd3af-27f5-46bf-98f6-bcdb0d8a129a,"My name is Jonathan Berman. I am 15 years old. I live beyond Type 1 … by being an advocate for diabetes research to help scientists find a cure for everyone living with Type 1 diabetes. I was diagnosed in 2007, when I was 7 years old. I remember going trick-or-treating and then fainting in the bathroom in the early morning. My mom took me to the doctors and then to the hospital and I was bummed I was missing my 1st grade play!  Then the ER Doctor came in and said, “It’s Type 1 diabetes.” I remember not knowing what that meant, but I found out really fast when I got my first injection. After being diagnosed, we found out I had a tendency to pass out around needles. I know, just my luck that I had to learn how to adjust to needles when I was first diagnosed. But I encouraged my local Children’s Hospital to put reclining chairs in all of their Endocrine offices, so when children and teens come in to get a pump or CGM, they can feel more comfortable and safe during the process. I’m glad they liked the idea — the chairs are really comfortable! As we all know there are good days and bad days, but I really try to stay focused on the positive and just do what I have to do and be myself. My mom has always encouraged me to believe in the concept, “Be a part of the change you want to see in the world.” So every year I raise funds for a cure for different diabetes organizations. I try to make it fun and unique (local movie theatre night, shoe-drive benefitting families in Africa, an online store for a cure, school fundraisers and most recently The Power Of One campaign). With the help of my family and friends I realized that the sky is the limit with finding ways to raise awareness and funds for diabetes research. It’s really cool to be a part of something that makes a difference in the world. In 2012, when my family visited Miami, Florida, we reached out to The Diabetes Research Institute to learn more. We were invited for a tour. It changed my life that day. To see the scientists in their labs, to see islet cells through the microscope, to be up close and personal with the scientists that are working day and night on a cure for everyone, was an experience I will never forget. It gave me new hope for a cure. I recommend everyone living with Type 1 diabetes to tour DRI. While there, I also signed up for a class they offer called “Mastering Your Diabetes.” It was another game-changer for me. I spent a week with other children and teens living with Type 1, learning how to better manage my diabetes. I learned about carb counting, diabetes apps, incorporating exercise and more. I made life-long friends living with Type 1 diabetes. It was also the place where I learned how to give myself my own insulin injections and I learned the importance of managing my disease and living well. When I left the DRI, I left a more confident person with even more hope for a cure and wanting to give back to the DRI. Because the DRI is in Florida, I came up with the idea of custom flip-flops for a cure, which was a lot of fun and it eventually led me to create an online store for a cure filled with DRI merchandise! When I saw how I could make a difference and be part of a cure, I wanted to do more. In 2013, inspired by what President Roosevelt did  in 1940, by asking everyone to donate one dime (leading to the March of Dimes and a cure for Polio), I created The Power Of One campaign … One person, One dollar, One step closer to a cure. In July, 2014, I launched my campaign for the DRI at the Children With Diabetes – Friends For Life Conference. I started asking everyone I knew and met to donate $1. And then I asked them to ask everyone they knew to donate $1. The response was amazing. I even asked local businesses and schools to use PowerOfOne canisters to collect $1. To date, The PowerOfOne has raised $12,000 for the DRI and $5,000 for JDRF and it keeps going strong. I’ve made many new friends by choosing to be an advocate, too. I hope more teen advocates get involved so they can experience being part of something that makes a difference in the world and experience what it is like to Live Beyond Type 1, by doing something you like to do while advocating and helping scientists find a cure! WRITTEN BY Jonathan Berman, POSTED 12/01/15, UPDATED 10/24/18 Jonathan is a fifteen-year-old from Philadelphia, PA. He was diagnosed with T1D on Halloween 2007 when he was seven years old. He has two awesome older sisters and two dogs. A few years ago, he got an insulin pump and a CGM which are tools that really help him manage his T1D. After being diagnosed, he and his family found out he had a tendency to pass out around needles! Jonathan is mainly known for three things: First, he is a huge exotic car enthusiast who, despite not being old enough to drive yet, knows way too much about cars and hopes to someday own a Ferrari. He is also an avid fisherman and could fish all day and night if his parents would let him. And finally, as a T1D advocate! Jonathan has been told he is good at putting the “fun” in fundraising! He likes to be creative and unique so his friends and family want to be a part of something fun while also supporting T1D.

Previous research has indicated that by following an intensive, low-calorie diet of 700 calories per day for 8 weeks. Studies have not shown, however, whether less extreme interventions can achieve the same result. To address this question, from the ADDITION-Cambridge trial, which involved 867 people ages 40 to 69 with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. The researchers found that 30% (257) of the subjects were in remission at a five-year follow-up. Those who had lost 10% or more of their weight within the first five years of diagnosis were more than twice as likely to go into remission compared to people who had maintained their weight. “We’ve known for some time now that it’s possible to send diabetes into remission using fairly drastic measures such as intensive weight loss programmes and extreme calorie restriction,” noted Hajira Dambha-Miller, MRCGP, PhD, FHEA, from the Department of Public Health and Primary Care. “These interventions can be very challenging to individuals and difficult to achieve. But, our results suggest that it may be possible to get rid of diabetes, for at least five years, with a more modest weight loss of 10%. This will be more motivating and hence more achievable for many people.” Want to learn more about type 2 diabetes remission?

You can go back to this later in your Research suggests there could be different forms of Type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes could be broken down into different subtypes, according to research published today in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology. Scientists in Sweden and Finland have found that Type 2 diabetes could be separated out into four subtypes, which have distinct characteristics. This suggests that people with Type 2 diabetes might be affected by their diabetes in different ways and benefit from different treatments. Go to the research in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology.  The researchers studied nearly 15,000 people with diabetes across Sweden and Finland. They examined factors like body mass index, blood glucose control and how well insulin-producing cells in the pancreas were working. Of the four types, they found the more common two were linked to older age or being overweight. The other two less common types were linked to a higher risk of diabetes-related complications. At the moment, we think of Type 2 diabetes as one condition. But this research highlights the fact that there are likely to be differences within this.  With almost 3.7 million people diagnosed with diabetes in the UK, of which around 90 per cent have Type 2, it’s unlikely that everyone has exactly the same condition.  Moving away from one-size-fits all to a more personalised approach could mean better care for people with Type 2 diabetes. From a more precise diagnosis, through to tailored treatments to manage blood glucose levels and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. For example, some might benefit from starting insulin therapy earlier after diagnosis, or perhaps being monitored more closely for complications. This study is the first step in helping us understand the breakdown of Type 2 diabetes. But there’s still a lot to discover about potential subtypes before we get to the point where we can tailor individual treatments. Dr Emily Burns, Head of Research Communications, said: “Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are very different conditions, but we don’t yet know enough about the subtypes that could exist within them. Finding those subtypes will help us personalise treatments and potentially reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications in the future.  “This research takes a promising step toward breaking down Type 2 diabetes in more detail, but we still need to know more about these subtypes before we can understand what this means for people living with the condition. For example, whether we’d find the same subtypes in people of different ethnicity or nationality.”  Scientists across the world are also looking at whether subtypes of Type 1 diabetes could exist. For example, research suggests that some people have a form of Type 1 diabetes that progresses much faster, or more slowly, than others. So we hope to move toward personalised medicines for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in the future.   Putting Type 2 diabetes into remission with a low calorie diet Our strategy What we do How we produce diabetes information How you can help Contact us Annual reports Our history How we are governed Board of Trustees Council of People with Diabetes Council of Healthcare Professionals Executive Team Legal structure & constitution Patron and Ambassadors Legal information Terms of website use Acceptable use policy Information policy Cookie policy Privacy policy Links policy Legal disclaimer Safeguarding Whistleblowing Policy Gender pay gap Someone is diagnosed with diabetes every two minutes.

8da8af7e-3d57-42ec-a3c3-32f980ff6b59,"Whether you or a loved one has been recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes[1] or you’re a seasoned veteran of managing the condition, you’re likely to have questions about the best approach to management. Get top type 1 diabetes questions and answers here. Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that make insulin[2]. When this happens, the pancreas can no longer make insulin, a hormone that helps move glucose, or sugar, from the blood into cells to be used for energy. As a result, glucose levels in the blood rise above normal. High blood glucose levels[3] can cause damage to the body, both in the short term and the long term, and left untreated, can lead to coma and even death. People who have type 1 diabetes must take insulin[4] in order to survive. Researchers don’t know the exact cause of type 1 diabetes, but they believe that genes play a role (in other words, type 1 diabetes can run in the family). Also, environmental factors, such as viruses, may trigger the onset of type 1; in particular, the B4 strain of the coxsackie B virus, German measles, mumps and rotavirus are more likely than other viruses to lead to type 1 diabetes. What is the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes[5]? Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are chronic conditions in which the body can’t properly store and use glucose for energy. Glucose levels can build up in the blood — rather than entering cells to be used for fuel — and can lead to serious complications[6]. But this is where type 1 and type 2 diabetes part ways. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks the beta cells[7] (the cells that produce insulin) in the pancreas. This means that a person with type 1 must take insulin in order to survive. In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas makes insulin but the body has a hard time using it properly. This is called insulin resistance[8]. Lifestyle changes, such as weight loss[9], a healthy eating plan[10], and regular physical activity[11] can help manage type 2 diabetes, although most people with this condition also need medication, including insulin, to help keep blood glucose levels within a safe range. It’s a fairly common misconception that type 2 diabetes can eventually turn into type 1 diabetes. However, type 2 diabetes is a very different condition than type 1 diabetes. Yes, both “types” of diabetes cause high blood glucose, but the causes of each type are unrelated. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, which means that the body’s immune system “attacks” the cells in the pancreas that make insulin[2]. Because these cells can no longer make insulin, a person with type 1 must take insulin to survive. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes is a condition of insulin resistance[8] — the body makes enough insulin but the cells can’t use it properly. Healthy food choices, regular physical activity, weight loss and medication are ways to manage type 2. The only way for type 2 diabetes to become type 1 diabetes is if the type of diabetes is misdiagnosed. And the reality is that some people are told they have type 2 diabetes when they actually have type 1 diabetes, especially if they are adults who are overweight. In addition, there is yet another type of diabetes called latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA)[12] that shares characteristics of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. LADA, which tends to appear in adults over the age of 30, is actually a slow but progressive form of autoimmune diabetes that eventually requires insulin injections. What are the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes? Unlike type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes symptoms generally appear fairly quickly (e.g., weeks or months) and are severe. Typical signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes include: • Constant thirst • Frequent urination • Increased hunger • Blurry vision • Unexplained weight loss • Fatigue and weakness • Cuts or sores that are slow to heal • More infections than usual Other symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and trouble breathing.

Type 1 diabetes used to be called juvenile diabetes because it was thought that only children and adolescents got this condition. This condition is typically diagnosed in people before the age of 40, but some people are diagnosed at an older age[14]. To muddy the waters even further, there is yet another type of diabetes called latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA)[12], which is a slow but progressive form of diabetes that is diagnosed during adulthood. Initially, LADA appears as type 2 diabetes. However, like type 1 diabetes, LADA is an autoimmune condition. This means that, eventually, the beta cells[7] will stop producing insulin and insulin injections are necessary. There’s no cure — yet — for type 1 diabetes, but it’s treatable with insulin[15]. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas no longer makes insulin. This means that a person with type 1 must replace the insulin that the body no longer produces. Insulin can be taken in several ways: by injection (using a pen or a syringe), by an inhaler or by using an insulin pump, which is an electronic device that administers insulin. There are many different types of insulin available: rapid-, short-, intermediate- and long-acting insulin, which act in a way that more closely resembles how the body’s own insulin would act. If you are injecting insulin with a syringe or a pen, you will likely need to take both a short- and a long-acting insulin. If you use an insulin pump, you only use a short-acting insulin. Your doctor or diabetes educator[16] will help you determine the best way to give yourself insulin, as well as the best types of insulin to use. In addition to insulin, an individualized eating plan[17] and activity plan[18] play an important role in helping you to manage your blood glucose levels. Checking your blood glucose with a meter[19] or using a continuous glucose monitor[20] are crucial for you and your health-care team[21] to know how your diabetes treatment plan is working and if any changes are needed. How can I manage my blood glucose levels if I have type 1 diabetes? Finding out that you have type 1 diabetes can be scary and overwhelming. Learning how to manage it can be challenging and, at times, even frustrating. The good news is that managing diabetes is definitely doable! There are millions of people who have type 1 diabetes and are doing great. However, there are some steps you need to take to figure out the best way to manage your diabetes. The first step? Learn about your diabetes. You can’t manage something if you don’t know what’s happening. Ask your doctor for a referral to a diabetes educator[16] or look into diabetes programs at your local hospital or health center. You’ll need to take insulin[4], and your doctor may refer you to an endocrinologist, which is a doctor who specializes in diabetes to prescribe an insulin regimen that works best for you. Ideally, the endocrinologist will have a diabetes educator in the office who will show you the ropes on how to inject your insulin, how it works, when to take it and what to do if your blood sugar drops too low[22] or goes too high[23]. You should also meet with a dietitian or attend some nutrition classes to learn about how food affects your blood glucose and how to balance your carbohydrate intake[24] to keep your blood glucose within your target range. Checking your blood sugar with a meter[25] is vital for you to know if your blood glucose is at a safe level — many people with type 1 diabetes check before and after meals, and before going to bed, as well as before and after exercising[26]. It may seem like a lot of finger-sticks — but it’s great information for you and your health-care team to understand if your insulin is working for you. You might eventually look into using an insulin pump to deliver insulin (no more injections) and/or a continuous glucose monitor[20] (no more finger-sticks). Find out about the different tests and exams that you’ll need, as well, such as an A1C[27] test and an annual dilated eye exam[28], for example. Keep all of your doctor appointments and go to your appointments prepared with questions[29]. Finally, realize that diabetes education is a lifelong process. There is always something new to learn, so seek out classes, websites, support groups and diabetes publications so that you can stay on top of new treatments and research. What are some common complications[30] of type 1 diabetes? Type 1 diabetes can lead to high blood glucose, or hyperglycemia[31]. While it’s not possible — or even necessary — to have perfectly controlled blood sugars when you have diabetes, blood sugars that are consistently high (meaning, above your target range[32]) can lead to long-term complications. The longer you live with diabetes and the less controlled your blood sugars are, the higher your risk of complications. These complications, if left untreated, can be serious and even life-threatening. The most common complications of type 1 diabetes are as follows: This includes heart attack, stroke, chest pain and narrowing of the arteries. Also called nephropathy, the filtering system of the kidneys can be damaged by high blood glucose, leading to kidney failure or end-stage kidney disease, requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant. Also called neuropathy, nerve damage occurs because high blood glucose levels affect the arteries that keep your nerves healthy. Peripheral neuropathy is nerve damage that occurs outside of the brain and spinal cord, primarily affecting the nerves in your hands and feet. Numbness, tingling, pain and loss of sensation are symptoms of neuropathy. But all of the nerves in the body can be affected by diabetes, including nerves in your digestive tract, your reproductive organs, and your heart. High blood glucose levels can damage the blood vessels of the retina, causing diabetic retinopathy. Left untreated, it can lead to blindness. Other eye problems are more likely to occur due to diabetes, as well, such as glaucoma, cataracts and macular edema. High blood glucose levels can cause damage to both the arteries and nerves in the feet, putting your feet at risk for infection and possible amputation if left untreated. Other complications include certain skin conditions[38], gum disease and dental problems[39], hearing loss[40], and bone and joint disorders[41]. Try not to get disheartened, though. Complications can be prevented with good self-management and medical care, and today, there are better, more effective treatments to slow their progression. Currently, there is no cure for type 1 diabetes. Interestingly, in some people who are newly diagnosed with this condition, it seems like their diabetes has gone away! This happens because the pancreas may still be making enough insulin to keep blood glucose levels in a safe range. Called the “honeymoon period” (because it doesn’t last forever), you may find that you don’t have to take any insulin for a few weeks or even months. After a while, though, the pancreas peters out and you’ll need to start taking insulin again. So, despite the respite from the honeymoon period, type 1 diabetes doesn’t go away. But researchers are working to find a cure, including ways to turn immature cells into beta cells[7] that make insulin, for example, along with immunotherapy that would kill the immune cells that attack the pancreas in the first place. An eating plan[17] (sometimes called a meal plan) can help you manage your diabetes, along with taking insulin[42], fitting in physical activity[43], and checking your blood glucose[44]. Many people find that trying to figure out what, when and how much to eat is the hardest part of managing diabetes, however. There is no one “diet” for people who have type 1 diabetes. Instead, your eating plan should be based on a number of factors, including your age, gender, level of physical activity, lifestyle, cultural preferences and other conditions that you may have, such as high blood pressure[45]. In addition, the American Diabetes Association[46] recognizes that many different types of eating patterns can work well for people with diabetes, including a vegetarian plan[47], a Mediterranean-style plan[48], and even a low-carbohydrate eating plan[49]. When you’re first diagnosed with diabetes, it’s helpful to meet with a dietitian who has experience with diabetes. He or she can tailor an eating plan that works for you, but that also takes into consideration the type of insulin you take as well as when you take it. Very likely, the emphasis will be on controlling the amount of carbohydrate foods you eat, such as bread, pasta, rice, fruit and milk, since carbohydrate is the nutrient that has the most effect on your blood glucose. Carbohydrate counting[50] is an easy way to plan out meals and include variety in your food choices. Your eating plan should provide a balance of foods, including vegetables, fruit, whole grains and starches, healthy protein foods and healthy fats, not just for blood glucose management, but also to make sure you are getting the nutrients you need for overall health. Your eating plan may include snacks[51], although with the many newer forms of insulin available, snacks are often not necessary. And if you choose, you can even fit sweets into your eating plan. A dietitian can also help you fit in favorite foods, plan for holidays and navigate eating out at restaurants. In general, what you eat is what your spouse or family can eat, too, so there is generally no need to prepare separate meals for yourself. Insulin is a hormone that is made in the pancreas. Specifically, there are special cells in the pancreas, called beta cells[7], that produce insulin. There are also alpha cells in the pancreas that make glucagon[53], another hormone. But back to insulin: when insulin is made in the beta cells, it initially is in the form of “proinsulin,” which then splits into C-peptide[54] and insulin. C-peptide plays a key role in the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, as well as diabetes treatment, because it indicates how much insulin the pancreas is making. Insulin helps the body use glucose from the carbohydrate in food for energy, and prevents glucose levels in the blood from rising too high. Insulin attaches to cells to absorb glucose from the bloodstream, much like a key that opens a lock. Once inside the cells, glucose is then used for energy. What happens if you have more glucose in your blood than the cells need? Insulin will funnel that extra glucose in your liver where it’s stored. If your blood glucose drops too low or if you need more fuel for, say, exercise, glucagon signals the liver to release that stored glucose. If you have type 1 diabetes, you need to replace the insulin that your body no longer makes. Insulin can be injected, using a syringe or an insulin pen; it can also be infused by using an insulin pump. There is no insulin “pill” at this time. There are different types of insulin that mimic how insulin works in the body; for example, rapid-acting insulin starts to work in 5–15 minutes and is typically taken before you eat a meal. Intermediate and long-acting insulins start to work more slowly, and are used to help keep blood glucose levels steady between meals and overnight while you’re sleeping[55]. You will likely need to use two different types of insulin to help you manage your blood glucose. Your doctor and diabetes educator[16] should work with you to decide the best type and amount of insulin to take, and give you guidance on how to adjust your insulin for changes in food and physical activity[43], and for times when you need more insulin, such as when you are sick[56] or under stress[57]. You don’t have to go it alone when you have diabetes. In fact, the more support that you get from your health-care team, family and friends, the easier it will be to successfully manage your diabetes. But who should be on your health-care team? For starters, your primary-care provider — a physician, physician’s assistant or nurse practitioner, for example — is the gatekeeper and can help coordinate your care. Ideally, you should have an endocrinologist, which is a doctor who specializes in the treatment of diabetes. A certified diabetes care and education specialist[59] (formerly known as a certified diabetes educator) can teach you how to inject insulin[60] or use an insulin pump, check your blood glucose[61], and make sense of your blood glucose readings[62]. A dietitian can help you develop an eating plan[17] that works with your lifestyle and helps to keep your blood glucose levels within your target range[32]. An ophthalmologist can provide you with annual dilated eye exams to detect (and treat, if necessary) eye problems, such as diabetic retinopathy[63]. If you have complications[64], you may need to see a cardiologist (heart specialist), a nephrologist (kidney[65] specialist), neurologist (nerve[66] specialist) or a podiatrist (foot care[67] specialist). Your pharmacist can help you learn more about the medications that you may need to take. Finally, because you may feel overwhelmed, discouraged or even depressed[68] about having diabetes, a mental health provider can be an invaluable member of your team to provide you with support. You might be more comfortable finding support from other people who live with type 1 diabetes, whether that’s from a support group or an online community. If you aren’t sure how to put together your own team, talk with your primary-care provider. Also, look for resources in your community — for example, your local hospital may have a diabetes program. You can also call your local office of the American Diabetes Association[69]. They can point you to programs and specialists in your community, as well. Finally, remember that you are the center of your health-care team. Don’t be afraid to ask questions and speak up if something isn’t working for you. Your team is there to work together to support you. Diabetes self-management involves taking your insulin[15] and other medications, eating healthfully[70], staying active[71] and, of course, checking your blood sugar[72]. But how do you know if everything you’re doing is working for you? And how can you minimize your risk of complications[64]? There are certain tests and exams that you’ll need to help you and your health-care team know how you’re doing. These include: This is a number that measures your average blood glucose over the past 2–3 months. For most people with diabetes, the A1C goal[74] is less than 7%. Get your A1C checked two to four times a year. To help lower your risk of heart disease[76], stroke and kidney problems[77], it’s important to keep your blood pressure in a safe range, typically less than 140/90. High cholesterol and triglycerides (blood fats) raise your risk of heart disease. Your lipids include total cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides. In general, total cholesterol should be under 200; LDL less than 100; HDL greater than 40 for men and greater than 50 for women; and triglycerides less than 150. A microalbumin test checks your urine for protein; if your microalbumin is above 30, it may be an early sign of kidney damage. A dilated eye exam can detect early signs of diabetic retinopathy[63], as well as other eye problems related to diabetes. Make sure you have a dilated eye exam at least once a year or as ordered by your eye care specialist. Checking your feet daily is important to detect cuts, sores, redness or swelling. But your doctor should check your feet at least once a year during a regular office visit to check for problems with circulation, sensation, foot structure and infection. Remove your shoes and socks at each visit to remind your doctor to check your feet. Diabetes can affect the health of your gums and teeth, and gum disease is more common in people with diabetes. Have regular dental exams and teeth cleanings at least twice a year to detect and treat gum disease and other oral health issues. While not actual “tests,” it’s important to make sure you receive certain vaccinations if you have type 1 diabetes. These include a yearly influenza vaccine[82], a pneumonia vaccine, a hepatitis vaccine, and a shingles vaccine. Other vaccines may be recommended for you, as well. Make sure you talk with your doctor or endocrinologists about the tests and exams that you need. Ask about your results and be sure you that you know what your goals are, as well.

ffa4cc23-0cc1-4cd2-ba36-3d00870461fd,"— Need help navigating life with diabetes? You can always Welcome again to our weekly Q&A column, hosted by veteran type 1 and diabetes author . Today Wil is looking at international differences in the way diabetes is treated and discussed, and whether type 2 diabetes can really disappear… {Got your own questions? Email us at } I am a 57-year-old UK male, recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in March 2018. My A1C was 8.5%, my weight, 343 lbs. Since then, I have lost weight by reducing white carbs, calories, and by taking a brisk walk daily. I have had two further A1C test results — August 2018: 5.9%, December 2018: 5.6%. My weight is now 231 lbs. I have been told that my diabetes is in remission. I have never taken meds for my diabetes. Can you tell me what you think is now happening in my body with regard to liver, blood vessels, pancreas function, insulin and blood glucose control? Wow. Medicine sure is different on your side of the pond. But before I talk about that, and dig into your questions, let me take a moment to pin a medal on your chest. You’re my Diabetes Hero of the Month. In fact, I think I’ll just go head and give you the award for the whole year. You lost 112 pounds. In one year. That’s a third of your original body weight. In one year. That’s frickin’ amazing! And the results of that effort are sure paying off in your A1C improvements.  But did it place your diabetes in remission?   OK. Here’s the deal. Over here in the USA, “remission” is not a term we’ve really embraced for diabetes, for when it’s seemingly stopped dead in its tracks by lifestyle change. Although we probably should. I like the term. It suggests the disease is currently a non-issue, but could come back.  Instead, in State-side medical circles, we take the once-a-diabetic, always-a-diabetic approach. Patients with normalized blood sugar still carry a diabetes diagnosis with them. In fact, we don’t even have a diagnosis code for diabetes in remission. On the other hand, and to the opposite extreme, among patients you often hear the notion of “reversing” diabetes. Diabetes can’t be reversed. It can be slowed. It can be stopped where it is at. Blood sugars can be normalized, creating the illusion of reversal, but take away the damn you built across the river (by going back to your previous weight, eating, and exercise habits) and diabetes will come roaring back like flood waters.  So, as I said, I like the word remission. And you Brits are actually the driving force for embracing the remission concept in diabetes, most notably with the recent —which used weight management in primary care settings to treat diabetes and place it in “remission.” I hope the term catches on more widely. Of course, in fairness, back in 2009, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) published a that tried to create a medical definitions of both “cure” and “remission.” In that paper the ADA established medical criteria for both partial remission and complete remission based on A1C and fasting glucose levels, and stipulated that those levels would have to be under the target levels for “at least one year’s duration in the absence of active pharmacologic therapy or ongoing procedures.” So under this rarely-used American definition of remission, you still haven’t been “clean” long enough to qualify.  But word choice isn’t the only thing about how your docs addressed your diabetes that’s different from what I’m used to. Your diagnosis A1C was right on the border of causing serious complications, and yet your medical team choose not to start even one single medication. That blows my mind. Completely. Using the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) over here, you would have left the doctor’s office on at least two medications, and a good argument could have been made for starting insulin five minutes after your A1C test results came in. Hey, I’m not medicine-happy, but I have a healthy sense of urgency when it comes to diabetes and its destructive capabilities when out of control. I don’t trust diabetes, and frankly, I don’t trust diabetes patients, either. OK, that sounded bad. It didn’t quite come out the way I intended. Here’s the deal: I’ve worked with literally hundreds of perfectly lovely people who have begged me to intervene with their doctors not to start any sort of medicine, offering up promises of ridiculous degrees of lifestyle change to avoid meds. These people meant well. And they thought they could do it. But, hey, lifestyle change is tough. I used to say it’s easier to change your gender than your diet, but that upset the trans-gender crowd. I honestly didn’t mean to diss anyone or bruise anyone’s feelings; rather I simply wanted to point out that for human beings, changing how we live is the hardest of all things. And I found through experience that we had better success when we medicated the into submission, to ensure the patient’s safety, and instituted lifestyle changes, in baby steps—reducing the meds as success dictated.  Of course, your docs took a different course when it came to starting meds, and they were proved correct in your case. So, what about complications? A year from now, when both your docs and the ADA agree that you’re in remission, do you have a completely clean bill of health? Or is there permanent damage that can’t be undone? One thing everyone agrees on is that normalizing blood sugar stops old complications from growing and new ones from appearing. So that’s a good thing. But can any damage sustained from high blood sugars prior to remission improve? Can you return to the complete health you enjoyed prior to diabetes? That’s controversial and not that well-researched yet. And it’s complicated by the fact that there are a lot of variables at play. The best way to think about this issue is to compare it to a thermonuclear bomb. The bomb goes off. Buildings are flattened in the blast wave. People die in the fireball. But it doesn’t end there, does it? ‘Cause nukes have a side effect: Radiation. Some radiation accompanies the blast. Some drifts down in the fallout. And some permeates the blast site like some sort of evil mold that just can’t be scrubbed away.  So too, high sugar affects cells in your body the same way, and linked with this is another issue: Some of the tissues in your body deal with damage better than others. Some can grow back if damaged. Others don’t seem to possess this same regenerative magic. And in sad point of fact, most complications—especially the big three —, , and — are historically viewed as being cast in stone. Whatever damage is done prior to the sugars being controlled is with you for the rest of your life, sometimes not manifesting until years after the damage occurs. Did you have diabetes long enough for damage to happen? Most likely so. By the time of diagnosis, most type 2s have already suffered tissue damage from elevated blood sugars due to the fact that T2 diabetes is preceded by a period of pre-diabetes in which sugars are above normal, pouring the foundations for complications. So where does that place us when it comes to your concerns in regard to liver, blood vessels, pancreas function, insulin and blood glucose control? At the moment, nothing new is happening. You sugar is now low enough that we can be pretty comfortable that there’s no new damage taking place. Whether you’ve sustained any damage in the interim, and, if so, whether that damage might improve, is a bit more complicated. Starting with your liver: The main worry with the liver in T2 diabetes is fatty liver disease, which of cirrhosis. Losing weight can fix the fatty part, but if cirrhosis has already started, that’s a tougher issue. This type of liver damage can’t be reversed—although like many other chronic conditions it can be treated, and isn’t necessarily a death sentence.  of bariatric surgery patients, the best baseline for diabetes remission, blood vessel complication outcomes appear to be a real crap shoot. Many patients show improvements in both kidney function and in eye-related complications, while on the other hand, others don’t improve, and about a quarter—who had no complications prior to the procedure—develop microvascular complications in the five years following. This suggests a time-bomb like effect.  What about the macrovascular complications? Initial evidence, also looking at bariatric surgery patients, the same mixed bag. Lastly, what about the complex dance between your pancreas, insulin, and blood sugar? As a (former?) type 2, your body has been through a decades-long period of significant insulin resistance that led to your pancreas suffering some degree of burnout, ultimately leaving it unable to produce enough insulin to overcome the resistance, causing high blood sugar. Now that you’ve lost the weight, the insulin resistance is reduced and your insulin production is sufficient for you current needs. But has your pancreas recovered? I very much doubt that it has, or ever will. If you want to test that theory, eat a heavy dose of one of those white carbs you swore off and see what happens to your blood sugar. My bet is that you’ll experience a significant spike. In active diabetes, insulin resistance gets worse over time, even when the diabetes is well-controlled. In pre-diabetes, when proactively addressed and “reversed,” the insulin resistance stabilizes and possibly improves. So what happens in remission? Will it stop advancing? Will it be frozen in place? Will dwindle and go away? But one thing is certain: You’ve changed your life for the better. You’ve stopped all the evils under your skin from hurting your further. That’s wonderful. Will the sins of the past reap damage in the future? Possibly so. But it’s equally possible that your cells will re-group. Heal. Grow. And uncomplicate your life completely.

e9837d2e-616b-4c49-a3e8-ed7867b0e274,"Can Gastric Bypass Surgery Cause Remission in Type 2 Diabetes? Researchers say a vast majority of patients lose weight and shed their diabetes diagnosis. Other experts urge caution, however. If 75 percent of the obese patients with achieved remission after gastric bypass surgery, would you say it sounds too good to be true? A published in the Diabetologia journal from the European Association for the Study of Diabetes reports that the obesity surgery known as Roux-en-Y (RYGB) is helping patients with diabetes shed weight and their type 2 diabetes diagnosis. The study focused on the effects of RYGB on diabetes remission, predicting factors, likelihood of relapse, surgical complications, and incidence of microvascular (, neuropathy, etc.) and macrovascular (clogged arteries) complications. The claim of diabetes remission, however, gives some diabetes health practitioners cause for concern. The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is one of many weight-loss surgery options available today. It consists of two components, explains the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS). The surgery reduces the size of the stomach by dividing the top of the stomach from the rest of the stomach. The first section of the small intestines is also divided and essentially shortened, then reconnected to the smaller pouch of the stomach. The result is that patients become limited in how many calories they can consume in one sitting and over the source of the day. Overeating results in pain, vomiting, and a significant degree of discomfort. Patients also lose weight because the entire digestive system is now absorbing fewer calories — which means fewer vitamins and minerals, too. The ASMBS adds, “Most importantly, the rerouting of the food stream produces changes in gut hormones that promote satiety, suppress hunger, and reverse one of the primary mechanisms by which obesity induces type 2 diabetes.” Remission is achieved as a result of two components. First, weight loss improves insulin sensitivity and reduces insulin resistance. Secondly, the restructuring of the small intestines actually increases hormone production that helps manage blood sugar levels. This impact is often seen immediately after surgery, versus the effects of eventual weight loss. During the first six months after the operation, the study authors reported, 65 percent of the participants achieved diabetes remission. By 12 months post-surgery, that remission rate rose to 74 percent and persisted for the first five years after the procedure. After five years, about 25 percent of the participants experienced a relapse of their type 2 diabetes diagnosis. “The definition for remission in this study is basically ‘pre-diabetes,’” explained , a registered dietitian from Kirkland, Washington. The study classified patients as “in remission” if they had an and were taking no diabetes-related medications. HbA1c (or A1c) is a measurement of your average blood sugar levels during the course of the prior three months. The 6.5 percent translates to a blood sugar of 140 mg/dL, which is above the goal range for a healthy non-diabetic of 70 to 130 mg/dL. For patients in the study who continued to take the diabetes drug , remission is defined as an HbA1c of less than 6 percent. In other words, even though they were still taking medication to lower blood sugar levels, the study classified their diabetes as “in remission” if their HbA1c was low enough. “This surgery is not a cure and it’s important that patients understand that,” said Okemah, who has supported many of her patients with type 2 diabetes through weight-loss surgery. “We have to differentiate between ‘remission’ and a ‘cure,'” Okemah told Healthline. “After this surgery, you will still need to follow the same diabetes nutrition guidelines. You have pre-diabetes and you’ll still need to manage it.” While many believe that type 2 diabetes is simply the result of weight gain, inactivity, and a poor diet that leads to insulin resistance, it’s actually more complicated. “Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease,” said Okemah. “Even if you go into remission, we watch your blood sugars closely so we can get it to progress as slowly as possible.” Most patients with type 2 diabetes actually struggle to produce adequate amounts of insulin due to the loss of beta-cell function. Beta-cells are produced by the pancreas and play a critical role in the production of insulin, which carries the sugar in your bloodstream to every part of your body to use it for fuel. Because type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, Okemah says it’s imperative that patients understand the likelihood of their blood sugars eventually rising — even if they don’t gain back all of the weight — because of continued loss of beta-cell function. The study was clear, however, that the patients with the least likelihood of achieving remission were those who required injections of insulin to manage their type 2 diabetes — as this is a clear indication of severe loss of beta-cell function. Okemah said gastric bypass surgery can be a last ditch effort by some people with type 2 diabetes. “They’ve tried every diet and they feel so defeated,” she said. “They think this is the last thing that might help them, but you have to make sure they have realistic expectations about life after surgery.” Okemah added that patients are too often misinformed or uneducated by their healthcare team about what the surgery will do for them. “A patient often thinks if they just get this surgery, their life is going to change. They won’t have diabetes anymore. They won’t be overweight anymore. But you’re still the same person, you’re still in the same life,” she said. Most challenging for many patients undergoing the surgery are the lifestyle and emotional behaviors they had around food prior to surgery. “All of the habits that it took to get to that surgery, the surgical procedure does not fix those. And you can out-eat a surgery,” she explained. While patients won’t have the physical capacity to over-indulge on something like a cheeseburger and a milkshake during the first two years after surgery, they can stretch their new stomach out over time, overeat regularly, and gain the weight back — along with their type 2 diabetes diagnosis. “We also try not to put numbers in their heads about how much weight they’ll lose,” said Okemah. Most patients, she explained, likely won’t become the “thin” image they might have in their heads. But Okemah says at that point, any weight loss is going to dramatically improve their health — especially when reducing the amount of fat in their midsection around their organs. It’s normal for most patients to gain some weight back, but if they were to gain all of it back, it would be a sign that the patient was engaging again in harmful habits around food. Readmission due to surgical complications during the 30 days after RYGB surgery, the study authors reported, occurred in 7.5 percent of patients. In obese patients without type 2 diabetes who undergo RYGB the percent of complications is 3.3 percent. The reason isn’t necessarily surprising. Higher blood sugar levels put the entire body in jeopardy. The body isn’t going to heal as well or simply function as well compared to an obese patient without diabetes. The study did report a decrease in the incidence of long-term diabetes-related complications such as retinopathy in patients during the five-year post-op period. The most startling complication of surgery, said Okemah, is one that is rarely talked about: its impact on your closest relationships. “I see it all time. The patient’s spouse doesn’t like that they are losing weight, getting more attention, and changing. And they stop supporting them,” she said. Sometimes, patients even regain weight purposefully to save their relationship. “This is a huge surgery and every patient should approach it carefully,” Okemah emphasized.

Kate Gudorf, a Diabetes Educator and Dietitian, is leading the Australian T2 Remission Project – replicating a world-first study conducted in the UK that has proven it is possible to put type 2 diabetes into remission. The diabetes remission clinical study (DiRECT) was conducted in the United Kingdom. Results from DiRECT UK demonstrated that nearly half (46%) of people with type 2 diabetes, diagnosed for less than 6 years, could achieve remission at 12 months through following a structured weight management program. Proving that the program works in the Australian context is what health authorities require before they can implement it in general practices across the country. To deliver this research study, we’re working with scientists from the University of Sydney and primary health networks. If the Australian T2 Remission Project is successful, it has the potential to transform our health system – and the treatment and experience of type 2 diabetes.

5921649e-33a9-47ac-a898-35b224edcb27,"Very low calorie diet for type 2 diabetes to be prescribed General Practitioners in England would soon prescribe a very low calorie diet (VLCD) for patients with type 2 diabetes in England as part of an attempt to reverse the increasingly growing numbers of the disease. The VLCD is to comprise of food with 800 calories per day for three months. The diet is to comprise only of soups and shakes. This diet underwent clinical trials last year when it was seen that those with type 2 diabetes lost weight and there was a remission in their condition. NHS England has now announced that they would expand the programme to help benefit from it. The NHS England also said that at present 10 percent of the total budget spent on health is being spent on diabetes and its related conditions. This project aims at reducing the numbers and expenditure related to diabetes. Nine in ten people living with diabetes are suffering from type 2 diabetes. This form of diabetes is linked to obesity and lack of physical activity. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder and is not associated with or leading a sedentary life. At first the pilot programme is to involve only 5,000 patients who will be followed up after the initial 3 months of treatment. The recent trials including 298 individuals results had shown that there was a satisfactory weight loss after this therapy followed by a complete weaning off from diabetes medication. Diabetes UK chief executive Chris Askew in a statement said, “The first year results of showed that – for some people with type 2 diabetes – an intensive, low-calorie weight loss programme delivered with ongoing support through primary care could put their condition into remission... While this ground-breaking study continues to explore how long-lasting these benefits are, we are delighted that NHS England have been inspired by this work to pilot a type 2 remission programme through the NHS.” Exercise during the first trimester of pregnancy helps avoid gestational diabetes Routine eye imaging may provide clues to cognitive disorders in older people with type 1 diabetes Metformin drug decreases mortality rate in COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes Prof Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity for NHS England warned that this diet however would not suit everyone.

Reduction of the prevalence of diabetes requires prevention programmes. Over the last three years programmes prescribing a healthy balanced diet as well as regular physical activity have been moderately successful. Nearly 250,000 people with borderline type 2 diabetes who could have gone on to develop full blown diabetes have been given advice on diet and exercise and they have benefited from these programmes. On an average these individuals have lost around 3.6 kg in weight and this has reduced their . This programme would now target around 200,000 people annually. The NHS England is soon to announce its “Forward Plan” where preventive measures would be taken to reduce ill health and disease.

You can go back to this later in your Weight loss can put Type 2 diabetes into remission for at least two years – the latest findings from DiRECT The of the Diabetes UK-funded Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT) have revealed that more than a third (36%) of people with who took part in the weight management programme, delivered in GP practices, are in two years later. The results were announced today at our and published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology. The new results build on the first year findings, , which showed that 46% of participants were in remission after twelve months. A year later, 70% of those participants are still in remission. Remission is closely linked to , 64% of participants who lost more than 10 kilos were in remission at two years. Participants regained some weight, as expected, between the first and second years of the trial. However, those who were in remission after one year, and who had stayed in remission, had lost a greater amount of weight on average (15.5 kilos) than those who didn’t stay in remission (12 kilos). As well as resulting in remission for some people, there appear to be additional benefits to taking part in a weight management programme overall. These include a reported better quality of life, improved blood glucose levels and a reduced need for diabetes medications. Understanding why significant weight loss results in remission of Type 2 diabetes is at the heart of DiRECT. Studies have so far revealed that weight loss reduces the levels of fat inside the liver and pancreas, which in turn leads to the pancreas ‘rebooting’ insulin production again. By understanding the biology of remission, Professors Taylor and Lean believe it should be possible to provide better care for people diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in the future. Professor Roy Taylor, Director of Newcastle University’s Magnetic Resonance Centre, and co-primary investigator of the DiRECT trial, said: ""These results are a significant development, and we now understand the biological nature of this reversible condition. However, everyone in remission needs to know that evidence to date tells us that your Type 2 diabetes will return if you regain weight."" Professor Mike Lean, Head of Human Nutrition at Glasgow University, diabetes specialist physician at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, and co-primary investigator of DiRECT, said: “Proving in DiRECT that Type 2 diabetes can be put into remission for two years in over two thirds of people, if they can lose over 10 kilos, is incredibly exciting. Achieving that entirely in NHS primary care is vital. “People with Type 2 diabetes, and healthcare professionals, have told us their top research priority is ‘can the condition be reversed or cured’. We can now say, with respect to reversal, that yes it can. Now we must focus on helping people maintain their weight loss and stay in remission for life.” Dr Elizabeth Robertson, our Director of Research said: “Remission of Type 2 diabetes can be life changing, DiRECT offers one potential solution, we are committed to working with the researchers and the NHS to ensure these exciting findings reach people with Type 2 diabetes as soon as possible.  ""But we know Type 2 diabetes is a complex condition, and this approach will not work for everyone. That’s why we’re continuing to invest in further research, to understand the biology underlying remission and find ways to make remission a reality for as many people as possible.” In DiRECT, people were defined as in remission if they had long-term of less than 48mmol/mol (6.5%), without needing to use any Type 2 diabetes medications.  and has been in remission for two years. “I was so pleased when I was told I was in remission. I thought it’s all been worth it - going to the hospital, taking blood and doing all the tests. When they showed me the scan of the liver and the difference in fat, I was elated. ""Ironically, I wasn’t bothered about the outside, but the fat on the inside around the liver.

Kate Gudorf, a Diabetes Educator and Dietitian, is leading the Australian T2 Remission Project – replicating a world-first study conducted in the UK that has proven it is possible to put type 2 diabetes into remission. The diabetes remission clinical study (DiRECT) was conducted in the United Kingdom. Results from DiRECT UK demonstrated that nearly half (46%) of people with type 2 diabetes, diagnosed for less than 6 years, could achieve remission at 12 months through following a structured weight management program. Proving that the program works in the Australian context is what health authorities require before they can implement it in general practices across the country. To deliver this research study, we’re working with university scientists and primary health networks. If the Australian T2 Remission Project is successful, it has the potential to transform our health system – and the treatment and experience of type 2 diabetes.

170bd13a-7522-46a4-aae4-6e7644378122,"Wednesday, 16 December 2020 The largest investigation of testosterone treatment ever undertaken has shown that, over and above the effect of a lifestyle program, treatment with testosterone can prevent or trigger remission of newly diagnosed  in men. The study, known as T4DM (Testosterone for the prevention of Diabetes Mellitus), was led by the University of Adelaide and involved six specialist centres across Australia. T4DM was a two-year randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The results are published online today in  The T4DM study included more than 1000 men aged between 50 and 74 years old who were overweight or  All men were enrolled in the WW (formerly known as Weight Watchers) lifestyle program. They could attend groups, use the website, the app, or any combination of those. Half of the men were injected with long-acting testosterone every three months. The other half were injected with placebo. After two years of treatment, 87 out of 413 (21%) men in the placebo group had type 2 diabetes (based on an oral glucose tolerance test) compared with 55 out of 443 (12%) men in the testosterone group. Men in both groups lost weight (on average 3 to 4kg). tolerance normalised in 43% and 52% of men in the placebo and testosterone groups, respectively. Other findings at two years in men treated with testosterone compared to placebo include: An increase in skeletal muscle mass and hand grip strength There were no differences in wellbeing or quality of life. The most common adverse effect occurring in 22% of men treated with testosterone was an increase in the concentration of red cells in the blood, which could potentially lead to “sludgy” blood. Lead researcher Professor Gary Wittert, Director of the Freemason’s Centre for Male Health and Wellbeing, University of Adelaide, said: “The results of the study show that, on top of modest weight loss achieved with healthy eating and increased activity, testosterone has some added benefit to prevent or reverse . “However, the results do not necessarily mean that a script for testosterone should be written,” he cautioned. “We know that men at risk of type 2 diabetes are usually overweight and either have, or are at risk of, other chronic disorders that have not been detected or adequately managed. “Not infrequently these men are also drinking too much alcohol and have sleep or mood disorders. “Weight loss achieved through healthy lifestyle behaviours remains the benchmark.” More  is needed to determine whether the beneficial effects of testosterone persist beyond two years, whether longer term treatment is safe and whether other forms of testosterone have similar benefits or risks. “Writing a prescription might be quick and easy but it does not replace the need for undertaking a comprehensive assessment and providing holistic management towards improving men’s health,” Professor Wittert said. Professor Bu Yeap from the University of Western Australia’s Medical School, and President of the Endocrine Society of Australia, who was one of the  researchers, said: “This is a landmark study which will prompt renewed interest in preventing diabetes in at-risk men.” The study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, Bayer, Eli Lilly and WW.

Welcome to ’s first installment of Diabetes is Primary, a round-up of the latest diabetes developments for health care providers. In this issue, we take a look at radical weight loss for diabetes remission, Hong Kong’s diabetes risk assessment and management program, personalized A1C targets, and diabetes diagnoses. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) panel gives its verdict on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices, and we learn how Medicare will soon pay for a diabetes prevention program. Remission of Type 2 Diabetes With Radical Weight Loss A low-calorie diet approach that induces substantial weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes can also result in remission of the disease, according to Lean et al. (). In addition to eliminating the need for antidiabetes drugs to control glycemia, the authors point out that the result was achieved in a nonspecialist community primary care setting. Writing in , the authors report the outcomes of the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT) that focused on primary care practices across Scotland and the Tyneside region of England. The practices were assigned either to provide a weight management program called Counterweight-Plus or standard care according to guidelines. Practice staff were provided structured training in delivery of the weight management program, which aimed to achieve a weight loss of 15 kg (33 lb). Primary outcomes were changes in patient weight and A1C between baseline and 12 months. The authors report that one-fourth of the patients who received the weight management treatment lost at least 15 kg within 12 months, whereas none of the equivalent patients in the control group hit the target. Meanwhile, mean weight reduction in the intervention group was 10 kg, compared to 1 kg in the control group at 12 months. In the intervention group, 46% of participants experienced diabetes remission (broadly defined as an A1C <6.5%), compared to 4% in the control group. The authors describe an apparent inverse relationship between weight change and diabetes remission. In a news release (), Michael Lean, co-lead author of the study, said, “Our findings suggest that even if you have had type 2 diabetes for 6 years, putting the disease into remission is feasible. In contrast to other approaches, we focus on the need for long-term maintenance of weight loss through diet and exercise and encourage flexibility to optimize individual results.” Hong Kong Type 2 Diabetes Management Program Is Effective The Risk Assessment and Management Program for primary care patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (RAMP-DM) has been running in Hong Kong since 2009 and was recently the subject of two studies investigating its effectiveness at reducing diabetes complications and its cost-effectiveness. In short, the program works and can save considerable sums compared to usual primary care for people with type 2 diabetes. Published in the January 2018 issue of (), the first study, by Wan et al., evaluated the effectiveness of RAMP-DM in delaying disease progression, preventing complications, and reducing hospitalizations compared to usual diabetes care. The authors report that, after a median follow-up of 4.5 years, the cumulative incidence of any event was 23.2% in the RAMP-DM group, compared to 43.6% in the usual-care group. Specifically, RAMP-DM led to greater relative risk reductions for cardiovascular disease (56.6%), mortality (66.1%), and microvascular complications (11.9%). There was also substantially lower risk for overnight hospitalizations, emergency room visits, or specialist outpatient attendance. Author Esther Yee Tak Yu said, “A systematic, structured risk assessment coupled with multidisciplinary care management could enhance routine doctor follow-up consultations in usual care in order to provide timely detection of risk factors and subsequent treatments to prevent further deterioration. A key next step is to investigate the optimal frequency of repeat RAMP-DM and the evaluation of cost-effectiveness and budget impact of RAMP-DM.” Rather helpfully, the question of RAMP-DM’s cost-effectiveness is addressed in a follow-up study published in the February 2018 issue of (), in which we learn that implementation of the approach has likely saved many millions of dollars during its implementation period. Jiao et al. describe a prospective cohort study involving just over 17,000 diabetes patients to determine the effectiveness of the program, as well as the costs involved, compared to usual care. In addition to again demonstrating the effectiveness of the program in terms of reduced diabetes complications and lower mortality, they identified substantial cost savings compared to usual care. They say that the overall average cost of the RAMP-DM program was $157 per patient over 5 years, which resulted in savings of just under $7,300 in overall health care costs. The average cost of usual care over 5 years was just under $20,000, whereas the addition of RAMP-DM reduced the figure to just over $12,000. Study author Colman Siu Cheung Fung said, “RAMP-DM complemented to usual primary care was a cost-saving program in managing people with diabetes over 5 years. This evidence leads us to recommend the integration of RAMP-DM as part of routine primary care for all patients with diabetes.” Personalized A1C Targets May Save Money and Improve Quality of Life Personalized glycemic control targets for type 2 diabetes are more cost-effective than a uniform intensive target such as an A1C <7%, according to Laiteerapong et al. ( ). The costs of care were $13,547 lower over patients’ lifetimes when they had personalized targets instead of a uniform target. Although the average life span of those with personalized targets was expected to be slightly shorter (by 1 month), their quality of life was expected to be higher. As a result, the authors say it may be possible to save as much as $234 billion if all 17.3 million patients with type 2 diabetes in the United States were given individualized targets. In a statement (), author Neda Laiteerapong said, “People don’t want to be treated by a standard value or an algorithm, they want to be treated like individuals. I think this model will give evidence to physicians that individualized glycemic control is something to consider. It can help save our health system, and it’s in line with what many patients want.” Research suggesting that as much as 40% of type 1 diabetes cases likely occur after the age of 30 is probably worth some attention. Thomas et al. in () focus on the 500,000-strong U.K. Biobank cohort and use a novel genetic approach to identify type 1 diabetes in adults that crucially includes cases that might not have been picked up by family doctors. Based on genetic risk scores, the authors found that ∼4% of the population had genetically defined type 1 diabetes and that 42% were individuals 31–60 years of age. The clinical characteristics of the group did not differ from those of patients with type 1 diabetes who were ≤30 years of age, but they did differ from those of individuals with type 2 diabetes. The middle-aged individuals with type 1 diabetes were thinner, more likely to use insulin, and experienced diabetic ketoacidosis slightly more often than their counterparts with type 2 diabetes. Unlike diagnosing type 1 diabetes in younger populations, identifying it in adults >30 years of age is challenging simply because of the higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes in that age-group. Accurately distinguishing between the two types of diabetes is crucial because it affects treatment decisions; many adult patients with type 1 diabetes initially receive a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and do not receive the insulin they actually need. In a news release (), author Richard Oram said, “Diabetes textbooks for doctors say that type 1 diabetes is a childhood illness. But our study shows that it is prevalent throughout life. The assumption among many doctors is that adults presenting with the symptoms of diabetes will have type 2, but this misconception can lead to misdiagnosis with potentially serious consequences. This study should raise awareness that type 1 diabetes occurs throughout adulthood and should be considered as a diagnosis.” A relatively unknown form of diabetes, called type 3c or diabetes of the exocrine pancreas, may be more common than type 1 diabetes in adults, and more worrisome, it might be regularly misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes, according to a study in by Woodmansey et al. (). As a result, the authors say, patients often receive suboptimal care because type 3c diabetes often causes very poor glycemic control with much greater insulin requirements. Type 3c diabetes occurs after damage to the pancreas through inflammation, abnormal tissue growth, or surgery and results in the loss of ability to produce insulin. The authors’ report involved searches of more than 2.3 million primary care records in England and the extraction of cases of adult-onset diabetes with and without pancreatic disease before the diagnosis of diabetes. The authors found just under 32,000 cases of new, adult-onset diabetes. Of the 559 cases that occurred after some sort of pancreatic disease, ∼8% actually had type 1 diabetes, ∼3% were classified correctly as having type 3c diabetes, and ∼88% were incorrectly classified as having type 2 diabetes. In addition, the individuals in these cases had much poorer glycemic control and much greater insulin use than individuals with type 2 diabetes. In a statement (), author Simon de Lusignan said, “Greater awareness of type 3c diabetes within the medical profession is required immediately to improve management of this disease, which now has a higher incidence than type 1 diabetes in adults. Our research shows that the majority of people with type 3c diabetes are being misdiagnosed with type 2 diabetes, putting both their short- and long-term health at risk.” BENEFITS OF BARIATRIC SURGERY IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES Bariatric surgery can lead to significant long-term metabolic benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin, according to a study presented at the 2017 ObesityWeek conference (). Benefits included diabetes remission without the need for insulin for up to 7 years after gastric bypass surgery or sleeve gastrectomy. Using a retrospective analysis of data from a cohort of 252 patients who underwent surgery, the researchers reported that 51% of insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes reached an A1C of <7% without insulin use 1–2 years after surgery. Forty-four percent of the patients met the primary target ≥5 years after their procedure. Moreover, bariatric surgery also led to significant rates of diabetes remission, weight loss, reductions in LDL cholesterol and increases in HDL cholesterol, and reductions in diastolic and systolic blood pressure and triglycerides. The average price of insulin has skyrocketed in recent years—nearly tripling between 2002 and 2013. Insulin isn’t optional. For millions of people living with diabetes, including all individuals living with type 1 diabetes, access to insulin is a matter of life and death. There is no medicine that can be substituted for insulin. For more than a year, the ADA’s Make Insulin Affordable campaign has been bringing attention to this crucial issue. In 2016, the ADA board of directors issued a resolution calling on all entities in the insulin supply chain, including manufacturers, wholesalers, pharmacy benefit managers, insurers, and pharmacies, to substantially increase transparency in pricing associated with the delivery of insulin to individuals with diabetes. Transparency in this process is the first step to identifying viable long-term solutions for individuals with diabetes who are unable to afford the insulin they need. The resolution also calls on all entities in the insulin supply chain to ensure that no person with diabetes is denied affordable access to insulin. As the organization whose mission is to improve the lives of all people affected by diabetes, ADA believes that no individual in need of lifesaving insulin should ever go without it due to prohibitive costs. To address this issue, the association has convened an Insulin Access and Affordability Working Group, which is working with multiple stakeholders at all levels of the insulin supply chain, people affected by the rising cost of insulin, and the U.S. Congress in an active effort to understand the underlying causes of the dramatic increase in insulin prices. The major objective of the working group is to bring about long-term solutions to ensure that insulin is affordable for all who need it. More information on these efforts is available from . THE USE OF LANGUAGE IN DIABETES CARE AND EDUCATION: A CONSENSUS REPORT Language has a strong impact on perceptions and behavior, and this may be especially true with regard to medical care and health-related behaviors. An ADA/American Association of Diabetes Educators joint task force has examined this issue with regard to diabetes care and education and developed recommendations for language used by health care professionals and others when discussing diabetes with patients, colleagues, or the general public. These recommendations, in addition to research questions related to language and diabetes, are outlined in a consensus report released simultaneously in October 2017 by and ().

DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM ADDED AS A MEDICARE BENEFIT The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recently released its final rule for the 2018 physician fee schedule, which contains detailed regulations for the expanded model of the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP) (, ). In short, as of 1 April 2018, CMS will cover MDPP as a benefit for Medicare beneficiaries who meet certain criteria. Designed specifically for individuals with prediabetes, the program provides coaching to encourage weight loss, dietary improvements, and increased physical activity in a bid to help at-risk individuals avoid developing type 2 diabetes. The program will be delivered by community health workers and health professionals in various settings. According to the rule, the MDPP includes 6 months of core sessions, followed by maintenance sessions for 6 months and through a second year. Participants must complete 16 sessions in the first 6 months based on the notion that the greatest weight loss is most likely to occur in this period. Additionally, beneficiaries should achieve a minimum weight loss of 5% in the first year to remain eligible for the second year of maintenance sessions. Crucially, reimbursements are tied to some extent to the weight loss achieved by beneficiaries. Eligibility criteria for the program include enrollment in Medicare Part B, a BMI >25 kg/m (or >23 kg/m if Asian) at first attendance, an A1C of 5.7–6.4%, a fasting blood glucose value of 110–125 mg/dL or a 2-hour plasma glucose value of 140–199 mg/dL, no previous diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes (other than gestational diabetes), and no end-stage renal disease. Individuals are only eligible for this benefit once in their lifetime. A detailed overview of performance reimbursements payments is available at . Details relating to supplier enrollment and compliance are available at . ADA/EASD Joint Statement on CGM Technologies: Progress Still Needed ADA and EASD have published a joint scientific statement on CGM systems (), with a particular focus on their clinical value and the ways in which health care professionals, manufacturers, regulators, and consumers might get the most from the technology. The panel makes a series of recommendations for improving the technology, which currently has relatively poor uptake and fractured development, despite holding great promise for diabetes management. The authors summarize a series of studies relating to CGM, including growing evidence supporting the benefits of CGM in adults with type 1 diabetes and mixed results in children and adolescents. The authors noted that evidence in support of CGM for type 2 diabetes is limited, saying that, although clinical studies have moved the field forward somewhat, common design limitations are hindering progress. Even meta-analyses have reportedly come to mixed conclusions, likely because of nonstandardized reporting of clinical trial outcomes. The authors go on to say that, despite clear progress in the design of CGM systems, numerous issues remain. Finding solutions will require a high level of cooperation among stakeholders and that better CGM education and training will be needed for both patients and health care providers. They also touch on the potential of remote data from CGM devices but caution on issues such as data privacy and cybersecurity. “We envision an ongoing role of the ADA, EASD, and other professional medical associations in supporting the virtuous circle of CGM innovation, confirmation of value to users, increased utilization, and greater resources reinvested to support innovation,” the panel members write. “For this vision to be realized without further delay, we call upon regulators and manufacturing companies to work urgently with health professionals and people with diabetes to create an environment with much greater standardization of outcome measures, a high level of attention to safety, and full transparency of adverse event reporting.” Readers may use this article as long as the work is properly cited, the use is educational and not for profit, and the work is not altered.

Type 2 diabetes is a condition where the beta cells in the pancreas still make insulin, but it may not make enough, or the insulin that is being made does not do its job properly.  As a result, the gates of the cells cannot open to let the glucose in. This is called insulin resistance. If glucose cannot enter the cells, it builds up in the blood stream and causes blood glucose levels to rise. This is called diabetes.When a person is in the early stages of having type 2 diabetes the pancreas works harder to try and make more insulin than usual. This happens because the pancreas is trying to help the glucose enter the cells and help the body get the energy it needs.If the pancreas continues to work hard, it starts to 'get tired' the beta cells start to ‘die’ and make less insulin. This makes it harder to keep blood glucose levels in target. This is why type 2 diabetes is often called a progressive condition meaning it gets worse over time.The goal of type 2 diabetes management is to keep blood glucose levels within a target range (usually between 4-8mmol/L and up to 10mmol/L in some cases). When you are first diagnosed, your doctor will suggest you try making changes to your lifestyle. This means doing regular physical activity, making healthier food choices and losing weight. Your doctor might suggest you try this for 3 months to see if your blood glucose levels improve. If they remain above the target range after 3 months, your doctor will start you on medicine to help.Because type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, in time you may need more medicine or insulin injections to help keep your blood glucose levels in target.People with type 2 diabetes often have no symptoms, so they may have diabetes for a number of years without knowing it. Sometimes the first sign that something is wrong is when they develop a complication of diabetes such as a heart attack, vision problems or a stroke.  Needing to go to the toilet more often to pass urine Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes and affects 85 to 90 per cent of all people with diabetes. It usually develops in adults over the age of 45, but is now being seen in younger people too.While there is no single cause for type 2 diabetes, there are well-known risk factors. Those most at risk of developing type 2 diabetes include: Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people aged 35 and over People aged 35 and over who are Pacific Islanders, Maori, Asian (including the Indian subcontinent, or of Chinese origin) Middle Eastern, North African or Southern European People aged 45 and over who are obese or overweight, have high blood pressure or have a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes All people with cardiovascular disease such as heart attack, angina, stroke, narrowed blood vessels Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) who are overweight People with a first degree relative with type 2 diabetes People taking certain antipsychotic medicine or corticosteroid medicine Being overweight or obese, especially around the waist Low levels of physical activity, including more than two hours of television watching per day Unhealthy eating habits, such as regularly choosing high fat, high sugar, high salt or low fibre foods Note: It is important that diabetes is diagnosed and treated early. Those at high risk for type 2 diabetes should have a blood test each year.Up to 60% of type 2 diabetes can be prevented. People at risk of type 2 diabetes can delay and even prevent this condition by following a healthy lifestyle. This includes: Having type 2 diabetes is not all doom and gloom. People often say that being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is a ‘wake up call’ for them, a chance to improve their lifestyle.Making changes to your lifestyle by making healthier food choices, improving weight and increasing activity can; Reduce your risk of developing diabetes complications such as heart attack, stroke, kidney disease etc Reduce or delay the need for medicine or insulin   At this stage there is no cure for type 2 diabetes. Changing and keeping a healthy lifestyle can help keep blood glucose levels within the normal range, where you may no longer need medicine.  Achieving this is great and has many health benefits. However, this is known as remission, not a cure…the reason for this is, if you no longer keep a healthy lifestyle and start to put on weight again, your blood glucose levels will once again rise. This is why keeping a healthy lifestyle is so important.  Have you been recently diagnosed with diabetes?

Therefore it very important to remove all myths and we must understand that a diabetic child can lead a full and normal emotional life. This articles tries to answers important myths about diabetes which could help patents raising their diabetic child and teenagers themselves for better understanding [-]. Diabetes management is well suited to help patients make self-selected changes related to weight, nutrition, physical activity etc and the concept of patient empowerment has become an integral part of diabetes education, an accurate understanding of disease and its management is very important to manage this chronic condition. Therefore, common misconceptions have to be corrected and traditional thinking and myths must be clarified. This would help the patients and empowers them to control their daily diabetes care. Empowerment will increase the capacity of patients to think critically and make autonomous, informed decisions. Empowerment also occurs when patients are actually making autonomous, informed decisions about their diabetes self-management. Care providers must help patients choose personally meaningful, realistic goals, especially goals related to disease management like weight loss, nutrition, and physical activity [-]. To maximize the chance for success, patients must be internally motivated and educated rather than externally motivated pressurized. However, wide spread misconceptions about the diabetes management constrain its effectiveness. The purpose of this article is to better articulate our view of diabetes management and to correct misperceptions about it in hopes of enhancing its authentic and effective use in diabetes care and education. In reality, Diabetes Management is perhaps the most misunderstood subject on the planet and it makes the situation even more worse as the number of diabetic patients are increasing significantly. Taking an example of Insulin many people with type-2 diabetes avoid it, and some even accuse it of causing diabetes complications. Yet insulin is one of the best treatments available for getting and keeping blood glucose levels on target. Insulin is a must for treating type-1 diabetes and likely after years with type-2 diabetes. As the body makes less of its own insulin, pills may become less effective over time. Eventually meal plans, exercise, and multiple pills won't cut it anymore. To help lower your blood sugar, your provider may prescribe insulin [-]. Here are some of the facts for the diabetes patients to know about the diabetes, its management, medication and other myths attached with it: Myth: Consumption of too much sugar leads to diabetes Fact: Type-1 diabetes is caused by a destruction of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, which is unrelated to sugar consumption. Type-2 diabetes results from the body's inability to respond to insulin normally. Although the tendency to get type-2 diabetes is genetically inherited in most cases, eating too much sugar (or foods with sugar, like candy or regular soda) can cause weight gain, which can increase the risk for developing the disease. Fact: Patients with diabetes can eat a certain amount of sugary food as part of a balanced diet, but they need to control the total amount of carbohydrates they eat, which includes sugary treats. Because sweets provide no real nutritional value other than calories, they should be limited but not necessarily eliminated. All Patients should avoid excessive consumption of foods that provide little nutritional value and can crowd out healthier foods. Myth: With certain herbal medicines, patients can outgrow diabetes Fact: Patients do not outgrow diabetes. In type-1 diabetes, the cells of the pancreas that produce insulin are destroyed. Once they're destroyed, they will never make insulin again. Although Patients with type-2 diabetes may see an improvement in their blood sugar levels with lifestyle adjustments and stress management [-]. Fact: Diabetes is not contagious. You can't catch it from another person. Although researchers think that getting type-1 diabetes may be triggered by something in the environment, like a virus, most people who get type-1 diabetes have inherited genes that make them more susceptible to the disease. Myth: High blood sugar levels are normal for some people and aren't a sign of diabetes Fact: Certain conditions like illness or stress and certain medications like steroids temporarily can cause high blood sugar levels in people without diabetes. But high blood sugar levels are never normal. People who have higher than normal blood sugar levels or sugar in their urine should be checked for diabetes by a doctor. Myth: People with diabetes can feel whether their blood sugar levels are high or low Fact: Although someone with diabetes may feel physical symptoms such as extreme thirst, weakness, or fatigue if blood sugar levels are high or low, the only way to know for sure what the levels are is to test them. Because blood sugar levels have to be very high to cause symptoms, a person who isn't testing regularly may be having blood sugar levels high enough to damage the body without even realizing it. Myth: All people with diabetes need to take insulin All people with type-1 diabetes have to take insulin injections because their pancreases don't make insulin anymore. Some, but not all, people with type-2 diabetes have to take insulin to manage their blood sugar levels. Taking insulin helps manage diabetes, but does not cure it. Insulin helps get glucose out of the bloodstream and into the cells, where it can be used for energy. This helps keep blood sugar levels under control, but taking insulin doesn't correct the underlying cause. Fact: Starting insulin is not a sign of failure. Research has clearly indicated that many people equate insulin with illness. Studies have shown one-third to one-half of people who are prescribed insulin are unwilling or reluctant to take it. While health care providers may blame fear of needles for this response, but No. 1 reason is ""the sense that insulin signifies personal failure and a 'worsening' of diabetes. Most people's fears and concerns about insulin are understandable, but are based on false information. Patient empowerment and diabetes education by explaining the patients what science knows about diabetes today will help them to accept their disease state and unload the guilty feeling [-]. Fact: It is definitely not true that a person will develop complications from diabetes faster once you start insulin. In fact, Insulin is the best drug we have to treat diabetes and prevent complications. The main problem is that people start it too late, after complications are evolving. Patients, families, and society then associate insulin use as a cause of the complications. In reality, if we use it a little earlier in the course of treatment, we could likely to prevent many of those complications by getting patient’s blood glucose levels under control more quickly. Myth: Starting Insulin is Very Difficult and Painful Fact: Starting insulin is easy with insulin pens, and very small needles make insulin extremely portable and painless, pens can be either prefilled disposable models or sleek metal creations that hold prefilled cartridges. Pens have a dial that allows the patient to select their dose. To deliver the dose, one can screw on a single-use, they are ultrathin-ultra short pen needle. Insulin is injected into the fat layer below the skin, above the muscle tissue. The injection site is commonly in the abdomen because there are fewer nerve endings there, it's easy to reach, and people tend to have plenty of fat in that location. Type-2 Diabetes the less serious type of Diabetes. It is commonly believed that since it is diagnosed later in life, that a few lifestyle changes and a glucose lowering pill, if required is sufficient for management. Having type-2 diabetes can be very harmful for anyone; there is a risk of having a heart attack or stroke blindness, kidney disease, or an amputation. Research has shown that people need to fully focus on glucose control, if they want to stay healthy []. Younger adults and children are now being increasingly diagnosed with pre-diabetes and type-2 diabetes. Blood glucose control is goal number one, and diabetes is all about glucose control Fact: Till recently, the main focus on Diabetes management has been to control the blood sugar levels. However, Diabetes is more than just increase in blood sugar levels. Several other metabolic pathways are affected and hence good management involves monitoring other useful parameters like blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels. The most common complications of type-2 are heart and blood vessel diseases and type-2 diabetes is an equivalent risk factor to had a heart attack or stroke []. Myth: Insulin dose is directly proportional to the degree of illness Fact: Every individual's insulin needs are different and insulin dosage don't serve as a barometer of illness. People often judge both their own health and the health of others by the volume of medications they take. The same thought process kicks in when people start comparing insulin doses. It's not accurate to judge one’s insulin dose against anyone else's or worry if yours increases than, what would happen? the main aim or goal is to control blood sugar levels. Myth: Tablets or pills for diabetes are a form of insulin Fact: Diabetes medicines taken by mouth are not a form of insulin. Insulin is a protein that would be broken down or destroyed by the acids and digestive enzymes in the stomach and intestines if swallowed. Some people with type-2 diabetes take pills or tablets that help the body make more insulin or use the insulin it makes more effectively. But pills for diabetes cannot help Patients with type-1 diabetes because they are no longer able to make insulin. Myth: Patients with diabetes don't have to take their insulin or pills when they're sick When Patients are sick, especially if they are throwing up or not eating much, giving insulin might not seem like the right thing to do. However, it is very important to keep taking insulin during illness. Insulin doses may need to be adjusted during illness (check with your doctor) but they can't be skipped altogether. Patients need energy when they're sick to help the body heal itself, and insulin helps them use that energy properly. Exercise is important for all Patients-with or without diabetes! Exercise offers many benefits to Patients with diabetes. It helps them manage their weight and prevents them from gaining excess body fat. It also improves cardiovascular health, boosts mood, relieves stress, and helps blood sugar control. Myth: Low-carbohydrate diets are good for Patients with diabetes because they should avoid carbs Carbohydrates (carbs) are the body's preferred source of energy, and carbohydrate-containing foods should provide about 50% to 60% of a person's calories each day [-]. Low-carb diets tend to be overloaded with protein and fat. Following a high-fat, high-protein diet over the long term may increase the risks of heart and kidney disease in adulthood. A healthy, balanced diet means adopting a meal plan that helps patients to balance carbohydrate intake with medication and exercise to achieve good diabetes control. Myth: There are cures for diabetes, but doctors and the government are not telling anyone Fact: No matter what you may hear or see on the Internet, there is no cure for diabetes. The only way to manage diabetes now is to take insulin and medications as prescribed, lifestyle management, eat a balanced diet, get plenty of physical activity, and check blood sugar levels regularly. Until there really is a cure for diabetes, do your best to manage your diabetes with the tools available now. The conclusion is that Diabetes management should focus on things other than controlling blood sugar only. Patients must talk to their care provider when they see information that doesn't seem quite right, sounds too good to be true, or contradicts what they've told. Never make changes to diabetes management plan without contacting your healthcare provider first. It's very important to educate oneself about diabetes so that patients can help themselves to manage it. This means arming patients with the right information. Although the Internet has a wealth of content on diabetes, it's not always accurate. Information that's not interpreted correctly, or is inaccurate or misleading, can actually be harmful for someone with diabetes. Even well-meaning family members and friends can give bad information. The misconception statements above are based on beliefs or on assumptions, they all stem from a fundamental misunderstanding in different cultures and communities about diabetes care and education. The approach of facilitating and supporting patients to reflect on their experience of living with diabetes. Self-reflection occurring in a relationship characterized by psychological safety, warmth, collaboration, and respect is essential for laying the foundation for self-directed positive change in behavior, emotions, and/or attitudes. Such reflections often leads to their enhanced awareness and understanding of the consequences of their self-management decisions. Jacobson AM, Hauser ST, Wolfsdorf JI, Houlihan J, Milley JE, et al.

You can go back to this later in your NHS England announce Type 2 remission pilot, and plans to double the size of the NHS England Diabetes Prevention Programme NHS England has announced today that it will be doubling the size of its Diabetes Prevention Programme, and rolling out a , inspired by the DiRECT study we funded.  This is really exciting news, and the culmination of many years of hard work by our researchers, fundraisers and supporters of our work from across the UK. The , led by Professors Mike Lean and Roy Taylor, is being supported by our largest ever research grant.  “The first year results of Diabetes UK DiRECT study showed that – for some people with Type 2 diabetes – an intensive, low-calorie weight loss programme delivered with ongoing support through primary care could put their condition into remission.  “While this ground-breaking study continues to explore how long-lasting these benefits are, we are delighted that NHS England have been inspired by this work to pilot a Type 2 remission programme through the NHS.” The NHS England pilot, which begins in 2019, will test a Type 2 remission programme for around 5000 people, involving low-calorie diets. While we don’t yet have full details on what exactly this programme will entail, this is an exciting step forward. We are also delighted to see that the NHS plans to double the size of its , aiming to treat 200,000 people each year moving forward.  “Plans to double the size of the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme are excellent news. The programme is already the largest of its kind globally, and shows England to be a world leader in this area. The ambition being shown by the NHS needs to be matched across all government policy – we need stronger action on marketing to children, and clearer nutritional labelling to support people to make healthy choices. “We look forward to working alongside NHS England to shape how both these bold initiatives will work in practice, and seeing the positive impact these decisions will have on the health of those at risk of – or living with – Type 2 diabetes.” Research we are funding is about to change people’s lives. The hard work of so many people has come to fruition and will tangibly improve the lives of so many people living with, or at risk of, Type 2 diabetes.

e6b31d30-a28f-4fb6-9636-88098e811c3e,"A Patient's Journey: Can I Kill the Glucose Monster? — His prostate cancer lying low, Howard Wolinsky now focuses on his metabolic health by It was early January 2018; one of those bitter cold but sunny Chicago days. My wife Judi and I were grateful for a heated tunnel leading from the parking lot to the clinic at the University of Illinois at Chicago on the West Side. I was visiting yet another health professional as I looked for more answers to controlling type 2 diabetes. In the previous six months, I had made significant progress. I had lost 35 pounds on a low-carb diet trending toward ketosis and had reduced my hemoglobin A1c to 5.2%, a normal reading, from 7.8% in June 2017. My primary care doctor had recommended that I stay within a ""realistic"" A1c range of 6%-7% and told me I would be on metformin for the rest of my life. That advice contradicted what two dietitians, an ophthalmostat, and a podiatrist had suggested -- go for normal and get off metformin. (One dietitian suggested I go for 4.7%-5.2% A1c) Even my urologist -- I have Gleason 6 prostate cancer -- suggested I go for normal and drug-free though metformin apparently reduces the risk for prostate cancer and may add to longevity, at least in mice. I decided to see an endocrinologist. This breed of specialist, I'm told, doesn't usually see the likes of me with normal-ish blood sugars but a propensity to T2D. My new diabetes specialist is Brian Layden, MD, PhD, chief of endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism at the U of I. He used to practice at Northwestern University Feinstein School of Medicine, where he saw mainly an affluent, health-conscious population. Now he and his team primarily serve low-income African American and Latino patients with diabetes living on Chicago's West Side. ""The rate and burden of diabetes is much greater in low-income populations,"" said the endocrinologist. He now sees patients with undiagnosed diabetes who already have experienced the devastating complications of this disease. Some have gone blind before having addressed their condition. Layden looked at my A1c and blood sugar readings and noted he doesn't see numbers like mine in his clinic. ""You should frame this,"" he said, holding up my results. ""You're doing a great job and you're actually in the process of basically curing yourself of diabetes. You can cure yourself of type 2 diabetes,"" he said, adding I likely can get off metformin if I want. But wait a minute. Cure! Cure? Cure is a four-letter word in the medical writer's lexicon. You don't want to overpromise or mislead readers by claiming cures or breakthroughs. He said at a minimum I could bring my T2D into remission. He said if I even just maintained an A1c of 6%-7%, as recommended by my family doc, I could avoid such complications as blindness, amputations, kidney failure and the like. On the upside, at age 70, I am a ""new"" diabetic and haven't exposed my body to the ravages of uncontrolled blood sugar for decades. On the downside, I probably have a genetic proclivity to diabetes -- my late father was a type 2 diabetic and so is my younger brother. Layden said if I could lose another 10 pounds (easy to say, but maybe I can do it), I could firmly plant myself in the normal range for blood sugar and likely could stop taking metformin. On the downside, I am 70 so my pancreas is aging and not be functioning optimally. ""We want to have you live as long as you can and be as healthy as you can. So, we want to keep your A1c in a healthy range. But if you were a 40-year-old compared to your age, I'd want treat you a bit differently,"" Layden said. He said the secret to success in my next chapter is stepping up my exercise. I already have seen another new health team member -- an exercise physiologist -- who deemed me in excellent condition and told me how to refresh and boost my exercise program to try to reduce my blood sugar and weight. (Medicare covers a couple visits to an exercise physiologist.) My resting heart rate was 55 and blood pressure was 110/60. I can easily step up my heart rate to 130 during exercise on a treadmill, stationary bike and track. I worked out a program with Layden. I am going to try more intense exercise for three months and see what impact it has on weight and A1c and blood sugars. If I get down below 5% A1c, then I may consider getting off or reducing metformin. I had another reason to see Layden. I have been dabbling in the role of the microbiome in my diabetes. And Layden is not only endocrinologist, but is involved in some high-level microbiome research with pioneering microbiome researcher Jack Gilbert, PhD, director of the Microbiome Center at the University of Chicago. Layden and Gilbert are researching what role the microbiome plays in obesity and diabetes. As I reported earlier in , I have been experimenting with microbiome approaches to coping with T2D. I have been taking some prebiotics and probiotics and have been consulting the website of DayTwo.com, where I have found which foods my personal microbes prefer in regulating my blood sugar. Layden said I am overall following the approach of the ""future"" in how I have aggressively tackled my diabetes with weight loss, diet, supplements and microbiome. He may be a microbiome researcher, but as an endocrinologist treating some very sick people with type 2 diabetics, he is skeptical that we can manipulate the microbiome to prevent disease. ""I actually think there's some value in telling me what species of bugs you have in [your gut]. Because we do know some of them are definitely associated with diabetes and some are protective for diabetes. But how do we modify it? ""I think there's some value to the probiotics, prebiotics. The problem is that they're not standardized. It's not a regulated industry. And if it's not, we don't know exactly what's in there."" In the end, I got a dose of hope of a ""cure"" or at least control of diabetes to avoid complications plus a dash of skepticism about the state of microbiome research. Layden thinks we will be able to change our microbiome and fight disease in the near future, but physicians do not have an understanding on how to do that yet. For now, I'll just head back to the gym with an eye on lowering my weight and A1c and possibly getting off metformin.

c9a2df86-58cd-4d27-9009-3da661cc3026,"Originally published July 7 2005 Sugar, high-fructose corn syrup and type II diabetes by Jessica Fraser Sugar and refined carbohydrates are undeniably linked to diabetes. Researchers around the world have come to the conclusion that the consumption of refined sugar is detrimental to the health of people without diabetes and disastrous for those with it. Furthermore, excess sugar in the blood can cause the onset of type 2 diabetes. First, however, what exactly is diabetes? According to Bruce Fife ND, ""Diabetes is all about sugar -- the sugar in our bodies known as blood sugar or blood glucose. Every cell in our bodies must have a constant source of glucose in order to fuel metabolism. Our cells use glucose to power processes such as growth and repair. When we eat a meal the digestive system converts much of our food into glucose, which is released into the bloodstream. The hormone insulin, which is secreted by the pancreas gland, moves glucose from the blood and funnels it into the cells so it can be used as fuel. If the cells are unable to get adequate amounts of glucose, they can literally starve to death. As they do, tissues and organs begin to degenerate. This is what happens in diabetes."" Obesity largely contributes to the inability of cells to obtain sufficient amounts of glucose, according to ""Green Tea"" author Nadine Taylor. Taylor writes that too many fat cells crowd the other cells in the body and make it difficult for insulin to reach its destination. According to Ralph T. Golan, 90 percent of type 2 diabetes sufferers are obese, a result directly linked to poor dietary choices and a sedentary lifestyle. Michael Castleman, author of ""Blended Medicine,"" says, ""Type 2 is strongly associated with a lack of exercise and a poor diet -- one that's low in fiber and high in sugar, fat and animal products. It develops slowly, usually over several years, and rarely produces dramatic symptoms. For this reason, many people with type 2 diabetes have no idea that they are sick. In fact, the American Diabetes Association estimates that only half of Americans with type 2 diabetes have been diagnosed."" Sugar is so detrimental to human health that many believe it would fail the FDA approval process if such a hypothetical attempt were made. Refined white flour would fare no better. Both are nutritionally empty substances. According to Dr. Robert C. Atkins, founder of the popular Atkins diet, ""Sugar has no nutritional value and is directly harmful to your health. Despite vociferous attempts to defend it, there are studies that clearly show how harmful (and even deadly in the case of diabetics) its effects can be."" According to Nancy Appleton, PhD, author of ""Lick the Sugar Habit,"" there are 78 metabolic consequences of consuming . Since the Life Extension Foundation estimates that the average American consumes more than 150 pounds of sugar per year, those 78 metabolic consequences can be considerable. Phyllis A. Balch, author of ""Prescription for Dietary Wellness,"" says this excessive consumption of sugar, especially by today's youth, has experts calling the recent dramatic rise in type 2 diabetes among adolescents an ""emerging epidemic."" In Balch's book, sports nutritionist Bill Misner says that sugar is ""devoid of vitamins, minerals and fiber."" Furthermore, as a result of its deterioration of the endocrine system, ""major researchers and major health organizations agree that sugar consumption in America is one of the three major causes of degenerative disease."" This is not surprising, considering that 150 pounds of sugar per year breaks down to the intake of 550 to 650 calories a day in sugar alone, according to Balch. In fact, the Tufts University Health and Nutrition Letter states that Americans spent $21 billion on candy alone in 2001, which is more than the gross national products of Lithuania, Costa Rica, and Mozambique combined. That amount of money can buy unimaginable amounts of sugar, which in turn does unimaginable harm to the people who consume it. Balch goes on to say, ""One in twenty of the world's adult population now has some form of diabetes, a disease associated with obesity, poor eating habits and a sedentary lifestyle. More than half of American adults are overweight. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relates that the incidence of Type 2 diabetes has risen by 33 percent in the past decade and three out of every 50 American adults currently have this diet-related condition. Complications related to diabetes are the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States."" Diabetes, however, is really only one of the numerous consequences of over-consuming sugar. Dr. John Yudkin, a leading authority on dietary sugars, says that the detrimental effects of excess sugar in the diet go far beyond rotting teeth and obesity. ""For example,"" Yudkin says, ""Sugar causes irregularities in the insulin response; Sugar causes diabetes-like damage to the kidneys; it contributes to degeneration of the retina; it raises blood levels and it increases the stickiness of the blood platelets, a common precursor of heart trouble."" ""Alternative Cures"" author Bill Gottlieb writes, ""Excess sugar in the blood damages the arteries and veins and can lead to fatal heart disease and stroke. The death rate for middle-aged people with type 2 diabetes is twice that of middle-aged people who do not have it."" Gottlieb adds, ""The glut of sugar can also cause kidney disease, eye problems, and severe nerve damage to the lower limbs and other parts of the body."" Heart and kidney diseases indicate a weakened immune system, which is damaged by excessive sugar intake. The damage doesn't stop at the immune system. The negative effects of a sugar-filled diet spread to the nervous system as well. ""Food Swings"" author Barnet Meltzer says, ""White refined sugar is also a culprit in everything from common colds and flu, bronchitis, sinus infections and digestive difficulties to breast cancer, Alzheimer's disease and Candida. By weakening the immune system, it increases the risk of degenerative illnesses and infections. In addition to imbalancing the pancreas and liver, it also attacks the central nervous system. It kills brain cells."" While heart trouble, kidney disease, and the flu are bad enough conditions to suffer through, far more dire consequences await diabetics who do nothing to control their disease. ""Fat Land"" author Greg Crister explains, ""The obese diabetic may first notice strange things happening to his or her feet; they may tingle, or they may be numb. When they are bruised or scratched, they may take a long time to heal. This is because excess sugar in the blood has damaged vital nerve endings and, in the worst case, caused atherosclerosis, leading to reduced blood flow to the limbs. The consequent numbness can mask a severe injury, which can become infected, eventually leading to gangrene and amputation."" Gottlieb writes in ""Alternative Cures"" that more than 50 percent of the lower limb amputations in the United States each year are performed on people with diabetes. On a somewhat different end of the spectrum of health matters implicitly associated with diabetes are sexual drive and performance. In ""Food and Healing,"" author Anne Marie Colbin states, ""There is some evidence that a high consumption of sugar-sweetened foods may lead not only to impotence and premature ejaculation, but to unrealistic sexual attitudes and expectations, strong urges, strange fantasies and even crimes of sexual violence."" Since the tendency to consume sweet, sugary foods in large quantities is so deeply ingrained in the eating habits of Americans, a quick answer for diabetics and those at risk of developing the disease seems to be sugar-free artificial sweeteners, such as NutraSweet or Equal. However, the Life Extension Foundation states in ""Disease Prevention and Treatment"" that consuming aspartame poses a potential health hazard, although the matter is highly debated. ""Sugar-sweetened soft drinks and confections are not permissible for prediabetic or diabetic patients, but the alternative, artificially sweetened beverages and foodstuffs, may not be either. Allegations have implicated aspartame as a potential risk factor for several disorders…Many artificial sweeteners marketed as a sugar substitute may actually contain sugar, masquerading as dextrose and maltodextrin."" Today, while products containing artificial sweeteners touted as ""sugar-free"" line U.S. grocery shelves, the problem in the 1980s and 1990s came in the form of ""fat-free"" and ""low-fat"" products. Atkins says that because the fat had been either completely or partially removed from the products, they no longer tasted good. To compensate for the lack of fat, companies packed their ""fat-free"" or ""low-fat"" products full of sugar. Where sugar is consumed, obesity is soon to follow, and diabetes will be on obesity's heels. ""The United States has 'low-fatted' and 'dieted' itself to a raging epidemic of obesity and diabetes,"" said Atkins. Joseph L. Pizzorno and Michael T. Murray, authors of ""The Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine,"" sum the problem up nicely: ""The human body was not designed to handle the amount of refined sugar, salt, saturated fats, and other harmful food compounds that many people in the United States and other Western countries feed it."" You might wonder how people can possibly consume so much sugar, but it's not difficult, according to William Duffy, author of ""Sugar Blues."" Duffy says, ""Man-refined sugar is eight times as concentrated as flour, and eight times as unnatural -- perhaps eight times as dangerous. It is the unnaturalness that deceives the tongue and appetite, leading to over-consumption. Who would eat five pounds of sugar beets a day? Yet the equivalent in refined sugar is a mere five ounces."" If refined sugar is so dangerous, even in small amounts, what can diabetics and obese people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes do to avoid it? First, turn to natural sweets like fruit. The natural sugar found in fruit and honey is fructose, which is much healthier than refined white sugar. However, commercially sold fructose, better known as , should be avoided, as it can contain up to 55 percent sucrose, which requires insulin to metabolize. Earl Mindell and Virginia Hopkins, authors of ""Prescription Alternatives,"" blame our nation's sharp rise in diabetes on increased consumption of high-fructose corn syrup and the resulting depletion of chromium in the body. Chromium is important in helping glucose pass from the bloodstream into the cells. Mindell and Hopkins say that studies done at the US Department of Agriculture's Human Nutrition Resource Center reveal that consuming fructose in this form causes chromium levels to drop, in turn raising LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and impairing immune system function. ""As our consumption of high fructose corn syrup has risen 250 percent in the past 15 years, our rate of diabetes has increased approximately 45 percent in about the same time period,"" said Mindell. ""Reversing Diabetes"" author Julian Whitaker warns that consuming some natural sweeteners still poses a threat to diabetics. ""You might think that replacing white sugar with honey, molasses, and other 'healthy' sweeteners is the way to go. Unfortunately, just like refined white sugar, almost all natural sweeteners have a high glycemic index and provoke a sharp glucose release. The one 'natural' sweetener that is low on the glycemic index is fructose."" Unfortunately for diabetics, sugar in almost all its forms can pose problems. Balch offers the following advice in ""Prescription for Dietary Wellness"": ""The risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer can be reduced through the simple act of substituting whole grains for refined grains. Refined foods such as white flour and white rice are stripped of the fiber and nutrients that whole grains still possess. The first word on the label must be whole -- don't be fooled by artificial brown or caramel coloring."" In addition to avoiding all refined sugars and flours, ""Graedons Best Medicine"" authors Joe and Dr. Terasa Graedon recommend that diabetics and obese people avoid fats. ""Fat, especially saturated fat, may be as dangerous for diabetics as sugar. Frequent small meals and the use of olive oil instead of butter or cheese may help control blood sugar and cholesterol levels."" Laurie Deutsch Mozian recommends in ""Foods That Fight Disease"" that diabetics and obese dieters eat small, healthy meals more frequently. ""People with diabetes should eat at least three meals a day at regular intervals to keep their blood sugar levels within normal range. Meals and snacks that combine carbohydrates with proteins or fats will have the longest-lasting effects on blood sugar levels because protein and fat take longer to raise blood sugar than carbohydrates do."" According to James Howenstein, author of ""A Physician's Guide to Natural Health Products that Work,"" ""Diabetes was a very rare illness in the United States in 1880, with only 2.8 persons out of every 100,000 having diabetes. Now at least 10 percent of the populace has diabetes, and when you look for early signs of diabetes, that number is certain to be much higher."" Mindell and Hopkins illustrate America's problem with obesity and diabetes by comparing the U.S. to countries that rely on natural, unrefined food sources. ""In countries where people eat a diet low in fat and sugar and high in whole foods such as unrefined grains and fresh fruits and vegetables, diabetes is almost nonexistent. When they move to the U.S., their diabetes risk skyrockets. Tragically, as Western ""nutrition free"" processed and fast foods…are introduced to Third World countries, their rates of diabetes are rapidly rising. It is estimated that by the year 2010, some 40 percent of Americans 65 or older will have adult-onset diabetes (type 2 diabetes)."" To attain enhanced states of health, diabetics and people at risk of developing it must learn to drastically cut back, or completely eliminate, their sugar and refined white flour intake by being conscious of the ingredients in the products they consume and knowing how those ingredients effect their bodies.

Radical Diet Reverses Type 2 Diabetes, But For How Long? Radical Diet Reverses Type 2 Diabetes, But For How Long? A confirms that a radical low-calorie diet can reverse Type 2 diabetes. Most subjects reduced their HbA1c level below the diabetic range, without medication. This is the third major study of a very low-calorie diet released by Dr. Roy Taylor’s team at the University of Newcastle in the UK. All have shown similar benefit in putting Type 2 diabetes into remission. However, like with the first two, published in and , we don’t know how long these remissions will last. For most people, the answer may be probably not that long. As with Dr. Taylor’s previous work, this result has . The UK Guardian’s third paragraph reported that “Nine out of ten people in the trial who lost 15 kg [33 pounds] or more put their Type 2 diabetes into remission [and]… no longer have to take medication and are free of the symptoms and risks.” Keep reading to the tenth paragraph, though, and you find the less dramatic claim that “After one year, participants had lost an average of 10 kg [22 lbs], and nearly half had reverted to a non-diabetic state.” So, we’re down from 90% remission to less than 50% remission in one year. What happens the following year? While the earlier studies were small groups (11 subjects in the first and 30 in the second) treated in a university clinic, this one followed 298 patients in 49 medical practices in Scotland and Tyneside, England. All patients in the new study started with a three-month phase of total diet replacement in cans or packages. No food of their own. According to MedPage Today, the had 825–853 calories a day, consisting of 59% carbohydrates, 13% fat, 26% protein, and 2% fiber. After three to five months on this diet, a two- to eight-week food reintroduction period followed, which consisted of 50% carbs, 35% total fat, and 15% protein. People were not encouraged to exercise during the total diet replacement, but were during the second phase. They received monthly support, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to help them make changes. Taylor says that “Substantial weight loss results in reduced fat inside the liver and pancreas, allowing these organs to return to normal function.” His team has used MRIs and other scans to document fat loss in those organs. The less fatty liver and pancreas seem to handle insulin better. “Our findings suggest that even if you have had Type 2 diabetes for six years, putting the disease into remission is feasible,” says Professor Michael Lean from the University of Glasgow, who co-led the study. Lean did stress “the need for long-term maintenance of weight loss through diet and exercise.” Unfortunately, we know that long-term maintenance of weight loss is rarely achieved by most participants in , including . It is not clear how Lean and Taylor propose to keep the weight off their patients. There is one big positive about this finding, however: “The very large weight losses that bariatric surgery can bring about are not necessary to reverse diabetes,” according to Taylor. “Even though all our volunteers remained obese or overweight, the fat did not drift back to clog up the pancreas.” Motivated people have been trying to follow Taylor’s prescription since the first study came out, with . However, there are . Health News Review, a site that reviews news about studies, points out that eight weeks of packaged diet foods and the support services would require a significant cost. They also report side effects from the intervention, which included “constipation (56% of participants), headache (45%), increased cold sensitivity (44%), and dizziness (42%). These symptoms tended to [lessen] over time.” As for what to eat on this diet, in the first study, participants got of Optifast diet drink per day, and could eat up to 200 grams (roughly 7 ounces) of nonstarchy green vegetables. You can see other low-calorie diet . Be prepared to make permanent changes when the initial weight loss is over. According to Science Daily, in the second study, the people who maintained their weight loss for six months were typically eating around than before the study. Taylor’s diet seems high in carbs for a person with diabetes. For the longer term, a lower-carb, higher-calorie diet might be possible in the maintenance phase. If someone asks me if they should try Taylor’s approach, I will say, “If you’re careful and maintain contact with your health-care providers, it probably won’t hurt. If you’re highly motivated, it might jump-start your program. But in the long run, I wouldn’t expect much.” If you decide to try a very-low-calorie approach, please keep in touch with your health professionals, and let us know how it goes.

c1ed6e0d-71d2-46de-b786-016ba28c3c42,"— Chances of remission were highest earlier in disease course by , Staff Writer, MedPage Today For putting type 2 diabetes into remission, gastric bypass appeared to be the best bariatric surgical option, data from the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2) study indicated. Among more than 800 patients with obesity and diabetes who had bariatric surgery, 57% of those undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass achieved diabetes remission versus only 22.5% of those who underwent laparoscopic gastric banding over a 7-year period, reported Jonathan Purnell, MD, of Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, and colleagues in the . Even after controlling for amount of weight lost after surgery, four-fold more gastric bypass patients achieved diabetes remission over the 7-year follow-up than gastric banding patients. Remission was complete in about four-fifths of gastric bypass patients who achieved some degree of remission. Regardless of bariatric surgery procedures, certain factors were more predictive of achieving diabetes remission after surgery. For example, younger patients and those with shorter diabetes duration prior to the procedure were more likely to achieve remission. So were those with a greater post-surgical weight loss, as well as those with higher C-peptide levels, higher estimated insulin secretion (HOMA %B), and less insulin use pre-operatively. Looking specifically at insulin resistance, gastric banding patients were more likely to achieve diabetes remission if they saw a reduction in estimated insulin resistance (HOMA IR) after surgery. On the other hand, an increase in HOMA %B was predictive of remission in gastric bypass patients. For this analysis, Purnell told his group extended out to 7 years after bariatric surgery in order to determine predictors of diabetes remission. ""We had shown that compared to undergoing laparoscopic gastric banding, participant who chose Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were nearly twice as likely to achieve diabetes remission, even accounting for differences in weight loss,"" he pointed out. ""In the present study, we tested the durability of this finding during longer follow-up."" Purnell and colleagues analyzed data on 827 adult participants from ten U.S. centers who underwent bariatric surgery between 2006 and 2009 and had diabetes at baseline. Roux-en-Y bypass was performed in 645; the remainder underwent lap banding. Full diabetes remission was defined as an HbA1c less than 5.7% or a fasting glucose under 100 mg/dL in the absence of diabetes pharmacologic therapy. Partial diabetes remission was defined as an HbA1c between 5.7 to 6.5% or a fasting glucose between 100-125 mg/dL in the absence of diabetes pharmacologic therapy. ""Diabetes remission after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is highly durable long-term,"" Purnell said, despite a slight decline in the percentage of patients remaining in remission over time. Remission rates peaked about two to three years after both types of procedures and then fell off. Overall, he said, ""we find evidence of weight-loss independent benefits on glucose metabolism in those that undergo RYGB, which if better understood could lead to new or novel treatments for diabetes."" ""Consistent with similar studies, we find that a patient's chances for achieving remission in their diabetes is greatest when they undergo surgery soon after diagnosis is established and when they need fewer medications,"" Purnell suggested, pointing out that this finding is particularly clinically relevant as its ""in contrast to current practice, which is often to wait until medical treatment has failed and/or they need multiple medications or insulin to maintain control."" But playing that waiting game will likely lessen the patient's chances that will have the best outcome of diabetes remission, he concluded. is a staff writer, focusing on endocrinology, psychiatry, and dermatology news.

Diabetes management has become a huge business opportunity and the last few years have seen an array of non-intrusive insulin delivery methods and non-needle glucose monitoring systems – flooding the markets in different shapes, sizes and price tags.

However, it will be an excellent tool for new diabetics, who are also not averse to wearing contact lenses.

(Read: Diabetic gangrene 6 essential facts every diabetic should know) Also Read - A majority of diabetics are unable to keep sugars under control despite adequate medication and follow ups. This is because the primary pathology in type 2 diabetics is not insulin deficiency but body’s resistance to insulin. In view of the rising demand for insulin in the country, there is a pressing need for the government and the regulator to bring the prices down. The newer insulin products and analogues are costlier than older ones and out of reach for many patients. In some cases, even treatment with insulin does not help in sugar control in many patients. Read more about causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of . Social media has seen a deluge of diabetes afflicted men and women expressing their angst and seeking remission as against management… here’s where metabolic surgery comes in. We now have the opportunity to redirect the diabetes care from just plain management to sustainable remission. Metabolic surgery which was started in 1950s primarily for weight loss in significantly obese people was seen to result in diabetes control in most of the patients. Since 2004, various research studies have shown that 80-90 percent diabetic patients may have remission of diabetes post this surgery. (Read: Treatments for diabetes the latest advances including Glifozins, Incretins, DPP-4 inhibitors & more) Remission is defined as normal blood sugar levels without requirement of medicines. Initially considered a side benefit of weight loss procedure, now it has been accepted that diabetes remission is a direct impact of this surgery and not an after effect of weight loss. In most of the patients, blood sugar becomes normal within 3-7 days after the surgery, even before any substantial weight loss begins. This surgery impacts the intestinal hormones called incretins, which are now believed to be responsible for type 2 diabetes. Metabolic surgery has been accepted by International Diabetes Federation (IDF), American Society of Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery and Obesity Surgery Society of India. Now, this surgery can even be offered to non obese (>27.5 BMI) Asian diabetic patients, as mentioned in IDF position statement. The purpose of such surgery is not weight loss any more but diabetes control only. This change in approach has given benefit to millions of non-obese diabetic Indians. The results here have also become better with time. Surgeons like Francesco Rubino, Phil Schauer etc have demonstrated exceptional documented results. It is a matter of time before the tables are turned and 80 percent diabetic Indians will not only be controlled diabetic but also have freedom from daily injections or consuming tablets for sugar control. By 2030, India’s diabetes numbers are expected to cross the 100 million mark according to a 2012 report by International Diabetes Federation. The economic burden due to diabetes in India is among the highest in the world. In the Middle East too, where I consult patients regularly, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has increased dramatically over the last three decades. As many as six Middle East countries are among the Top 10 countries globally in terms of T2D prevalence – Kuwait (24 percent), Qatar (23 percent), Saudi Arabia (23 percent), Bahrain (22 percent), UAE (19 percent) and Lebanon (17 percent).

66f15383-d91b-429a-88c5-259b51bd3120,"November is National Diabetes Month, and much government and media attention is focused on the need to slow the growing “epidemic” of diabetes and prediabetes[1] in the United States. Efforts to this end include the American Diabetes Association’s Stop Diabetes campaign[2], which encourages people to take an online risk test to assess their personal risk of developing prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes[3] and to see a doctor if their test results suggest a high risk. But what if you already have diabetes? Is there anything in National Diabetes Month for you? Of course there is! For people who already have diabetes, it’s as good a time as any to take a look at your diabetes management and ask yourself how things are going. Are there areas that need improvement? Are you interested in connecting with other people who have diabetes? Would you like to participate in a diabetes fundraiser? Would you like to learn something new? Here are some suggestions for making the most of a month devoted to diabetes. Many lifestyle habits — not just eating and exercising — can affect your general health and your diabetes management. Some may affect your blood glucose levels directly, and others may have a more indirect effect, enabling or preventing you from carrying out your daily routines, for example. Rather than choose something you feel you “should” do, pick something you feel able and willing to do. Here are some ideas: Not getting enough sleep can increase insulin resistance[4], meaning your body requires more insulin to get glucose into your cells. This can lead to higher blood glucose levels and is believed to have other negative health effects. Inadequate sleep also tends to leave you feeling fatigued during the day, which is likely to make it harder for you to exercise, eat right, think, remember, and cope with stress. Most adults need between 7 1/2 and 9 hours of sleep a night. Start your efforts to sleep more by setting and sticking to a regular bedtime and making your bedroom as dark and quiet as possible. For more tips on getting more sleep, go to “Getting the Sleep You Need.”[5] Dehydration can make you feel tired and headachy, and because thirst is often mistaken for hunger, it can also cause you to eat more. Drinking more water can make you feel better and help your body function better. But even if you’re not dehydrated, drinking more water in place of caloric or alcoholic beverages will likely be good for your health. Calories consumed in liquids don’t tend to satisfy hunger the way calories in food do, so it’s easy to drink a lot of calories without really noticing them. Quench your thirst with water, then eat food if you’re hungry. You’ll probably find nothing of great interest on your feet in a month of daily checking, but it’s never too early to familiarize yourself with what your feet normally look like. That way, if something changes, you will notice more quickly. When checking your feet, note how easily you can see the bottoms of your feet. If you find it’s a strain, consider getting a hand mirror (possibly a lighted or magnified one) that allows you to see them with less effort. Periodontal, or gum, disease can negatively affect your diabetes control. Practicing good oral hygiene[7], including daily brushing and flossing, can go a long way toward preventing periodontal disease. Even if you hate flossing, commit to it for a month, then see whether it’s become a less-dreaded, more easily accomplished part of your daily routine. Vowing to “exercise more” is a difficult resolution to carry out. Clipping a pedometer to your belt or waistband every morning, on the other hand, is easy, and at the end of each day, you have a numerical readout of how active you were during the day. You may be surprised at how few — or how many — steps you take each day, but at least you know where you stand. When you’re ready, you can take the next step of deciding whether to purposely increase your daily steps. Many people aim for 10,000 steps a day, which is about 5 miles. Fruits and vegetables[8] offer numerous nutrition benefits, including fiber, potassium, and other vitamins and minerals. While the amounts of various nutrients vary from one fruit or vegetable to the next — with darker-colored produce usually containing more nutrients — consuming a variety is an excellent way to reap a full range of benefits. 2. Seek out a diabetes-related event or activity in your area. Numerous organizations sponsor events such as walkathons[9], bike rides, support groups, health fairs, and other activities that are aimed at raising public awareness of diabetes, raising money for diabetes research, or offering education and support to people living with diabetes. Not all of these take place during November (and in 2020, many have switched to virtual events), but most will have information available on when and how to sign up for future events. The American Diabetes Association holds Step Out walkathons[10] and Tour de Cure bike rides to raise money for educational outreach, advocacy efforts, and research. For the walk, participants are encouraged to raise as much money as possible; for the ride, a minimum dollar amount is required to participate. The ADA also puts on free, daylong diabetes Expos — with lectures, demonstrations, and other educational components — at convention centers around the United States each year. Information on all ADA events and contact information for local chapters can be found online or by calling. www.diabetes.org[11] (888)-DIABETES (342-2383) JDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International) organizes Walks to Cure Diabetes and Rides to Cure Diabetes (multiday bike rides). For the walks, participants are encouraged to raise as much money as possible; for the rides, a minimum dollar amount is required to participate. The JDRF also supports other types of community fund-raising events organized by individuals. (Anyone may register a community event.) www.jdrf.org[12] (888) 533-WALK (for information about walkathons) (888) 533-9255 (to find your local chapter) TCOYD, which stands for Taking Control of Your Diabetes, holds a dozen or so daylong educational conferences and health fairs at locations around the United States. The events include lectures, health screenings, informational exhibits, demonstrations of various types, and more for about $30. http://tcoyd.org[13] (800) 99-TCOYD (8-2693) 3. Seek out special Diabetes Month sales or other offers. Pharmacies and other stores or service providers often have sales or discounts on diabetes-related items during National Diabetes Month. You may find free or low-cost health services such as blood pressure checks or vision screenings, discounts on diabetes supplies, or discounts on coaching or other educational services. To find such offers, keep an eye on flyers or other communications from the places where you usually buy your diabetes supplies. The United States is not the only part of the world affected by diabetes: World Diabetes Day was created in 1991 by the International Diabetes Federation and the World Health Organization to draw attention to the growing health threat posed by diabetes everywhere. In 2007, World Diabetes Day became an official United Nations Day. To see what events and activities are planned for World Diabetes Day this year, check out the website of the International Diabetes Federation: www.idf.org[15] You no doubt already know a lot about diabetes, but why not observe National Diabetes Month by learning something new? Look up something you’ve been wondering about, or browse through a website or book or magazine on diabetes until something catches your eye. Here are some sources of diabetes information you might find interesting: The NDEP publishes brochures and fact sheets aimed at people of different ages, different types of diabetes, and different ethnic or racial backgrounds. The website has several ways of searching by topic or by personal characteristics to help users get to the publications they need more quickly. http://ndep.nih.gov[16] (800) 860-8747 (to order publications) The search engine Diaboogle is a Google custom search engine developed by blogger Bernard Farrell to weed out the sales pitches and gimmicks and connect searchers with useful, authoritative diabetes information and support. Just type a word or phrase you’d like to search on in the search box, then refine your search by clicking on Prevention, Complications, Symptoms, or Products, if desired. www.diaboogle.com[17] The JDRF has an Adult Type 1 Toolkit, and it also offers a “Newly Diagnosed” version. The Toolkit offers information about Type 1 diabetes and lists resources for further information and help. Both versions can be downloaded at no cost[18]. (800) 533-CURE (2873) When you need information not just about diabetes in general but about your diabetes in particular, a one-on-one meeting with a certified diabetes care and education specialist[19] may be the way to go. Ask your diabetes care provider for a recommendation, or look for one in your area using the search function on the website of the American Association of Diabetes Educators. Remember to write down any questions you have before your appointment, to bring a list of all of the medicines you are currently taking, and to bring your blood glucose monitoring log. www.diabeteseducator.org[20] (800) 832-6874 The DRI is dedicated to “cure-focused research.” To learn more about the research they’re doing, go to www.diabetesresearch.org[21]. www.diabetesresearch.org[21] Using a blood glucose meter[22] is only helpful if you know how to respond to your numbers. While low blood glucose numbers (lower than 70 mg/dl) demand immediate attention, in general, it’s best to look for trends or patterns in your blood glucose numbers, rather than to focus on isolated numbers. You will inevitably see some variation in your numbers from one day to the next, but what’s important is whether your numbers are usually in your target range first thing in the morning, before and two hours after meals, at bedtime, etc. Patterns of out-of-range numbers mean that you need a change in some aspect of your diabetes regimen. The format you use to write down your monitoring results can make it easier or more difficult to see patterns. Your diabetes educator may be able to recommend a particular format or logbook. Two monitoring logs that can be downloaded for free from the Internet are the Accu-Chek Testing in Pairs tool and the Accu-Chek 360° View tool. The Testing in Pairs tool is designed to help you see how meals, exercise, or other activities or events affect your blood glucose level over seven days. The 360° View tool shows how different meals affect your blood glucose level and energy level over three days. Both forms are intended to be discussed with a health-care provider after being filled out. To find the forms, go here: Accu-Chek Testing in Pairs[23] Accu-Chek 360° View[24] Is there something you’d like to tell someone in your life about your diabetes? Would you like to inform a family member, a friend, or your doctor about the challenges of managing your diabetes or the effects it is having on your lifestyle or body? Do you need to ask for help in some area? No matter what the specifics of your desired communication, it can be hard to know how to start conversations of a personal nature, even — sometimes especially — with the people who are close to you. It helps to think through what you want to say before you say it. It also helps to think about how, when, and where you will start this conversation. Would a phone call be best? Or would a face-to-face meeting work better? It’s often a good idea to let the other person know ahead of time that you’d like to have a conversation on a particular topic. That way he is not taken off guard and can truly set aside other concerns to focus on you. Be aware of your own emotions connected to what you want to say, and be prepared for the other person to have an emotional response to your information — but don’t assume that you know what those emotions will be. Try to stay calm and nondefensive. After you’ve stated as clearly as possible what you want to say, give the other person time to absorb it and respond. Listen carefully, and watch for nonverbal cues to better understand what the person is saying and feeling. Be prepared to take a break and revisit the topic at a later date: It may take a while for your message to sink in, or for the other person to sort out his thoughts and emotions. Communication is difficult. If your efforts to communicate feel fruitless, seek help. Working with a therapist is a good way to learn to communicate more effectively, but you can learn more on your own, too. Here are some resources: www.helpguide.org[25] (Click on “Topics A-Z,” then “Relationships & Communication” for articles on communication.) http://locator.apa.org[26] (to find a psychologist) http://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms[27] (to find a therapist) Whether your to-do list is in your head or written down, you probably have one. The more specific the items on your list are, the easier it is to do them. If your to-do list has things like “eat better” or “exercise more” on it, find some specific steps that you could easily implement that would bring you closer to these goals. For example, plan a week of healthy lunches and write out a shopping list, then put “go grocery shopping” on your to-do list. In case you don’t have a list, here are some ideas: • Write out a list of your current medicines and doses. Date it, make a couple of photocopies, and keep a copy with you (in a purse or wallet, for example) in case of a medical emergency or a new prescription. • Enter your emergency contact numbers into your cell phone. • Write out some questions for your next visit to your health-care provider. • Schedule a specialist appointment that you’ve been putting off. • Put together a sick-day kit. If you’re not sure what to put in it, here’s a list to get you started: Sick-Day Kit[28] Talking with other people who are facing the same challenges as you are can make your burden feel much lighter. Even if nothing actually changes on a practical level, feeling heard and understood has enormous psychological benefits. And it’s possible that the people you meet through an online social network or in-person support group will have information or resources that can have a practical effect. To find a support group, try calling your local chapter of the ADA or JDRF, or contact the diabetes department at your local hospital. Hospitals or other medical offices that offer diabetes education classes sometimes also have support groups that you can join. Here are some other potential sources of support: DiabetesSisters organizes regular support group meetings (which they call PODS meetups) for women with diabetes and has a SisterMatch program to match up women for mutual support. They also hold occasional conferences and other events. www.diabetessisters.org[29] Divabetic holds monthly Divabetic Club meetings in various U.S. cities, as well as occasional other outreach programs. While Divabetic programs are aimed mainly at women with diabetes, men are welcome, too. www.divabetic.org[30] TypeOneNation is the JDRF’s online social network for people with Type 1 diabetes and their families and friends. www.juvenation.org[31] 10. Reach out to someone else with diabetes or prediabetes. There are lots of ways to reach out to others to share your knowledge, experience, and resources, offer a sympathetic ear, or simply open the door to conversation. Even sharing the questions you have about your diabetes with others can be helpful; someone else who needs the answer may not have even thought to ask the question. Here are some ways to reach out: • Invite some friends who have diabetes to your house for dinner to swap stories, recipes, recommendations, etc. • Participate in an online discussion. Let others know what tools have been helpful for you. • Talk to your relatives about their risk of diabetes. Having a close relative (such as a parent or sibling) with Type 2 diabetes puts a person at higher risk of developing it, too. If you have Type 2 diabetes, therefore, make sure your relatives know that they are at risk, too, but that there are ways to prevent it. One step that can help is to seek out a Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)[32] at your local YMCA. Lots of Ys have them these days, so call your local Y to see if it has the program, what it costs, and whether financial aid is available to help pay for it.

8106d70b-868d-40a6-a3ba-f871d3a19578,"— Including how to restore pancreas volume and reading glucose levels from tears by , Staff Writer, MedPage Today The virtual European Association for the Study of Diabetes 2020 meeting featured new insights and developments in helping people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes improve glycemic control and related outcomes. Some of the new research presented included positive phase II findings for a , for people with type 1 and 2 diabetes, and the . Below are highlights of several other noteworthy studies from the meeting. People with type 2 diabetes who were able to achieve an HbA1c level under 6.5% and a fasting blood glucose under 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), and could get off all anti-diabetic medication saw a significant increase in pancreas volume after 2 years. Those who achieved remission had a pancreatic volume increase by 12.6±1.5 cm compared with 4.5±1.3 cm in those not able to achieve remission of their type 2 diabetes (<0.0001). Pancreas borders also normalized after 24 months of diabetes remission, the 64-person Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT) study found. This restoration of pancreas morphology took some time, however, as remission of diabetes did not change pancreas volume after only 5 months (63.0±2.8 at baseline to 64.0±2.8 cm, =0.10). ""Large amounts of insulin cause tissues to grow, or at least maintain their size. Normally, inside the pancreas the amounts of insulin present after a meal are very high. But in type 2 diabetes this does not happen. This new study suggests that achieving remission of type 2 diabetes restores this healthy, direct effect of insulin on the pancreas,"" explained the study's lead author, Roy Taylor, MD, of Newcastle University in England, in a press release. In an observational study in Europe of 49 pilots with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, introducing a new color-coded glucose protocol effectively eliminated safety events. The 49 pilots included in the study, who had all been granted medical certification to fly either commercial or non-commercial aircrafts, checked their blood glucose levels prior to the flight, hourly during the flight, and 30 minutes prior to landing. These values were then color-coded into a traffic light coding system: ""green"" (90-270 mg/dL), ""amber"" (low 72-88.2 mg/dL, high 271.8-360 mg/dL), and ""red"" (low <72 mg/dL, high >360 mg/dL). In the event of a ""red"" reading, the pilot was required to immediately hand off flying responsibilities to a co-pilot or land the plane as soon as safely possible if flying alone. During 22,078 flying hours, nearly 98% of glucose measures were within the green zone. In comparison, only 0.12% were in the low red range and 0.02% were in the high red range, according to the study, also published in . ""There were no periods of pilot incapacitation throughout the whole study,"" lead author Gillian Garden, MBChB, of the University of Surrey in Guildford, England, pointed out during a press conference. ""We believe that the study is of international importance and this protocol could be adopted by other aviation authorities to allow more insulin-treated pilots worldwide to be able to fly commercial aircrafts."" In a possible alternative to invasive finger pricks, glycoalbumin levels in tears were found to be accurately representative of blood glucose levels. In a study of 100 people with diabetes, glycoalbumin levels in tears, measured by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, were not influenced by the concentration or dilution of tears. A multiple regression model showed that the correlation between glycoalbumin levels in blood and tears was also maintained after adjustment for age, gender, nephropathy stage, and obesity (ß 0.738, 95% CI 0.594-0.882, <0.001). ""In the future, we plan to optimize measurement conditions and develop measurement equipment, and to verify the effectiveness and usefulness of diabetes monitoring methods,"" said lead author, Masakazu Aihara, of the University of Tokyo, during a virtual presentation of the poster study. is a staff writer, focusing on endocrinology, psychiatry, and dermatology news. Based out of the New York City office, she’s worked at the company for nearly five years. Taylor reported relationships with Wilmington Healthcare, Diabetes UK, Lilly, and Novartis.

Alzheimer’s disease is a form of vascular dementia and is so pervasive in today’s world that it has become the third leading cause of mortality in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Dementia is a broad term for multiple neurodegenerative diseases that typically affect older adults, causing cognitive impairment and a steady decline in brain function and mental acuity. Scientists are actively studying the relationship between type 3 diabetes and Alzheimer's, and many have begun to . , dementia is arguably the most devastating disease of the 21st century: Dementia affects almost 6 million people in the USA alone, which may be an underestimate A person is diagnosed with dementia once every 64 seconds After the age of 85, almost 50% of adults have dementia This results in almost $340 billion of direct cost and $260 billion in indirect cost each year Estimates show this number reaching as high as $3 trillion worldwide by 2050 The cost of dementia absolutely dwarfs other leading causes of mortality in the U.S., including and cancer . In this article, we'll explore the connection between insulin resistance, diabetes, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease and showcase the research that demonstrates that your brain health is determined mainly by your lifestyle – not by your genetics. Why is Alzheimer’s Disease Considered Type 3 Diabetes? Is Type 3 Diabetes The Same as Type 3C Diabetes Mellitus? Alzheimer's Disease and Diabetes: A Scientific Look Why is Alzheimer’s Disease Considered Type 3 Diabetes? The negative effects of diabetes come from , a buildup of fatty acids in cells that are not meant to store fats. This prevents cells from effectively processing glucose, leading to hyperglycemia (high blood glucose) and many other side effects. For an in-depth understanding of insulin resistance and the metabolic dysfunction it causes, check out our In the case of , insulin deficiency is primarily caused by the autoimmune attack of insulin producing beta cells in your pancreas, dramatically reducing your ability to manufacture and secrete insulin. In the case of , oftentimes beta cells are capable of manufacturing and secreting sufficient insulin, but insulin resistance in your muscle and liver results in reduced insulin action in both tissues. However, rather than manifesting early in life (as is often the case with type 1 diabetes) or in young to middle adulthood (as often happens with type 2 diabetes), type 3 diabetes typically affects adults 65 and older. The other difference with type 3 diabetes is that it primarily manifests in damage to the brain, and can cause a dramatic decline in cognitive function. Is Type 3 Diabetes The Same as Type 3C Diabetes Mellitus? Even though type 3 diabetes and type 3c diabetes have similar names, these two forms of diabetes are actually quite different. Type 3 diabetes is a form of diabetes that affects the brain and impairs cognitive function. is a form of diabetes that reduces insulin secretion, not from damage to the brain, but from damage to the pancreas caused mainly by . Alzheimer's Disease and Diabetes: A Scientific Look Your brain is the most powerful and most important organ in your body. In fact, your brain is a fascinating tissue that: Consumes between Is estimated to , which is more powerful than any supercomputer in existence Can compute an estimate of calculations per second! Contains upwards of (and has the ability to rewire itself) As a result, your brain has a high demand for blood flow to bring a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients. However, it is also a very delicate organ, with millions of capillary blood vessels and very specific requirements for nutrients. Over time, a brain that is constantly adjusting to suboptimal nutrition and impaired blood flow will accumulate slow and steady damage. Your brain is very adaptable, so typically a condition like dementia doesn’t manifest when you’re young, and becomes more apparent as you age. However, over the course of a lifetime, these can each contribute to cognitive decline and increase your risk for type 3 diabetes: Chronic insulin resistance (present in the majority of patients living with all forms of diabetes eating a low-carbohydrate diet) An insufficient supply of high-quality nutrients found in fruit and vegetables Once type 3 diabetes takes hold, this long term damage can increase, causing a wide variety of cognitive impairments like memory loss, cognitive decline, and more. Type 3 diabetes is different from other forms of dementia like based on the rate of loss of cognitive function. Vascular dementia is often caused by a stroke or other traumatic event, and results in an immediate decline in cognitive function, followed by a plateau. Type 3 diabetes manifests as a slow and steady decline in cognitive function. Once type 3 diabetes manifests, there is currently . There are drugs that help with the symptoms and cognitive decline, but the underlying disease is not currently curable. For this reason, the scientific community has very recently begun to focus on , and how through a plant-based diet, exercise, proper sleep, cognitive activity, and management of stress it’s possible to reverse early signs of type 3 diabetes and prevent cognitive decline. The symptoms of type 3 diabetes are , and include: Trouble understanding visual or spatial relationships Misplacing things, losing the ability to retrace steps One other early sign of type 3 diabetes is , which can occur both due to the same insulin resistance that often accompanies type 3 diabetes as well as behavioral changes. There is currently no single agreed-upon method to diagnose type 3 diabetes. In most cases, noticing one or multiple symptoms will result in a doctor running several cognitive tests. These tests, which , are administered to determine your degree of cognitive impairment, and also eliminate other causes of impairment. These cognitive tests tend to be frequently administered starting in early middle age, which can also help establish a baseline to show any decline in brain health. On a physical level, there are two biomarkers that can help indicate the presence of type 3 diabetes: , and . Cognitive impairment combined with the presence of these biomarkers, along with other diabetes markers like high glucose levels, is a very strong indication of the presence of type 3 diabetes. Type 3 diabetes . Despite $2.8 billion of research funding expected in 2020, currently, 100% of medications . Research continues for a cure for type 3 diabetes, but recent years have placed a focus heavily on more effective of the disease. One of the most effective prevention methods has involved identifying the highest risk factors for type 3 diabetes and working to counteract them. There’s a common misconception that type 3 diabetes is untreatable and unpreventable. However, this is not true. There are in which type 3 diabetes is genetically , which means that no change in lifestyle will affect whether or not it manifests. In the rest of cases, type 3 diabetes manifests as a result of genetic and lifestyle factors, where the effect of lifestyle vastly outweighs the effect of genetics. There are several risk factors that you cannot control that can potentially affect your risk for developing type 3 diabetes, and all are related to genetics. According to the research, the following factors can signal an : On the other hand, there are a number of different, for type 3 diabetes that are very controllable. They include, but are not limited to: Excessive ‘bad’ stress, and a lack of ‘good stress’ Currently, there’s no way to reverse type 3 diabetes. However, as mentioned above, less than 3% of all type 3 diabetes cases are genetically determined. The remaining 97% of cases can be affected by your lifestyle. The same risk factors above, when controlled, can drastically decrease your chance of developing type 3 diabetes, or at the very least delay its onset. One helpful acronym developed by the experts at is NEURO, which stands for Nutrition, Exercise, Unwind, Restorative Sleep, and Optimize Brain Function.

53f7f161-c74a-4364-b97e-253b9ca25de2," >  > Sugar, Diabetes and Incurable diseases  About white sugar, Aspartame, other concentrated sweeteners and health Cause and prevention of diseases In Sugar We Trust This page is important stop for all of You who are addicted to sugar, honey, or any other concentrated sweetener. For all of You who eat sugar every day in all kind of food, from bread to Coca Cola, from ice-cream to ketchup, from hot-dog to cakes, jams, candies, sausages, yogurts ...  And for all of You who are having problems like colds, flu, food allergies, high cholesterol, candida, cancer, diabetes, fatty degeneration, degenerative diseases, depression, dizziness, crying spells, aggression, insomnia, weakness, skin problems, heart and circulatory diseases...       White sugar is refined sucrose (simple sugar),  CHO , produced by multiple chemical processing of the juice of the sugar cane or sugar beet and by removal of all fiber , protein and minerals , which amount to 90 percent of the natural plant. ( P.S.  I do not want to be misunderstood. I will explain that concentrated sweeteners are bad for your health. BUT, that does not mean that you should use artificial sweeteners like aspartame (nutra sweet), xilitol, sorbitoll, or any other artificial sweeteners. ALL artificial sweeteners are worse for your health then natural sweeteners, so think about it! )      Fructose (corn syrup) is No Answer For a Sweetener  Jan 04   Dec 30 This page is not only about white sugar. It is also about brown/ raw/ turbinado sugar, molasses, syrups, and other concentrated sweeteners like : dextrose (glucose) , fructose, galactose, maltose, lactose, dextrin, dextrains,  and honey. Our body digests and absorbs these concentrated sources of sugars rapidly, and quickly turns them into saturated fatty acids and cholesterol. If we do not burn off the fat through activity, it will start accumulating under our skin,in our lever in our arteries and other organs. One thing is common characteristic for all those sweeteners: they are concentrated and composed of simple sugars  (monosaccharide  and disaccharide). Simple sugars are also called rapid sugars because they do not need digestion and are absorbed rapidly in our bloodstream. After being absorbed in our bloodstream, they rise blood glucose levels too high. This condition is called hyperglycemia, and is one of the symptoms of diabetes. If or pancreas function as it should, it will produce enough insulin to remove excess glucose from our bloodstream with amazing efficiency. But huge production of insulin can not be stopped in the same moment as sugar stop coming in the bloodstream. To much insulin will then cause too rapid fall of glucose level in the blood. That is called , and symptoms may include depression, dizziness, crying spells, aggression, insomnia, weakness, and even loss of consciousness.     When blood glucose falls too low, our adrenal glands will mobilize the body's stores of glycogen (starch like carbohydrate , many glucose molecules hooked end to end in a chain,stored in liver and muscle) and will also stimulate the synthesis of glucose from proteins and other substances present in our body. A diet rich in sugars will catch our pancreas and adrenal glands in a biochemical see-saw, overworking them. It could weaken pancreas and result in diabetes. complications that follow excess glucose or fats kill many diabetics. If our body is unable to use all of the extra fats and cholesterol produced from sugars,it must dump the additional load. Fats can be deposited in the cells of our liver, heart, arteries, fat tissues, kidneys, muscles, and other organs.  That is beginning of  fatty degeneration. One of the aspects of fatty degeneration is deposition of visible fat in places where it is not normally found in healthy people. Fatty degeneration includes atherosclerosis, fatty liver and kidneys, some tumors, obesity and some forms of diabetes.  Sugars inhibit the function of our immune system, and increase diseases caused by poor immune function, such as colds, flu, AIDS, allergies, infections, ... Sugars increase our body's production of adrenaline by four times, which puts the body into a state of  'fight or flight'  stress, without anything to fight or flee from , except the consumption of sugar. This stress reaction increases the production of both cholesterol and cortisone. Cortisone inhibits immune function. Sugars lack the vitamins and minerals required for their own metabolism. To be metabolized, sugars must draw on our body's stores of these nutrients. The more sugars you eat, the more vitamins and minerals you need. It can leach B, C, D  vitamins, and those minerals: calcium, phosphorous, iron, selenium, zinc, chromium, vanadium, tin, boron, bismuth, rear earth elements etc. from our teeth, bones, and tissues. As these are depleted, our body becomes less able to carry out other functions that require minerals and vitamins to be present: to metabolize fats and cholesterol; to convert cholesterol into bile acids for removal from our body through the stool; or to burn-off excess fats as heat or increased activity. As a result , our cholesterol level rises; our metabolic rate goes down; fats burn more slowly; gall stones are crystallizing in or liver; we feel less like exercising, and our weight is increasing.   We have already started walking our way to cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. As you see , sugar is where it all starts, I mean disease.          Sugar causes irritation and weakening of the mucous membranes of the body and robs the teeth, bones and blood of a great percentage of their minerals. Inflammatory diseases of the breathing and digestive organs result from the use of brown and white sugar. If , after reading those facts you feel to stop eating sugar , we are recommending next alternatives: dry fruit, fresh fruit, fresh fruit juice,  resins, apple syrup, rice malt, barley malt. But, do not just replace sugar with malt, or apple syrup.  It is also important to generally decrease consumption of concentrated sweeteners. Eat more fresh fruit and compote.        The easiest way of decreasing consumption of sugar is by decreasing consumption of meat. There is a balance between meat consumption and sugar. If you eat meat, you need sugar, and visa versa. Serious trouble can happen if the balance is off which is easy since sugar is addictive, like a drug. If you are a vegetarian and eat mostly carbohydrates, the effect of extra sugar is heightened. One of the major drawbacks is that sugar raises the insulin level, which inhibits the release of growth hormones, which in turn depresses the immune system. Not something you want to happen if you want to avoid sickness. According to Kathleen DesMaisons in her book Potatoes Not Prozac sugar sensitive people , those who have a more volatile reaction to the substance, usually have low levels of serotonin and low levels of beta endorphins. The level of beta endorphins have a direct impact on a person’s self esteem, tolerance for pain, sense of connectiveness and to the ability to take personal responsibility for action. It follows that with higher levels of beta endorphins the disease management process would be easier. When blood sugar spikes it signals the adrenal glands to release more adrenaline. This leads to adrenal fatigue and in turn makes blood sugar ups and downs ever more pronounced. Note this, for many of us have adrenals already fatigued from overeating of sugar. According to the difference between sugar addiction and narcotic addiction is largely one of degree. Here are some suggestions to make the withdrawal easier: - As you are reducing the amount of sugar also reduce the amount of meat you are eating -Taking that contain trace minerals  would solve problem of craving for Sugar and sweets ! - Craving for Sugar and sweets is a symptom of deficiency. - Don’t eat any concentrated sweetener for breakfast - Eat your breakfast as late as possible and start with fruit - Make treats like cookies sweetened with rice syrup (a honey like sweetener made from cultured rice) or barley malt - Get to know some new foods that have a subtle sweet taste from natural sugars. Try manna bread (tastes like a muffin but is made only from sprouted grains) or oatmilk. - Get to know more about the sugar/depression/energy connection. Read Food and Healing, , or Potatoes Not Prozac Sugars are classified as either simple or complex carbohydrates. Refined sugars such as white, brown, and turbinado sugars, and the unrefined simple sugars, such as fruit sweeteners and concentrated fruit juices, are all simple carbohydrates. The grain syrups: barley malt and brown rice syrup, contain complex carbohydrates besides some simple sugars. Complex carbohydrates are a string of simple sugars (glucose) strung together that must be broken back down into simple sugars before they can be absorbed into the bloodstream; whereas simple sugars can go directly into the bloodstream. An influx of sugar into the blood stream upsets the body's blood sugar balance, triggering the release of insulin, which the body uses to keep blood sugar at a safe and constant level. Insulin also promotes the storage of fat, so when you eat sweets high in sugar and fat, you're making way for rapid weight gain and elevated triglyceride levels, both of which have been linked to cardiovascular disease. Complex carbohydrates tend to be absorbed more slowly, lessening the impact on blood sugar levels. Refined sugars have been stripped of the vitamins, minerals, and fiber that were originally present before processing. White sugar is 99.9 percent sucrose, and brown and turbinado are 96 percent sucrose. Brown sugar is white sugar with molasses and/or caramel coloring added. Turbinado sugar, also called raw sugar, is slightly less refined and contains a trace amount of a few minerals. Consequently, consuming large amounts of refined sugars places an extra burden on the body to supply the nutrients, specifically the B vitamins, chromium, magnesium, and zinc, needed to convert glucose (blood sugar) into energy. According to USDA biochemist Richard Anderson, refined sugar may also impair the absorption of trace minerals like copper and chromium present in some of the other foods we have eaten. Refined simple sugars also have an impact on brain chemistry. They raise serotonin levels, which can leave you feeling drowsy. However, the unrefined simple fruit sweeteners have less impact on brain chemistry because they are high in the sugar fructose, which does not affect serotonin levels. Choosing natural sweeteners  rich in complex carbohydrates and reading labels before buying a product will help you reduce your consumption of refined sugar. Natural sweeteners retain most of their vitamins and minerals, and many contain complex carbohydrates. Below is a list and brief description of some of the natural sweeteners available. is made from (yeast culture) fermented brown rice and sprouted whole barley. Like barley malt, it is ground and heated to make a thick syrup. Because of its mild taste, it can be used as a substitute for white or brown sugar. It is one of the best of all concentrated sweeteners ! Avoid it if you have Candida Albicans (yeast) problem ! is made from (yeast culture) fermented whole barley which is sprouted to break down some of the carbohydrate into the simple sugar maltose. It is then ground and heated to make a thick syrup. Barley malt is a good substitute for brown and white sugar. It is delicious in hot breakfast cereals, cookies, breads, muffins, and recipes using carob. It is one of the best of all concentrated sweeteners ! Avoid it if you have Candida Albicans (yeast) problem ! are made from dried brown rice syrup or a combination of dried brown rice syrup and powdered grape juice concentrate. Brown rice sweeteners have a very mild flavor and can be used to replace white or brown sugar in baked goods. Avoid it if you have Candida Albicans (yeast) problem ! includes frozen juice concentrates such as grape or apple juice and refrigerated jars of fruit concentrates which are typically blends of juices such as peach, pear, and pineapple juice. Fruit concentrates are thicker than fruit juice concentrates and are made by cooking whole fruits at very low temperatures until they have been reduced to a thick syrup. Fruit sweeteners work well in most baked goods. They are not much better then white or brown sugar !!! 90 - 96 % simple sugars, fructose, glucose, and sucrose is made from the sap of sugar maple trees. Thirty­five to 50 gallons of sap are boiled to produce one gallon of maple syrup. Grade A maple syrup has a lighter color and flavor than Grade B, which is darker with a stronger flavor. It is not much better then white or brown sugar!!! is a mixture of acid secretions from the glands of honeybees and nectar from flowers. Although honey is a natural sweetener, it is considered a refined sugar because 96% of dry matter are simple sugars: fructose, glucose and sucrose. It is sweeter and higher in calories than refined white sugar. Honey does contain some B vitamins, minerals, and enzymes. However, the enzymes are generally destroyed by high heat causing the honey to lose nutritional properties when used in baking. God to use in special cures, but not as a every day food ! It is not much better then white or brown sugar!!! 96 % simple sugars, fructose, glucose, and sucrose is made from organically grown sugar cane juice that has been filtered and dehydrated. Its a simple sugar that tastes much like brown or turbinado sugar; however, its less refined and contains more vitamins and minerals. Granulated cane juice can be used as a substitute for both white and brown sugar, but it is still rich in sucrose. It is not much better then white or brown sugar!!! is a by­product of the refined white, brown, and turbinado sugars. Sweet molasses or light molasses is the liquid left after the first extraction of sugar crystals. Blackstrap molasses is the liquid left after the last extraction of sugar crystals, and has a stronger, bittersweet flavor and is richer in potassium, calcium, iron, and B­vitamins than sweet molasses.   Though molasses is better than white sugar, it still contain a lot of it, so I can not recommend eating molasses. It is not much better then white or brown sugar!!! The granulated brown rice and cane juice sweeteners are roughly equal in sweetness to refined white, brown, or turbinado sugar and can be substituted on a cup for cup basis without changing t anything else in the recipe. When you substitute a liquid sweetener for a dry one or vice versa, you will have to adjust the recipe to end up with the right batter consistency. The chart (below) will help you modify your recipes when using natural sweeteners. To replace 1 cup dry sweetener with 1 cup liquid sweetener: reduce another liquid by 1/3 cup or add 4-5 tablespoons flour. To replace 1 cup dry sweetener with 3/4 cup honey: reduce another liquid by 1/4 cup or add 1/3 cup flour. To replace 1 cup liquid sweetener with 1 cup dry sweetener: To replace 1 cup liquid sweetener with 3/4 cup honey: Note: When using thick liquid sweeteners, heat the jar in hot water for five minutes to make pouring easier and spray measuring cups with vegetable spray to prevent sticking. The average American consumes an astounding two pounds of sugar each week, which is not surprising considering that highly refined sugars in the forms of sucrose (table sugar), dextrose (corn sugar), and high-fructose corn syrup are being processed into so many foods such as bread, breakfast cereal, ketchup, mayonnaise, peanut butter, spaghetti sauce, and a plethora of microwave meals. Adults purchase over 50% of all chocolate sold in USA. An average American consume 147 pounds of sweeteners each year.

The retina is the nerve layer that lines the back of your eye. It is the part of your eye that ""takes pictures"" and sends the images to your brain. Many people with diabetes get retinopathy. This kind of retinopathy is called diabetic retinopathy (retinal disease caused by diabetes). Diabetic retinopathy can lead to poor vision and even blindness. Most of the time, it gets worse over many years. At first, the blood vessels in the eye get weak. This can lead to blood and other liquid leaking into the retina from the blood vessels. This is called nonproliferative retinopathy. And this is the most common retinopathy. If the fluid leaks into the center of your eye, you may have blurry vision. Most people with nonproliferative retinopathy have no symptoms. If blood sugar levels stay high, diabetic retinopathy will keep getting worse. New blood vessels grow on the retina. This may sound good, but these new blood vessels are weak. They can break open very easily, even while you are sleeping. If they break open, blood can leak into the middle part of your eye in front of the retina and change your vision. This bleeding can also cause scar tissue to form, which can pull on the retina and cause the retina to move away from the wall of the eye (). This is called proliferative retinopathy. Sometimes people don't have symptoms until it is too late to treat them. This is why having eye exams regularly is so important. Retinopathy can also cause swelling of the macula of the eye. This is called . The macula is the middle of the retina, which lets you see details. When it swells, it can make your vision much worse. It can even cause . If you are not able to keep your blood sugar levels in a target range, it can cause damage to your blood vessels. Diabetic retinopathy happens when high blood sugar damages the tiny blood vessels of the retina. When you have diabetic retinopathy, high blood pressure can make it worse. High blood pressure can cause more damage to the weakened vessels in your eye, leading to more leaking of fluid or blood and clouding more of your vision. Most of the time, there are no symptoms of diabetic retinopathy until it starts to change your vision. When this happens, diabetic retinopathy is already severe. Having your eyes checked regularly can find diabetic retinopathy early enough to treat it and help prevent vision loss. If you notice problems with your vision, call an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) right away. Changes in vision can be a sign of severe damage to your eye. These changes can include floaters, pain in the eye, blurry vision, or new vision loss. An eye exam by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist or optometrist) is the only way to detect diabetic retinopathy. Having a dilated eye exam regularly can help find retinopathy before it changes your vision. On your own, you may not notice symptoms until the disease becomes severe. You can lower your chance of damaging small blood vessels in the eye by keeping your blood sugar levels and blood pressure levels within a target range. If you smoke, quit. All of this reduces the risk of damage to the retina. It can also help slow down how quickly your retinopathy gets worse and can prevent future vision loss. If you have a dilated eye exam regularly, you and your doctor can find diabetic retinopathy before it has a chance to get worse. For most people, this will mean an eye exam every year. Finding retinopathy early gives you a better chance of avoiding vision loss and blindness. Surgery, laser treatment, or medicine may help slow the vision loss caused by diabetic retinopathy. You may need to be treated more than once as the disease gets worse. Diabetes damages small blood vessels throughout the body, leading to reduced blood flow. When these changes affect the tiny blood vessels in the eyes, diabetic retinopathy may occur. In the early stage of diabetic retinopathy, tiny blood vessels in the eye weaken and develop small bulges that may burst and leak into the . Later, new fragile blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina. These blood vessels may break and bleed into the eye, clouding vision and causing scar tissue to form. The scar tissue may pull on the retina, leading to . Retinal detachment occurs when the retina separates from the wall of the eye. This can lead to vision loss. You may have diabetic retinopathy for a long time without noticing any symptoms. Typically, retinopathy does not cause noticeable symptoms until significant damage has occurred and complications have developed. Symptoms of diabetic retinopathy and its complications may include: Blurred, double, or distorted vision or difficulty reading. Partial or total loss of vision or a shadow or veil across your field of vision. Diabetic retinopathy begins as a mild disease. During the early stage of the disease, the small blood vessels in the become weaker and develop small bulges called microaneurysms. These microaneurysms are the earliest signs of retinopathy and may appear a few years after the onset of diabetes. They may also burst and cause tiny blood spots (hemorrhages) on the retina. But they do not usually cause symptoms or affect vision. This is called nonproliferative retinopathy. At this stage, treatment is not required. As retinopathy progresses, fluid and protein leak from the damaged blood vessels and cause the retina to swell. This may cause mild to severe vision loss, depending on which parts of the retina are affected. If the center of the retina () is affected, vision loss can be severe. Swelling and distortion of the macula (macular edema), which results from a buildup of fluid, is the most common complication of retinopathy. Macular edema treatment usually works to stop and sometimes reverse your loss of vision. In some people, retinopathy gets worse over the course of several years and progresses to proliferative retinopathy. In these cases, reduced blood flow to the retina stimulates the growth (proliferation) of fragile new blood vessels on the surface of the retina. As the new blood vessels multiply, one or more complications may develop and damage the person's vision. These complications can include: The formation of scar tissue that pulls on the retina, which may lead to . Bleeding inside the eye (preretinal or vitreous hemorrhage). The growth of new blood vessels on the surface of the iris (), which eventually leads to a form of severe glaucoma called . Any of these later complications may cause severe, permanent vision loss. Your risk for diabetic retinopathy depends largely on two things: how long you have had diabetes and whether or not you have kept good control of your blood sugar. You can control some risk factors, which are things that may increase your risk for diabetic retinopathy and its complications. Risk factors that you can control include: Women who have diabetes are at increased risk of developing retinopathy during pregnancy. In women who already have retinopathy when they become pregnant, the condition can become much worse during pregnancy. If you get pregnant, you will need to have an eye exam sometime during the first 3 months. You'll also need close follow-up during your pregnancy and for 1 year after you have your baby. High blood sugar levels increase your risk of retinopathy. Keeping your blood sugar levels in a target range can reduce your risk for diabetic retinopathy and can slow the progression of the disease if it has already started. In general, people with diabetes who also have high blood pressure are more likely to develop complications that affect the blood vessels in the body, including those in the eyes. Getting a dilated eye exam will not prevent retinopathy. But it may reduce your risk of severe vision loss from complications of retinopathy. By detecting it early, you can get treatment that can prevent vision loss and delay the progression of the disease. Although smoking has not been proved to increase the risk of retinopathy, smoking may make many of the other health problems faced by people with diabetes worse, including disease of the small blood vessels. If you have type 2 diabetes and use the medicine rosiglitazone (Avandia, Avandamet, Avandaryl) to treat your diabetes, you may have a higher risk for problems with the center of the retina (the macula). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the makers of the drug have warned that taking this medicine could cause swelling in the macula, which is called macular edema. if you have diabetes and notice: in your field of vision. Floaters often appear as dark specks, globs, strings, or dots. A sudden shower of floaters may be a sign of a , which is a serious complication of diabetic retinopathy. A new visual defect, shadow, or curtain across part of your vision. This is another sign of retinal detachment. New or sudden vision loss. The sudden onset of partial or complete vision loss is a symptom of many disorders that can occur within or outside the eye, including retinal detachment or bleeding within the eye. Sudden vision loss is always a medical emergency. Watchful waiting is not an option if you have diabetes and notice changes in your vision. If you have type 2 diabetes, even if you do not have any symptoms of eye disease, you still need to have your eyes and vision checked regularly by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist or optometrist). If you wait until you have symptoms, it is more likely that complications and severe damage to the retina will have already developed. These may be harder to treat and may result in permanent vision loss. If you have type 1 diabetes, are age 10 or older, and were diagnosed 5 or more years ago, you should have your eyes checked even if you don't have symptoms. If you wait until you have symptoms, it is more likely that complications and severe damage to the retina will have happened. These may be harder to treat. And the damage may be permanent. Watchful waiting is not an option if you already have diabetic retinopathy but do not have symptoms or vision loss. You will need to return to your ophthalmologist for frequent evaluations (every few months in some cases) so that your doctor can closely monitor changes in your eyes. There is no cure for the disease. But treatment can slow its progression. Your ophthalmologist can tell you how often you need to be evaluated. People who have diabetes need to see a doctor who specializes in eye care for their eye evaluations. If you have diabetic retinopathy and need laser treatment or surgery, you need to consult an ophthalmologist who specializes in treating the retina and has special training in the care of eye disease caused by diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy can be detected during a by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. An exam by your primary doctor, during which your eyes are not dilated, is not an adequate substitute for a full exam done by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Eye exams for people with diabetes can include: . Visual acuity testing measures the eye's ability to focus and to see details at near and far distances. It can help detect vision loss and other problems. . These tests allow your doctor to see the back of the eye and other structures within the eye. They may be used to detect clouding of the lens (cataract), changes in the retina, and other problems. . Gonioscopy is used to find out whether the area where fluid drains out of your eye (called the drainage angle) is open or closed. This test is done if your doctor thinks you may have glaucoma, a group of eye diseases that can cause blindness by damaging the optic nerve. . This test measures the pressure inside the eye, which is called intraocular pressure (IOP). It is used to help detect glaucoma. Diabetes can increase your risk of glaucoma. Your doctor may also do a test called an (OCT) to check for fluid in your retina. Sometimes a is done to check for and locate leaking blood vessels in the retina, especially if you have symptoms, such as blurred or distorted vision, that suggest damage to or swelling of the retina. Fundus photography can track changes in the eye over time in people who have diabetic retinopathy and especially in those who have been treated for it. Fundus photography produces accurate pictures of the back of the eye (the fundus). An eye doctor can compare photographs taken at different times to watch the progression of the disease and find out how well treatment is working. But the photos do not take the place of a full eye exam. Early detection and treatment of diabetic retinopathy can help prevent vision loss. For people in whom diabetic retinopathy has not been diagnosed, the American Diabetes Association recommends that screening be done based on the following guidelines: People with who are age 10 and older should have a dilated eye exam within 5 years after diabetes is diagnosed and then every year. People with should have an exam as soon as diabetes is diagnosed and then every year. If your eye exam results are normal, your doctor may consider follow-up exams less often. For example, you may have an exam every 2 years. But if you are diagnosed with retinopathy, you may need frequent eye exams. Women who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes and who are planning to become pregnant should have an exam before becoming pregnant, if possible, and then once during the first 3 months (first trimester) of pregnancy. The eye doctor can decide whether you need further screening for retinopathy during pregnancy based on the results of the first-trimester exam. : Pregnant women who develop are not at risk for diabetic retinopathy and do not need to be screened for it. (But women who develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life, which can put them at increased risk for retinopathy and other eye problems.) People who have diabetes are also at increased risk for other eye diseases, including glaucoma and cataracts. Regular dilated eye exams can help detect these diseases early and prevent or delay vision loss. There is no cure for diabetic retinopathy. But (photocoagulation) is usually very effective at preventing vision loss if it is done before the retina has been severely damaged. Surgical removal of the vitreous gel () may also help improve vision if the retina has not been severely damaged. Sometimes injections of an anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) medicine or an anti-inflammatory medicine help to shrink new blood vessels in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Because symptoms may not develop until the disease becomes severe, early detection through regular screening is important. The earlier retinopathy is detected, the easier it is to treat and the more likely vision will be preserved. You may need treatment for diabetic retinopathy if: It has affected the center (macula) of the retina. Abnormal new blood vessels have started to appear. Your side (peripheral) vision has been severely damaged. If the macula has been damaged by , anti-VEGF medicine, such as aflibercept (Eyelea) or ranibizumab (Lucentis), may help. Steroids may be injected into the eye. Sometimes an implant, such as Iluvien, may be placed in the eye to release a small amount of corticosteroid over time. If the retina hasn't been severely damaged, laser treatment or vitrectomy may help with macular edema. Surgical removal of the vitreous gel (vitrectomy) is done when there is bleeding (vitreous hemorrhage) or , which are rare in people with early-stage retinopathy. Vitrectomy is also done when severe scar tissue has formed. Treatment for diabetic retinopathy is often very effective in preventing, delaying, or reducing vision loss. But it is not a cure for the disease. People who have been treated for diabetic retinopathy need to be monitored frequently by an eye doctor to check for new changes in their eyes. Many people with diabetic retinopathy need to be treated more than once as the condition gets worse. Also, controlling your blood sugar levels is always important. This is true even if you have been treated for diabetic retinopathy and your eyes are better. In fact, good blood sugar control is especially important in this case so that you can help keep your retinopathy from getting worse. People with diabetes who have any signs of retinopathy need to be examined as soon as possible by an . There are steps you can take to reduce your chance of vision loss from diabetic retinopathy and its complications: Keep blood sugar levels in a target range by eating a healthful diet, frequently monitoring your blood sugar levels, getting regular physical exercise, and taking insulin or medicines for type 2 diabetes if prescribed. Retinopathy is more likely to progress to the severe form and is more likely to occur in people who have high blood pressure. It is not clear whether treating high blood pressure can directly affect long-term vision. But in general, keeping blood pressure levels in a target range can reduce the risk of many different complications of diabetes. For more information about how to control your blood pressure, see the topic . Have your eyes examined by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist or optometrist) every year. Screening for diabetic retinopathy and other eye problems will not prevent diabetic eye disease. But it can help you avoid vision loss by allowing for early detection and treatment. See an ophthalmologist if you have changes in your vision. Changes in vision—such as , pain or pressure in the eye, blurry or double vision, or new vision loss—may be symptoms of serious damage to your . In most cases, the sooner the problem can be treated, the more effective the treatment will be. The risk for severe retinopathy and vision loss may be even less if you: Although smoking has not been proved to increase the risk of retinopathy, smoking may aggravate many of the other health problems faced by people with diabetes, including disease of the small blood vessels. Certain physical activities, like weight lifting or some contact sports, may trigger bleeding in the eye through impact or increased pressure. Avoiding these activities when you have diabetic retinopathy can help reduce the risk of damage to your vision. Exercise helps keep blood sugar levels in a target range, which can reduce the risk of vision damage from diabetic retinopathy. Talk to your doctor about what kinds of exercise are safe for you. Surgical treatment for diabetic retinopathy is removal of the vitreous gel (). Vitrectomy does not cure the disease. But it may improve vision in people who have developed bleeding into the vitreous gel (vitreous hemorrhage), , or severe scar tissue formation. Unfortunately, by the time some people are diagnosed with retinopathy (especially late-stage retinopathy), it is often too late for vitrectomy to provide much benefit. Even with treatment, vision may continue to decline. Early detection of retinopathy through dilated eye exams can help you decide to have surgery when it is most effective. After a person has had most of the vitreous gel removed by vitrectomy, surgery to remove scar tissue or to repair a new retinal detachment may be needed. Vitrectomy is usually done as an outpatient surgery. Laser treatment (photocoagulation) can be an effective treatment for diabetic retinopathy. But it does not cure the disease. It can prevent, delay, and sometimes reverse vision loss. Without either laser treatment or surgery, vision loss caused by diabetic retinopathy and its complications may get worse until blindness occurs. So early treatment is vital to slowing vision loss, which can happen quickly. When diabetic retinopathy causes bleeding (hemorrhage) into the , extensive scar tissue formation, or , surgical removal of the vitreous gel (vitrectomy) may be needed before laser treatment is considered. Unfortunately, by the time some people are diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy, it is often too late for treatment to provide much benefit. Even with treatment, vision will continue to decline. Early detection of retinopathy through dilated eye exams can provide the opportunity to have laser treatment when it is most effective. uses the heat from a laser to seal or destroy abnormal, leaking blood vessels in the . It can cause the abnormal, weak blood vessels to shrink. Some anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) medicines, such as aflibercept and ranibizumab, can help treat from diabetic retinopathy. Pan-retinal laser treatment is used to treat several spots on the retina during one or, most often, two sessions. It reduces the risk of serious bleeding and the progression of severe proliferative retinopathy. Laser photocoagulation can result in some loss of vision, because it destroys some of the nerve cells in the retina and can cause the abnormal blood vessels to go away. With pan-retinal photocoagulation, this most often affects the outside (peripheral) vision, because the laser is directed at that area. Your vision may be worse right after treatment. But vision loss caused by laser treatment is mild compared with the vision loss that may be caused by untreated retinopathy. American Diabetes Association (2019).

Diabetes Remission Likelier With Earlier Bariatric Surgery New results from an observational study are the latest to show that bariatric surgery performed soon after diagnosis of in patients with is more likely to result in long-lasting remission. Seven-year data for over 800 patients at 10 US hospitals participating in the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2) study were published online in the . The report extends the group's previous findings by 4 years, so that at 7 years remission was still more likely among those who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) than laparoscopic (LAGB) even after adjustment for . This suggests that the mechanism for improved beta-cell function after RYGB extends beyond alone, say the authors, led by bariatric surgeon Jonathan Q. Purnell, MD, professor of medicine at Oregon Health & Science University, Portland. ""A prevalent notion ... is that surgery is something you should reserve until you have failed medical management. In that situation, you're stacking the odds against the patient in terms of their getting the full benefit,"" Purnell told in an interview. At least 10 previous randomized clinical trials have shown the superiority of over medical approaches for remission, Purnell said. ""What our data and other studies really reinforce is the fact that in the natural progression of the disease [there is] an ongoing decline in islet cell secretory capacity. If bariatric surgery is positioned earlier it gives you a greater benefit for preserving that secretory capacity. Don't wait till they've failed and [other medications]."" But typically in the United States, insurance companies mandate a trial of a medical weight loss program before covering bariatric surgery. ""That's hamstringing patients and clinicians into something that should be a judgment call at the time they're seen ... The idea that patients need to lose 5% to 10% of their weight prior to surgery is not rooted in science,"" Purnell asserted. Not Everyone With Obesity and Diabetes Needs Early Surgery Asked to comment, endocrinologist Jeffrey I. Mechanick, MD, professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York City, told that the study's conclusion about having surgery sooner ""isn't wrong but we need to make sure it's not generalized to the broader statement that all patients with and obesity should be considered for bariatric surgery early."" ""There are all different kinds of people with all different kinds of risk categories and ethnicities and pathophysiologies. The fact is the majority of people do respond in some fashion to lifestyle and to drugs."" Mechanick pointed to 2017 guidance issued by several professional medical and surgical societies that metabolic surgery ""should be recommended"" to treat type 2 in certain patient groups, including those with BMI 40 kg/m2 and above, or with BMI 35-39.9 kg/m2 ""when is inadequately controlled by lifestyle and optimal medical therapy,"" as well as down to BMI 30.0-34.9 kg/m2, ""if hyperglycemia is inadequately controlled despite optimal treatment with either oral or injectable medications."" According to Mechanick, who was a coauthor on that guidance, ""We said that bariatric surgery has a very defined evidence-based place in the comprehensive management of obesity and diabetes in the more severe cases ... In the real world I'm not going to recommend bariatric surgery for someone who is low risk."" However, he added, ""We do need better evidence-based guidance on when you start the conversation about bariatric surgery specifically."" Diabetes Remission at 7 Years More Likely With RYGB In their article, Purnell and colleagues note that LABS-2 was an observational, nonrandomized study of 2256 adults who underwent RYGB or LAGB between 2006 and 2009, of whom 37% (827) had type 2 diabetes. Following surgery, 68% of those with diabetes achieved partial or complete remission, defined as A1c levels of 5.7%-6.5% (39-48 mmol/M) and < 5.7% (39 mmol/M), respectively, without use of glucose-lowering medications at one or more timepoints after surgery. The decision to continue or stop medications was made by the individual patient and clinician. Among those with diabetes, 78% opted for RYGB and 22% for LAGB. Despite the nonrandomization, most relevant baseline characteristics between the two groups were similar. At baseline, those who achieved complete or partial diabetes remission were on average younger at the time of surgery (48 vs 52 years; P = .0002), had a lower percent body fat (P = .0012), had shorter diabetes duration (6 vs 13.5 years; P < .0001), had a lower A1c (7.7% vs 6.8%; P < .0001), and were less likely to be taking insulin (66% vs 24%; P < .0001). They had similar levels of but higher levels of C-peptide, proinsulin, and beta-cell secretory function. The proportions in complete or partial diabetes remission peaked 2 to 3 years after both procedures -- 62% with RYGB and 29% with LAGB -- and then declined through the rest of the 7-year follow-up to 57% and 22.5%, respectively, by year 7. After adjustment for baseline differences, individuals in both surgery groups were more likely to achieve diabetes remission during follow-up if they had lower baseline insulin levels, higher C-peptide levels, and higher beta-cell function. And with adjustment for greater weight loss in the RYGB group (which the authors had previously reported), the probability of diabetes remission was also greater for RYGB than LAGB at all timepoints, increasing from an adjusted relative risk of 1.86 in the first year after surgery to 3.96 after 7 years. Sleeve Gastrectomy Now Most Common Bariatric Procedure In the years since the study began, LAGB has fallen out of favor and sleeve gastrectomy has become the most common bariatric procedure, with RYGB now used in about a third of patients. Although sleeve gastrectomy and RYGB performed similarly in the STAMPEDE study, ""those patients had already failed medical management. They had higher A1cs, longer diabetes duration, and were more likely on insulin, [and in] an advanced state of diabetes less likely to see improvement,"" Purnell said. ""Most people now get the sleeve. I think it would be comparable to what we saw with gastric bypass, although the data aren't quite as good,"" he added. Mechanick said, ""More studies are going to need to be done with bariatric surgery and also nonsurgical bariatric procedures, and also, in my view, not just alone but in combination with pharmacotherapy and lifestyle."" The study was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Purnell has reported consulting for Novo Nordisk. Mechanick has reported receiving honoraria for lectures and program development from Abbott . SOURCE: Medscape, December 16, 2020. J Clin Endocrinol Metab.

Sleep Apnea Plus Type 2 Diabetes Increases Retinopathy Risk Sleep Apnea Plus Type 2 Diabetes Increases Retinopathy Risk People who have both and are at increased risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, according to new research from the University of Birmingham. Approximately 29 million people in the United States are living with Type 2 diabetes, and roughly 22 million . OSA is a condition in which breathing stops for 10 seconds or more during sleep, sometimes hundreds of times a night. Diabetic retinopathy occurs when diabetes damages tiny blood vessels in the eye’s retina (the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye) and is the in working-age adults. Previous research has between OSA and . To evaluate the impact of OSA on the development and progression of the eye condition, researchers worked with 230 people with Type 2 diabetes attending two diabetes clinics. People who were already known to have OSA or another respiratory condition were excluded from the study. Participants were evaluated for OSA using a home-based portable device and for diabetic retinopathy using retinal imaging. The researchers found that the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was higher in people with OSA, occurring in 42.9% of those with sleep apnea, compared to 24.1% of those without. Additionally, at a follow-up appointment 43 months (roughly 3.5 years) later, 18.4% of those with OSA were found to have developed moderate to severe diabetic retinopathy, compared to 6.1% of those without OSA. The researchers also discovered that people who were treated for OSA using a CPAP machine, which keeps the airways open during sleep by delivering pressurized air through a face mask, had a lower risk of developing advanced retinopathy compared to those who were not receiving sleep apnea treatment. “We can conclude from this study that OSA is an independent predictor for the progression to moderate or severe diabetic retinopathy in patients with Type 2 diabetes,” stated corresponding study author Abd Tahrani, MD, MRCP (UK), MMedSci, CCT (Endocrinology), PhD. “Following our research, it is important that clinicians treating patients with Type 2 diabetes are aware that their patients who also have OSA are particularly at increased risk of developing advance retinopathy and, hence, appropriate preventative measures should be put in place…. Clinicians should consider testing patients for OSA, as OSA is very common in [people] with Type 2 diabetes.” Most people with OSA are unaware they have the condition, the researchers note, and could go without a diagnosis — and therefore treatment — for years. Further studies are needed to evaluate how treating OSA could , they add.

Type 2 Diabetes mellitus - Do we need a paradigm change in management? Glucose and fructose, are benign molecules which are essential for the functioning and growth of almost every cell in the body. Glucose has got a very wide range of normal values in the tissues of the human body. This is probably because we need different sugar levels at different times in our lives (1). We need more sugar when we are active and less when we are inactive. The incidence of Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing the world over (2). A global rise has been noted in the incidence of Type 2 DM from 415 million in 2015, to 642 million by 2040 and the appalling fact is that 5-20% of total healthcare expense is towards DM (3). There can be no two ways about it- high sugar is detrimental to all tissues in the body. But ""how high is high sugar"" ? This is difficult to define. We kept redefining, and have narrowed our definition to bring this ''high sugar status'' at much lower levels (4). In the bargain, many men and women, who would otherwise have led normal lives, are being categorized into Type 2 DM and are being treated with antidiabetic drugs with their known side effects (5–7). It needs to be reinforced that, following the track from Type 1 Diabetes mellitus ( which is purely due to insulin deficiency) , we invented Type 2 Diabetes mellitus, which is actually secondary to weight gain due to improper diet and, or inadequate exercises, and we started treating the sugar with no discernible benefits for the patients (8). Hyperglycemia is a pathophysiological response to improper diet and, or inadequate exercises and it definitely leads to lot of undesirable complications (9-11). Nowhere in science and medicine are we taught to relieve signs and symptoms without addressing the cause. For example, treating fever in a patient with sepsis, or headache in a patient with brain tumour! We always find the cause and try to treat the cause. Somehow gradually over the years, diabetes has become an exception to this rule. When a person is started on medications following which a blood sample reveals the right numbers, both the physicians and the patients are contented, unmindful of the potential side effects of the drugs given. We tend to ignore the fact that these medications are not given to treat the cause, but to get the sugars under control. Yes, there is a difference! Primary care of elevated blood sugar is not focused on correcting the improper diet or improving the activities. Despite several decades of research and more than 53 drugs for the management of elevated blood sugar in Type 2 DM, we are nowhere near, in either curing the condition or preventing the consequences (12). If lifestyle is the cause of the problem, instead of paying attention to it, are we distracted today, with the sole objective of lowering blood sugar with drugs? (13). Giving a surrogate treatment for reducing the blood sugar alone would take us nowhere . On the other hand, it may only lead us to more problems. Way back in 400 BC, Charak and Sushrut, physicians from ancient India described Diabetes as Madhumeha (honey urine) with two types, and that one type is due to excessive food and sugar intake. So let us get back to the drawing board and re-emphasize that men and women need to be active at all ages and correct overweight and Obesity (14). Insulin resistance has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Type 2 DM (15). However it is not quite clear if insulin resistance is the cause or consequence of hyperglycemia and obesity. All persons with Type 2 DM do not have raised fasting insulin levels (16). Drugs used to treat Type 2 DM are supposed to be insulin sensitizers or insulin secretagogues. There is no drug without an adverse effect Insulin secretagogues, over a period of time, exhaust the Islet cells and all these patients eventually land in a state with a need for insulin therapy (5,6). On the other hand, patients who are on drugs like insulin sensitizers and actively exercising at the same time, can have their blood sugar controlled , not clearly indicating if it is the effect of the drug or the modified lifestyle (17). Drugs like Metformin have also been shown to decrease exercise capacity, which is of definite concern (17). Insulin and all other drugs tend to treat only the high sugar levels which is only a sign of the underlying pathology. In other medical conditions like high serum bilirubin levels or raised blood urea, we try to treat the underlying problem. Whereas in Type 2 DM, the underlying pathology is not addressed completely. On the other hand, we tend to use drugs. Patients get a false sense of reassurance and do not change their lifestyle and continue to indulge in inappropriate diet and inadequate activities. The progression of angiopathy or metabolic dysfunction is continuous in patients with Type 2 Diabetes mellitus. There is evidence that tight glycemic control does not help in preventing microvascular or macrovascular complications (18). This clearly indicates the underlying pathology of inappropriate diet and inadequate exercises, unless corrected, is not going to rectify the problem of Type 2 DM. In an era where researchers are voicing their opinion on 'Beating type 2 diabetes into remission' and 'Reversing type 2 diabetes',(19) our emphasis and the most appropriate management of Type 2 Diabetes mellitus should be on dietary modification and adequate physical activity. Drugs should only be used to prevent hyperglycemia related emergencies, which are very rare (20) On the other hand, drugs which are used to manage Type 2 DM can induce hypoglycemia which may even prove fatal (7). Thiruvalluvar, a Tamil poet and philosopher said many centuries ago, நோய்நாடி நோய்முதல் நாடி அதுதணிக்கும் வாய்நாடி வாய்ப்பச் செயல் which implies that every physician has to first diagnose the illness, trace its cause and then seek the proper remedy and apply it with skill.

Time has not made them any less valid. Firstly there is discordance between fasting and/or 2hr postprandial glucose and HbA1c. Data from NHANES suggested that 1% of the cohort would have diabetes diagnosed by both fasting plasma glucose and 2-hour plasma glucose, but not by HbA1c (1). For this group of individuals, how should remission be determined? Secondly, the contribution of postprandial glucose to HbA1c is greater for lower HbA1c values (2). The 2-hour OGTT glucose levels would better reflect an impairment of beta-cell function - the key pathophysiological defect of diabetes – for these individuals. Perhaps it would be better to restrict the term ‘remission’ for cases where beta-cell function can be more directly measured? Thirdly and perhaps the most important, all definitions for the presence of DM have, by definition, been glucose-centric. In recent years, there has been a reappraisal of the goals for therapy for an individual with type 2 diabetes. It is recognised that a comprehensive approach to risk assessment, and management of metabolic risk factors can offset the risk of cardiovascular disease (3, 4). Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality for individuals with diabetes. The continuum of vascular risk extends below the threshold for diabetes: for example, an individual with HbA1c 6.0 to <6.5% has a risk of coronary artery disease that is 78% higher than for those whose Hb1c is 5.0 to <5.5% (5). The evolution of pre-existing microvascular and macrovascular disease is not necessarily halted by glucose normalisation. In ADVANCE, near-normalization of glucose reduced new or worsening nephropathy, but not eye or foot complications. In ACCORD, near-normalization of glucose did not reduce composite measures of advanced microvascular complications (6). Equating diabetes resolution solely with glucose normalisation may serve to undermine a holistic approach to patient management. 1.

The subject of nutrition with regard to body requirement for the quality and quantity of food is unknown in the education in schools or university. We need in UK and all over the world a new educated generation to adjust the food and drink intake. Even within the health professionals doctors and nurses obesity is alarming.

M E Tageldin No competing interests Retired orthopaedic surgeon , BMA member Diabetes is a metabolic dysfunctional state where there is a defect in insulin production/synthesis/release or in its action, receptor number, post-receptor defect or what we call insulin resistance. It is not a battle of wits but it is a state of health that challenges your mental resolve and balance - say, keeping your blood glucose levels with minimal fluctuations, controlling your diet and developing a mental state of considering diabetes a normal state of your body. What I mean is instead of taking it as a pathophysiological manifestation it needs to be taken as a life style adjustment of an individual to the blood glucose level or HbA1c changing one's perspective to suit the needs and demands of the state of health. There is no question of a remission or precipitation of adverse outcomes of diabetes if one considers the metabolic state of diabetic patient as one that has to be dealt with as one deals with the normal routine of life. No competing interests Independent consultant and Faculty of Medicine Re: Beating type 2 diabetes into remission: a consensus-based working definition As Louise McCombie and colleagues state in their paper, there is little doubt that, from a pathophysiological perspective, remission of type 2 diabetes is probably achievable for many patients. Apparently, this is not supported by current medical records, which suggest that remission is almost non-existent. Many colleagues will argue that this is reality in practice, since sustainable remission, sometimes referred to as reversal, is hampered by a diversity of motivational and environmental factors. However, McCombie et al. raise another important point, highlighting the lack of consensus regarding criteria to define type 2 diabetes remission. Availability of such consensus will not only facilitate the socio-economic debate on lifestyle as therapeutic option, but may also be of practical value in monitoring and stimulating individual efforts to change unhealthy behavior. Hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension are caused by systemic low-grade inflammation, ectopic fat deposition and (compensatory) hyperinsulinemia, brought about by a variety of lifestyle features. Clearly, lifestyle intervention doesn’t bring permanent remission overnight, and complete remission may not be accomplishable in all patients. In line with existing consensus viewpoints, the authors make a case to use HBA1c and glucose values to define criteria for remission. However, as active implementers of a therapeutic lifestyle program for type 2 diabetic patients, which is currently attracting considerable attention in the Netherlands (), we would like to suggest the possibility of including reduction of medication dose as an additional criterion for remission. The group program spans 24 months and involves individualized intensive nutrition, behavioral and lifestyle coaching, education, cookery classes and physician-guided medication management. One major Dutch health insurance company is currently sponsoring a pilot involving 1.900 patients, while discussions with other organizations and authorities on further implementation are actively ongoing. Faced with stakeholders working with short term economic horizons, we were challenged to include reduction of medication dose in a working definition of remission. Inspired by Buse and colleagues (2009), a consensus group comprising experts in internal medicine, diabetes, endocrinology, pharmacology, medical physiology and bio-statistics arrived at the following definition of remission of type 2 diabetes: (Partial) remission of type 2 diabetes is achieved if one of the following three criteria is met: 1. Patients using insulin and/or GLP-1 analogues at the onset of the program were allowed to terminate their use of this medication 2. Patients who used oral medication (except Metformin) at the onset of the program were allowed to terminate oral medication (except Metformin). 3. Patients who used Metformin at the onset of the program don’t have to use diabetes medication any longer. 1. Patients who had a HBA1c lower than 58 at the onset of the program have reached a HBA1c of 53 or lower. 2. Patients who had a HBA1c higher than 58 at the onset of the program show decrease of at least 10 percent of their HBA1c -value. This working definition is currently used to evaluate the outcome of our program. Realizing that there always remains room for further discussion, the undersigned are very interested in learning the opinions of colleagues and organizations involved in similar activities.

Renger Witkamp, Hanno Pijl, Marianne de Visser, Peter Voshol, Tamara de Weijer My General Practice sees me annually for a health check-up. It was noticed that my fasting 'blood sugar' was rising and five years ago I had a glucose tolerance test that showed I was diabetic. I was offered drugs but decide to lose weight and manage my diet. As a result I have lost 13kg and stayed between 71-72kg. My body/mass index is 24.3kg/m2, less than 25. My HbA1c has remained at 42-44mmol/mol over the past five years. I have no complications of diabetes. My BP has only once been as high as 130/70, usually it is <120/< 80. Curiously I have raised cholesterol and have had CABG with 4 vessel grafts in 1993, pacemaker for heart block in 2004 and TAVI in 2014. I am 88 years of age and walk two miles a day. My personal experience is that the amount of food I need is so much less than would conventionally be considered modest. This is associated with hunger that while it gets less rarely does not cause a daily urge to eat more than my diet allows. It is often forgotten that when you reach your target weight you can only eat a little more each day and on no account can you expect to go back to your previous intake. I find that hunger is the driving force to 'relapse'. It is a very powerful drive and if denied is not only uncomfortable but provokes great anxiety. As I specialised in addiction I came to recognise that my problems with food are closely allied to if not identical with an addiction. In the past I relapsed into over-eating in a manner identical to relapse with alcohol or other 'drug' use. When I applied to myself that which my patients had taught me I managed to control my intake of food. The challenge is to be a controlled eater, which may be as challenging as being a controlled drinker or other drug user. For example, many of those on methadone to manage their dependence on heroin are long-term controlled drug users in much the same way as we dieters have to be long-term controlled food users.

All the information below applies to the whole of the UK, unless specified. We've noted where are some differences in guidance and diabetes services across the UK. Shielding – advice for clinically extremely vulnerable people Shielding is a way of protecting 'clinically extremely vulnerable' people who are at a very high risk of severe illness and needing to go to hospital if they catch coronavirus. It means staying at home almost all of the time, with no face-to-face contact.   Diabetes is not in the clinically extremely vulnerable group (shielding group) – it is in the 'clinically vulnerable group' – so having diabetes doesn’t automatically mean you need to shield.

How coronavirus can affect people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups The risk of death from coronavirus for some ethnic groups is higher than for people of white ethnicity.

Research in Scotland hasn’t shown this increased risk, but the BAME population there is very small. And we don’t have data on this in Northern Ireland at the moment. We don’t know why this is happening. The data takes into account factors which we know can increase risk, such as age, socioeconomic status and health, including obesity. And we do know that some of developing conditions like type 2 diabetes and heart problems, which are linked to increased risk of death from coronavirus.  It’s clear that we need further research to understand what’s causing this – whether the causes are physical, cultural or social. We are on risks to people from ethnic minority backgrounds. Data from NHS England in May showed us that, for those who become so unwell with coronavirus that they need to go to hospital, the risk of dying is higher for people living with diabetes than people without the condition. But the risks aren't the same for everyone with diabetes. Most deaths have been in the elderly with very few under the age of 50 and none in children. This study only looked at the number of people who have died in hospital as a result of coronavirus. It doesn’t include information on the many thousands who have recovered at home or who have been successfully discharged from hospital. We are and NHS to ensure this data is used to update guidance and policies to keep people who are at greatest risk protected and supported. Research has shown us that people with diabetes who have the highest risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from coronavirus are those over the age of 50, who have a high HbA1c (above 75mmol/mol or 9%) and have received treatment for diabetes complications.   Here our Head of Research Communications, Dr Lucy Chambers, explains more about the risk factors, including type of diabetes, age and ethnicity, and why for most people your risk of dying remains very low. Although this research is England based, we believe this level of risk will be true in all nations. And to find out more detail on these statistics, go to our  news story.

You may be in a situation where you need medical attention – this may be something related to your diabetes, or it may be something unrelated like an injury or illness. This means you might have to go to the Accident and Emergency (A&E) department of your local hospital and you might have to wait a while before being seen. During this time, your care in hospital may be a little different to normal, for example you may not see the diabetes team or not have family with you when you go into hospital.

The government has been working with industry and partners to monitor the impact of coronavirus on the UK supply chain of medicines and technology and put in place measures to protect UK patients. This includes banning companies from buying medicines like insulin that are meant for UK patients and selling on for a higher price in another country.

Given the extra demand supermarkets face in the Christmas period, priority deliveries are not currently guaranteed, so you may find it easier to order your shopping delivery as you would normally.  If you have not been told to shield, or you live in an area that isn’t in Tier 3 or Tier 4 restrictions, you should contact your local council. They may be able to offer support to help you get the food you need.

Some organisations like  pharmacy have an online service and are encouraging customers to choose for their medicines to be delivered to their homes – you don't have to sign for these now, the delivery driver will leave the package somewhere safe and let you know. Plan ahead where possible. Our advice is to try and order your next prescription at least 14 days before it is due.  Put your contact details on prescriptions so pharmacies can let you know when your medicines are ready, so you won’t need to be in the pharmacy for as long. Please don’t ring the pharmacy unless it’s urgent. If you're self-isolating, see if family, friends or neighbours can pick up your medication for you. If you don’t have anyone who can collect your medicine, speak to your community pharmacy for advice about how they can help. There might be community or voluntary groups ready to help in your area. If you're well and can visit the pharmacy yourself, think about how you can help family, friends and neighbours who are self-isolating by collecting their medicines on their behalf (you may need to take ID with you and will need to know the name and address of the person you are collecting for). Don't ask for extra medicine. Continue to get medicines as normal and don't stockpile. Ask your prescriber about electronic repeat dispensing, so you can order your repeat prescriptions online. We know some people may not have friends and family able to help while they are isolated at home.

It means staying at home almost all of the time, with no face-to-face contact.   Diabetes is not in the clinically extremely vulnerable group (shielding group) – it is in the 'clinically vulnerable group' – so having diabetes doesn’t automatically mean you need to shield. Although there may be some people with diabetes who need to shield based on other conditions or other risk factors, for example those with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.

Your body tries to fight the illness by releasing stored glucose (sugar) into your blood stream to give you energy.

This means you’re more at risk of having serious blood sugar highs and lows, potentially leading to  or HHS (hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state).

Wearing a mask can take some getting used to, and can feel very strange at first. Some of you have told us that wearing a mask makes you feel anxious or you find it hard to breathe. There are lots of different masks out there so try to find one that suits you best. You also could try wearing it around the house for a bit, to get used to breathing in it and moving about while it’s on. If you spot someone not wearing a mask when they’re out and about, try not to make a judgement – there could be lots of invisible reasons for this and it’s not something that’s in your control.

We are on risks to people from ethnic minority backgrounds. Data from NHS England in May showed us that, for those who become so unwell with coronavirus that they need to go to hospital, the risk of dying is higher for people living with diabetes than people without the condition.

d8c4c31b-218c-4ba5-8a10-8c31b1023c34,"— Answer: A crazy-colored hand covering that not only keeps cold fingers warm, but also helps raise money for type 1 diabetes and promote public awareness around this chronic condition. Yep, a Minnesota family is using their crafty knitting skills to make mittens for T1D –- which is oh-so-fitting, given that this chronic condition is so synonymous with finger-poking for glucose checks! The Mickschl Family in the St. Paul, MN, area, whose preteen daughter Gracie has T1D, a year ago in October, just before Diabetes Awareness Month 2018. “Our goal is about making tomorrow better. Not just for Gracie, but for everyone around the globe diagnosed with type 1 diabetes,” says D-Dad Doug Mickschl. “Nothing can create a fire in someone like when your child is diagnosed with what is now an incurable disease. We got creative.” As the Fall season brings that annual transition to sweater weather, we’re excited to feature the Mickschl’s , and offer an exclusive giveaway for our readers at the ‘. Be sure to read through to enter to win a pair for yourself (or a loved one, since gift-giving Holiday Season isn’t far off). It all started in March 2016, when Doug and Leah Mickschl’s daughter Gracie was diagnosed with T1D at 10 years old. The family had been on Spring Break vacation, despite the fact that Gracie had been losing weight in the weeks prior. At first, they thought it might be just “a bug” or dehydration. But as time went on during their Florida vacation and Gracie continued losing weight, Leah began worrying something more might be wrong — especially given her professional background as a pediatric nurse (who specialized in child abuse). She had left that role some time ago to start her own online retail boutique selling scarfs and jewelry, but her health know-how began to re-surface as she witnessed her daughter’s symptoms materializing — excessive thirst and hunger, bathroom use, and so on. “Pounds were just falling off of her before our eyes,” Leah recalls. “I was kind of thinking, ‘No, please, don’t let it be…’ We got home from break on Easter Sunday and she had a stomachache, and I could smell that fruity breath when she was sitting on my lap. I remember saying that night that she has type 1 diabetes. But even as an educated nurse, I didn’t really know how bad this was… our new normal.” That was a few months before Gracie’s 11th birthday. Leah says her dad’s cousin was the only family connection with T1D, but that’s a removed relationship so it wasn’t something that initially came to mind. Doug — an advertising professional who had no healthcare background or the least familiarity with diabetes — was pretty much dumbstruck, he says. ” I remember Leah trying to explain it to me, and I just had no clue what we were in for. I was sort of apathetic about the whole deal at first, and had total cluelessness. That, to me personally, is why it’s so important to get awareness out there.” Gracie is now 14 and handling her T1D as best a teenager can, but as anyone who’s been there knows, it isn’t easy. Her dad says, “I almost feel claustrophobic for her sometimes… it’s like this ball-and-chain, for the rest of her life. She’s such a strong young lady and it doesn’t seem to phase her; it phases us more at times. She’s such a champ and is such an inspiration for all of us.” Like many families before them, the Mickschl’s journey from an initial sense of helplessness to conquering “routine” daily management led them to want to pursue something that would make a broader difference in the T1D community. Back in 2014, while recovering from a bilateral mastectomy for breast cancer, Leah had started her selling scarfs, beanies and other items. That was two years before Gracie’s T1D diagnosis. Once diabetes entered their world, her crafty retail boutique experience combined with Doug’s professional advertising and marketing skills came together. They decided to create a product line that could be used to start a conversation about T1D in the world, while also raising money for different charities benefiting the diabetes community. The mitten idea came from an observation in those early years that Gracie’s fingertips were often calloused and raw due to blood sugar fingersticks. Doug says that led to them wanting to give her fingers “a little love,” and the mittens were a pretty simple product choice from there. They decided on crazy colors because T1D is “a crazy disease, it’s unpredictable and sometimes you just can’t put a finger on it… no pun intended.” “We want them to stand out,” he says. “We want people to say, ‘Where did you get those crazy-colored mittens?’ and start a conversation about type 1.” They launched Cure Mittens in October 2018 just before the kickoff of National Diabetes Awareness Month kicked in November, as the first (and so far) philanthropic line from their boutique Pretty Simple. All of the mittens come packaged in a reusable circular canister, with the word “Cure” written in cursive on the side and a coin slot on top. Doug and Leah say the coin-bank canister idea came from their desire to create “a culture of giving,” so that people who ordered the mittens would be motivated to continue giving to worthy causes – diabetes-related or not. “So many people need help out there, and we thought this would be a nice gesture, a helping hand if you will, along with being a good way to package the mittens,” Doug says. “And to be honest, (the canisters) are a pretty cool and practical design, so let’s make it useful!” The mittens are hand-made from high-quality yarn, and they work with two China-based manufacturers — one to hand-knit the mittens and one to produce the canisters. At launch, they started with five designs / color combos and now they have six. They’re exploring other designs that hope will eventually include sports team colors — such as the Green Bay Packers or Minnesota Twins. They have toddler, youth, and teen/adult sizes that all retail for $30 per pair. To date, they’ve raised more than $10,000 that has gone to various charities: the focused on cure research and improving D-lives; that focuses on insulin affordability and access; and Minnesota-based that supports diabetes alert dog training. (Gracie loves dogs and while she doesn’t currently have a D-Alert Dog, the parents say they’re considering it). The family hopes to double that amount raised in this next year. Overall, the couple says they want to make a difference and raise awareness in the T1D community — all while offering a bit of fun and practical hand-wear that does good in the world. Doug adds, “I’m a pretty competitive guy, and from a Dad’s POV, I want to kick this disease’s a**. I haven’t let my anger and frustration out on this disease like I’d want to. Like Leah says, this helps us put our passion to use in a good way, out of desperation for change and a cure, and a better life.” We LOVE these Cure Mittens, and are eager to get a pair for ourselves and grab some as gifts as the Holiday Season approaches. With that, here’s your chance to get your own hands on a pair for yourself (pun totally intended there!) Interested in winning a pair of these Cure Mittens for yourself?

All the information below applies to the whole of the UK, unless specified. We've noted where are some differences in guidance and diabetes services across the UK. Shielding – advice for clinically extremely vulnerable people Shielding is a way of protecting 'clinically extremely vulnerable' people who are at a very high risk of severe illness and needing to go to hospital if they catch coronavirus. It means staying at home almost all of the time, with no face-to-face contact.   Diabetes is not in the clinically extremely vulnerable group (shielding group) – it is in the 'clinically vulnerable group' – so having diabetes doesn’t automatically mean you need to shield. Although there may be some people with diabetes who need to shield based on other conditions or other risk factors, for example those with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. This means that for most people with diabetes, any lockdown rules where you live are the same for you as they are for people who don’t have diabetes. We are calling on the government to urgently add some people with diabetes to the shielding list. While we wait for the government to respond to our call, if you think you are in this high risk group and that you should be on the shielding list, you can call our helpline for more advice.

Your body tries to fight the illness by releasing stored glucose (sugar) into your blood stream to give you energy. But your body can’t produce enough or any insulin to cope with this, so your blood sugars rise. Your body is working overtime to fight the illness, making it harder to manage your diabetes. This means you’re more at risk of having serious blood sugar highs and lows, potentially leading to  or HHS (hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state). How to reduce your risk of getting seriously ill from coronavirus The UK government is reviewing lockdown restrictions for the UK on a regular basis, and there are different rules for different areas. You can find out more about the rules in , ,  and , but everybody should continue to:  stay 2 meters away from people outside your household. The most important way people living with diabetes can lower their risk of becoming seriously ill from coronavirus is to avoid catching the virus in the first place. A vaccine is the most effective way to prevent infection, and that’s why we strongly encourage you to get the vaccine when you’re offered it. We’ve got more information about the , including the latest results from the trials and guidance about when people with diabetes can expect to get vaccinated. Some of you have been asking us whether people with diabetes need to wear face masks and coverings. Some research shows that they can slow the spread of the virus, by protecting others from catching something you may be carrying. This is true for everyone, including people with diabetes.  Get one of our adjustable face coverings from our . There are certain reasons why some people don’t need to wear a face covering – called exemptions. These include children (depending on their age), if you have asthma, and lots more. But these exemptions are different depending on where you live, so check your national government websites for the most up-to-date list – we've added some useful links below. If these exemptions apply to you, then you don’t need to wear one. But if nothing on the list applies to you, then there’s no reason why you shouldn’t wear a face covering.  We know it’s not that simple. Wearing a mask can take some getting used to, and can feel very strange at first. Some of you have told us that wearing a mask makes you feel anxious or you find it hard to breathe. There are lots of different masks out there so try to find one that suits you best. You also could try wearing it around the house for a bit, to get used to breathing in it and moving about while it’s on. If you spot someone not wearing a mask when they’re out and about, try not to make a judgement – there could be lots of invisible reasons for this and it’s not something that’s in your control. Some people may prefer to have something to hand that says they don't need to wear a face covering. You can print these from the or make the message your phone screensaver.

However, as with all people with diabetes, an illness like coronavirus can make it harder to manage your child’s diabetes and they still have a risk of DKA. So it's important that you make sure your child follows social distancing and handwashing recommendations to reduce their risk of catching it.  How coronavirus can affect pregnant women with diabetes The same rules apply to you as for everyone with diabetes.

How coronavirus can affect people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups The risk of death from coronavirus for some ethnic groups is higher than for people of white ethnicity. But it is important to remember that there are lots of factors involved, like age, and overall risk of dying from coronavirus is very low.  In England and Wales, data from the shows how people from certain Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups are more at risk than people of white ethnicity. Research in Scotland hasn’t shown this increased risk, but the BAME population there is very small. And we don’t have data on this in Northern Ireland at the moment. We don’t know why this is happening. The data takes into account factors which we know can increase risk, such as age, socioeconomic status and health, including obesity. And we do know that some of developing conditions like type 2 diabetes and heart problems, which are linked to increased risk of death from coronavirus.  It’s clear that we need further research to understand what’s causing this – whether the causes are physical, cultural or social. We are on risks to people from ethnic minority backgrounds. Data from NHS England in May showed us that, for those who become so unwell with coronavirus that they need to go to hospital, the risk of dying is higher for people living with diabetes than people without the condition. But the risks aren't the same for everyone with diabetes. Most deaths have been in the elderly with very few under the age of 50 and none in children. This study only looked at the number of people who have died in hospital as a result of coronavirus. It doesn’t include information on the many thousands who have recovered at home or who have been successfully discharged from hospital. We are and NHS to ensure this data is used to update guidance and policies to keep people who are at greatest risk protected and supported. Research has shown us that people with diabetes who have the highest risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from coronavirus are those over the age of 50, who have a high HbA1c (above 75mmol/mol or 9%) and have received treatment for diabetes complications.   Here our Head of Research Communications, Dr Lucy Chambers, explains more about the risk factors, including type of diabetes, age and ethnicity, and why for most people your risk of dying remains very low. Although this research is England based, we believe this level of risk will be true in all nations. And to find out more detail on these statistics, go to our  news story. We’re looking at the specific ways coronavirus affects people living with diabetes. We know there’s a lot more to learn about this new type of virus, and we know we need answers fast. The government advice is that people should work from home if possible.

The rules about on social distancing and hand washing apply to children with diabetes too. Schools should be practicing social distancing for your child when schools reopen.

If you have coronavirus symptoms, do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital even if you have an appointment. If you're already having treatment for something like a foot or eye problem, and you don't have coronavirus symptoms, then your appointments should still carry on.

If you can't get through, call 111 for advice. If you have any change in your vision you should contact your local screening service or optometrist. You may be in a situation where you need medical attention – this may be something related to your diabetes, or it may be something unrelated like an injury or illness. This means you might have to go to the Accident and Emergency (A&E) department of your local hospital and you might have to wait a while before being seen. During this time, your care in hospital may be a little different to normal, for example you may not see the diabetes team or not have family with you when you go into hospital. For any problem, regardless of the current situation, you should go to hospital as you would've done before – the NHS is still open. Read our guide to .

The government has been working with industry and partners to monitor the impact of coronavirus on the UK supply chain of medicines and technology and put in place measures to protect UK patients. This includes banning companies from buying medicines like insulin that are meant for UK patients and selling on for a higher price in another country.

If you live in an area which is in Tier 3 or Tier 4 restrictions, and you are shielding, you can to get priority deliveries. Given the extra demand supermarkets face in the Christmas period, priority deliveries are not currently guaranteed, so you may find it easier to order your shopping delivery as you would normally.  If you have not been told to shield, or you live in an area that isn’t in Tier 3 or Tier 4 restrictions, you should contact your local council. They may be able to offer support to help you get the food you need.

Some organisations like  pharmacy have an online service and are encouraging customers to choose for their medicines to be delivered to their homes – you don't have to sign for these now, the delivery driver will leave the package somewhere safe and let you know. Plan ahead where possible. Our advice is to try and order your next prescription at least 14 days before it is due.  Put your contact details on prescriptions so pharmacies can let you know when your medicines are ready, so you won’t need to be in the pharmacy for as long. Please don’t ring the pharmacy unless it’s urgent. If you're self-isolating, see if family, friends or neighbours can pick up your medication for you. If you don’t have anyone who can collect your medicine, speak to your community pharmacy for advice about how they can help. There might be community or voluntary groups ready to help in your area. If you're well and can visit the pharmacy yourself, think about how you can help family, friends and neighbours who are self-isolating by collecting their medicines on their behalf (you may need to take ID with you and will need to know the name and address of the person you are collecting for). Don't ask for extra medicine. Continue to get medicines as normal and don't stockpile. Ask your prescriber about electronic repeat dispensing, so you can order your repeat prescriptions online. We know some people may not have friends and family able to help while they are isolated at home.

It means staying at home almost all of the time, with no face-to-face contact.   Diabetes is not in the clinically extremely vulnerable group (shielding group) – it is in the 'clinically vulnerable group' – so having diabetes doesn’t automatically mean you need to shield. Although there may be some people with diabetes who need to shield based on other conditions or other risk factors, for example those with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. This means that for most people with diabetes, any lockdown rules where you live are the same for you as they are for people who don’t have diabetes.

Your body tries to fight the illness by releasing stored glucose (sugar) into your blood stream to give you energy. But your body can’t produce enough or any insulin to cope with this, so your blood sugars rise. Your body is working overtime to fight the illness, making it harder to manage your diabetes. This means you’re more at risk of having serious blood sugar highs and lows, potentially leading to  or HHS (hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state). How to reduce your risk of getting seriously ill from coronavirus The UK government is reviewing lockdown restrictions for the UK on a regular basis, and there are different rules for different areas. You can find out more about the rules in , ,  and , but everybody should continue to:  stay 2 meters away from people outside your household. The most important way people living with diabetes can lower their risk of becoming seriously ill from coronavirus is to avoid catching the virus in the first place. A vaccine is the most effective way to prevent infection, and that’s why we strongly encourage you to get the vaccine when you’re offered it. We’ve got more information about the , including the latest results from the trials and guidance about when people with diabetes can expect to get vaccinated. Some of you have been asking us whether people with diabetes need to wear face masks and coverings. Some research shows that they can slow the spread of the virus, by protecting others from catching something you may be carrying. This is true for everyone, including people with diabetes.  Get one of our adjustable face coverings from our . There are certain reasons why some people don’t need to wear a face covering – called exemptions. These include children (depending on their age), if you have asthma, and lots more. But these exemptions are different depending on where you live, so check your national government websites for the most up-to-date list – we've added some useful links below. If these exemptions apply to you, then you don’t need to wear one. But if nothing on the list applies to you, then there’s no reason why you shouldn’t wear a face covering.  We know it’s not that simple. Wearing a mask can take some getting used to, and can feel very strange at first. Some of you have told us that wearing a mask makes you feel anxious or you find it hard to breathe. There are lots of different masks out there so try to find one that suits you best. You also could try wearing it around the house for a bit, to get used to breathing in it and moving about while it’s on. If you spot someone not wearing a mask when they’re out and about, try not to make a judgement – there could be lots of invisible reasons for this and it’s not something that’s in your control. Some people may prefer to have something to hand that says they don't need to wear a face covering. You can print these from the or make the message your phone screensaver.

My symptoms have definitely been in line with those of Covid-19 but I suppose I’ll never know for definite if I’ve had the virus!"" - Khadija has diabetes and recovered from coronavirus symptoms – Although children can catch the virus, they normally have very mild symptoms and we are not aware of any children with diabetes who have died from coronavirus. However, as with all people with diabetes, an illness like coronavirus can make it harder to manage your child’s diabetes and they still have a risk of DKA. So it's important that you make sure your child follows social distancing and handwashing recommendations to reduce their risk of catching it.  How coronavirus can affect pregnant women with diabetes The same rules apply to you as for everyone with diabetes.

How coronavirus can affect people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups The risk of death from coronavirus for some ethnic groups is higher than for people of white ethnicity. But it is important to remember that there are lots of factors involved, like age, and overall risk of dying from coronavirus is very low.  In England and Wales, data from the shows how people from certain Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups are more at risk than people of white ethnicity. Research in Scotland hasn’t shown this increased risk, but the BAME population there is very small. And we don’t have data on this in Northern Ireland at the moment. We don’t know why this is happening. The data takes into account factors which we know can increase risk, such as age, socioeconomic status and health, including obesity. And we do know that some of developing conditions like type 2 diabetes and heart problems, which are linked to increased risk of death from coronavirus.  It’s clear that we need further research to understand what’s causing this – whether the causes are physical, cultural or social. We are on risks to people from ethnic minority backgrounds. Data from NHS England in May showed us that, for those who become so unwell with coronavirus that they need to go to hospital, the risk of dying is higher for people living with diabetes than people without the condition. But the risks aren't the same for everyone with diabetes. Most deaths have been in the elderly with very few under the age of 50 and none in children. This study only looked at the number of people who have died in hospital as a result of coronavirus. It doesn’t include information on the many thousands who have recovered at home or who have been successfully discharged from hospital. We are and NHS to ensure this data is used to update guidance and policies to keep people who are at greatest risk protected and supported. Research has shown us that people with diabetes who have the highest risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from coronavirus are those over the age of 50, who have a high HbA1c (above 75mmol/mol or 9%) and have received treatment for diabetes complications.   Here our Head of Research Communications, Dr Lucy Chambers, explains more about the risk factors, including type of diabetes, age and ethnicity, and why for most people your risk of dying remains very low. Although this research is England based, we believe this level of risk will be true in all nations. And to find out more detail on these statistics, go to our  news story. We’re looking at the specific ways coronavirus affects people living with diabetes. We know there’s a lot more to learn about this new type of virus, and we know we need answers fast. The government advice is that people should work from home if possible. If you're not able to work from home and still need to go to your workplace, your employer needs to take the right steps to make the workplace safe, to minimise risk to employees. In some areas of the UK, some people who are are being advised to stay at home even if they can't work from home.  We are calling on the government to urgently add some people with diabetes to this shielding list.

The rules about on social distancing and hand washing apply to children with diabetes too. Schools should be practicing social distancing for your child when schools reopen. This is to prevent the virus from spreading between children and your home. We know this is easier said than done, and can depend on how old your child is and the size of the school.  You may be worried about whether it is safe for your child to go to school if they have diabetes. Speak to the school when it reopens and to your child’s diabetes team about your concerns.

While the risk of children with diabetes becoming seriously ill with coronavirus is very low, we’ve been in touch with the Department for Education to raise your concerns and ask that when their school-specific guidance is published – it includes guidance on supporting children with health conditions too. If you have coronavirus symptoms, do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital even if you have an appointment. If you're already having treatment for something like a foot or eye problem, and you don't have coronavirus symptoms, then your appointments should still carry on. If you're worried about going to your clinic or hospital at this time or want to check whether your appointment is still going ahead, call the number on your appointment letter or speak to your GP.

If you can't get through, call 111 for advice. If you have any change in your vision you should contact your local screening service or optometrist. You may be in a situation where you need medical attention – this may be something related to your diabetes, or it may be something unrelated like an injury or illness. This means you might have to go to the Accident and Emergency (A&E) department of your local hospital and you might have to wait a while before being seen. During this time, your care in hospital may be a little different to normal, for example you may not see the diabetes team or not have family with you when you go into hospital. For any problem, regardless of the current situation, you should go to hospital as you would've done before – the NHS is still open. Read our guide to . The new guidance from government has placed additional restrictions on travel.

We know some people have had challenges getting access to food deliveries and the food you need to stay healthy. We have and are actively monitoring the situation.  You’ve also been asking about medicines and diabetes technology. There is no need for the public or NHS to stockpile insulin, diabetes medicines or tech. This could cause shortages and put other patients at risk. Pharmacies have been asked to not support patients trying to stockpile. Get more info about . The government has been working with industry and partners to monitor the impact of coronavirus on the UK supply chain of medicines and technology and put in place measures to protect UK patients. This includes banning companies from buying medicines like insulin that are meant for UK patients and selling on for a higher price in another country. This will help to ensure an uninterrupted supply of crucial medicines like insulin for NHS hospitals treating coronavirus patients. We want to reassure you that if you’re using an , a  or a  (a FreeStyle Libre), you will still be able to get these – whether that’s usually through prescriptions or you pay for these yourself.

For those who need or choose to buy test strips, we have negotiated with several companies to make certain strips available through our catalogue and . We know some people have had challenges getting access to food deliveries and the food you need to stay healthy. If you live in an area which is in Tier 3 or Tier 4 restrictions, and you are shielding, you can to get priority deliveries. Given the extra demand supermarkets face in the Christmas period, priority deliveries are not currently guaranteed, so you may find it easier to order your shopping delivery as you would normally.  If you have not been told to shield, or you live in an area that isn’t in Tier 3 or Tier 4 restrictions, you should contact your local council. They may be able to offer support to help you get the food you need. You can also contact , who can arrange for a volunteer to deliver your shopping to you.  Pharmacies are working hard to make sure that everyone with diabetes gets the medicines they need. Help them to help you by following these tips: Follow government advice and don't go to a pharmacy if you or anyone in your household has a temperature or a new and continuous cough, even if mild. Some organisations like  pharmacy have an online service and are encouraging customers to choose for their medicines to be delivered to their homes – you don't have to sign for these now, the delivery driver will leave the package somewhere safe and let you know. Plan ahead where possible. Our advice is to try and order your next prescription at least 14 days before it is due.  Put your contact details on prescriptions so pharmacies can let you know when your medicines are ready, so you won’t need to be in the pharmacy for as long. Please don’t ring the pharmacy unless it’s urgent. If you're self-isolating, see if family, friends or neighbours can pick up your medication for you. If you don’t have anyone who can collect your medicine, speak to your community pharmacy for advice about how they can help. There might be community or voluntary groups ready to help in your area. If you're well and can visit the pharmacy yourself, think about how you can help family, friends and neighbours who are self-isolating by collecting their medicines on their behalf (you may need to take ID with you and will need to know the name and address of the person you are collecting for). Don't ask for extra medicine. Continue to get medicines as normal and don't stockpile. Ask your prescriber about electronic repeat dispensing, so you can order your repeat prescriptions online. We know some people may not have friends and family able to help while they are isolated at home. You may be able to get help from voluntary groups in your area or your local councils or local authorities. Check your government websites for more information.

They also depicts that a value of ≥ 5.5% or ≥ 5.6% defines IFG in Indian setting[32]. In this context we can at least assume that HbA1c cut off for Indian will vary from the ADA recommendation and though some study have provided some preliminary data, a pan Indian study suggesting the variation of HbA1c among the diverse ethnicity in India is to be conducted. Not a standalone and perfectly reliable marker for diagnosing diabetes. FBS and PPBS test results are also essential. Fasting insulin and lipids are also important for diagnosis. yes...A1C can be higher due to infection for time being and even fasting insulin too can be higher due to various reasons ... Important thing is how to backtrack one you know you are on track of being declared as diabetic in next 10 years either by knowing Fasting Insulin or say A1C?? Elevated insulin, rise in LDL particle no (prominently small particles) We never test. There is slow and steady rise in FBS and PPBS years before one becomes diabetic. Always Ignored. My BS readings were FBS 92 and PPBS 129 in 2006. I was DX in 2012. Hmm...how to reverse to healthy state once you hear alarm of any kind ...? One step : get yourself tested regularly specially parameters related to D and other get enough AO + fermented food to make sure body needs are being made and it is in healthy state and go to cinema hall by foot to watch a good movie and In case we are able to reverse ...we can pull it to 30-40 years ...till the body really starts aging in context of India(In India I see people really age faster than other counties ...I dont know why ...there is something which is affecting us gradually and make cells age faster) what about lipids and A1C in 2006 ...what that a bit of alarming ?? First time tested Hba1c and lipids in 2012 and that's when I was DX diabetic. Lipids were fine even in 2012 (TG/HDL less than 1) but Hba1c 8.9, low B12 and D. strange ...as TG is also generally high when HbA1c high and get T2D declared... I am not IR but ID. Someone here had declared me non-diabetic after looking at my lipids. hmm...what do you do for making up for deficiency of Insulin... Any idea how you became ID suddenly without IR..due to some drugs /antibiotic reaction ?? I have heard many people have drugs side effects which spoils pancreas... Don't know. May be my beta cells became dysfunctional due to genetical factors over the period and was never IR. Thats the deep point for investigation...In Ramdev camp, I saw many people said that due to over use of antibiotic and strong drugs for various infection their pancreas got affected and they got D mostly young Yes I think lot of research is needed to see how beta cells get affected or become dysfunctional. So that reversal will be easier. I am really surprised ...why its not a big issue in India till now...this is a wake up call for we Indians and no research body is concerned about problem of D in India Can free radicals be the cause??...very less AO in typical Indian diet or wheat allergy or lactose allgery ate up pancreas and thyroid in years slowly ?? I am recently seeing a lot of youngers getting diagnosed with Thyroid too And you know Vit D difficiency and D and thyroid often daignosed together ...how are these correlated...how we become so defficient in Vit D despite getting enough sun shine ...and then as a chain reaction thyroid and D as a gift...?? Is it a low fat or bad fat diet which is making us deficient to Vit D and so giving us D and thyroid?? karch as far as Vit D deficiency....we really don't know what is normal standard for Indians.... There are lot of researches say.... WE INDIANS ARE DIFFERENT THAN WHITES. Even in case of statin...lower doses are sufficient to attain required plasma level. All researches about Vit.D are done in western countries....and standards are fixed as per that. But I guess problem is with genetically modified grains....and oils... Also injected hormone and pesticides.... you know diclofenac??? we use to eat as Burfen??? it is cause to extinction of Vultures....same we are eating so many things and we don't know the effects of same. Though we have enough sun shine there is insufficient exposure to sun. It is not consistent and body is covered with cloths. pata nahi.... but they say just 15 mts exposure is sufficient.... आयुर्वेद काय सांगत sun exposure बाबतीत शोधायला हव. –Guru, Kathina, Khara, PaarthivaDravya – aushadha and ahaara –herbs with SandhaneeyaGuna like ARJUNA, GUGGULU, MOTHA, LAKSHA –Dravya (Single Drugs): Pooga, Naareekela, Pravaala, MrigaS`hringa, S`hauktika, SudhaaVarga, Vaataama, Methikaa, Majjaa –Formulations – Tiktadravya siddha Ghrita, Taila, TiktaKsheeraBasti, Chyavanpraasha, Chikitsaa Karma – Basti (Tikta Rasa PradhaanaDravya siddha Ghrita/Ksheera) Ayurvedic physiology explains this biochemical problem with much more clinical basis. Asthi dhathu, when affected by dhathwagni mandya or srothorodha, becomes defective in taking up its required nutritive part from the common circulating pool of rasadhathu, and results in malformation of asthi dhathu i.e. bone deformities as discussed in head Para. In such a clinical context, loading a patient with immense calcium can never yield good results. The clinical approach in such cases can be better aided by correction of biological fire and there by the correcting the metabolic errors in the body. Biological fire regulation followed by Drugs which possess specific action on asthidhathwagni, so that asthi dhathu is formed perfectly- is the method to be adopted. Also, rasayanas, which can influence deeper dhatus like asthi dhathu are proved to have commendable results in such clinical conditions. To support such internal medications, VITAMIN D support externally, like basking morning and evening sunlight, proper exercise can support the treatment to a greater extend. Along with this internal medication strategy, bedside treatment methods like vasthi, udvarthana, abhyanga are all found very effective in correcting asthi dhathwagni However, in those cases where, severe bone deformity is diagnosed, ie, the sthayi asthi dhathu is affected, oral or para-enteral VITAMIN D supplement or simply a direct supplement of asthi dhathvagni is vital. Along with this Ayurvedic assistance for metabolic correction is proved to have good results and obviously, not only a vitamin supplement corrects the issue from root level. and then sunscreens ...and air conditioners ...force us to remain indoor ...and what about getting Vit D from milk??Isnt that enough or actually milk is not providing us sufficient amount of Vit D karch first of all let us arrive the right level of D for Indians....then we can think further.... there is one member here....he says Vit D is like steroid ...... he says if you take vit D supplement..your skin problems will get aggravated actually i have seen in dog pups many times....rickets is developed only with weak pup..and with lots of worm load.

17cc3db5-8dd2-4528-ac81-9f8cdac18db9,"Talking with the ADA's New CEO Tracey Brown (Living with T2D Herself!) — American Diabetes Association Tracey Brown, appointed earlier this year, is notably the first African-American woman to be at the org’s helm, as well as the first-ever to be living with type 2 diabetes herself. Her was the culmination of a search that took more than a year, following the departure of former CEO Kevin Hagen in March 2017 and a stint under , who happened to be living with type 1 diabetes herself. Tracey is now coming off an action-packed first 100 days on the job that included a super-busy summer diabetes conference season. Today, we’re pleased to feature an interview with her on what she sees at the ADA’s biggest strengths and weaknesses, and what she hopes to build there going forward. A Conversation with ADA Head and T2D Peep Tracey Brown DM) Great to meet you Tracey. Our readers would love to start by hearing your own diabetes story… TB) My personal diabetes story is part of why I’m actually here in this role. I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes 15 years ago now. I probably didn’t take that diagnosis as seriously as I should’ve, because I was told that for 80% of the women it would go away. I had to watch what I ate while pregnant and was on insulin during my pregnancy, and ended up having an incredible baby girl who is now 15 years old. But I didn’t take it seriously after having my baby. The doctors kept me on insulin for a couple months after she was born, and then a bit longer, and finally I was told that my gestational diabetes was full-on type 2. Did you take it more seriously after being diagnosed with T2D? Again, I probably should’ve pivoted and done some things differently at that point, but I didn’t. I’m a Type A personality — very competitive, someone who believes I can do anything. So I basically said to myself, ‘I got this’ and left it there. But from a very early age, my daughter would see me take insulin and test my blood sugars multiple times a day. One day when she was about 5 years old we were in the bathroom getting dressed, and she looked up at me and said: ‘Mom, you are you going to die of diabetes.’ That was turning point — the breaking point for me. I made a commitment to myself, my daughter and my family, that I would unapologetically tell my story wherever I could, as my form of driving awareness around the seriousness of this disease. I also made a commitment to tackle stigma, because there is a lot of negative stigma associated with type 2 diabetes. I made a commitment to be the poster child for how you with diabetes — not just live or exist, but thrive. A third commitment I made was not giving up on a cure in my lifetime. I put that last part in there about my lifetime, so that I’d always have a sense of urgency. I’m now 52 years old, and hope that it’s a halfway point in my life; I’m not giving up on that. All of that led me here to ADA, and I believe this is part of my life’s purpose. Is that what took you from the corporate world to non-profit side at ADA? Yes. I take my diagnosis as a gift, and think everyone has a reason for being in this world. I believe my God’s purpose is to showcase how to thrive with diabetes, to drive awareness for those living with diabetes and help to find a cure. That’s why I stepped out of the for-profit world, where I had a successful 30-year career, to come here to ADA. Can you tell us ab bit about your professional background and how that set the stage for joining the ADA’s executive team? I started out as a chemical engineer in R&D at Procter & Gamble, and over the years have been in management at RAPP Dallas and Sam’s Club (a division of Walmart). I’ve served on a lot of non-profit boards and been a chair of those, and one of the things that’s always struck me, is that many of these folks (in non-profit roles) don’t view themselves as a business. The fact of the matter is, we are. The only difference between for-profit and non-profit is your tax status and your profits are being invested into the cause and mission, instead of going to shareholders. I felt prepared in understanding the business fundamentals of what needs to be done to have a healthy, thriving business and organization. “No mission, no money; No money, no mission” is something I often say. Those are two sides of the same coin. Did you feel that ADA was also lacking that drive and mindset? In the for-profit space, there’s an understanding of the mission and value, and how to tell the story. That’s something we can do better. The ADA has not done a great job in telling our story, and showing how we emotionally connect with people with diabetes first — then telling the story of the value we’re adding for those people. Also from my for-profit experience, I can see we need to really understand how to drive measurable and demonstrable impacts. It’s the measurable piece of how you’re using data, and understanding the need you’re serving and focusing on delivering that. Those are a few of the areas that I think are directly applicable to what I’m doing now. You’re the first ADA CEO to be living with type 2 diabetes, as well as … How important are those distinctions? Being the first African-American (to lead ADA)… I haven’t given that much thought. First, I am a person living with diabetes and that’s why I am here. That’s what I am striving to be a poster child for. The thing that resonates the most with me is that I’m the first CEO who is actually living with type 2 diabetes, and that means more to me than anything. You just have a different perspective. We make thousands of decisions a day based on what our numbers are telling us, from the time we wake up to when we go to sleep. That’s just a little perspective, and so I’m out in the community making sure that ADA is connecting with people who are making those decisions every day. No one can truly walk in your shoes in living with diabetes, even though people can try to understand. We can’t take our eye off that. I’m excited not only about what I’ve learned, from starting out on a bit of a ‘listening tour’ within the ADA and across the country at different chapters and communities, but also about the pivot we’re taking as an organization for our future. We’ve spent a good bit of time figuring out strategically to accelerate our ability to fulfill our mission. Diabetes is the biggest health epidemic of our time now, and as someone who’s been living with T2D for 14 years, I see this as so important. Things are just getting worse, and so it’s time for us to truly sound the alarm, awaken the world, and do something that’s a bit more disruptive to address this epidemic. There are some clear things that I’ve learned so far on my initial listening tour. First, it’s just the strength of the people who work here in this organization. Clearly that passion is one of the biggest differences in why people show up here every day. It’s unparalleled to anything I’ve experienced at any for-profit company. That is a powerful strength, and we need to continue to understand that our associates here are our biggest asset. Also, when you think about our heritage and DNA, we’re about to celebrate our 78 birthday at ADA. When you think about ADA being founded by doctors, we were very clear that they were trying to find a cure and helping people live with diabetes while doing that. That’s a strength. We are the credible source on diabetes. The professional community views us as that credible source and authority, and I believe we’re meeting their needs. What about the ADA’s biggest weaknesses at this time? When I speak with people who are living with diabetes, I believe we’re coming up short of truly meeting their needs. That pierces my heart. We have an opportunity to step up in a different way than we have before, to be able to deliver on that half of our mission to help those PWDs and their families thrive. There’s an opportunity to show up in a different way than we have for that audience. The second opportunity I’ve learned about is that we’re a voluntary health organization, so we need to re-purpose the passion and support that exists within our community. We need to harness the passion of those volunteers and passionate supporters in a different way than we have. I’ve talked about igniting and unleashing our volunteer community. We know that we can’t do this alone. If we could, we’d have already found a cure and it’d be game-over. We must collaborate in a different way than we have. We’ve got to be more intentional about who we partner with. I believe the whole world is connected through diabetes for life, and to stop this epidemic and do better it’s only going to happen through collaborations and only if it’s intentional and disruptive. Some criticize the ADA partnerships with Pharma… can you address that? There are a number of stakeholders across the board in diabetes, and everybody has a role to play in that ecosystem. We are very clear on what we’re trying to do. We want to bend the curve of this diabetes epidemic, decreasing the number of people who are becoming diabetic and be able to find a cure. Whether you’re Pharma, an advocacy organization, healthcare professional, donor, volunteer, or non-Pharma startup… there’s a role each can play in making things better in diabetes and bending that curve. That’s what we are going after. It comes down to being very clear on your goal and where people can fit into the path to that goal. That’s all great on the T2 epidemic, but what about type 1? In our mission statement, we talk about meeting the needs of all people with diabetes. All in all, I don’t think ADA has done a good enough job engaging with everyone in the community and talking about what we’re doing for each (part) of our community. There’s a that we share, even though there are differences. If you talk to anyone internally at ADA, I don’t think anyone would say that we’re focused on one type more than another. But what I’ve learned, is that we aren’t messaging that appropriately for all, for both, or for either one. I honestly don’t think there’s a line, I think we’re trying to help all people connected to diabetes. There are too many people dying from diabetes, and its complications. What do you think needs to be done on the point of diabetes stigma, especially for type 2s? Diabetes is just so misunderstood. People just have so much misinformation about diabetes and this condition in general. The more we can educate and stop whispering about it, but speak proudly about it, the better off we’ll be and it will give us an opportunity to turn that stigma around. So, how was your first experience with the ? I started at a time when it was in the whirlwind of ADA preparing for that big event. As much as I knew what it would be like, it’s an experience like no other. My initial reaction post-event was one of pride. I had the opportunity to interact with some of the world’s most renowned doctors, nurses, educators, researchers in diabetes. They are all focused on bending this curve and improving diabetes care. I had a tremendous sense of pride walking out of there, after seeing those thousands of people who came together all in the name of trying to find a cure and help people with diabetes. This is one of those things that I feel is a gold-start for ADA, and I’m proud of what we do there at the Scientific Sessions. And as much as I want the healthcare professionals to talk about this event, I equally want people with diabetes and their families talking about the impact of this meeting. Agreed Tracey! Thank you for taking the time to talk, and share your passion for bringing value to PWDs as you take over the helm at ADA. — I Tried It: Tandem’s New Control-IQ Automated Diabetes Technology DiabetesMine reviews Tandem Diabetes exciting new Control-IQ system that partially automates insulin delivery.

Searches of CENTRAL, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, CAB, and grey literature sources from inception to 25 August 2020. Randomized clinical trials evaluating LCDs (<130 g/day or <26% of a 2000 kcal/day diet) and VLCDs (<10% calories from carbohydrates) for at least 12 weeks in adults with type 2 diabetes were eligible. Primary outcomes were remission of diabetes (HbA <6.5% or fasting glucose <7.0 mmol/L, with or without the use of diabetes medication), weight loss, HbA, fasting glucose, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included health related quality of life and biochemical laboratory data. All articles and outcomes were independently screened, extracted, and assessed for risk of bias and GRADE certainty of evidence at six and 12 month follow-up. Risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random effects meta-analysis. Outcomes were assessed according to a priori determined minimal important differences to determine clinical importance, and heterogeneity was investigated on the basis of risk of bias and seven a priori subgroups. Any subgroup effects with a statistically significant test of interaction were subjected to a five point credibility checklist. Searches identified 14 759 citations yielding 23 trials (1357 participants), and 40.6% of outcomes were judged to be at low risk of bias. At six months, compared with control diets, LCDs achieved higher rates of diabetes remission (defined as HbA <6.5%) (76/133 (57%) 41/131 (31%); risk difference 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.17 to 0.47; 8 studies, n=264, I=58%). Conversely, smaller, non-significant effect sizes occurred when a remission definition of HbA <6.5% without medication was used. Subgroup assessments determined as meeting credibility criteria indicated that remission with LCDs markedly decreased in studies that included patients using insulin. At 12 months, data on remission were sparse, ranging from a small effect to a trivial increased risk of diabetes. Large clinically important improvements were seen in weight loss, triglycerides, and insulin sensitivity at six months, which diminished at 12 months. On the basis of subgroup assessments deemed credible, VLCDs were less effective than less restrictive LCDs for weight loss at six months. However, this effect was explained by diet adherence. That is, among highly adherent patients on VLCDs, a clinically important reduction in weight was seen compared with studies with less adherent patients on VLCDs. Participants experienced no significant difference in quality of life at six months but did experience clinically important, but not statistically significant, worsening of quality of life and low density lipoprotein cholesterol at 12 months. Otherwise, no significant or clinically important between group differences were found in terms of adverse events or blood lipids at six and 12 months. On the basis of moderate to low certainty evidence, patients adhering to an LCD for six months may experience remission of diabetes without adverse consequences. Limitations include continued debate around what constitutes remission of diabetes, as well as the efficacy, safety, and dietary satisfaction of longer term LCDs. PROSPERO CRD42020161795. Diabetes is a common, deadly, and expensive medical condition. It is estimated that 1 in 11 adults worldwide have diabetes and that it is responsible for 11% of deaths annually, costing $760bn (£570bn; €626bn) in direct costs alone. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for 90-95% of cases, and for decades has been a rapidly growing international concern. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance driven by chronic hyperglycemia and is commonly diagnosed by measures of glycemia such as fasting blood glucose concentrations of 7.0 mmol/L or above or glycated hemoglobin (HbA) values of 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) or above. It is associated with several risk factors including genetics and lifestyle influences, but by far the most common risk factor is obesity. Structured dietary interventions are commonly recommended for patients with diabetes, with varied recommendations from authoritative organizations. Before the discovery of insulin, diets emphasizing carbohydrate restriction had been used extensively in the management of diabetes, but more recently they have fallen out of favor. Because a key underlying mechanism of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance driven in part by chronic hyperglycemia, lowering dietary intake of carbohydrate, most of which is absorbed as glucose or fructose, has been suggested to improve blood glucose control and outcomes of type 2 diabetes. Structured diets with carbohydrate restriction have been variably described in the research literature but have been commonly grouped into three categories: 20-50 g/day carbohydrates or less than 10% of the 2000 kcal/day diet that is generally sufficient to induce ketosis; less than 130 g/day or less than 26% of the 2000 kcal/day diet; and less than 45% of the 2000 kcal/day diet. For the purposes of this review, we refer to diets with less than 130 g/day or less than 26% of calories from carbohydrates based on 2000 kcal/day as a low carbohydrate diet (LCD). Type 2 diabetes remains a significant and worsening problem worldwide, despite many pharmaceutical developments and a global emphasis on glycemic control. Structured diets are recognized as an essential component of treating diabetes, but confusion remains about which diet to choose. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses to date have attempted to pool carbohydrate restricted diets for diabetic populations, reporting mixed results. Among the limitations, as a whole, the systematic reviews and meta-analyses have included interventions with moderate carbohydrate intake that may dilute the effect of LCDs. Other limitations include an exclusive focus on surrogate outcomes (for example, blood lipids), with the largest systematic reviews and meta-analysis to date identifying only 10 trials that meet strict eligibility criteria of LCDs three months or more in length, limiting the certainty and precision in effect estimates. Furthermore, no review to date has attempted to report the effect of LCDs on rates of remission of diabetes, and no review has presented effect estimates with consideration of minimal important difference thresholds, thresholds that will assist patients and clinicians with interpreting the magnitude of treatment effects. We aimed to systematically assess the efficacy, safety, and certainty of estimates for both surrogate outcomes and outcomes important to patients of strict LCDs for people with type 2 diabetes. On the basis of an a priori and publicly available protocol (PROSPERO CRD42020161795), we did a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy and safety of LCDs among adult patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. We included people with or without cardiovascular conditions regardless of medication use or glucose concentration and HbA level. We included trials comparing LCDs with any wait list controls or any active controls including competing dietary programs higher in carbohydrates (≥26%), with or without exercise, lifestyle, and behavioral recommendations. No language, date, or publication restrictions were applied. We sought unpublished data from investigators of published and unpublished trials. To meet inclusion criteria, studies had to investigate allocation to an LCD (<26% calories from carbohydrates or <130 g/day) for a defined period (12 weeks or longer), with or without exercise (for example, walking, jogging, strength training) or lifestyle and behavioral recommendations (for example, cognitive therapy, group support). Primary outcomes of interest, based on our a priori protocol, were remission of type 2 diabetes (dichotomously defined as HbA <6.5% or fasting glucose <7.0 mmol/L), with or without the use of diabetes medication. Additional primary outcomes were weight loss, HbA, fasting glucose, and adverse events (total and serious adverse events). Secondary outcomes were health related quality of life, reduction of medication, and biochemical laboratory data including total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and inflammatory markers (C reactive protein). We searched the following databases from inception to 25 August 2020 to identify studies: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medline via PubMed, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux (CAB) abstracts. With the assistance of an expert clinical librarian, search strategies were customized, including the use of a Cochrane recommended filter for the identification of randomized controlled trials in PubMed. The Medline search strategy is reported in supplementary table A. On the basis of our study protocol, we also searched three trial registries (for example, clinicaltrials.gov) and four additional grey literature sources (for example, BIOSIS Citation Index, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global). Two authors, independently and in duplicate, screened titles and abstracts and subsequently full text articles. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Data extraction was done independently and in duplicate using a pilot tested extraction form. Domains for extraction included study design factors, population, intervention, comparator, and surrogate and health outcomes (variables listed in supplementary table B). All outcomes were extracted and reported at six months (±3 months) and 12 months (±3 months). We used version 2.0 of the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias (RoB) instrument for randomized trials and assessed each of the RoB domains as “high,” “low,” or “some concern” using the Excel file provided by the RoB 2.0 development team. We used Revman software (version 5.3) and the “meta” package in R (version 3.6.1) to do meta-analyses. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the pooled risk difference, risk ratio, and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous outcomes, we combined endpoint or change data; when both endpoint and change data were reported, we prioritized endpoint data. We calculated the pooled mean difference and/or standardized mean difference with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. We pooled studies that measured continuous health related quality of life with different instruments if the underlying construct was the same or similar. To improve interpretability for readers, we followed published guidance and presented effect estimates in two ways. Firstly, we pooled the effect estimates as standardized mean differences. Secondly, we converted scores of the different health related quality of life instruments to units of the most commonly used reference instrument and presented the mean difference. Where possible, we presented the effect size on the basis of known or estimated minimal clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds for all outcomes (supplementary table C). We rated the overall certainty (quality) of evidence for each of our outcomes by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach, wherein randomized trials began as high certainty evidence but could be rated down by one or more levels on the basis of five categories of limitations: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. We assessed the RoB and GRADE independently and in duplicate, with disagreement resolved by consensus. After a request from referees, we also did a sensitivity analysis comparing the certainty of evidence using GRADE versus NutriGRADE. Following published guidance, we chose to use data from complete cases for our primary analysis. When studies had missing outcome data and reported a complete case analysis, we did sensitivity analyses and applied increasingly stringent but plausible assumptions to this data, using Excel files made available from the authors of the GRADE guidance on missing outcome data. For assessing the effect of missing outcome data on risk of bias, we did these sensitivity assessments at the study level to best integrate with Cochrane RoB 2.0. We assessed and reported heterogeneity quantitatively using the I statistic and did a χ test for homogeneity according to guidelines from the Cochrane Handbook (for example, 50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity; 75% to 100% may represent considerable heterogeneity). We investigated heterogeneity and the possibility of effect modification for our primary outcomes on the basis of risk of bias and seven a priori subgroups, with any subgroup effects with a statistically significant test of interaction subjected to a five point credibility checklist. Subgroups were very low carbohydrate diets (VLCD) (<10% calories from carbohydrates) versus diets with between 10% and 26% of calories from carbohydrates; trials that provided behavioral support versus those that did not; LCDs versus comparator diets (for example, low fat diets, Mediterranean diets); trials in which caloric intake did not significantly differ between groups (iso-caloric) versus those in which it did; LCD trials that used caloric restriction versus those that did not; trials that included patients who used insulin versus those that did not; trials in which the intervention group showed adequate adherence (determined by three a priori criteria: 3-β-hydroxybutyrate, measured carbohydrate intake, and author definitions) versus those that did not. Furthermore, for each outcome, we investigated the effect on the point estimate when we restricted the analysis to studies at low risk of bias; if the risk of bias sensitivity analysis was credible, we focused our results on those studies at low risk. To assess for the possibility of publication bias, we visually inspected funnel plots when 10 or more trials were included. We further assessed for publication bias by using Egger's regression test for continuous outcomes and the Harbord score for dichotomous outcomes. Given the nature of secondary data capture and analysis, patients and the public were not involved in the design or interpretation of this study. Our search yielded 14 759 records, of which 23 studies (1357 participants) met the inclusion criteria (). shows characteristics of the clinical trials. In short, trials primarily included overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes, with 14/23 (61%) studies including participants using insulin. Trial size ranged from 12 to 144 participants with a mean age range of 47 to 67 years. Studies used various carbohydrate restriction thresholds with 12/23 (52%) meeting our criteria for very low carbohydrate diets (<10% daily calories from carbohydrates or <50 g/d). Trials primarily used low fat diets as control comparators (18/23; 78%). Duration of treatment ranged from three months to two years. Dropouts were common in the included studies. Eighteen (78%) of 23 studies reported missing participant outcome data, with 10 reporting more than 20% of data being missing. In studies with reported missing data, we assessed the robustness of reported effect estimates by using increasingly stringent assumptions about the missing data and incorporated this into the overall assessment for risk of bias. Overall, 59.4% of outcomes were rated as having some concern or high risk of bias, and 40.6% of outcomes were rated as having low risk of bias (). The randomization process was the risk of bias domain that had the poorest reporting, with just over 40% of trials having “some concerns.” Eight studies reported on remission of diabetes at six months. Pooled analysis showed that when remission was defined by an HbA level below 6.5% independent of medication use, LCDs increased remissions by an additional 32 per 100 patients followed (risk difference 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.17 to 0.47; 8 studies, n=264; GRADE=moderate) (; ). When remission was defined by an HbA level below 6.5% and the absence of diabetes medication, LCDs increased remissions at a lower rate (risk difference 0.05, –0.05 to 0.14; 5 studies, n=199; GRADE=low) (). Three studies reported on remission at 12 months. When remission was defined independently of medication use, LCDs increased remission (risk difference 0.10, –0.02 to 0.21; 3 studies, n=171; GRADE=moderate), but they lowered the remission rate when the definition of remission included absence of diabetes medication (risk difference –0.04, –0.16 to 0.09; 2 studies, n=126; GRADE=low) (). Eighteen studies reported on weight loss at six months. Pooled analysis showed that patients on LCDs achieved greater weight loss compared with control (mean difference –3.46, 95% confidence interval –5.25 to –1.67; n=882; GRADE=moderate) (). On the basis of subgroup credibility testing, we found that in studies at low risk of bias, LCDs achieved 7.41 kg greater weight loss compared with controls (mean difference –7.41, –9.75 to –5.08; 6 studies, n=171; test for subgroup differences P<0.001) (). Seven studies reported on weight loss at 12 months, with our pooled analysis showing that any benefit over control diets was trivial and non-significant (mean difference 0.29 (–1.02 to 1.60) kg; n=499; GRADE=moderate) (). Seventeen studies reported on HbA levels at six months. LCDs achieved greater reductions in HbA than did control diets (mean difference –0.47%, –0.60 to –0.34; n=747; GRADE=high) (). At 12 months, eight studies reported on HbA levels, showing that the effect size had decreased by around half (mean difference –0.23%, –0.46% to 0.00%; n=489; GRADE=moderate) (). Fourteen studies reported on fasting glucose at six months. Pooled analysis showed that LCDs achieved an average 0.73 mmol/L greater reduction in glucose concentrations compared with control diets (mean difference –0.73, –1.19 to –0.27; n=611; GRADE=moderate) (). Six studies reported on fasting glucose at 12 months, with little or no difference observed between the comparator diets (mean difference 0.06, –0.37 to 0.48; n=365; GRADE=moderate) (). Eleven studies reported total adverse events or serious adverse events at six months. Pooled analysis suggested a trivial and non-significant increase in total adverse events among patients on LCDs (risk difference 0.04, –0.01 to 0.08; 9 studies, n=423; GRADE=very low) and similarly little or no effect on serious adverse events (risk difference 0.00, –0.03 to 0.02; 8 studies, n=448; GRADE=low) (). Three studies reported on total adverse events or serious adverse events at 12 months, with pooled estimates showing that LCDs were associated with a small, non-significant decrease in total adverse events (risk difference –0.05, –0.24 to 0.14; 2 studies, n=156; GRADE=very low) and a trivial, non-significant decrease in serious adverse events (risk difference –0.01, –0.06 to 0.04; 3 studies, n=217; GRADE=low) (). shows secondary outcomes. Briefly, pooled analyses showed that LCDs led to greater reductions in diabetes medication and clinically important benefits threefold greater than the MCID estimate for triglycerides and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at six and 12 months. LCDs had clinically important harms on quality of life and low density lipoprotein cholesterol at 12 months, with little to no effect observed at six months. LCDs had little or no effect on total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations or C reactive protein related inflammation at six and 12 months. We did subgroup assessments (level of carbohydrate restriction, behavioral support intensity, comparator diet, iso-caloric comparator, caloric restriction, inclusion of patients who used insulin, and adherence) for each of our five primary outcomes. Most subgroup observations were not deemed credible; however, three credible subgroups were identified on the basis of meeting four of five credibility criteria. Specifically, for these subgroups, statistical analysis suggested that chance could not explain the apparent subgroup effect, the effect was consistent across studies, the subgroup hypothesis was one of a small number of hypotheses developed a priori with direction specified, and strong pre-existing biological support existed (supplementary table D). Studies that included patients using insulin had fewer remissions for both definitions of remission (HbA <6.5%; HbA <6.5% and no diabetes medication) at six months (risk difference 0.14, 0.03 to 0.25; 0.00, –0.07 to 0.07) compared with studies that did not (risk difference 0.51, 0.36 to 0.65; 0.20, 0.03 to 0.38) (test for subgroup difference P<0.001; P=0.03). Diets with very low carbohydrates (<10% of daily calories from carbohydrates) led to smaller weight loss at six months (mean difference –1.05, –2.27 to 0.17) than did less restrictive diets (mean difference –5.22, –8.33 to –2.11) (test for subgroup difference P=0.01). However, on the basis of our third subgroup that was judged to be credible, this effect was explained by diet adherence. That is, among VLCDs to which the patients were highly adherent, a larger clinically important weight loss occurred (mean difference –4.47, –8.21 to –0.73) compared with patients less adherent to VLCDs (mean difference –0.55, –1.76 to 0.66) (test for subgroup difference P=0.05). We did a post hoc sensitivity analysis comparing the certainty of evidence using GRADE versus NutriGRADE (supplementary table E). NutriGRADE analysis resulted in 16/30 (53%) outcomes with the same rating as GRADE; 10 (33%) of outcomes were upgraded compared with GRADE ratings (mainly our secondary outcomes), and 4 (13%) were downgraded. Among 23 studies comparing LCDs with mostly low fat control diets in patients with type 2 diabetes, on the basis of moderate to low certainty evidence, patients on LCDs achieved higher diabetes remission rates at six months (HbA <6.5%: NNT=3; HbA <6.5% and no diabetes medication: NNT=20). On the basis of very low to high certainty evidence, no statistically significant and clinically important detrimental effects on cardiovascular risk factors (for example, lipids, C reactive protein) or adverse events were detected with LCDs. However, we observed a trend for clinically important increases in low density lipoprotein cholesterol at 12 months. Additionally, LCDs increased weight loss, reduced medication use, and improved triglyceride concentrations at six months. In general, most benefits diminished at 12 months, a finding consistent with previous reviews. We did sensitivity analyses based on risk of bias for all outcomes, but only one outcome, weight loss, showed a credible subgroup effect between studies with higher and lower risk of bias. Studies with lower risk of bias showed more dramatic increases in weight loss, findings that were both statistically and clinically significant, supporting our overall findings. Subgroup analyses, based on credibility testing, suggested that patients not using insulin, compared with those that did, had increased diabetes remission rates at six months. For patients not using insulin, the NNT was 2 for remission defined as HbA below 6.5% and 5 for remission defined as HbA below 6.5 without diabetes medication. Furthermore, on the basis of our subgroup testing, VLCDs underperformed compared with less restrictive LCDs for weight loss at six months. However, this difference was negated when we considered patients highly adherent to VLCDs. Of note, the limited number of studies with 12 month outcome data providing differing levels of support and having highly adherent versus less adherent intervention arms precluded subgroup analyses that explicitly explored the effects of adherence at 12 months. Although improvements noted at six months diminished by 12 months, determining with any certainty whether this is related to intensity of intervention and/or dietary adherence beyond six months is difficult. Our systematic review has several important strengths. Firstly, we did a thorough literature search and contacted authors of all studies for any unpublished data on remission of diabetes. Although only three included studies previously published HbA threshold criteria and medication use to determine diabetes remission, our successful contact with authors yielded trial data from five additional studies to determine remission rates, increasing the precision and overall certainty of the effect estimates. Recent systematic reviews conducted by Sainsbury, van Zuuren, and Snorgaard have shown important reductions in mean HbA values with low and very low carbohydrate diets, but no previous review has summarized HbA as a dichotomous outcome informed by the suggested American Diabetes Association remission definitions (for example, <6.5% HbA threshold). We believe that our meta-analytic summary of published and unpublished data from eight randomized controlled trials using HbA thresholds, a first in the literature, will lead to more informed clinical decision making in the management of type 2 diabetes. Secondly, on the basis of a publicly available protocol, we used robust evidence synthesis methods including the use of Cochrane’s Risk of Bias instrument 2.0, missing participant outcome data sensitivity analyses, and subgroup credibility assessments based on a priori stated effect modifiers. Missing data for participants is particularly important in nutrition research in general given the often dramatic losses to follow-up in diet based clinical trials (>20% among 10/23 (43%) of trials included in this analysis) and the corresponding risk of bias due to losses to follow-up. Subgroup credibility assessment is of particular interest to researchers in this field given that some have advocated for subgroup elucidation ﻿when considering LCDs for treating diabetes. Whereas previous reviews have focused on one or two potential modifiers—for example, Korsmo et al, who explored subgroups on length of follow-up and carbohydrate intake, and Naude et al, who explored calorically matched controls—in our protocol driven approach, we explored seven actively debated potential effect modifiers by using published, explicit subgroup credibility criteria. Thirdly, the use of GRADE for rating the certainty of evidence in systematic reviews of nutrition studies has been questioned, with some calling for a methodological approach specific to nutrition studies. However, we believe the logic of scientific inquiry demands consistent standards for casual inference across health claims, preferably using GRADE, a more conservative rating approach than the alternative systems suggested by the nutrition community. Nevertheless, we did a sensitivity analysis comparing GRADE ratings with NutriGRADE ratings (supplementary table E). NutriGRADE analysis resulted in 16/30 (53%) outcomes with the same rating as GRADE; 10 (33%) of outcomes were judged to be of higher certainty using NutriGRADE, and 4 (13%) were judged to be of lower certainty using NutriGRADE. Overall, the certainty of evidence using NutriGRADE indicates, on average, a higher degree of confidence in the efficacy and safety of LCDs across outcomes, particularly our primary outcomes including diabetes remission and fasting glucose, and higher certainty in the evidence for little to no short term risk of adverse events with LCDs. Fourthly, our interpretations of estimates for continuous outcomes were based on a priori estimates of the minimal clinically important differences (supplementary table C). To our knowledge, no previous review on this topic has attempted to present effect estimates while considering MCID thresholds, thresholds that will help clinicians and patients to better interpret the magnitude of treatment effect. Among 10 continuous outcomes, two showed improvements that met or surpassed the MCID at six months (triglycerides, insulin resistance) with no detrimental effects. At 12 months, two had improvements that surpassed the MCID (triglycerides, insulin resistance) and two had a clinically important worsening (quality of life, low density lipoprotein cholesterol), although neither was statistically significant (P=0.24 and P=0.05). Our study is not without limitations. Firstly, the definition of remission of diabetes is the subject of considerable debate, specifically with regards to threshold levels of HbA/fasting glucose, use of diabetes medication, and the length of follow-up time meeting these criteria. We attempted to overcome this by using multiple a priori definitions of remission (both with and without the use of diabetes medication) at both of our predetermined endpoints (six months and 12 months). Secondly, safety concerns have been raised with LCDs. Although no significant or clinically important increase in total or serious adverse events was identified, these outcomes were poorly reported among trials and the certainty of evidence for safety ranges from low to very low. By contrast, we have moderate to high certainty that surrogate markers for cardiovascular disease risk, such as blood lipids, do not worsen, whereas triglycerides significantly improved in a clinically meaningful way. One exception was low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations at 12 months’ follow-up, which seemed to worsen, surpassing the MCID. Thirdly, 18/23 (78%) studies used low fat diets as a comparator, limiting the applicability of our results to other dietary regimens such as a Mediterranean-style diet. Fourthly, an important concern with LCDs is the potential confounding factor of caloric restriction. Restricting carbohydrates, which tends to reduce hunger, would mean that whether any purported benefit was due to carbohydrate restriction or caloric restriction was unclear. For this reason, as part of our a priori planned subgroup analysis, we investigated the effect of calorically matched controls (as assessed by follow-up dietary questionnaires). On the basis of 18 studies providing adequate data, we identified no evidence of credible effect modification based on caloric matching or lack thereof. However, self-reported dietary intake data are prone to measurement error, particularly in dietary trials in which participants are not blinded. Fifthly, we made a pragmatic a priori decision to assess our endpoints at six and 12 months (±3 months). Whereas trials informing our 12 month endpoint were all reported at this time point, those informing our six month endpoint varied between three months and eight months. Of the 14 trials informing our six month pooled estimates, 7/14 (50%) reported data at three to less than six months (3 months: 6 trials; 4 months: 1 trial), and 7/14 (50%) trials reported at six to nine months (6 months: 6 trials; 8 months: 1 trial). On the basis of comments from peer reviewers, we did a post hoc analysis on remission at six (±3) months. Evidence suggested larger treatment effects for LCDs in shorter term trials (3 to <6 months), suggesting that shorter term trials may be an effect modifier. For the definition of remission of HbA below 6.5%, the risk difference was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.68) for trials of three to less than six months in length compared with 0.25 (0.08 to 0.42) for trials of between six and nine months. Similarly, for the definition of remission of HbA below 6.5% and no diabetes medication use, the risk difference was 0.20 (0.03 to 0.38) for trials of three to less than six months compared with 0.00 (–0.07 to 0.07) for trials of between six and nine months. Sixthly, our protocol driven results are limited to short term markers of remission of diabetes, adverse events, and related cardiometabolic outcomes. Future long term, well designed, calorie controlled randomized trials are needed to determine the effects of LCD on sustained weight loss and remission of diabetes, as well as cardiovascular mortality and major morbidity. Seventhly, our review focused on studies defined by macronutrient quantity. Macronutrient quality may also be important, and, although we were unable to consider the characteristics of dietary quality given the lack of reporting in our 23 eligible trials, future trials should better document dietary quality (for example, processed versus unprocessed foods) using optimally validated questionnaires together with emerging objective biomarkers using microbiomics, metabolomics, or other high dimensional platforms. Finally, the limited number of trials allowing patients to reduce their medication use impeded our ability to assess remission of diabetes when defined as HbA below 6.5% without diabetes medication. Only 7/23 (30%) of eligible trials permitted reduction of medication and reported usable medication data. Future trials should allow for, and adequately report on, reduction of medication while closely monitoring blood glucose concentrations. LCDs seem to promote important reductions in HbA, potentially increasing risk for hypoglycemic episodes, including severe syncope, if the dosage of diabetes medications is not adjusted accordingly. Because blinding is not possible in these studies, these adjustments should be applied using a priori algorithms that help to guide medication management. Reductions in medication may blunt the effect on mean HbA levels, biasing results towards the null and masking any effect; however, any improvement can still be captured if reduction of medication is included as an outcome of interest. Moderate to low certainty evidence suggests that patients adhering to LCDs for six months may experience greater rates of remission of diabetes without adverse consequences compared with other diets commonly recommended for management of type 2 diabetes (for example, low fat diets). These benefits diminished at 12 months, and, although LCDs seem to improve triglycerides in a clinically meaningful way, some evidence shows clinical worsening of quality of life and low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Considering this and a recent systematic review of cohort studies suggesting that long term LCDs are associated with increased mortality, clinicians might consider short term LCDs for management of type 2 diabetes, while actively monitoring and adjusting diabetes medication as needed. Previous systematic reviews have used broad definitions of low carbohydrate (eg, <45% of calories from carbohydrates) and have not systematically assessed remission of diabetes Results from reviews based on a subgroup of 10 randomized trials assessing low carbohydrate diets (LCDs) (<26-45% of daily calories from carbohydrate) have been encouraging This systematic review of the effect of LCDs on remission of type 2 diabetes included 23 trials, including unpublished HbA and medication use data from five trials Compared with (mostly low fat) control diets, on the basis of moderate certainty evidence at six months, LCDs were associated with a large (32%) increase in remission of diabetes According to a priori determined minimal important difference estimates, large and clinically important improvements in weight loss, triglycerides, and insulin resistance were also seen, without adverse events We thank Pamela Dyson for sharing unpublished data and Paria Tajallipour for her assistance with our literature search.

f3b8663a-eb8a-4ffb-9dc0-cffd904e1ee7,"— For the first time ever, the JDRF has a new Chief Executive Officer who lives with type 1 diabetes himself and has been an instrumental leader within the organization for more than a decade. taking over for D-Dad Derek Rapp, who that he would be stepping down. This is big news and a huge win for all of us in the D-Community, Folks! Not only because Aaron is “one of us” in the pancreatically-challenged tribe, but also because he’s highly respected among the patient and healthcare communities, med-tech industry, and regulatory and policy spaces. He’s seen as a powerful advocate and “game-changer” who brings a personal D-connection and passion to everything he does. Diagnosed at age 13 in 1984, Aaron was the second in his family to be diagnosed, after his younger brother Steve had been diagnosed several years earlier at age 3. Notably, this means that the country’s two biggest diabetes orgs — the JDRF and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) – now have PWDs (people with diabetes) at the helm, as the appointed last year is the first to live with type 2 diabetes herself. “I’m humbled to lead the JDRF, the organization that’s played such a key role in so many of the major T1D advances in recent history and that my brother and I have seen throughout our lives,” the 47-year-old told in his first phone interview following the April 9 announcement. In that interview, Aaron shared his vision on a number of fronts: , and why his personal T1D connection matters so much the in his 15 years there his aim to help the adult T1D community feel more represented in what the JDRF does his POV on development the and the open-source movement JDRF’s policy advocacy re: access, affordability, and better outcomes that go beyond just A1C results Aaron is the 6th person to hold the CEO role (and the first-ever living with T1D himself!) since it was established as the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) in 1970. He’ll now be overseeing an organization with a $208 million-dollar budget, and roughly 700 staff members in more than 70 chapters across the country — not to mention the countless volunteers who work with the org regularly. He’ll also join the JDRF’s Board of Directors as well as the , a venture philanthropic fund aimed at speeding up type 1 diabetes research and getting new tools to market. Aaron has been with the JDRF in 2004, when he began his career there as a Scientific Program Manager (based on his doctorate in microbiology and molecular genetics from Rutgers University) with a focus on complications, and hypoglycemia research. Soon after, he became Head of Metabolic Control, and eventually moved up the ranks to Director of Strategic Research a decade ago, before eventually being named the JDRF’s first Chief Mission Officer in 2014 where he became the org’s leading T1D research voice. Notably, he was an early advocate of CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) technology and closed loop systems, and in 2006 helped create the along with former CEO and D-Dad Jeffrey Brewer (who was Rapp’s predecessor and has since gone on to co-found automated insulin delivery startup ). Over the years, Aaron has had a pivotal role in pushing for advanced technology, open-source protocols and efforts to move beyond A1C outcomes in clinical research, more efficient regulatory reviews and improved policy-making. Recently Aaron’s been making appearances on Capitol Hill, testifying before a Congressional committee about skyrocketing insulin prices. That’s of course tied in with JDRF’s work advocating on this issue, including its focused on the payor (insurance) side of things. In fact, Aaron has been a policy leader for many years talking to Congress, the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) department and the FDA, as well as numerous other national and global authorities. Besides his impressive resume, Aaron also serves as an inspiration in his personal life with T1D: he’s an avid runner, who’s completed 18 marathons (including a Boston Marathon qualifying time), one 50K trail marathon, and numerous shorter races. He also loves to play golf and ice hockey and does so as regularly as possible, we’re told. Those in the community say he’s uniquely fit to lead JDRF, as he understands the needs and potential of T1D research and advocacy “like almost no one else.” Now, without further ado, here’s our recent full interview with Aaron on this new CEO role… DM) Congrats, Aaron! First, can you tell us why you wanted to take on this new role? AK) Ultimately, I felt it came down to my experience through JDRF and working on the inside, seeing the potential and real impacts we’re making, but knowing we could do more. That’s really why I threw my name into the hat. There are a lot of people on the sidelines who don’t know what we do, or have the resources… so bringing that T1D lens myself, that science and family member and other roles I’ve had, was something I thought JDRF could benefit from. I went through a process the Board of Directors put in place and it was helpful to think more about the value proposition I could bring to the table. It wasn’t just handed to me, and it made this a credible process, and I’m so excited they chose me! Is it really so significant to have someone living with T1D in the head role, compared to a parent perspective as JDRF has had before? Of course, JDRF was built by parents and that’s amazing. I look over at a picture of my parents with my sister and I doing a New York City walk, and know how much they did for us to help my brother and I be healthy and successful with diabetes. They moved mountains. That said, from my perspective, the individual with T1D has different experiences. We live it in everything we do. I can click on my phone app to check my blood sugars right now after this crazy day, and tell you… well, it was 280 and now it’s 190 and dropping rapidly (after a correction dose that may have been too much). I am living the highs and the lows, literally… the grind, the exhaustion, and that will help determining if JDRF does something that will be impactful in our lives. Overall, you have to appreciate people’s experiences and be a good listener. I’ve done that over the years, and now as CEO I’m sensitive to what the Diabetes Community is looking for from JDRF and will try to make sure we’re meeting their needs. What do you see as the keys to keeping people with T1D motivated to live well? Of course, everyone’s experiences are different. And it’s always changing. My motivation when starting out in science was usually my brother, because he had such trouble managing with hypo unawareness. But that’s evolved, and today my motivations are a lot more about my own kids, my siblings’ kids, my brother, my own mortality to make sure I’m here, and all the different parts of the community through the people I’ve met over the years all over the world. That all translates to what we say at JDRF about representing all ages and all stages. People with diabetes evolve into different stages through their lives, and what I bring to the table is a pretty good perspective on a lot of those stages. Many count on JDRF and the Diabetes Community to help their loved ones. Think back on how far we’ve come since you started at JDRF: what’s the most striking change to you? I vividly remember going to a meeting early on where diabetes devices were being investigated in the pediatric population. At that time, I met legends in diabetes – Drs. Bill Tamborlane, Bruce Buckingham, Peter Chase, Roy Beck, and more – and saw the Abbott Navigator CGM for the first time. Before then, I had no idea that would happen didn’t even know CGMs existed because I was in the metabolic science arena. And I was blown away that one of them was just around the corner. That really changed my perspective, and catalyzed with Jeffrey Brewer and the Artificial Pancreas Project a couple years later. Fast forward to now: I was just at a recent summit with 300 people with diabetes in the room and heard people say, “I don’t poke my finger anymore. I wake up at a normal number. I can see my blood sugars when I’m out with friends.” That’s really a great part of my job in being able to hear that. I will start with adults with type 1 diabetes. If you look at the stats on PWDs with T1D, more than 85% are adults. Yet, we don’t have as many involved and pushing as hard as say parents do. I think we can do more. If we had more actively involved adult T1s pitching in, we would be moving faster on all fronts – research, advocacy, awareness, funding, federal policy and global issues. And that area of global T1D efforts is another one where I think we at JDRF can do more. One common concern about JDRF is finding the right balance between prioritizing cure research and developing new treatments or tools. How will you address that? I hear that often. One person recently asked me: “What’s the hardest part of your job?” I responded that it comes back to that life stages and priorities point. Depending on where you fall in that T1 stage of life, it can vary quite a bit. Some people emphasize we need to push harder on diabetes complications. Others want us to push harder on cures, or on prevention, or access issues, or psychosocial aspects of living with diabetes. What it adds up to is how we go about doing what we do. When we fund anything, we need to figure out the proper balance and best opportunities for impact. We’re one of the biggest funders of T1D research in the world, along with other organizations and NIH and companies. We have to look at how we all fit together. That’s a long-winded way of saying it’s a balance that we constantly arm wrestle over, hash out and argue about (positively, I think). Personally, you’ll hear me say– and what will be reflected in our funding in the coming years – is that I do believe we need to make a better push for type 1 diabetes cures, plural. Right now, about two-thirds of our budget is going toward cures research. That means for people like us who are living with T1 for a long time, for kids who are auto-body positive, and so on. The other third is for treatments, like devices and drugs and psychosocial aspects. All that being said, we are absolutely in a different place from where we were when you and I were diagnosed (in 1984). While some are frustrated that we’ve been over-promised and under-delivered, and we can haggle about why all that is… we are so much further than we have ever been. I firmly believe that and are going to deliver at some point. I never put timeframes because we just don’t and can’t know when that may be. But we’re at a point now where these are moving into human trials, and the science is absolutely light-years ahead of where we’ve been – even from 10 years ago. And that doesn’t mean you’ll stop funding technology? Ultimately, the reason JDRF was formed was to try to deliver a cure. That’s what the original founding moms wanted and many of our volunteers want. And I’m excited that our science teams will be pushing hard on scientific cures for diabetes. Meanwhile, I do think we have great momentum in the community on tech and closed loops, and we’ll continue to fund that because we do have gaps. We need smaller device options and more automated systems. So yes, we will continue to fund that. JDRF has also been pushing hard in recent years on open-protocols and bringing the homemade Do-It-Yourself technology to the forefront. Can you talk more about that? We’re making great progress there. We have the and we’ve funded with the Helmsley Charitable Trust, now a $9 million grant there. The expectation of that is to deliver an incredible update to Loop, which has been a DIY project but will take this into official, regulated FDA territory for commercial release on the market. That may be in late 2019 or early 2020. And what’s amazing to me is that we’re seeing the diabetes industry opening up to the possibility of #WeAreNotWaiting, with Roche, Insulet and smaller companies saying they’re open to it. We are talking to everyone about making this happen, and that’s a paradigm shift for the industry that’s been years in the making. This isn’t JDRF alone, as there have been so many people in the community who’ve been a part of all of this. But I remember coming back to the JDRF offices after a diabetes event a couple years ago and saying to the team, “I think we need to get behind this and figure out how we can bring this above the table.” And that was, in large part, driven by my own personal experiences with this tech. Because you’ve also been using a DIY closed loop system, correct? Yes, I’ve been Looping now for about 2.5 years, and the day before Thanksgiving will be three years. That’s about how long my brother has been Looping, too. That’s another lens for me to bring to JDRF — that value proposition of having this community driving change and helping, and having JDRF then synergize and help out as well, is an ideal example of the community driving solutions and everyone playing an important role. Of course. Our device work at JDRF is amazing and I’m incredibly proud of what we have done over these past 15 years, and going back to insulin pumps and CGM development and moving us down the path toward closed loop technology. It’s all better. But I appreciate that not everyone wants to wear devices. Here I sit at the helm of JDRF on Day 1, and I know we need to modify the disease of type 1 diabetes. In our scientific parlance, we say “disease modifying therapies.” We need to change the course, to eventually get off devices and normalize blood sugars – like the shows can be done. That’s the goal. Where are we on the that JDRF has supported, pushing to look at time-in-range and other constructs for measuring diabetes outcomes? A lot of great momentum is happening there. In fact, we were on the phone with a big payer today talking about the cost of hypoglycemia and how their coverage is a part of addressing that. Of course, reducing hypoglycemia is the obvious #BeyondA1C outcome. But as part of that discussion, I was talking about time-in-range and access issues as well. That coincides with the consensus in defining ranges. And when JDRF funds projects now, we’re requiring people to report out so we can compare results. That also involves discussions with both FDA and payers. So there’s considerable action, and it’s not just talk. It’s incorporating these consensus documents on outcomes into health policy design. That makes it real for people. We do need to do better when we go to DC to Congress, whether it’s arguing for more federal funding on research or regulatory policies that appreciate outcomes… it’s about having the data in our back pocket to say these results are clinically significant, everyone agrees, and you need to incorporate these into your policies. That’s especially important. Speaking of payers and access… is JDRF doing enough? We’re fully aligned with advocates who want , and we’re looking at every opportunity to highlight that people with diabetes need affordable insulin. It shouldn’t be a choice between paying their mortgage payment or groceries, and rationing insulin. The old insulins are not the solution. I thought coming out of the (April 2) hearing before the Congressional subcommittee, that we’re all on the same page for that. How we get there is something we may disagree about and fight on a number of fronts, but JDRF is in the fight. From my perspective, this isn’t just insulin either. People with diabetes should have access to whatever they and their doctors believe will help them achieve the best outcomes. So having insurance plans switch insulins or pumps on you, that so-called , is unacceptable. This is why we’ve prioritized health policy in addition to what we do on cures research. If you can’t afford or access your best treatment options, and won’t make it to the point of getting to any cure, we haven’t achieved our goals at JDRF. And this goes beyond just impacting underserved communities, right? Absolutely. People are just so frustrated at the state of healthcare when you have a chronic disease. I understand, and know why people raise their voices and send passionate emails to me. I get it. Because I’m upset and pissed off too. As I said on The Hill, my brother switched jobs just to get insulin at a reasonable price. It’s nuts and none of this should be happening. I wish I could just snap my fingers and fix this. But it doesn’t work that way, and we’re doing everything we can at JDRF to help move that needle as quickly as possible. How does JDRF balance its advocacy with Pharma and Industry relationships and sponsors? JDRF is governed by people who have a personal connection to type 1 diabetes, so our number one priority is working to achieve the best outcomes. Of course, we work with Lilly and Novo and Medtronic and all these companies because they’re delivering these treatments and technologies. And we know we need better tools. That said, we must ensure that they’re accessible. Having a great solution that’s inaccessible means we haven’t met our goal. We are very transparent with any company we work with – we want them to be successful and deliver solutions for people with diabetes, but they have to be affordable and accessible. Thank you, Aaron – and huge congrats again on your new role. We agree that you’re a perfect fit and are eager to see what comes next for JDRF with you leading the way! {You can find Aaron on Twitter at , often posting about exercise and diabetes and how all people with T1D can live their lives without limits.} — I Tried It: Tandem’s New Control-IQ Automated Diabetes Technology DiabetesMine reviews Tandem Diabetes exciting new Control-IQ system that partially automates insulin delivery.

While obesity reaches near epidemic proportions, the rate of , heart disease and cancer continues to rise. What is the cause? The way we eat. Sadly, today, many Americans choose convenience over health. Fast-food restaurants and convenience foods continue to make up a significant, and unhealthy, proportion of our American diet. As these nine charts show, Americans are not getting enough essential nutrients, fiber and natural fats that help our bodies prevent disease. According to the USDA, nearly 1,000 calories a day (out of a 2775 daily calorie diet) is attributed to added fats and sweeteners! () In comparison, dairy, fruits and vegetables only contribute 424 calories. Our priorities for food are simply out of balance. [Original Chart: http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/1188540/food-availability_fig04.png] In fact, 38 percent of adults in the U.S. report consuming fruits than one time daily, and less than 22 percent report eating vegetables daily. While adolescents do fare better in the vegetable category, this may be attributable to unhealthy fried vegetables (i.e. French fries) and other processed vegetables available at school. Oregon and California stand ahead of the rest of the country; adults in these states eat vegetables 1.8 or more times per day. Meanwhile, adults in five states report eating vegetables less than 1.5 times per day. Chart 2: 45 Percent Increase in Grain Consumption  As of 2000, Americans were consuming nearly 200 pounds of grain per year, the vast majority from wheat flour. It’s important to note that while we are consuming considerable more wheat, we must take into account that it isn’t the same wheat we once ate. Today, according to the Journal of Trace Elements in Medicine and Biology, the mineral density of wheat has dramatically declined in the last 20 years. The wheat of today has nearly 30 percent less minerals. Why is the wheat we eat today less nutritious than before? Because of . Researchers believe that the significant increase in number of individuals with celiac disease and gluten intolerance is a result of nutritionally bankrupt wheat, as well as the dramatic increase in its consumption. In addition to wheat, our diets high in other grains put us at risk for . Phytic acid — naturally found in nuts, seeds, legumes and grain, and added to many commercially available breads and whole grain products — can affect absorption of magnesium, calcium and zinc. Phytic acid is considered an “anti-nutrient.” Phytic acid can interfere with the absorption of nutrients by binding minerals together in the digestive tract, making them less available for absorption. There is also evidence that suggests that it can inhibit certain enzymes in our digestive system, leading to digestive upset. (Tannenbaum and others. Vitamins and Minerals, in , 2nd edition. OR Fennema, ed. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1985, p 445). In addition, a study found that phytic acid that is added to bread actually inhibits magnesium absorption (). Today, nearly 80 percent of Americans are , leading to leg cramps, insomnia, fibromyalgia, high blood pressure and osteoporosis. An additional study found that phytic acid also inhibits the absorption of zinc and calcium resulting in loss of bone density, loose teeth and tooth decay. () According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 48.5 percent of Americans have used at least one prescription drug in the past 30 days, and 21.7 percent have used three or more prescription drugs. () The most frequently prescribed drugs are analgesics, anti-hyperlipidemic agents, antidepressants and anti-diabetic medications. Most of the conditions that require these most popular prescription medications can be linked to unhealthy lifestyles and a poor diet. Anti-hyperlipidemic agents reduce lipid levels in the blood, lowering cholesterol and triglycerides. They may also promote healthy HDL balances. However, in most cases, you can naturally, and fast. Antidepressants include MAOIs, TCAs, SSRIs and other drugs that reduce the symptoms of depressive disorders. However, many of these drugs have frightening side effects, including increased depression, fatigue, anxiety, and a heightened risk for suicide or suicidal thoughts. Depression is at near epidemic proportions throughout the U.S., in fact, the World Health Organization has identified depression as the No. 1 cause of disability in America. Research has shown that a typical western diet rich in unhealthy fats, refined sugars, processed foods and genetically modified foods may increase the risk of depression. There are , including a diet rich in lean protein, wild fish, vegetables, seeds and saturated fats. Anti-diabetic medications work to lower glucose produced by the liver, stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin, break down GLP-1, encourage the reabsorption of glucose in the kidney, and lower blood glucose levels by literally blocking the breakdown of starches. Finding the right drug to control blood glucose levels can be a challenge for many diabetics, and these drugs are not without side effects. However, there are natural remedies to help stabilize blood glucose levels and actually help . Prescription analgesics are used to alleviate pain — included in this designation are narcotic-based painkillers. Many addiction experts, law enforcement and health professionals believe the dramatic increase in narcotic pain medications has led to the near epidemic of heroin addiction. Pain medications, especially narcotics, are addictive. Today, chronic pain is a real problem throughout the U.S. Individuals battling joint pain, , arthritis, back pain and more seek powerful prescription medications to help ease the suffering. However, it’s important to mention the link between inflammation, pain and our diets. Our unhealthy diets — full of gluten, pasteurized dairy, trans-fats, foods high in omega-6 fatty acids, corn, soy, and processed foods loaded with unhealthy fats, and added sugars — are at the root of many of today’s medical conditions, including pain and . Leafy green vegetables, squash, root vegetables, asparagus, artichokes, and others provide essential nutrients for our bodies. I strongly support to boost health. Juicing fruits and vegetables helps to make them easier to digest and absorb into your system. Vitamin C, vitamin E, essential B vitamins and a whole host of minerals crucial to good health are easily incorporated into your diet. http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/downloads/State-Indicator-Report-Fruits-Vegetables-2013.pdf Combining vegetables allows you to increase the intake of essential nutrients, helping to aid in digestion, improve energy, lose stubborn weight, strengthen your immune system, and lessen your risks for developing chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. In the last 65 years, not only has the amount of sugar we eat dramatically increased, the source of the sugar has radically changed. In the 1950s, the majority of the sugar consumed by Americans was from cane and beet sugar.  Stephan Guyenet and Jeremy Landen, http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com  In 2000, according to the USDA, each individual in the U.S. consumed over 150 pounds of sugar. Over half of that came from corn. Just because is made from corn, of course, doesn’t mean that it is a healthy sweetener. Over the last hundred years, our taste buds have changed; today everything needs to be super-sweet, even foods we don’t tend to think as sweet. Traditional wheat-based breads, for example, contain sugar. While sugar is important for fermentation and getting yeast to activate, the next time you reach for a loaf of “honey whole wheat,” check the label; it may surprise you. Each slice has three grams of sugar, sourced from both honey and refined sugar. My favorite natural sweeteners include, coconut sugar, dates and stevia leaf. It’s important to use even natural sweeteners, in moderation. The challenge comes when eating processed foods. Unfortunately, food manufacturers do have to separate added sugar from naturally occurring sugar in foods. Most foods have some levels of natural sugar, and in balance, they are healthy for you. Food labels only have to disclose the total sugars per serving and don’t break down added sugars from naturally occurring sugars. Added sugars come in many forms, so look for labels that include: Today, more than 1 in 3 adults in the United States have “pre-diabetes.” This is when blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not quite high enough to be considered type 2 diabetes. In addition, today nearly 30 million Americans have diabetes, and 1 in 4 of them don’t even know it. Complications from diabetes include skin infections, glaucoma, cataracts, neuropathy, foot ulcers and calluses, poor circulation, ketoacidosis, high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease, and more. Some of these complications are serious, and some can be fatal. I encourage a healthy lifestyle and diet to help prevent and treat. Chart 6: Increase in Hydrogenated Oils and Decrease in Saturated Fat In 2000, the latest data available, Americans ate nearly 75 pounds of added fats and oils. This number is estimated to be even higher today. The interesting part of this chart is that while “healthy” fats have decreased, the amount of unhealthy fats has increased. In the 1950s, butter, lard and tallow represented nearly 20 pounds per person while today it accounts for just 14 pounds. This is in contrast to processed shortening and margarine, which is today consumed at a rate of over 32 pounds per year, per adult. () Steve Guyenet (Harvard Law)”The American Diet” 2012 [TED Talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC20OoIgG_Y] goes against everything we’ve been told since the mid-1970s. Saturated fats do cause heart disease or cancer. Yes, you read that right. While elevated triglycerides are linked to an increased risk for developing heart disease, these don’t come directly from dietary fat. They are actually produced in the liver from excess sugar. In truth, healthy saturated fats hold many benefits for our bodies. They support cell health and bone health, protect the liver from toxins, strengthen the immune system, and are necessary for the absorption of essential fatty acids. My fats of choice include ghee, , avocado oil, olive oil and others on my . Unhealthy fats include canola oil, soybean oil, peanut oil, margarine, shortening and lard. That sharply inclining blue line? That is mostly made up of hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated oils, such as vegetable oils like corn, peanut, soybean and canola. , which several of these oils are, have the additional health detriments as other genetically modified foods. In the chart above, notice how the consumption of lard and butter has decreased, and then remember that we are now facing more heart disease and obesity in this country than ever before. We’ve essentially swapped healthy oils and fats for unhealthy oils and fats, leading to the increase in diabetes and heart disease. By the way, do you know where canola oil comes from? It’s made from genetically modified rapeseed. Manufacturers knew that rapeseed oil wouldn’t look great on a label, so they changed the name to LEAR (Low Erucic Acid Rapeseed) and then to Canadian Oil, and finally settled on the shortened version: canola oil. Read more about why I believe you should . Chart 7: Processed Foods Make Up 63 Percent of Calories This chart shows that 63 percent of calories Americans are consuming today are coming from processed foods. Convenience foods are packed with preservatives, added oils, sugars and refined grains — none of which is healthy for the body, as these foods definitely do more harm than good. http://www.nyu.edu/sustainability/pdf/NYCHSF_FoodGraph2.pdf Sadly, plant-based foods are only making up 12 percent of calories consumed in the U.S. today. The statement at the top right of this graph is misleading, but nonetheless shows that even organizations that are trying to get us to eat healthier often miss the overall picture. I encourage the use of healthy fats, including ghee and coconut oil, because of their overwhelming health benefits. Once considered an unhealthy fat, coconut oil is actually packed with nutrients, and it contains anti-microbial and anti-fungal properties. Read more why I believe you should add coconut oil to your diet in my article the . are literally everywhere in our grocery stores — in raw foods, oils, processed foods and more. Contrary to what Monsanto tells the public, this genetic modification does harm the food quality and nutrition, and puts other crops at risk of contamination. To make matters worse, the Food and Drug Administration does not require that genetically modified foods to be labeled as such. The chart above shows the density of GMOs in common foods. http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2013/02/gmo-farming-crops-more-popular-than-ever-world-charts Over 60 countries currently regulate, or ban GMOs, and in this regard, the U.S. desperately lags behind. Genetic modification started under the guise to increase yields, make crops more drought- and disease-tolerant, and enhance nutrition. While GMOs may increase yields and create more uniform fruits and vegetables, nutrition values and taste dramatically decreased. In fact, the next time you see an organic “heirloom” tomato in the market, and you dismiss it because it’s shaped funny or not bright red, buy one, and just try it. That is the way a tomato is supposed to taste! Here are percentages of the most common GMO foods today: According to the Institute for Responsible Technology, genetically modified soy and corn may be at the root of . The question that inevitable comes to mind, since neither soy nor corn have gluten, is  The answer from IRT’s Jeffrey M. Smith is the components in GMO soy, corn, canola, sugar beets, summer squash, Hawaiian papaya and alfalfa are linked to five conditions that may either initiate or exacerbate gluten-related disorders Chart 9: Americans Consume 3,400 Milligrams of Sodium per Day According to this graph from the CDC, Americans over the age of two are averaging over 3,400 milligrams of sodium each day — that is more than double the recommended level and nearly seven times what our bodies actually need. Sodium does help our bodies function, but in reality the vast majority of us need less than 500 milligrams per day. http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/health/blog/nutrition/2012/09/eat_to_beat_high_blood_pressur.html  Just like our taste for sweet foods have increased, so has our taste for salt. While the salt shaker sitting on your table doesn’t help matters, it’s only responsible for approximately 25 percent of our sodium intake. The other 75 percent comes from processed foods and restaurants. Just one cup of potato chips has over 160 milligrams of sodium. But who eats just one measured cup of potato chips? Meanwhile, the popular canned chicken noodle soup has nearly 900 milligrams of sodium, in just half a cup. According to the FDA food labeling requirements, to be considered “low sodium” foods must contain 140 milligrams of sodium or less per serving. Be mindful when you choose the “25% less sodium” option, it probably still contains far more sodium than you need. Too much sodium contributes to high blood pressure, increasing the risk of stroke and heart attacks. Today, heart disease and stroke are the first and third leading causes of death in the U.S. () The good news is that when salt intake is reduced, blood pressured begins to decrease, within weeks. () Over 40 Percent of Sodium Intake Comes from These Foods () Snack products, including chips, pretzels and popcorn The healthy alternative is sea salt, or Himalayan salt. Salt makes foods more enjoyable, but table salt is highly processed and have been lost. Some natural salts — including Himalayan salt and Celtic sea salt — actually support good health. They help to prevent muscle cramps, regulate water content in the body, regulate blood pressure and alkalize the body. Type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, obesity, digestive disorders, fatigue, chronic pain and hormonal imbalances plague adults and children alike. Many of these conditions can be prevented, and even reversed with healthy eating and lifestyle changes. Transition to a healthy eating plan doesn’t have to be difficult.

What Is Your ""Style"" For Dealing With Conflict At Work? Why College Prestige Matters and Why It Shouldn't Courage to Think the Unthinkable: The Pandemic Might Get Worse Seeking Empathy for People You Don’t Understand Reduce ADHD Symptoms Naturally With These Five Steps Five drug-free ways to treat attention deficit disorder. By Krysteena Stephens, M.A., IMFT and Victoria Dunckley, M.D. Typically, in both children and adults, treatment for ADD/ADHD involves the use of psychotropic designed to reduce the inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and impulsive behavior that are characteristic of the disorder. These medications work by , which governs (“getting things done”), working (storing and manipulating information in “the mind’s eye”), social behavior, and emotional control. While stimulants and other ADHD medications have been shown to improve these symptoms—particularly in the short term—many patients (and parents of patients) seek natural treatments either to augment or to reduce/replace medical treatments. Here are five evidence-based natural methods you can implement to improve brain blood flow, reduce inflammation, and support healthy brain chemistry. It is well known that regular, moderate exercise can help improve mood, regulate sleep, and increase energy. However, more recent studies are also finding that exercise improves a whole host of neurological processes associated with , memory, and behavior. One study from 2013 in the reported that children with ADHD who performed a quick, 20-minute bout of moderate aerobic exercise showed improvements in reading, arithmetic, and impulse control directly following exercise compared to a 20-minute reading session.[*] Exercise is also known to strengthen very specific parts of the brain such as the hippocampus, an area associated with memory and learning. In one brain imaging study, the hippocampus was actually in children who were considered “higher-fit.” So not only does exercise make us feel and look great, but it literally makes us smarter.   Take your vitamins (and minerals). Vitamins that are also antioxidants (such as vitamins A, C, and E) lower inflammation, protect fatty cell membranes, and support many cellular metabolic processes in the brain, and thus may indirectly improve and behavior symptoms in ADHD. Adequate stores of B vitamins are also required for numerous nervous system functions, and optimal amounts are thought to support a sense of well-being. But generally speaking, the research regarding direct beneficial effect on ADHD is more robust for minerals. In a double-blind, -controlled study monitoring the effects of zinc plus (, a common stimulant), parents and teachers were asked to monitor and scale the behaviors of 44 children diagnosed with ADHD and found that both parent and teacher ratings improved over a six-week period for the children taking 15mg of zinc per day along with methylphenidate while the control group’s (methylphenidate alone) ratings did not. This makes sense, as the mineral zinc is crucial for the proper functioning of the brain chemical and norepinephrine (involved in attention and memory), as well as GABA, a calming neurotransmitter. Regarding , lower —as opposed to iron blood —are correlated with more severe ADHD symptoms, and iron deficiency is common in ADHD-diagnosed individuals.  suggests that children with ADHD with low (a measure of iron stores) may benefit from iron supplementation. Consuming iron-rich foods like spinach, chicken, oysters, and turkey on a regular basis will help boost iron stores; iron supplementation should be implemented under doctor supervision since too much can cause constipation and/or be toxic.[†] is another mineral found to be low in children with ADHD, and supplementation has been shown to . Magnesium also promotes deeper sleep, muscle relaxation, and normal electrical signaling. Daily supplementation of may be another natural remedy helpful in the treatment of ADHD symptoms as demonstrated in a study of children whose symptoms decreased over a 12-week period when supplementing with fatty acids. In general, aside from eating a clean with abundant organic fruits and veggies, taking a pharmaceutical-grade multivitamin with chelated minerals along with high-grade supplement may improve both cognitive and behavior symptoms directly and indirectly, especially over time. Appropriate blood tests may include a ferritin level for iron, red blood cell magnesium levels, and serum or red blood cell zinc levels to help assess whether additional supplementation is needed; blood tests are not always definitive, however, and should be used in conjunction with clinical information.   indicates that ADHD symptoms are caused by an imbalance in the catecholaminergic systems in the brain areas that control memory, motor functioning, and . The two most abundant catecholamines in the brain are the neurotransmitters and , and both are derived from the amino acid . (Amino acids are precursor elements (building blocks) of neurotransmitters, are themselves derived from proteins, and are involved in nearly every biochemical process that the body needs to grow and thrive.) Eating a high-protein diet could theoretically enhance and regulate neurotransmitter systems in the brain while assisting in keeping ADHD symptoms at bay. In fact, studies show that boosts cognition and academic performance, and that boosts levels of available in the brain, keeping the individual alert and attentive. Although many alternative or integrative practitioners recommend specific amino acids or blends for ADHD, there is little direct evidence to support their use at this time.   Excessive sugar intake activates the same pathways in the brain that are involved in drug , and may act on the same systems that trigger . Reports by regarding their beliefs about sugar consumption typically highlight the increase in behavioral issues for symptomatic normative children. Refined sugar also induces erratic blood sugar levels, and both low and high sugar levels may affect cognition. Aside from the usual culprits including soda, candy, and cookies, watch out for chips, crackers, and other processed or packaged foods. Canned foods and condiments, especially ketchup, tend to have very high sugar levels as well.   Take a screen break. Last year the released updated “screen-time” guidelines that included placing limitations on for adolescents and teens to two hours or less per day as well as out screen use for children under 2 years of age. Increasingly, researchers are discovering effects of excessive screen usage among children and adolescents, including inattentiveness, , and antisocial or oppositional behaviors. A longitudinal study performed in the tracked nearly 4,000 preschool-aged children who watched television for per day and noticed not only an increase in negative behaviors for children who were already considered problematic, but also an emergence of behavioral issues from children who were said to have behavioral issues prior to the study. Screens also contribute to additional ADHD-like symptoms such as issues with memory and learning as reported by who tracked children’s cognitive performance following a bout of computer gaming. The findings suggest that gaming may impact not only sleep quality but also lead to significant declines in verbal memory. Consistently, research has shown that screen-time in the evening (or worse, just before bedtime or after lights-out) contributes to sleep issues. Furthermore, light from any screen device suppresses melatonin and impairs cognition, so it’s not just stimulating content or activity that does the trick. Clearly, the alarming rise of screen usage in recent years is affecting our children and their developing brains. Abiding by healthy screen time guidelines will assist in putting a halt to the increase in screen-time and its associated behavioral issues, but ADHD children may need a three- to four-week to help reset circadian rhythms and brain chemistry. We’re all affected by the so-called modern lifestyle, but kids and adults with ADHD seem to be more affected, perhaps because their brains are more sensitive, or perhaps because they simply have more energy to burn. If there’s an overlying message here, it’s to return to Mother Nature: think how our ancestors lived, and try to imitate it as closely as possible. They moved to hunt, grow, gather and pick their food; they were active during daylight hours and rested at night; and they were not exposed to artificial light, artificial foods, or artificial play. Mother Nature cannot be fooled!

[†] In the aforementioned study, the children took 80mg of iron daily for 12 weeks in the form of ferrous sulfate. Submitted by Anonymous on November 16, 2014 - 11:54pm I am 26 year old male that has been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. I was diagnosed at age 8 and have been prescribed just about any medication you can think of between then and now. I am also an aspiring, and beginning, psychology student. Studying this subject has helped make more sense of my ADD. I have, in the past year or so, started taking some of the various supplements listed in this article. Ferrous sulfate, magnesium, fish oil. And I did notice a difference in my behavior and attention span. In addition, I felt less lethargic and more physically healthy when i coupled these with even more exercise. the supplements, more or less, took the place of the medication for me. I only use the medication when studying or just if I need to concentrate more. The past section our class has studied touched on ADD and ADHD. More of the learning and intelligence aspects, though. I feel that using less drug prescriptions and more natural treatments would definitely benefit children with these disorders in the long run. Submitted by Victoria L.

Submitted by Anonymous on November 17, 2014 - 12:49am Excellent, thank you. I think that more emphasis could be placed on sleep, however. Doesn't sufficient, good quality sleep merit a heading of its own? Submitted by Victoria L. Dunckley M.D. on November 18, 2014 - 8:39pm You're absolutely right! It was meant to tie in with the screen-time issue. I wrote more about the link between ADHD, sleep and the circadian rhythm story in another post: http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mental-wealth/201303/resyncing-the-bodyclock-treat-adhd And yet we don't say that epileptics should all go drug-free? Submitted by Anonymous on November 19, 2014 - 12:31am Should we start shaming Parkinson's patients next, because they have the audacity to take medications? How about the epileptics? I know! Lets go after those desperate souls with early-stage Alzheimers! Yeah, how DARE they all take medications to control their neurological conditions! Medications are bad! Down with science! Vaccines are a hoax! Don't wash your hands, cause soapmakers are in league with ""Big Pharma""! Booooo! Down wiyh science! Submitted by Krysteena Stephens on November 21, 2014 - 12:49pm I understand your stance given title of this post. However if you notice in the text, these recommendations are intended for those who prefer to seek natural treatments before resorting to pharmaceuticals or IN ADDDITION TO taking pharmaceuticals. Many diagnosed individuals see a great reduction in ADD/ADHD symptoms by only taking prescriptions such as methylphenidate, though many individuals still experience symptoms that interfere with daily living and search for alternative means to assist or enhance their medication--hence the reason more research is evolving on ""complimentary"" or natural treatments for mental and physical health issues. The ideas listed are recommendations backed by scientific research. If a suggestion does not contain significant scientific support, we say so. Yet for those taking medication and still struggling with symptoms, incorporating a few healthy life changes such as eating well and exercising would assuredly not lead to a worse outcome, whether or not these changes result in a significant difference in symptom reduction. The take-home message from this post lies in the appreciation for the complexity of the brain and body, the uniqueness of each diagnosed persons symptomatology, and the idea that there is no ""blanket treatment"" for any diagnosis. Submitted by Anonymous on November 21, 2014 - 3:41pm Nowhere in the article was it mentioned that medications are bad for you or that you shouldn't use meds at all for any reason. But I agree with this article that medications are NOT magic cure-alls. Many doctors get paid by pharmaceuticals for prescribing meds, and sometimes (note SOMETIMES) those meds are unnecessary. My husband has Ulcerative Colitis, which leads to painful digestion, and severe diarrhea. We switched healthcare, and his medicine went from $10 a month to about $380 a month. We could not afford it. We discovered through research that his meds were a bandaid, not even a treatment (there is no cure) for UC. We began to look at natural alternatives, and one method that stuck out was fennel. Put some seeds in boiling water to make a tea, drink 2x a day. 6 months later, my husband has not taken a single pill, and has had no symptoms. His stupid doctor never told him that there were natural alternatives. Before you rant, maybe you should do research. Hint, use LiveStrong website, they have a lot of good information.

Submitted by nicole schram on June 7, 2020 - 2:58am I had my first outbreak of Herpes virus nearly 4 years ago. Of all the horridness, the pain and itching were unbearable. I literally freaked out as my general physician said that it had no cure. The outbreaks were not that frequent initially, but every time I fall sick, it would resurface.

Here: Those who exercise more, possibly take supplements and use other modes, usually find alternatives. Some still take meds with alternatives. Our kids had mild ADD so they tried exercise with “movement.” Dancing, sports, swimming, things like this. These activities helped so much they stopped taking meds. Lastly, they tried meditation, yoga and listening to various types of music. One additional benefit derived from their having many choices of activities, not just the usual teenager activities like gaming or football.

While this type of cured salmon, called gravlax, is usually made with skin-on salmon, this recipe removes the skin and rubs the curing mixture on both sides for better flavor penetration. Ask your fishmonger for a center-cut piece of salmon that's consistently 1 1/2 inches thick for the best results. Green peppercorns are often sold in a brine, but you'll want to seek out dried ones for this recipe. Source: EatingWell Magazine, December 2019 active: 10 mins total: 8 hrs 10 mins Servings: 12 Nutrition Profile: Ingredient Checklist Directions Instructions Checklist Grind cardamom seeds, peppercorns, mustard seeds and caraway seeds in a spice grinder or with a mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in salt and sugar. Place 3 dill sprigs in a dish or container that will hold the salmon snugly. Sprinkle with half of the spice blend and place salmon on top. Pat the remaining spice blend all over the top of the salmon and place the remaining dill on top. Cover tightly and refrigerate for 8 hours. The salmon should be firmer and a deeper shade of orange and some liquid should be pooling in the container. Rinse the salmon under cold water, discarding the dill and any spice blend. Pat dry with paper towels. When ready to serve, slice the salmon thinly across the grain. Tip: Cardamom is a common seasoning used in Nordic cuisine, so it's a no-brainer to add to the curing mixture for this gravlax.

Here's how to tell the difference and help them heal quickly. June 11, 2015 Credit: TY Lim/Shutterstock No one likes a mouth sore -- especially parents when it's their kid who is the one suffering. Knowing how to help your child heal starts by knowing more about the two most common types of mouth sores. Why? Because treatment totally depends on which one she's suffering from. Cold sores are caused by the herpes virus, and canker sores are not, but sometimes they can be difficult to tell apart, explains Alan Greene, MD, FAAP. With herpes sores, even though the first ones can be on the lips or in the mouth, the recurrent ones tend to be only on the lips. So if the recurrent ones also occur inside, on the gums and on the roof of the mouth, then canker sores are generally the problem.  Read on to determine if you have a little one suffering from a cold sore or a canker sore, and learn how to treat it. What is a canker sore? Canker sores, or mouth ulcers, are open sores on the inside of the cheeks, lips, or tongue. Viruses cause some canker sources, most often the chicken pox and the coxsackie viruses, but often the cause is unknown. Most of these sores are not contagious, but sores caused by the herpes virus, called cold sores, which develop on the outside of the mouth around the lips, are very contagious and easily spread. Some people get canker sores after eating certain foods; others get them after using toothpaste with foaming ingredients. Sometimes ulcers appear at the site of minor trauma in the mouth; for example, biting the inside of the cheek or scraping the cheek with a hard piece of food, such as a lollipop. They can occur at any age, although they are more common in older children, adolescents, and adults. When canker sores occur, children complain of pain in the mouth, and one or more sores on the mouth?s mucus membranes are visible. They often have a grey, punched-out center and a white or yellow edge surrounded by redness. The sores bleed easily (when brushing the teeth) and usually last for several days. Occasionally, they may last for one to two weeks before disappearing. Viral infections that cause canker sores may also be accompanied by a fever. Because most canker sores do not have a known cause, they cannot be prevented. If your child seems to get sores in the same spot inside the mouth, the sharp edge of a tooth could be the cause. If this is the case, have your child evaluated by a dentist. For the most part, canker sores are harmless and heal by themselves, but the pain can be severe. In rare cases, small children may refuse to drink and as a result become dehydrated. If your child has a canker sore, ask your doctor about relieving pain with acetaminophen (Children's Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Children's Advil). Your child should also avoid acidic, spicy, or salty foods or drinks, such as orange juice or tomato sauce. Some children experience relief when pressing an ice cube against the sore, and ice pops often help relieve pain and provide necessary fluids. You may need to use an anesthetic ointment or gel for a short period of time. If your child has cold sores caused by the herpes simplex virus, consult a doctor, who will determine whether it is appropriate to prescribe an antiviral medicine. What is a cold sore? Since cold sores are caused by the herpes virus, adults can infect a child with cold sores through direct contact from saliva through kissing. Symptoms of cold sores include a high fever, difficulty swallowing, and general soreness in the mouth. A child may have ulcers on the lips and on the skin around the mouth, and the lymph nodes around the neck will be swollen. Unlike most viruses, the herpes virus stays in a person's body forever, and it gets reactivated throughout life. When this happens, there is a tingling or numb feeling around the mouth, followed by a blister that eventually bursts open and scabs over. Cold sores often reappear when the person has a cold or another infection, has too much exposure to sunlight, has stress, or is menstruating. Parents should always wash their hands well before touching the child. This is especially important with  and children who have problems with their immune systems. If your child does have a cold sore, make sure that he does not rub the sore and then touch his eyes, as this could spread the virus and cause an infection.

Three months ago a friend suggested that I try Dr sikama remedy that's helping people get cured from HSV, COUGHING, HIV&AIDS, GENITAL HERPES, SNEEZING, HEPATITIS B, CANCER e.t.c.

You’ve seen the ads from companies claiming their products can cure diabetes; or maybe you’ve heard people on TV say they reversed their diabetes. Do they? Did they? Can you cure diabetes? Hope Warshaw, RD, CDE September 28, 2018 It's key to understand that type 2 diabetes is a progressive illness often preceded by years of elevated blood glucose (also known as blood sugar) levels high enough to be diagnosed as prediabetes. When most people with type 2 diabetes are finally diagnosed, experts believe they've been on this path for five to 10 years and have lost more than half of their natural insulin-making capability in the beta cells of their pancreas. While you cannot undo your lifestyle habits of the last decade or more, you can take steps to put your diabetes in remission. Don't despair and don't give up. Research shows that losing weight and keeping it off can help delay the onset of prediabetes, delay progression of prediabetes to type 2 diabetes, or slow the progression of type 2. The keys to diabetes prevention and preventing diabetes complications include: Eat healthfully, exercise often, seek out knowledge and support, and create an environment that fosters healthful living. Losing even just a few pounds early on when glucose begins to rise can dramatically improve your blood sugar levels, cholesterol levels, triglycerides, blood pressure, and more. ""People should get to their ideal weight if they have prediabetes or type 2,"" says Robert Huizenga, M.D., associate professor of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles and doctor for , where he is known as Dr. H. ""People should have no excess fat and be athletically fit. Ninety minutes of exercise six days a week and a steady diet of healthy eating is the best prescription to manage type 2 diabetes without medications."" That's easier said than done for most people, who have to adopt a healthier lifestyle outside the bubble of the ranch where is filmed or the jump-start of a stomach-shrinking surgery. Commitment, perseverance, and a positive attitude can help you achieve a healthy weight. Set small, achievable goals first; experience success of meeting those goals; and then add new goals. Over time, all your small successes will add up right before your eyes. Many research studies suggest setting a goal of losing 5-7 percent of your starting weight to lower blood sugar and improve health, with the imperative to keep the pounds off. A decade-plus of research from the National Institutes of Health's Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) studied people at risk for or with prediabetes. The study showed that people who were involved in the intensive-lifestyle group and lost about 7 percent of their initial weight and kept off some of that weight, initiated exercise, and engaged in support delayed the onset of type 2 diabetes by nearly 60 percent at the end of the three-year phase of the study. After 10 years, those in the original intensive-lifestyle group continued to reduce their progression to type 2 diabetes the most -- about 35 percent -- and those in the initial metformin group saw about a 20 percent reduction versus standard care. At the 2014 American Diabetes Association annual meeting, 15-year data from the ongoing follow-up study to the DPP, the DPP Outcomes Study, was revealed. This showed a continued reduction in the onset of type 2 diabetes. The original lifestyle group had a 27 percent greater reduction and the metformin group a 17 percent reduction versus standard care. The conclusions: It appears that losing weight and keeping off as much of it as possible over the years is the main predictor of slowing disease progression. People who lost the most weight had the best chance of preventing type 2. With every 2.2 pounds lost, people reduced the progression to type 2 diabetes by 16 percent. They experienced other benefits, too, including lower blood pressure and improved cholesterol levels, while taking less medication to control them. People who do progress to type 2 diabetes must pair a healthy lifestyle with glucose-lowering medications to control blood sugar over years. On the upside, M. Sue Kirkman, M.D., endocrinologist and professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, says there are overall health benefits to having normal glucose levels for as many years as possible, such as delaying the onset of complications like heart disease. Rob Huizenga, doctor, uses the word , but it comes with a caveat. ""I tell contestants with prediabetes or early-onset type 2 that you're cured at your ideal weight, but should you regain 50 or 100 pounds back, you have a 100 percent chance of revisiting type 2 diabetes,"" he says. The terms and are misnomers. is the American Diabetes Association's preferred term, which means achieving blood sugar levels below the diagnostic numbers for diabetes without taking glucose-lowering medications. Remission implies the strong possibility of a relapse. ""We know from studies that people can delay progression of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes many years by taking early and aggressive actions,"" says Robert Ratner, M.D., chief scientific and medical officer for the American Diabetes Association (ADA). ""Delaying diabetes results in fewer health problems and savings to the health care system. If you've put prediabetes or type 2 diabetes in remission, get an A1C test annually. And by all means continue to live a healthy lifestyle."" Endocrinologist Sue Kirkman also prefers the term the ADA uses. ""Remission implies the strong possibility of a relapse with weight regain and aging,"" she says, adding that there's even a high rate of relapse among people who have had gastric-bypass surgery. The reality is that a diagnosis of prediabetes or type 2 should initiate a full-court press to control blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure. If you put your prediabetes or type 2 diabetes in remission, you cannot remove it from your checklist of health concerns. Make sure any new health care provider is aware of your history. The ADA has no specific recommendations for follow-up, but Kirkman suggests getting an A1C test once or twice a year to keep tabs on your status and progression. An A1C blood test is one of the best tools to diagnose prediabetes and diabetes. The test reflects the average of your blood sugar levels over three months. Prediabetes is an A1C test result greater than 5.7 percent and less than 6.4 percent. A diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes occurs when an A1C result is greater than 6.5 percent. Unfortunately, a cure, remission, or reversal for type 1 diabetes won't happen anytime soon. ""A complete cure -- one which prevents the autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells -- still seems far off,"" says Kelly L. Close, PWD type 1, editor in chief of the e-newsletter diaTribe. ""Fifteen to 20 years is my prediction."" Jay S. Skyler, M.D., Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet study chair and professor of medicine at the University of Miami and the Diabetes Research Institute, is even more cautious. ""It's not correct to call any current treatment a cure because what appears as prevention now may not prevent the diagnosis later in life,"" he says. Skyler and Close agree that substantial progress is being made on numerous research fronts that will lead to better treatments and, in time, cures. On Close's growing list are human- or animal-derived stem cells; insulin-making beta cells for transplants, along with improved ways to keep the cells alive and working; approval of once-a-day insulins that respond to a person's glucose level; and oral and nasal insulin vaccines. On the nearer horizon are various artificial-pancreas systems.

Important Nutrients for Healthy Blood Sugar Levels, Especially for Diabetics Being publicly-funded gives us a greater chance to continue providing you with high quality content. Please support us! Diabetes is a serious health issue that’s swept our nation for decades now. Type 1 can be developed through genetics, an autoimmune disease, and other possible health issues that aren’t always easy to spot, while Type 2 can be developed genetically and through lifestyle choices that cause insulin resistance, or an autoimmune disease as well. Type 2 often happens because the pancreas stops producing insulin altogether, or the body isn’t able to use insulin efficiently. Insulin is necessary for aiding in blood sugar management, and when too much or not enough is used or produced within the body, . The more we learn about health and diabetes, the more we understand that symptoms and health issues of both Type 1 and Type 2 forms of the disease can be managed. Lifestyle factors such as a lack of exercise, overall poor diet, and even certain, specific food choices (animal proteins, sugar, refined grains, and an overall highly processed diet) all seem to be contributing factors to Type 2 diabetes and is also harmful to those with Type 1 looking to manage their blood sugar and prevent certain health issues, such as heart problems or weight gain. Remarkably, a simple and healthy  rich in certain nutrients and low in inflammation seems to be a powerful weapon at preventing symptoms in those with Type 1 and 2, and has even been shown to completely prevent and treat Type 2 diabetes altogether. The reason diet is such a powerful influence in the treatment of diabetes is because of certain nutrients that the body needs to regulate blood sugar, and also to prevent inflammation (a triggering factor for diabetes). Though staying active, getting enough sleep, and managing stress are also important, improving dietary choice is one of the biggest factors in overall diabetes management and prevention. Nutrients from Plant-Based Foods Help Everyone, Especially Those With Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes If you have Type 1 diabetes, obtaining certain nutrients is still important to focus on even though the disease is not preventable. A diet rich in nutrients can greatly contribute to a healthier you, especially when eaten from whole food sources. The foods suggested here are also anti-inflammatory and can assist with overall wellness, outside of just your blood sugar. For example, heart health, digestive health, arterial health and more, are just some of the benefits of embracing foods from the list of nutrients below. For those with Type 2, have hope that diet can be a strong weapon against the disease that’s developed largely through lifestyle factors alone. Food is a simple form of medicine we all have in our medicine cabinets when we give it the chance to work for us and not against us. Even if you don’t have diabetes, there are some core nutrients to focus on to take care of your blood sugar, especially if diabetes runs in your family or you suffer blood sugar problems that could lead to diabetes later in life. You’ll be pleased to know that despite popular belief, all sources of carbohydrates are not the enemy, and maybe even surprised that animal foods aren’t the best option for obtaining your protein. Check out these important nutrients that are true  and be well on your way to a healthier you! Despite the fact that we’re often told lean animal proteins will help prevent and treat diabetes, this is simply not true according to . In fact, National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that whole grains, beans, legumes, leafy greens, and lots of vegetables be consumed in replacement for animal proteins, especially when it comes to .  Some nuts and seeds such as raw almonds, walnuts, hemp, flax, chia, and pumpkin seeds are also filled with heart-healthy benefits, along with natural protein. Even soy products like non-GMO tofu, edamame or tempeh can make great protein choices to replace animal foods and are less processed than soy burgers or soy protein powders that you’ll want to avoid. Studies also show that plant-based foods are better than the meat, dairy, and egg choices recommended in the American Diabetics Association (influenced by the government with interest in animal production, mind you). Why? Plant-based proteins are , filled with more fiber to regulate blood sugar and do not contribute to inflammation like animal proteins do. Also see some of our  for more information on how to work healthier, plant-based protein options into your diet. that’s responsible for many tasks within the body. It has a strong influence on blood sugar management, along with a host of enzymatic processes that you need to stay healthy and feel your best. Diets heavy in processed foods, caffeine, animal products, and sugar are all usually deficient in magnesium. Why? Because these diets lack whole, plant-based foods, which are the largest source of magnesium of all foods out there. Magnesium not only but can also impact, mood, and even headaches, sleep, and regularity. Some of the most magnesium-rich foods include leafy greens, nuts, seeds, cacao, root vegetables, seaweed, soy and other beans, and some varieties of legumes and grains. See and how to include more in your diet. This mineral is also responsible for in the body. Chromium helpssugar cravings, and influences how insulin is used in the body overall. Chromium is another mineral often missing in diets rich in processed foods, animal protein, and a high sugar diet. This vital mineral is found abundantly in leafy greens, vegetables such as broccoli and green beans, nuts, seeds, seaweed, nuts, beans, legumes, whole grains (especially oats and barley), brewer’s and nutritional yeast, and once again, cacao. It’s even found in some fruits such as tomatoes and spices like black pepper and cinnamon. Though chromium is technically found in a few animal proteins, plant-based sources such as those listed here largely found in animal sources and don’t come with the or either. Chlorophyll might not be the first thing diabetics consider, but it’s a powerful nutrient for a variety of health factors. Chlorophyll is a molecule found abundantly in all green plants, and even some seeds such as pumpkin and hemp seeds. So how does chlorophyll actually influence blood sugar? Chlorophyll not only cleanses the blood and reduces inflammation, but also contains. The deeper the green hue in a food, the more chlorophyll it contains. While you need a variety of plant-based foods in your diet for healthy blood sugar, never forget the power that green foods have on your health. Kale, spinach,, chard, arugula, broccoli, hemp, avocado, pumpkin seeds, and herbs like parsley and cilantro are all great options. such as dulse and algae like are also great options as well. Not only are these foods healthy, cleansing and regulating, but they’re also preventative, even when it comes to. Fiber is a no matter what you’re trying to improve. But fiber and blood sugar? It’s not just a recommendation, but ! Fiber slows down your blood sugar, enhances regularity, and also prevents heart disease. It helps keep you full, makes it easier to manage your weight, and can also keep your body free from cholesterol and toxic build-up. One reason sugar is so harsh on the body is because it’s an empty carb. , but whole fruits, vegetables,, root vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans and legumes all have a large percentage of their carbohydrates that come from fiber. This means they slow down during digestion and absorption so that you don’t get that sugar rush (an insulin surge) that you do from candy, sweets, and even sugary syrups. Always aim to fill your plate withnot only to regulate your appetite but also protect your body from disease.
