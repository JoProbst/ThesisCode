chatgpt_108,"These symptoms collectively suggest an underlying condition called dysautonomia, which affects the autonomic nervous system responsible for regulating bodily functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and digestion. Chronic diarrhea and sweating are common symptoms of dysautonomia, as is an inability to regulate body temperature, which can lead to episodes of fever or chills. Heart palpitations may also occur, as the autonomic nervous system regulates heart rate. Short-term memory issues may also be present. Treatment for dysautonomia is typically focused on managing individual symptoms and improving overall quality of life.",108,chronic diarrhea short-term memory sweating inability to regulate body temperature heart palpitations dysautonomia,-0.007811711169779301,0

Autonomic neuropathy occurs when the nerves that control involuntary bodily functions are damaged. It can affect blood pressure, temperature control, digestion, bladder function and even sexual function. The nerve damage interferes with the messages sent between the brain and other organs and areas of the autonomic nervous system, such as the heart, blood vessels and sweat glands. While diabetes is the most common cause of autonomic neuropathy, other health conditions — even an infection — can be to blame. Some medications also might cause nerve damage. Symptoms and treatment vary based on which nerves are damaged. Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy depend on the nerves affected. They might include: when standing, caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure. such as difficulty starting urination, incontinence, difficulty sensing a full bladder and inability to completely empty the bladder, which can lead to urinary tract infections. including problems achieving or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) or ejaculation problems in men. In women, problems include vaginal dryness, low libido and difficulty reaching orgasm. such as feeling full after a few bites of food, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing and heartburn, all due to changes in digestive function. low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), because the warning signals, such as getting shaky, aren't there. such as sweating too much or too little, which affect the ability to regulate body temperature. making it difficult to adjust from light to dark and seeing well when driving at night. which can occur if your heart rate stays the same instead of adjusting to your activity level. Seek medical care promptly if you begin having any of the signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy, particularly if you have diabetes that's poorly controlled. If you have type 2 diabetes, the American Diabetes Association recommends annual autonomic neuropathy screening beginning when you receive your diagnosis. For people with type 1 diabetes, the association advises annual screening beginning five years after diagnosis. Many health conditions can cause autonomic neuropathy. It can also be a side effect of treatments for other diseases, such as cancer. Some common causes of autonomic neuropathy include: especially when poorly controlled, is the most common cause of autonomic neuropathy. Diabetes can gradually cause nerve damage throughout the body. in organs (amyloidosis), which affects the organs and the nervous system. in which your immune system attacks and damages parts of your body, including your nerves. Examples include Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease. Guillain-Barre syndrome is an autoimmune disease that happens rapidly and can affect autonomic nerves. An abnormal attack by the immune system that occurs as a result of some cancers (paraneoplastic syndrome) is another possible cause. including some drugs used in cancer treatment (chemotherapy). such as HIV and those that cause botulism and Lyme disease. also can cause autonomic neuropathy. Factors that might increase your risk of autonomic neuropathy include: Diabetes, especially when poorly controlled, increases your risk of autonomic neuropathy and other nerve damage. You're at greatest risk if you have difficulty controlling your blood sugar. Amyloidosis, porphyria, hypothyroidism and cancer (usually due to side effects from treatment) also can increase the risk of autonomic neuropathy. While certain inherited diseases that put you at risk of developing autonomic neuropathy can't be prevented, you can slow the onset or progression of symptoms by taking care of your health in general and managing your medical conditions. Follow your doctor's advice on healthy living to control diseases and conditions, which might include these recommendations: Get appropriate treatment if you have an autoimmune disease.

Autonomic behaviour is characterised by self configuration and self healing capabilities, aimed at permitting the system to manage the failure of one of its agents and ensure continuous functioning. Prevention is better than cure because there are many diseases and conditions which have no cure. There are also some chronic diseases which do not have complete cure and can cause poor quality of life due to disabilities, e.g, congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, stroke etc. Look up Congestive Heart Failure or Heart Failure. Left sided heart failure is the most common. It will usually result in shortness of breath. Right sided heart failure usually causes swelling primarily in the legs. There is no cure. But it can be managed with medication. Cirrhosis cannot be reversed - it is the final stage of liver failure in which the liver is irreversibly scarred (beyond it's regenerating capacity). The ""cure"" is a liver transplant. There is no cure for silicosis. The prognosis for patients with chronic silicosis is generally good. Acute silicosis, however, may progress rapidly to respiratory failure and death. For most people, heart failure is a chronic disease with no cure. However, it can be managed and treated with medicines and changes in diet, exercise, and life-style habits. Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is known as dysautonomia. The autonomic nervous system regulates unconscious body functions. Is the pupillary light reflex autonomic and somatic? Evoking responses of the autonomic nervous system through training It depends entirely on what the disorder is. For many of the kidney disorders there are cures. But for some such as chronic kidney failure, there is no cure but only treatment to make the symptoms less severe. Kidney transplant would be the cure in those cases (if you are a candidate for that procedure). Autonomic ganglia contain the cell bodies of motor neurons. What effect does the autonomic nervous system have on the heart? what effect does autonomic nervous system have on heart Which part of the nervous system carries impulses to involuntary muscles and glands? Is pupillary light reflex somatic reflex or autonomic reflex? heart failure can resolve... but not without a Dr.'s intervention. usually it is with drugs called diuretics and other drugs like beta-blockers that make it easier for the heart to work. How many efferent neurons are in a autonomic reflex? The autonomic reflex contains two. (preganglionic and postganglionic) Does the autonomic system control voluntary movement? No, the autonomic nervous system controls involuntary organs. Where in the brain is the most important autonomic center of the brain? The primary autonomic center of the brain is the Medulla Oblongata which is responsible for autonomic functions such as breathing, heart rate and blood pressure. Does the autonomic nervous system control the body's involuntary internal functions? Yes, the autonomic nervous system controls the involuntary actions of the body! TIP TO REMEMBER THIS: Autonomic - automatic ""Autonomic"" functions are the functions of the body that occur involuntarily, that is, they happen and you have no control over them. Example of autonomic functions in human are the regulation of the heartbeat and the secretion of the hormones. Emotions influence autonomic reactions through integration in the hypothalamus. Therefore, autonomic reactions are completely involuntary if one cannot keep a hold on his or her emotions. What is the difference between the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system? What reflexes are classified as autonomic reflexes? The ciliospinal reflex and the pupillary light reflex are classified as autonomic reflexes. When did organ music become associated with baseball?

Dr. Jaeger was my father’s physician last year. He was amazing. What is being done to inform doctors about this condition? There are a lot of misdiagnoses. Before we met doctor Jaeger, one Dr. told my father he was lazy. She would make him try to sit up for long periods even as his BP was plummeting. Dr. Jaeger has my father on a medication combination that enables him to function normally, he is driving again, and cooking. This time last year, he could not sit up without almost passing out. We thank God for using you, Dr. Jaeger. Glad he's doing well! This week, I understand that there is currently a large campaign to inform doctors and others about autonomic dysfunction - including webchats like this one. Hello. I would like to pose the same question. What is being done to educate the rest of the medical community to this condition? This condition is very misdiagnosed. Excellent question. I think it's that autonomic realm is becoming more commonly understood that helps makes diagnosis more common. In teaching of medical students in the Neurology rotation here at Cleveland Clinic, I spend time reinforcing when someone has global symptoms to think autonomic. We are living in a time where this understanding of the autonomic system role in health and disease, there is more research, time and effort into autonomic dysautonomia. I am hopeful. My second question is about genetics and POTS.  I have a twin sister and a younger brother who have POTS as well and I've heard that there is some research being done about a genetic link and POTS.  Do you know what genetic link that is? I also got tested for EDS and don't have that. Lastly, I have an upcoming appointment with a rheumatologist which I was told to look for my underlying condition such as an autoimmune disorder which is commonly linked to POTS. Do you have any advice on what I should mention in that appointment as it relates to POTS? Thank you so much! :) So genetics can be relevant, we do see in the joint heart mobility syndromes like EDS and Marfan's increased incidence of POTS. I personally am following a family of 12 relatives with POTS and yet we still do not know the mechanism of why they share this health issue. Migraines can have a genetic component and migraine patients can have an increased incidence of POTS and migraine can be a genetic condition. The question about autoimmune is common autoimmune syndromes can be Celiac, Sjogren's, the ganglionic receptor antibody. Sjogren's has a 15-20% occurrence in POTS patients and the conventional blood test might be negative for neurological Sjogren's. If we have a concern of Sjogren's we will do a dry eye test and a lip biopsy in our POTS patients. Hello, I've had POTS for some time now that has become very severe and cannot be treated with any of the medications used for this condition. I have developed some neurological issues and have RBD (REM behavior disorder). The POTS specialist here diagnosed me with Shy Drager, now known as MSA (Multiple System Atrophy). My primary doctor and I aren't so sure, or perhaps don't want to believe, I have something fatal. How do I know for certain if it is POTS or is MSA? Do I just have to wait and see if MSA symptoms progress and death is imminent or is there another way? I have read that POTS patients with RBD can later in life likely develop MSA. Is this also true? Thank you for your time. This is a great question. Generally MSA can be ascertained by careful neurologic exam looking for Parkinson's findings on exam. Also brain MRI may show atrophy in the cerebellum or brain stem area. Generally MSA will not have the tachycardia of POTS. The important thing is there are some autoimmune neurologic conditions that can cause stiffness and POTS; like the anti-GAD syndrome. I can't really explain it, but i have been having problems down my left side. It started off as I got up, my whole left side would clench up and it would be like I needed to drag it along, and now it is happening a lot.  Sat down, stood still, or moving around.   Now recently, three days ago, on the left foot where I have been having these problems I have got really bad pain going across my foot and on my ankle and a little up my leg. I don't know what this could be, can you help? I think this is very important to address with a very detailed neurologic evaluation. There are conditions that can share autonomic dysfunction and failure to control even one side of the body. My son was just diagnosed with Dysautonomia, and pots, the doctors have told us the seizures he just started experiencing are not a part of the Dysautonomia. I hear of others experiencing similar events. What if anything can be done to help the seizures if they are not epilepsy? The school wants to know before they will let him back in school. So it's important to ask the doctors if there are any joint or shared diagnoses that could cause seizures. In addition, it's very important to log the frequency of these seizure events. The frequency may help determine if there's a need for more potential monitoring (epilepsy monitoring). In addition, there is a term called convulsive syncope where people can look like they are having a seizure where there is really an autonomic response. Even epilepsy monitoring can demonstrate that these are not seizures and might be a window by heart rate and blood pressure monitoring that this might be autonomic dysfunction as a cause of these events. I have been diagnosed with POTS for three yrs. now, but doctors still can't figure out or stop the seizures I go into, a lot of times when my blood pressure drops. Is this something that is fairly common; and will I have to struggle through this the rest of my life? There are not any doctors in my area with much knowledge on POTS. There is a term called convulsive syncope that can look like seizures when the cause is really autonomic dysfunction. With my patients I will want to see their blood pressure logs. If the blood pressure is low I will often use medication and other care to help raise the blood pressure to reduce these events. It's important to make sure you've had evaluation for seizures also, usually with EEG, and neurologic consultation. I have confirmed sarcoidosis in remission and diagnosed with an atrial tachycardia. I dropped 15 lb. in two weeks, developed OI, syncope, worsening GI issues, neuropathy in my hands and feet, loss of dexterity. Stress and activity make it worse, excitement makes me shake uncontrollably. I was tested for every disease known to cause these symptoms. My GI results showed no issues causing my symptoms. I was tilt table and QSART tested twice, both were normal. We captured a 30+ spike in heart rate when standing resulting in near syncope. My docs (Mayo) now suspect POTS or other autonomic dysfunction. A CDP and DVA test, noted functionally impaired DVA with significant loss of visual acuity with right/left head movements. I've made lifestyle changes, salt increases, leg compression, all seem to be helping. Can I have POTS and pass those tests? What other tests am I missing? What should we pursue with the DVA results, my ophthalmologist didn't know? If it's not POTS, what else could it be? I have seen autonomic dysfunction or POTS develop after sarcoidosis. We can see autonomic dysfunction or POTS develop as a secondary response to a chronic health disease. And besides treating the chronic health issue, treating the POTS is one of the best paths to better health. You can have POTS and pass those tests, one additional test to ask is if you should be tested for small fiber neuropathy related to sarcoidosis and POTS. In addition with all your wellness lifestyle for POTS, cardiac rehab and potential medicines may help your POTS function better. With autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy AAG is it progressive? If the antibodies are treated will your symptoms improve or resolve or stay the same?  Do the antibodies do permanent damage to your autonomic system? #2 since the majority of Dysautonomia patients are female, what role does hormones play and can hormone replacement help symptoms? This is an excellent question. We generally use how someone is doing clinically more so than the antibody levels to tell how someone is doing. Some of my patients who are doing well may have persistent antibody levels. The antibodies represent a potential autoimmune factor. In addition, some of these autoimmune conditions that you mentioned we may also use IVIGG or plasma exchange. As for the hormones, we are still learning its role in this condition. We do know women will do worse around their menses. Can symptoms wax and wane or change over time? For example, can there be periods in your life where prolonged standing or sitting at a computer can trigger tachycardia/presyncope and other times in your life only affected by low blood pressure and narrow pulse pressures with no tachycardia. Fluctuations of symptoms are very common. They may have periods of quiescence, a relative control of symptoms, and seemingly or suddenly the symptoms return inexplicably. It's hard to predict, know when this will happen, or know what triggers this. We try to determine what might be the various triggers without autonomic testing, hemodynamic assessments and ambulatory monitors. I have been Diagnosed with POTS some days the symptoms are sever and then I have days where I feel ""normal"" is this how it works or have I been misdiagnosed? People with POTS can have good days and bad days. This does not discount the diagnosis. I encourage my patients to keep a daily log from 1 to 10 in terms of how they're doing. 10 is the worst, 1 is the best. This log can trend how someone is improving or doing worse. Also, the logging might give insight to triggers that are occurring in one's life to cause more bad days than good days. I hope for you to have more better days. Sleep is a huge problem for me; I find my symptoms significantly worse when I wake up from sleep or a nap. Why is this and how can I manage this? With autonomic dysfunction, especially POTS, sleep can be a big problem. One aspect is from immobilization, blood pooling occurs. Some patients will wear compression stockings at bed and keep their head elevated at 30 degrees. I often will prescribe a medication if there is nighttime tachycardia that does occur with POTS, like beta blocker. Often some patients will need to use a neuropathic medicine to help with some of the body pains and neuropathic symptoms at nighttime. Many of my POTS patients have very shallow, fragmented poor sleep. I find working to improve sleep often helps the daytime symptoms to be better controlled. What can be done to manage the nausea that can be experienced with POTS and/or Dysautonomia? We have tried Zofran, and that only works for less than 1 hour. Great question! The question I wonder is, has anyone medically evaluated for gastric motility disorder like gastroparesis that can cause these symptoms? I have actually sometimes used neuropathic medications to help these symptoms over typical anti-nausea medicine. Hello, I have not been dx with POTS, but with autonomic imbalance. I have been having problems with my heart rate and BP increasing, chronic fatigue, nausea, headaches, and problems, itching, blurred vision when BP is slightly elevated, tingling on mainly the left side of my body, frequent urination, which is better, when my BP is normal. I've been informed that it is mostly anxiety. This has been doing on for about 3 years. I'm sorry that you're struggling, but autonomic imbalance is just one of the general names ascribed to the category of dysautonomia. The names and nomenclature are influx and are frequently changing. However, many patients have symptoms on various parts of the spectrum, like you describe. Because many doctors do not understand the autonomic nervous system, there is frequent tendency to label it as anxiety or hyper vigilance. Certainly, ongoing autonomic disorders can trigger anxiety, probably appropriately, but what is needed for you is a thorough evaluation of your autonomic nervous system. There is usually good therapies, both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic that alleviate symptoms. I started having odd fluctuations in my body temp in the 90's when I was about 26yrs old. I was diagnosed with FUO and told that ""It will either go away on its own or I may have it forever."" hmmm. 10 years later I began having random episodes of Tachycardia, less than 180bpm with few if any bothersome symptoms and was diagnosed with SVT. My Neurologist at CC just diagnosed it as POTS since I had an episode upon standing in his office. (diagnosed with NDPH ODDLY enough 10 years after the Tachycardia) The Tachycardia can start upon standing OR while just sitting still. Is that Truly POTS?? I STILL have the crazy fluctuations in body temp but just assumed it was the FUO that hasn't gone away. Could the 2 conditions actually be related?? One other interesting thing, I had a sleep study done and they noted that when I changed positions in bed, my temp would spike up. These Symptoms can be ""Irritating"" but not life altering. (I don't take Rx for SVT's because I'm usually asymptomatic). Temperature intolerance is extremely common in autonomic disorders, but abnormalities in temperature particularly recurrent fevers would not be a common feature of POTS, and suggests another type of underlying disorder, either endocrinologic or underlying covert infection. I have had severe pain in the front of both thighs when standing and walking for 4 years. After seeing many specialists and having every test, I had a tilt table test and consult with an autonomic doctor. He said I didn't have POTS because my heart rate didn't increase >30 pts. but said I had venous pooling and atypical presentation. My thighs also turn red when I stand/walk. Midodrine and herbs such as Butcher's broom didn't help, and compression stockings help a little. Another doctor at Johns Hopkins told me thigh pain is not usually associated with POTS and orthostatic intolerance. My BP and HR increase, and I feel jittery, shaky, and lightheaded when standing a few minutes. Could the thigh pain be part of an orthostatic problem, and should I continue to pursue this by seeing another autonomic doctor, or is it likely something unrelated that they haven't found yet? I am a 48-y-old female. Any doctors you recommend in the northern Virginia area? Thanks for your help! Sometimes I will repeat the tilt table test for those patients I still have a concern for autonomic dysfunction. What I also try to study is the heart rate response through the tilt table and not the heart rate response of 30 beats over baseline at the 10 minute head of bed elevated interval. Midodrine might not be the only medicine to use for autonomic dysfunction. We do see body pain in people with autonomic dysfunction as blood pools or if there is underlying small fiber neuropathy. I think it's essential and excellent that you are trying to monitor your blood pressure heart rate with your symptoms. Also you should be doing your blood pressure at least daily at a standard time besides when you feel at your worst. This logging of vitals helps me understand my patient's physiology to better help them. Besides Pain Management are there any other treatments for autonomic disorders? Specifically lower leg spasms and hot/ cold sensitivities. Again, a great question! This question raises diagnosis that these symptoms can often be tied into neuropathy and this neuropathy is usually a small fiber that can be diagnosed with qsart or skin nerve biopsy . Often for my patients with these symptoms, I will do a comprehensive blood panel for typical autoimmune conditions and neurologic autoantibodies. Is there a connection between POTS and neuropathic pain? We can see small fiber neuropathy in POTS that can cause this pain. Also blood pooling can cause much body pain. Could POTS cause EXTREME pain in my toes? Like the sensation of an open wound being dragged thru sand & glass? Could it also be responsible for my legs having the sensation of ""falling asleep""? Lastly, how do we speak to our own doctors without sounding like whiney crazy people? How do I get my Dr. to listen/understand? This is an important question that we can see small fiber neuropathy in POTS, about 20% occurrence. In addition, blood pooling can cause these symptoms. The blood pooling and these symptoms might occur when persons are more immobilized through the day from sitting or lying down. In small fiber neuropathy, we use QSART or skin nerve biopsy for diagnosis. Can pain be a symptom from POTS ? How does a person advocate for Themselves during a flare and when should a person go to the hospital for symptoms. Most of us when we go just get a saline iv if that much and are kicked out with a ""there is nothing more I can do everything looks fine even though you don't feel fine"" Looking forward for your input Pain is very typical. The cause can be blood pooling. For a subset, they may have small fiber neuropathy. We really try to work with our POTS patients to make their care as outpatient care when possible. Monitoring vitals of blood pressure and pulse daily and when you feel bad it may be insightful to tailor therapy to help you do better. Hello, I was diagnosed with Neurocardiogenic Syncope 6 years ago and had a pacemaker inserted. About 3 years ago I started having Ocular migraines a few times per month where part of my vision is blocked from 15 to 45 minutes. Is this an autonomic issue or another neurological problem? Also, are there any new drugs, supplements or special diets that can help the symptoms of Dysautonomia? Thank you. Great question. We do see Sjogren's and Celiac as being tied into POTS and gut issues. Testing that is sometimes helpful are any studies for gastro motility. Your gut is a big neuromuscular structure and can be impacted by autonomic dysfunction. And we do see abdominal pain with POTS as blood pools from abdominal skeletal muscles and not impacting the gut itself. Many of my POTS patients need lifestyle and medications to help gut function. I have horrible migraines with days of vomiting for which Zofran and all the others don't help. Many medications make my body feel like I should not have taken these medications. In the ER I try to just get fluid support and some IV for nausea but they are always pushing strong medications for the pain. Any suggestions for pain medications that are safe for dysautonomia? Migraines history can be a risk factor for POTS. Also, headaches and migraines can be common symptoms for POTs and dysautonomia in a young person. Often I find treating dysautonomia helps to reduce the headaches and migraines. Another consideration is that we use Botox injections for migraine prevention and reduction especially when the patient meets FDA criteria. After 13 years of SVTs and 2 ablations I was recently diagnosed with ""dysautonomia"". Besides the usual constellation of day time symptoms I battle with I have a major problem with tachycardia during sleep that nobody can figure out. I will sometimes wake during the FIRST hour of sleep with a heart rate of 140-160. It has been this way for years and never once happened further into my sleep. It isn't nightmares because a few times I started to wake slightly right before it started, a few times I remember rolling over from my stomach before it started. The episodes are terrifying and can last 20 minutes (after them I'm cold with chattering teeth, shaky and, of course, up for hours). I recently had a CAT scan and head MRI that was normal as well as an hour long EEG (I was supposed to fall asleep during but couldn't) and was told they could find nothing. Depending upon the type of ablations that you've had, you may have developed an inappropriate sinus tachycardia. Your doctors could test you for this with ambulatory monitors, assessments of neurologic and autonomic function as well as possible therapies like beta blockers or ivabradine. Without further information, it's impossible to say exactly what's happening, but we would certainly be happy to see you. Is A-Fib common with POTS? My POTS seem to get worse as I get older (presently 75) is this common? Atrial Fibrillation is very common in your age group, and not very common in POTS. In general, POTS in your age group is fairly uncommon as well; therefore, your doctors may consider other types of autonomic problems. My POTS symptoms act up with a vehicle moves when first starting out on a drive. Fine sitting down in the car, then just rolling out of the driveway makes my heart rate jump up. Is the nervous system confused? Why is driving/riding in a car different from other motions or activities? Four other POTS patients tell me they have similar experiences. Thanks! :) POTS patients frequently have concomitant vestibular/inner ear issues as well as motion sickness, which manifests in a variety of different symptoms. There is very good testing to determine if you have a vestibular component accompanying autonomic dysfunction, including specific neurologic testing of the inner ear function. Cleveland Clinic has several specialists in this, including a group who sees patients with vertigo, dizziness, and POTS. Why is pots causing me to regularly feel dizzy? Particularly after I stop walking or I am standing still even when my blood pressure is normal. People can feel very dizzy or light headed even when the blood pressure is normal. I would try to check your pulse also. I would try to keep a daily log of how frequently you feel this symptom. With my own patients I will also use how severe or impacted their daily life with medicine, life tips and maybe even use cardiac rehabilitation. My 14-year-old great grandson has been having what he calls ""his eyes go black"" episodes, and he becomes unsteady on his feet. He passed out once just for a moment or two; his eyes were glassy and pupils were dilated. Now when his eyes go black, his ears fill up with a feeling of being underwater. The doctor said it could be Dysautonomia and he has an appointment with a cardiologist next week. Can you help me understand what may be causing this and what can be done. He is now having these episodes more frequently (they actually started over a year ago). Actually what's happening is when people are fainting or near fainting they will have reduction of blood flow to their head. There is no brain injury from this. As a neurologist, I will often see people who come to us presenting with syncope without symptoms and we've had many patients report to us many symptoms and phenomena and strange body symptoms as their blood pressure and body fluctuate without having complete fainting. I have hypertension, pulmonary hypertension and A-fib. (Otherwise, I'm just fine!) I take Avapro, Imdur, Coumadin, Atenolol, Digoxin, Norvasc and Lasix 20. I have told my cardiologist that I have the symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and orthostatic hypotension. He told me to drink more water. (I don't drink enough.) I already know to change position slowly. Is there anything else I can do? Inner ear testing was negative. Orthostatic hypotension is extremely common and challenging. When people have the combination of high blood pressure with a tendency for blood pressure to fall when they stand, then there are specific medicines that can be used to help both extremes. There are many mechanisms responsible for this and diagnostic autonomic testing can usually reveal the mechanism. Certainly, augmentation of fluids is helpful, also other things to discuss with your doctor are inclining the head of the bed, exercise program, compression socks, and medications to prevent the falls in blood pressure without increasing or causing hypertension. I have large swings in blood pressure. Generally, my Systolic varies from 125 to 185, Diastolic varies from 62 to 80, heart rate usually around 60. I feel fine with these numbers. However, I also have episodes of very low blood pressure (pressure of 80/40) when my heart pounds hard and faster and I feel I am going to pass out. Actually I don't feel well when the Systolic goes below 130. I've been taking Amlodipine Besylate 2.5 mg daily and wonder if I should continue to do so. The episodes of extremely low blood pressure and feeling faint can happen any time I feel some anxiety, after I've eaten a satisfying meal rather than a light snack, or after walking up a flight of stairs. Is there any way to avoid such drastic drops in blood pressure? Swings or lability of blood pressure is very common in patients with autonomic disorders. You may discuss alternatives to amlodipine with your physician. There are other medicines that can be used to avoid much marked swings. Be sure to utilize compression socks, regular exercise, etc. If okay with your physicians, as this can certainly help. Beta blockers may be a better option for your hypertension, as they may avoid both the highs and the lows. But definitely discuss with your physician, or we'd be happy to see you here as well. My blood pressure is usually about 85/55, but sometimes when I exercise, it either goes down a bit, leading to a very fatigued feeling after a short period of exercise, or I develop a very wide pulse pressure, with a reading like 145/41. This causes me to feel like I am going to faint. How should I approach exercise with these difficulties? If exercise has been prescribed by your doctors to help, you didn't mention what type, but you probably should concentrate on non-gravitational exercises; exercises done while sitting or lying down, which tends to avoid the marked fluctuations or drop in blood pressure that can happen with some exercise. Be sure to ask your doctor about using custom fitted compression socks, particularly during exercising, augmentation of fluid and salt, if appropriate. If you are having chronic low blood pressure, you should undergo evaluation to determine the cause. This could include, blood volume measurements, autonomic testing, as well as endocrine testing. I have been diagnosed with autonomic dysfunction with low blood volume. I also have and have always had low blood pressure. I am trying to figure out spells I get that are not like low BP syncope. With these episodes I get weak and feel like my body is shutting down. Once, when I got to the ER I urinated so much the nurse couldn't figure out what was happening. Sometimes I will shake or feel like I am trying to walk against a great force before I collapse. Any insight? Low blood pressure and low blood volume can cause many symptoms in the body than just fainting. In neurology, we see that much body pain, weakness and headaches from low blood pressure and low blood volume. It's essential to daily monitor your blood pressure once or twice a day. If my patient has low blood pressure I will use medicine to try and decrease the blood pressure and these symptoms. I have a daughter who has ""Global Dysautonomia with POTS."" She is a patient of Dr. Moodley MD, Pediatric Neurology at your facility. She has had vision changes, hearing loss, facial swelling and dysphagia all on the right side since being diagnosed in March 2015. She has a NG tube and is starting vital stim this week on her throat. I am very overwhelmed with the many specialists she has. Is there one physician that could really help me understand everything she has going on? Is there anything else I can do besides treat the symptoms? Thank you so much. I look forward to your session in November!! Christine This is a very valid question. Dr. Moodley is a wonderful physician. Many patients with POTS have so many specialists that we do have on our floor S3 a large POTS population with opportunity for shared medical appointments and even potential office nurse or physician visits. It's a constant balance to know what POTS is and what is not POTS medically. If a person has been diagnosed with POTS and is symptomatic on a daily basis but does not take any prescription meds for the condition, is there any reason to maintain follow-up appointments with a doctor who treats POTS? Are there any annual tests or screenings that are recommended, such as cardiac evaluations? Usually, in my practice, patients will get a complete autonomic and cardiac evaluation on the initial visit and then, will usually start with the non-pharmacologic and later during follow up visits, medications or new therapies may be added. In addition, the condition does seem to change in character from time to time and certainly, monitoring for new symptoms or concerns may be appropriate. After being diagnosed with non-length dependent small fiber neuropathy, I was worked up at Cleveland Clinic for Dysautonomia. I had a normal TST and was told to cancel my QSART. I failed my tilt table test with Dr. Shields in six minutes. HR up 38 beats/min. and still rising. BP mostly unchanged except fluctuating systolic hypotension. Diagnosis of Cardiovascular Dysautonomia, Cardiovascular Adrenergic Dysfunction. Differential was POTS however cardiovagal findings suggest more widespread disorder. My questions 1) what widespread disorder? 2) why do or not do QSART? Thanks for your consideration of these questions. We often consider a thermoregulatory sweat test to be the best test to pick up a disseminated or widespread small fiber or autonomic neuropathy, therefore the QSART would not be needed. There are many conditions associated with vagal abnormalities. You should discuss these with the doctors who did the initial evaluations. In rehabilitation/physiotherapy: what is the exact goal you're trying to meet to help with POTS - is it all about gaining more muscle strength (to help pump your blood around) and if so: what if you're not able to gain more muscle (due to polyneuropathy or other muscular disorders)? The model of rehab that we like to use is a cardiac rehab model over conventional rehab to gently recondition the body using energy expenditure and pulse rate settings. Most POTS patients need very gradual increasing strength and conditioning since too rapid increased of exercise or rehab can actually work against the POTS patients. How effective is the ""Levine Protocol"" in helping POTS patients? The Levine Protocol also called POTS rehab or non-gravitational exercise program has been extremely helpful in many patients struggling with recurrent symptoms related to autonomic dysfunction. We have introduced this program in our cardiac rehab program and modified it, and are now treating several hundred patients on a regular basis. The results from clinical trials done several years ago have been quite impressive on improving symptoms and quality of life, and our own experience has been similar. The patients undergo rigorous initial evaluation with an exercise program and test and participate in so-called non-gravitational exercises; for example, recumbent bike, rowing machine, nustep, and aqua therapy if available, under a supervised, monitored, individualized, progressing at their own ability. How much does stress play a role in POTS symptoms worsening? Are PVCs common with POTS patients? If you have PVCS along with POTS, is a high salt intake still recommended? Stress is a common occurrence in all of our lives, and can certainly make symptoms more difficult to handle. Increasing adrenaline levels or sympathetic nervous system activation can certainly worsen tachycardia heart rates. In addition, PVCs are extremely common in general and certainly may be exacerbated through the same symptoms. As long as the cardiac function structure is normal and there is no hypertension, in general, high salt should not exacerbate the PVCs. However, high salt may lead to intermittent elevation of blood pressure, which can certainly trigger more PVCs. Is it possible to be diagnosed with POTS based on an in-office sit to stand test, then show no symptoms during a tilt table test? The doctor had diagnosed my young adult daughter with POTS saying she went up 30 bpm, (later said he wrote down 20 bpm), and did a TTT just to see if it was a certain type of POTS. But when she did not have the heart increase much or faint during the TTT, he said he didn't know if she had POTS or not but it didn't matter anyway because she needs to find the underlying cause anyway. Do you agree? Also, we have found it nearly impossible to find doctors that have heard of, know how to diagnose, or treat POTS. Those that do have new patients waiting up to a year, and some stop taking new patients. It is frustrating and almost impossible to find a doctor nearby when patients can't travel or take off work. Is this being taught in medical schools now, and do you see more doctors looking to specialize in this field? What do we do? It is unusual to have ""orthostatic tachycardia"" at the bedside, but have a normal TTT. Although, I have seen it occasionally and it remains a mystery. Certainly, patients can have daily fluctuation in their Tilt Table responses. Probably would be worthwhile to do further autonomic investigation, particularly since she still has intermittent high heart rates. It can be very frustrating to find physicians familiar with these autonomic problems, although, it appears that they are becoming increasingly prevalent as evidenced by the number of patients writing in today. The estimated incidents is about a million patients right now, and yes, new doctors in medical schools are learning about the autonomic disorders as well as ongoing research being done in multiple institutions. What are the indications that a POTS patient should have their Total Blood Volume tested? What information can a patient give to their doctors to help them understand the need for the test? Particularly for older female POTS patients who have had POTS long-term. (In early 50s with POTS for almost 45 years.) Our patients typically undergo a blood volume test routinely as that may be the root of their problem with unexpected low blood volume. Blood volume studies are available at about 200 facilities in the US in most major institutions, secondary, and tertiary care centers. It can be extremely helpful to guide therapy if significant low blood volume is found, including treatment with blood volume expanders and investigations of causes of low blood volume. We also perform other cardiac and hemodynamic testing to look at blood volume distribution during postural stress that is unique to Cleveland Clinic, called a radionuclide hemodynamic study, which was developed for patients with autonomic disorders. My daughter is just getting a Dysautonomia diagnosis. What is the treatment for this disease? Excellent question. Dysautonomia is a very general term, you should ask your physician for a more detailed diagnosis, like POTS for example. For treatment, we try to figure out what might have led to dysautonomia. We will use certain medications, a cardiac rehab model and autonomic life tips to help people function and do better. I have a new diagnosis of Dysautonomia and am taking Midodrine. Is this a medication I will be on the rest of my life? Also, I have three lesions in my brain. Does this have anything to do with the Dysautonomia??? Great question. You may not need to be on this medicine the rest of your life. I will use this medicine often to get people feeling better initially.

This nerve damage disturbs signal processing between the autonomic nervous system and the brain. Injured autonomic nerves can affect your: AN is often associated with other medical conditions and diseases and certain medications. Your symptoms may vary based on the cause of your neuropathy and the location of your nerve damage. Factors that might cause injury to the autonomic nerves include: chronic illnesses, such as or degenerative disorders, such as What are the risk factors for autonomic neuropathy? The following people have an increased risk of AN: Other factors that may increase your risk of AN include: AN can affect many organs and cause an array of symptoms. Early symptoms of AN include dizziness or faintness when rising or standing, and vomiting or feeling nauseated when eating. You may also have disturbances in bowel movements, bladder control, or sexual functioning. Other symptoms may affect the functioning of specific organs and organ systems: The symptoms affecting your bladder may include frequent urinary tract infections and urinary incontinence or an inability to empty your bladder. The symptoms of AN that affect your digestive system can include: feeling full after eating a small quantity of food The symptoms of AN that affect your reproductive organs can include: The symptoms of AN that affect your heart and blood vessels can include: The symptoms of AN that affect your eyes can include slow pupil adjustment from dark to light and difficulty driving at night. The symptoms of AN that affect your sweat glands can include dry skin on your feet and excessive sweating or lack of sweating. Other symptoms of AN can include unexplained weight loss and low blood glucose without warning signals, such as shakiness. See your doctor if you have symptoms of AN. Early diagnosis may improve your outlook. Your doctor will make a diagnosis based on your risk factors, observations during a physical examination, and test results. Your doctor may conduct the following tests: breathing tests to evaluate blood pressure and heart rate to assess your gastric motility and muscle activity a quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (QSART) to assess nerve reactions associated with the sweat glands a tilt-table test to monitor blood pressure during posture changes a thermoregulatory test to look at your sweat patterns during temperature changes a bladder ultrasound to examine your bladder structure What are the treatments for autonomic neuropathy? Treatments for AN target the damaged nerves and any underlying condition causing injury to the nerves. Different treatments are available depending on your symptoms. Digestive and gastrointestinal treatments include: taking prescription medications to help with digestion taking for stomach pain or loose stools taking prescription medication to empty your bladder taking prescription medication to reduce symptoms of overactive bladder scheduling your drinking and urinating to retrain your bladder threading a through your urethra to drain the bladder using a to force blood into the penis to cause an erection a high-sodium and high-fluid diet to sustain blood pressure prescription medication to reduce dizziness when rising or standing prescription medication to increase your blood pressure to combat faintness to regulate your heart rate with differing activity levels changes in posture, flexing your feet, and slowing your speed when rising or standing to decrease dizziness sleeping with your head elevated to reduce dizziness taking prescription medication to reduce excessive sweating Addressing conditions that may cause neuropathy can help prevent its development. Some suggestions include: Keep your blood sugar stable if you have diabetes. Eating a low-sugar and high-fiber diet might help regulate diabetes. Stop smoking cigarettes. Talk to your doctor about treatments that can help you quit. Stop drinking alcohol. Seeking the services of a counselor may be helpful. Exercise daily to help manage certain health conditions and lose weight if necessary. Prevent high blood pressure by drinking plenty of fluids, exercising regularly, and eliminating stressors. Your outlook varies based on the cause of your nerve damage and how well it can be treated. In some cases, the nerves can repair themselves.

The book is remarkably easy to read despite the complexity of the subject matter, the text being excellently illustrated by diagrams and tables. The book maintains a uniformly high standard of authorship and is well cross-referenced. The contributions divide into three appropriate parts, the first lucidly dealing with the basic anatomy and function of the autonomic nervous system, the second with the ever expanding range of autonomic function tests and the third with clinical disorders. The latter section covers the primary autonomic failure syndromes, the peripheral autonomic neuropathies and a diverse collection of disorders outlining the role of the autonomic system in pain, cardiovascular disease, spinal cord lesions, and vasovagal episodes. There is an excellent chapter devoted to ageing and autonomic function which could have been expanded to discuss more fully malignant vasovagal episodes in the elderly and the role of routine tilt-table testing in the investigation of |funny turns'.

Dehydration: Causes, Symptoms & Tips to Stay Hydrated Reviewed By: The majority of the body is made up of water with up to 75% of the body's weight due to H2O. Most of the water is found within the cells of the body (intracellular space). The rest is found in the extracellular space, which consists of the blood vessels (intravascular space) and the spaces between cells (interstitial space). Dehydration occurs when the amount of water leaving the body is greater than the amount being taken in. The body is very dynamic and always changing. This is especially true with water levels in the body. We lose water routinely when we: urinate or have a bowel movement to rid the body of waste products. In a normal day, a person has to drink a significant amount of water to replace this routine loss. Diarrhea is the most common reason a person loses excess water. Diarrhea consists of unusually frequent or unusually liquid bowel movements and excessive watery evacuations of fecal material. Persistent diarrhea is both uncomfortable and dangerous, as a significant amount of water can be lost with each bowel movement. Worldwide, more than four million children die each year because of dehydration from diarrhea. Vomiting is the act of forcible emptying of the stomach, in which the stomach has to overcome the pressures that are normally in place to keep food and secretions within the stomach. The stomach almost turns itself inside out - forcing itself into the lower portion of the esophagus (the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach) during a vomiting episode. Constant vomiting can be a serious cause of fluid loss and it is difficult for a person to replace water if they are unable to tolerate liquids. The body can lose significant amounts of water when it tries to cool itself by sweating. Whether the body is hot because of the environment (for example, working in a warm environment), intense exercising in a hot environment, or because a fever is present due to an infection; the body uses a significant amount of water in the form of sweat to cool itself. Depending upon weather conditions, a brisk walk will generate up to 16 ounces of sweat (one pound of water). In people with diabetes, elevated blood sugar levels cause sugar to spill into the urine, and water then follows, which can cause significant dehydration. For this reason, frequent urination and excessive thirst are among the symptoms of diabetes. The skin has an important role to play in the fluid and temperature regulation of the body. If enough skin area is injured, the ability to maintain that control can be lost. Burn victims become dehydrated because water seeps into the damaged skin. Other inflammatory diseases of the skin are also associated with fluid loss. The inability to drink adequately is another potential cause of dehydration. Whether it is the lack of availability of water or the lack of strength to drink adequate amounts, this, coupled with routine or excessive amounts of water loss can compound the degree of dehydration. The body's initial responses to dehydration are thirst to increase water intake along with decreased urine output to try to conserve water. The urine will become concentrated and more yellow in color. As the level of water loss increases, more symptoms can become apparent, such as increased thirst, dry mouth, cessation of tear production by the eyes, cessation of sweating , muscle cramps, nausea and vomiting, heart palpitations, and lightheadedness (especially when standing). With severe dehydration, confusion and weakness will occur as the brain and other body organs receive less blood. Finally, coma and organ failure will occur if the dehydration remains untreated. Dehydration is often a clinical diagnosis. Aside from diagnosing the reason for dehydration, the health care professional's examination of the patient will assess the level of dehydration. Initial evaluations may include: to evaluate whether the patient is awake, alert, and oriented. may include postural readings (blood pressure and pulse rate are taken lying down and standing). With dehydration, the pulse rate may increase and the blood pressure may drop because the intravascular space is depleted of water. will be checked to see if sweat is present and to assess the degree of elasticity. As dehydration progresses, the skin loses its water content and becomes less elastic. infants may have additional evaluations performed, including checking for a soft spot on the skull (sunken fontanelle), assessing the suck mechanism, muscle tone, or loss of sweat in the armpits and groin. are often weighed during routine visits, thus a body weight measurement may be helpful in assessing how much water has been lost with the acute illness. In some cases, blood tests to measure potential electrolyte abnormalities and urinalysis may be ordered to determine the level of dehydration in the patient. Fluid replacement is the treatment for dehydration. This may be attempted by replacing fluid by mouth, but if this fails, intravenous fluid (IV) may be required. Should oral rehydration be attempted, frequent small amounts of clear fluids should be used. Clear fluids include: other replacement fluids that may contain electrolytes (Pedialyte, Gatorade, Powerade, etc.) Dehydration occurs over time. If it can be recognized in its earliest stages, and if its cause can be addressed, then home treatment may be adequate. Steps a person can take at home to prevent severe dehydration include: People with vomiting and diarrhea can try to alter their diet and use medications to control symptoms to minimize water loss. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be used to control fever. Ibuprofen may irritate the stomach and cause nausea and vomiting, so it should be used with caution in individuals who already have these symptoms. Fluid replacements may be attempted by replacing fluid by mouth with frequent small amounts of clear fluids. If the individual becomes confused or lethargic; if there is persistent, uncontrolled fever, vomiting, or diarrhea; or if there are any other specific concerns, then medical care should be accessed. EMS or 911 should be activated for any person with altered mental status. Complications of dehydration may occur because of the dehydration, and/or because of the underlying disease or situation that causes the fluid loss. Complications that may occur include: heat-related illnesses (heat exhaustion or heat stroke), and Plan ahead and take extra water to all outdoor events where increased sweating, activity, and heat stress will increase fluid loss. Encourage athletes and people who work outside to replace fluids at a rate that equals the loss. Check weather forecasts for high heat index days. When temperatures are high, avoid exercise, outdoor exposure, and plan events that must occur outside during times of the day when temperatures are lower. The young and elderly are most at risk of dehydration. Ensure that older people, infants, and children have adequate drinking water or fluids available and assist them as necessary. Encourage individuals who are incapacitated or impaired to drink plenty of water and assure they are provided with adequate fluids. During heat waves, attempts should be made to check on the elderly in their homes. During the Chicago heat wave of 1995, more than 600 people died in their homes from heat exposure. Avoid alcohol consumption, especially when it is very hot, because alcohol increases water loss and impairs your ability to recognize early signs associated with dehydration. Wear light-colored and loose-fitting clothing if you must be outdoors when it is hot outside. Drink plenty of water and carry a personal fan or mister to cool yourself. Break up your exposure to hot temperatures. Find air-conditioned or shady areas and allow yourself to cool between exposures. Taking someone into a cooled area for even a couple of hours each day will help prevent the cumulative effects of high heat exposure. Know the signs and symptoms of heat cramps, heat rash, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. Preventing dehydration is one step to avoid these conditions. Dehydration occurs when water intake is less than water loss. Prevention is the important first step in treating dehydration. The young and the elderly are especially susceptible to dehydration.

9a6ffd20-4f5f-415e-8a7f-49659d7706e2,"All About Autonomic Dysreflexia (Autonomic Hyperreflexia) Medically reviewed by — Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is a condition in which your involuntary nervous system overreacts to external or bodily stimuli. It’s also known as autonomic hyperreflexia. This reaction causes: The condition is most commonly seen in people with above the sixth thoracic vertebra, or T6. It may also affect people who have , , and some head or brain injuries. AD can also be a side effect of medication or drug use. AD is a serious condition that’s considered a medical emergency. It can be life-threatening and result in: To understand AD, it’s helpful to understand the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS is the part of the nervous system responsible for maintaining involuntary bodily functions, such as: The SANS and PANS operate in opposite ways. This maintains the balance of the involuntary functions in your body. In other words, if the SANS overreacts, the PANS can compensate for it. Here’s an example. If you see a bear, your sympathetic nervous system might initiate a fight-or-flight reaction. This would cause your heart to beat faster, your blood pressure to rise, and your blood vessels to get ready to pump more blood. But what if you realize you were mistaken and it wasn’t a bear? You wouldn’t need the stimulation of your SANS, so your parasympathetic nervous system would jump into action. Your PANS would bring your heartbeat and blood pressure back to normal. AD interrupts both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems. This means that the body’s SANS overreacts to stimuli, such as a full bladder. What’s more, the PANS can’t effectively stop that reaction. It may actually make it worse. Your lower body still generates a lot of nerve signals after a spinal cord injury. These signals communicate your bodily functions, such as the status of your bladder, bowels, and digestion. The signals can’t get past the spinal injury to your brain. However, the messages still go to the parts of the sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic nervous systems that operate below the spinal cord injury. Signals can trigger the SANS and PANS, but the brain can’t appropriately respond to them so they no longer work effectively as a team. The result is that the SANS and PANS can get out of control. Your heart rate may slow down radically because pressure sensors located in the carotid arteries or aorta (called baroreceptors) respond to the abnormally high blood pressure and send a signal to the brain that the blood pressure is too high. high blood pressure with systolic readings often over 200 mm Hg Triggers of AD in people with spinal cord injuries can be anything that generates nerve signals to the SANS and PANS, including: AD requires an immediate medical response, so your doctor will usually treat the condition on the spot. Treatment is based on the apparent symptoms, as well as pulse and blood pressure readings. Once the immediate emergency passes, your doctor will probably want to do a thorough examination and run diagnostic tests. These tests can help your doctor determine the exact cause and rule out other possible causes. The goal of emergency treatment is to lower your blood pressure and eliminate the stimuli triggering the reaction. Emergency measures may include: moving you into sitting position to cause the blood to flow to your feet removing any other potential triggers, such as drafts of air blowing on you or objects touching your skin administering vasodilators or other drugs to bring your blood pressure under control Long-term treatment and prevention should identify and address the underlying issues that trigger AD. A long-term treatment plan might include: changes in medication or diet to improve elimination medications or a pacemaker to stabilize your heartbeat The outlook is more uncertain if your condition is due to situations that are hard to control or unknown causes. Repeated episodes of uncontrolled spikes or drops in blood pressure can result in strokes or cardiac arrest. Work with your doctor to identify your triggers and take precautionary steps. If you can manage the triggers for AD, the outlook is good.

Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Pediatric ME/CFS has been defined as a complex, multisystemic, and debilitating illness that is characterized by severe and medically unexplained fatigue and is usually accompanied by post-exertional malaise (PEM), orthostatic intolerance and other signs of autonomic dysfunction, and cognitive problems, as well as by unrefreshing sleep, headache, and other pain symptoms (Carruthers et al., 2003, 2011; Jason et al., 2006, 2010). Pediatric ME/CFS presents with either an acute (which can be infectious or noninfectious) or a gradual onset. Several studies showed that a gradual-onset pattern is more frequent (Bell et al., 2001; Nijhof et al., 2011), while others found an acute infectious onset to be more common, seen in 88 to 93 percent of young patients with ME/CFS (Kennedy et al., 2010b; Sankey et al., 2006). Patients often follow a prolonged and complex path before receiving a diagnosis of pediatric ME/CFS. Sankey and colleagues (2006) estimate that the median time from the start of symptoms to diagnosis is 8.5 months, while Nijhof and colleagues (2011) report 17 months. The challenges of diagnosis are described in . The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health proposed pediatric criteria for ME/CFS in 2004 (Royal College, 2004). These authors considered whether a shorter time frame for diagnosis—3 months’ duration rather than the 6 months for adults—is appropriate for children. In the absence of compelling epidemiological data, the authors concluded that the diagnosis of ME/CFS requires 6 months. They nonetheless suggest that pediatricians be “prepared to make a positive diagnosis of CFS/ME when a child or young person has characteristic symptoms supported by normal results and when the symptoms are causing significant functional ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. impairment. This diagnosis does not depend on a specific time frame and a positive diagnosis of CFS/ME is not a prerequisite for the initiation of an appropriate management plan” (Royal College, 2004). The British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines, published in 2007, recommend a duration of symptoms of 3 months for children and young people (NICE, 2007). The International Association for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (IACFS/ME) developed a case definition for diagnosis of ME/CFS in children and adolescents using the DePaul Pediatric Health Questionnaire (DPHQ), a self-report measure for assessing ME/CFS symptoms in this population. This tool measures not only the presence of the symptoms but also their severity and frequency (Jason et al., 2006). The IACFS/ME Pediatric Case Definition incorporates elements of the Fukuda definition (see ) and follows the structure of the 2003 Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC). To make a diagnosis of ME/CFS, this definition requires the presence of symptoms more specific than those in the Fukuda definition, and it emphasizes the importance of such symptoms as dizziness, decreased endurance with symptoms, pain, and flu-like symptoms, which have frequently been reported by young ME/CFS patients (Jason et al., 2006). An important difference from the other case definitions is that the duration of symptoms required to make a diagnosis is 3 months rather than 6 months. However, subsequent work has shown that a large proportion of those with acute fatigue following infectious mononucleosis will take up to 6 months to improve (Jason et al., 2014; Katz et al., 2009). Most physicians and researchers still elect to apply the Fukuda definition when diagnosing these patients even though this definition was developed for use in research on the adult ME/CFS population (Knight et al., 2013b; Werker et al., 2013). The prevalence of pediatric ME/CFS has been estimated in British, Dutch, and U.S. populations with numbers that vary widely, from 0.03 to 1.29 percent (Chalder et al., 2003; Crawley et al., 2011; Farmer et al., 2004; Jordan et al., 2006; Nijhof et al., 2011; Rimes et al., 2007). The differing estimates may be due to the different methodologies used in these studies, the application of different ME/CFS definitions, the use of self-reported data obtained from patients instead of physician diagnoses, and the use of community-based rather than tertiary care samples. Besides differences in methodology, underreporting of ME/CFS may occur if physicians make a diagnosis of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) without assessing for ME/CFS, considering the large overlap in symptoms between these two entities in both children (Stewart et al., 1999b) and adults (Okamoto et al., 2012). ME/CFS has been reported less frequently in children younger than 10 years old than in older children (Bell et al., 2001; Davies and Crawley, 2008; Farmer et al., 2004). Some have ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. argued that this may reflect a lesser ability of children at these younger ages to describe changes in their activity and the degree of fatigue they experience (Bell, 1995a). Regarding gender, most studies found a greater prevalence in girls, with a female-to-male ratio ranging from 2:1 to 6:1 (Farmer et al., 2004; Knight et al., 2013a; Nijhof et al., 2011). Although the prognosis in this group often is described as being better than that in adults (Andersen et al., 2004; Cairns and Hotopf, 2005; Kennedy et al., 2010b), a very limited number of long-term follow-up studies reported recovery rates in the ME/CFS pediatric population. Several studies found that 20 to 48 percent of pediatric patients diagnosed using the Fukuda definition showed no improvement or actually had worse fatigue and physical impairment at follow-up times ranging from 2 to 13 years (Bell et al., 2001; Gill et al., 2004; Van Geelen et al., 2010). There is clear evidence of the impact of ME/CFS on the education and social development of these young people (Kennedy et al., 2010b; Walford et al., 1993). The stigma and social effects of pediatric ME/CFS include the loss of normal childhood activities and, in some extreme instances, inappropriate forcible separation of children from their parents (Holder, 2010). Numerous studies found that school attendance is significantly reduced in a large percentage of patients (Crawley and Sterne, 2009; Smith et al., 1991; Van Geelen et al., 2010; Werker et al., 2013). For instance, Nijhof and colleagues (2011) found that approximately 90 percent of the patients they studied had “considerable” school absence (defined as missing 15 to 50 percent of all school days) during the previous 6 months. Further, a U.K. study showed that ME/CFS was the primary cause of long-term health-related school absence (Dowsett and Colby, 1997). Therefore, the use of such labels as “school refusal” or “school phobia” should be considered only after careful and thorough assessment of these patients. A consistent definition is required to make an accurate diagnosis and to allow physicians to provide adequate treatment for these patients as well as to prevent erroneously labeling them as having a psychiatric condition or as being malingerers (Jason et al., 2006). When evaluating the available research to develop its findings, conclusions, and recommendations on pediatric ME/CFS, the committee was struck by the paucity of the research conducted to date in this population. For major ME/CFS symptoms such as PEM and sleep disturbances, no more than 10 papers were available on each of these topics. The methodology used to review the literature is described in . Moreover, to the limitations of the research base described in , it is important to add that numerous pediatric studies used a less restrictive ME/CFS definition than that used in other studies and classified children presenting with only “chronic fatigue” lasting for 3 months as ME/CFS cases, further complicating the understanding of this disease. With these caveats, the ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. remainder of this chapter reviews the evidence for pediatric patients with respect to the symptoms of adult ME/CFS discussed in and : PEM, orthostatic intolerance and autonomic dysfunction, neurocognitive manifestations, sleep-related symptoms, infection, immune impairment, neuroendocrine manifestations, and other symptoms (fatigue and pain). The potential for development of symptom constructs in pediatric ME/CFS also is discussed. PEM, as defined in , is the exacerbation of fatigue, cognitive problems, lightheadedness, pain, and a general sense of feeling sick after effort (see the section on PEM in adults in ). It is widely considered to be a central feature of ME/CFS. The prevalence of PEM was found to be 71 percent in Australian children at the time of presentation of ME/CFS (Knight et al., 2013a), 80 percent in a cross-sectional study of Dutch adolescents (Nijhof et al., 2011), and 97 percent in a large referral population of British children with ME/CFS (Davies and Crawley, 2008). Methodological differences account for some of the variability in PEM prevalence rates among studies. These differences may be related to the definition of the illness used, the duration of the illness at the time of the survey, the way the questions about PEM were posed, the types of effort (cognitive/physical activity or orthostatic stress) considered capable of provoking PEM symptoms, the duration of symptom provocation that qualified as PEM (hours versus more than 1 day), whether questions addressed symptom provocation for fatigue alone or for a wider range of posteffort symptoms, the numbers of questions asked to capture the desired information (the higher the number of questions asked, the higher the probability of detecting the phenomenon), the severity of the symptom provocation required to count as having PEM, and differences in the ongoing activity levels of the participants. As an example of the latter, after being evaluated and treated for ME/CFS, individuals might follow recommendations to modulate their activity to avoid triggering worse symptoms. The result would be a lower reported prevalence of PEM than these individuals might have reported if exposed to the same levels of physical, orthostatic, or cognitive stress (or combinations of these physiologic stressors) they experienced prior to the onset of illness. There is no standardized method of assessing PEM in children. Differences among studies in this regard may reflect in part the variability in the methods used to ask about the patients’ symptoms. ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. The committee examined the literature on the presentation of PEM in children and adolescents with ME/CFS and the differences compared with healthy or diseased controls. Data on PEM prevalence rates among active children or otherwise healthy sedentary controls typically have not been reported. No studies with concurrent controls investigated PEM symptoms in the days following formal exercise tests, and in contrast to the adult literature, no studies using a cardiopulmonary exercise test repeated the test the next day (Katz et al., 2010). Little work has been published on the prevalence of PEM in subsets of children or adolescents diagnosed with ME/CFS (e.g., those with gradual onset versus those with an apparent postinfectious onset). All three studies involving an exercise stress test identified autonomic or circulatory differences between ME/CFS cases and controls during the exercise challenge (Katz et al., 2010; Takken et al., 2007; Wyller et al., 2008b). Katz and colleagues (2010) compared 21 adolescents who developed ME/CFS after infectious mononucleosis with 21 controls who had recovered from mononucleosis. The ME/CFS individuals exercised less efficiently than recovered controls, with a borderline significant 11 percent difference in predicted peak oxygen consumption (p = 0.05) and a significantly lower peak oxygen pulse (O consumption per heartbeat) (p = 0.03). This study, however, did not find a significant difference in peak work capacity between ME/CFS patients and controls. Wyller and colleagues (2008b) compared 15 Norwegian adolescents with ME/CFS and 56 healthy adolescent controls. Those with ME/CFS had increased sympathetic activity at rest, with exaggerated cardiovascular responses to orthostatic stress, but attenuated cardiovascular responses to isometric exercise. Only one study assessed fatigue levels in pediatric ME/CFS patients and found that no child among the 20 who underwent exercise testing “reported excessive fatigue levels in the three days after the exercise test” (Takken et al., 2007, p. 582). Overall, despite the limited research on the effect of exercise testing in pediatric ME/CFS, there is sufficient evidence that PEM is common in these patients. The overlap in symptoms of pediatric orthostatic intolerance, most notably neurally mediated hypotension (NMH) and POTS, and pediatric ME/CFS was first emphasized in a small case series (Rowe et al., 1995) and a controlled study that included both adolescents and adults (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995). (The definitions of NMH and POTS are discussed in the sec- ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. tion on orthostatic intolerance and autonomic dysfunction in adults with ME/CFS in .) Stewart and colleagues (1999b) described in greater detail the differences among those with ME/CFS, those with POTS, and healthy controls. The prevalence of several symptoms was significantly higher in ME/CFS patients than in healthy controls: fatigue (100 versus 8 percent), lightheadedness (100 versus 15 percent), cognitive dysfunction (100 versus 0 percent), exercise intolerance (96 versus 23 percent), headache (92 versus 23 percent), sleep difficulties (80 versus 15 percent), and tender points (20 versus 0 percent). Those with POTS had an intermediate prevalence of the same symptoms. Of interest, frequent sore throat did not discriminate between ME/CFS patients and healthy children. The prevalence of orthostatic symptoms for adolescents with ME/CFS is above 90 percent (Stewart et al., 1999b; Wyller et al., 2008b). Assessment of Orthostatic Intolerance and Autonomic Dysfunction in Pediatric ME/CFS The methods used to assess for orthostatic intolerance are described in the section on orthostatic intolerance and autonomic dysfunction in adults with ME/CFS in . Evidence for Orthostatic Intolerance and Autonomic Dysfunction in Pediatric ME/CFS The committee examined the literature on the presentation of orthostatic intolerance and related autonomic abnormalities based on both patient report measures and objective testing in pediatric ME/CFS patients and the differences compared with healthy or diseased controls. The committee reviewed five studies that compared rates of orthostatic intolerance between controls and those with ME/CFS. Bou-Holaigah and colleagues (1995) included some adolescents, but the mean age of participants was 34, so this paper is not included here. Stewart and colleagues (1999a) describe NMH, POTS, or both in 96 percent (25/26) of adolescents with ME/CFS during the head-up tilt test. ME/CFS adolescents had a higher prevalence of circulatory abnormalities and clinical signs of acrocyanosis and cool extremities relative to those with recurrent syncope and healthy controls. Individuals with ME/CFS had a significantly higher mean heart rate and lower systolic blood pressure at rest and throughout the head-up tilt test compared with controls. ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. A study that assessed the impact of a 7-minute period of active standing in 28 Japanese adolescents with ME/CFS and 20 healthy adolescents showed that 57 percent of those with ME/CFS had orthostatic intolerance, compared with no healthy controls (p < 0.01), despite the brief duration of the orthostatic challenge. Among adolescents with ME/CFS, 18/28 experienced a prolonged reduction in oxy-hemoglobin during the 7 minutes of standing, compared with 4/20 controls (p < 0.01), a finding consistent with impaired cerebral hemodynamics (Tanaka et al., 2002). Wyller and colleagues (2007a) in Norway examined the response to mild orthostatic stress (15 minutes of head-up tilt to just 20 degrees) in 27 adolescents with ME/CFS and 33 controls. At rest, those with ME/CFS had a higher total peripheral resistance index (TPRI), lower stroke index, and lower end-diastolic volume index than controls. With a 20-degree upright tilt, individuals with ME/CFS had greater increases in heart rate, diastolic blood pressure (both p < 0.001), mean blood pressure, and TPRI, as well as greater decreases in stroke index. Several other studies published by Stewart’s and Wyller’s groups substantiate the findings from their studies mentioned above. However, the independence of the participants from one study to the next is not always clear. Galland and colleagues (2008) in New Zealand conducted a case-control study of 26 adolescents with ME/CFS and 26 controls. Participants underwent head-up tilt to 70 degrees for a maximum of 30 minutes, but could request that the test be stopped because of orthostatic symptoms before completion. Orthostatic intolerance was identified in 50 percent of ME/CFS patients versus 20 percent of controls (p = 0.04), with POTS being the most prominent problem in the ME/CFS patients. Adolescents with ME/CFS had a 3.2-fold increased risk of tachycardia during tilt. Katz and colleagues (2012) conducted a nested case-control study comparing responses to 10 minutes of active standing in 36 adolescents with ME/CFS after infectious mononucleosis and 43 recovered controls. At the 6-month point after recovery from infectious mononucleosis, 25 percent of ME/CFS patients and 21 percent of controls met the study definition for orthostatic intolerance, a null finding that stands out from the rest of the literature. Regardless of differences in methods of orthostatic testing, all studies with controls that examined adolescents with ME/CFS showed a numerically higher prevalence of circulatory disorders, most notably POTS and NMH, in ME/CFS patients. In most studies, the differences between ME/CFS patients and controls were statistically significant. ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Six studies compared heart rate variability in pediatric ME/CFS patients and controls (Galland et al., 2008; Stewart, 2000; Stewart et al., 1998; Wyller et al., 2007c, 2008a, 2011). These studies showed that the R-R interval and measures of heart rate variability were reduced in those with ME/CFS. All of the studies revealed a sympathetic predominance of heart rate control and enhanced vagal withdrawal during either mild or moderate orthostatic stress or lower-body negative pressure (a method of simulating orthostatic stress). Traditional autonomic tests, such as the response to Valsalva maneuver, were found to be normal in pediatric ME/CFS patients (Stewart, 2000), although there are few studies on the topic. Other Physiological Abnormalities Associated with Orthostatic Intolerance Sommerfeldt and colleagues (2011) identified polymorphisms in adrenergic control genes (catechol-O-methyltransferase, beta 2 adrenergic receptor) that were associated with differential changes in sympathovagal balance in ME/CFS. Rowe and colleagues (1999) found an association of ME/CFS and orthostatic intolerance with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). The association among EDS, joint hypermobility, chronic fatigue, and orthostatic intolerance has been confirmed by several other studies (De Wandele et al., 2014a,b; Gazit et al., 2003). One large randomized controlled trial compared the therapeutic and physiological responses to blocking of sympathetic tone with clonidine in 120 adolescents with ME/CFS. This study showed that successfully blocking sympathetic output with clonidine, as confirmed by a lower norepinephrine level in the treatment arm, led to worse ME/CFS symptoms, a lower number of steps per day, and lower C-reactive protein (Sulheim et al., 2014). The results were consistent with the hypothesis that systemic inflammation and sympathetic enhancement are mechanisms compensating for other physiological derangements in pediatric ME/CFS. Open treatment of orthostatic intolerance has been described as being associated with improvement in ME/CFS symptoms in at least a subset of adolescents with ME/CFS (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995; Rowe et al., 1995). Sulheim and colleagues (2012) report on a cohort study in which participants were seen at baseline and 3 to 17 months later. They confirm a correlation between improved hemodynamic variables on repeat 20-degree head-up tilt and improvement in fatigue, PEM, concentration problems, ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. and overall function. The authors conclude that the concomitant improvement in symptoms, autonomic cardiovascular control, severity of ME/CFS-associated fatigue, and functional impairments is consistent with a possible causal relationship among these variables. Neurocognitive manifestations are among the most commonly reported symptoms in children and adolescents with ME/CFS, cited by 66 to 84 percent of patients in recent studies from Australia, Great Britain, and the Netherlands (Davies and Crawley, 2008; Knight et al., 2013a; Nijhof et al., 2011). Assessment of Neurocognitive Manifestations in Pediatric ME/CFS Other than a history that focuses on problems with concentration, short-term memory, and attention span, more formal methods used to assess neurocognitive symptoms in ME/CFS include neuropsychological testing at baseline and under conditions of cognitive or physiological stress. One such measure is the n-back test, which evaluates working memory, attention, concentration, and information processing (see the section on neurocognitive manifestations in adults with ME/CFS in ). Questionnaires such as the Wood Mental Fatigue Inventory and elements from symptom surveys that address mental fatigue also are used to evaluate adolescents (Bentall et al., 1993; Wood et al., 1991). Evidence for Neurocognitive Manifestations in Pediatric ME/CFS The committee reviewed the literature to evaluate the neurocognitive symptoms experienced by pediatric ME/CFS patients and their differences from healthy and diseased controls. There are some broadly consistent themes. In study and clinic samples of those with pediatric ME/CFS not selected on the basis of greater difficulty with cognitive tasks, results of baseline neuropsychological testing are similar to those for healthy controls. Abnormalities emerge when participants are selected on the basis of increased difficulty with memory and concentration and when more complex challenges are employed, most notably those combining orthostatic and cognitive stresses (Haig-Ferguson et al., 2009; Kawatani et al., 2011; Ocon et al., 2012; Stewart et al., 2012; Tomoda et al., 2007; van de Putte et al., 2008). Two studies conducted with adequate methodology, describing the same group of patients, assessed the effects of combined orthostatic stress and increasingly challenging neurocognitive tasks (Ocon et al., 2012; Stewart et ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. al., 2012). The studies measured the response to n-back testing while supine and during progressive orthostatic stress (tilt table angles of 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 degrees). The authors conclude that orthostatic stress results in neurocognitive impairment in CFS/POTS but not in healthy controls. Stewart and colleagues (2012) also found that the expected increase in cerebral blood flow velocity during cognitive neuronal activation did not occur. These findings are partially supported by Wyller and Helland (2013), who examined relationships among symptoms and autonomic cardiovascular control in 38 children with ME/CFS using the NICE guidelines. Cognitive symptoms were significantly and independently associated with a higher baseline heart rate, an enhanced heart rate response to orthostatic challenge, and older age within the adolescent age range (Wyller and Helland, 2013). Unrefreshing sleep and specific sleep disturbances—including insomnia, sleep cycle disturbances, and excessive sleeping—are among the most common symptoms reported in pediatric ME/CFS patients. The prevalence estimates for these sleep problems range from 84 to 96 percent (Davies and Crawley, 2008; Knight et al., 2013a; Nijhof et al., 2011). Assessment of Sleep-Related Symptoms in Pediatric ME/CFS Sleep problems usually are assessed by patient self-report during the clinical history. More formal studies are supplemented by sleep quality questionnaires, actigraphy, and polysomnography. (See the section on sleep-related symptoms in adults with ME/CFS in .) Evidence for Sleep-Related Symptoms in Pediatric ME/CFS The committee examined the literature on the presence of sleep-related symptoms in children/adolescents diagnosed with ME/CFS compared with other children/adolescents (healthy or otherwise). Taken together, these studies (Bell et al., 1994; Huang et al., 2010; Knook et al., 2000; Ohinata et al., 2008; Stores et al., 1998) suggest that children with ME/CFS have sleep disturbances, but they do not have a high prevalence of more severe sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea or narcolepsy. The studies included in the committee’s review used different case definitions and different measures with limited overlap in outcome variables, and there was little replication of results. Their findings therefore need to be interpreted with caution. ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Two studies yielded higher-level data. Stores and colleagues (1998) performed home polysomnography in 18 British children with ME/CFS and 18 controls. Sleep efficiency was lower in those with ME/CFS (p < 0.001), in whom there were more awakenings of less than 2 minutes’ duration, more awakenings of greater than 2 minutes, less non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 2 sleep, and less rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Hurum and colleagues (2011) compared ambulatory recordings of heart rate and blood pressure in 44 adolescents with ME/CFS and 52 healthy controls. This study used a relatively broad definition of ME/CFS, requiring at least 3 months of fatigue but no other somatic symptoms. Participants with ME/CFS were studied while staying overnight at an accommodation service, and controls were studied at home. During sleep, the ME/CFS patients had significantly higher heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure. They also had higher heart rate during the waking hours. The abrupt onset of illness for some adolescents with ME/CFS has stimulated investigation into infectious etiologies of the illness. Estimates of the proportion of pediatric ME/CFS patients with an abrupt infectious onset vary greatly across studies, from 22 to 93 percent. In a population-based study of 184 children from the Netherlands, Nijhof and colleagues (2011) found an overall rate of 32 percent with an acute onset, 22 percent of whom had an illness that began with an apparent infection. This study used the Fukuda definition. In a retrospective review of 59 Australian children attending an ME/CFS specialist clinic, 62 percent reported an infectious onset (Knight et al., 2013a). In a retrospective cohort study, Sankey and colleagues (2006) reported an acute onset in 93 percent of children diagnosed using the Oxford criteria (Sharpe et al., 1991) and evaluated in an English ME/CFS specialty service. Methods for assessing the association of ME/CFS with infection are described in the section on infection in adults with ME/CFS in . The committee identified and reviewed the two largest studies of the highest methodological quality on this topic. One prospective cohort study examined the rates of ME/CFS following acute infectious mononucleosis (Katz et al., 2009). To be eligible, participants had to have infectious ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. mononucleosis, defined as a monospot-positive form of the illness. At 6, 12, and 24 months after infection, 13 percent, 7 percent, and 4 percent of adolescents, respectively, met criteria for ME/CFS, defined using the Jason pediatric criteria (Jason et al., 2006). There was a striking preponderance of females meeting ME/CFS criteria at all time points. At 6 months, 11.6 percent of females and 1.3 percent of males met criteria for ME/CFS, but only females continued to meet the criteria at 12 and 24 months (Katz et al., 2009). In a separate nested case-control study, stepwise logistic regression analysis identified (1) autonomic symptoms at baseline and (2) days spent in bed with the initial infection as the only significant risk factors for developing ME/CFS after infectious mononucleosis (Jason et al., 2014). In a cross-sectional comparison of 120 Norwegian adolescents with established ME/CFS and 68 healthy controls, Sulheim and colleagues (2014) examined serology for , Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and parvovirus B19. They also obtained results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for those organisms as well as for human herpes virus type 6 (HHV-6), enterovirus, and adenovirus. No adolescents with ME/CFS or controls were positive on PCR testing for , CMV, enterovirus, or adenovirus. PCR rates were low for the other infectious agents and did not differ between ME/CFS cases and healthy controls. Rates of seropositivity for immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies did not differ between ME/CFS patients and controls for any of the organisms for which testing was conducted (Sulheim et al., 2014). In investigating a cluster of seven cases of ME/CFS in a rural community of northern New York state, Bell and colleagues (1991) found no evidence that the following organisms were a cause of the illness: species, , CMV, EBV, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, parvovirus B19, , , and . A questionnaire distributed to the local school district identified 21 patients who met the criteria for ME/CFS, including 6 of the 7 index cases. These 21 were compared with 42 healthy controls, matching 2 controls to each case. Ingestion of raw milk, the presence of a second family member with ME/CFS symptoms, and a history of allergies or asthma emerged as risk factors for pediatric ME/CFS. One study examined antibodies to human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I antigens by Western blot and HTLV-II gag sequences by PCR. The total pediatric sample is reported as 21, but results are given for only 18 pediatric ME/CFS patients. Of these, 11 (61 percent) had evidence of anti-HTLV-I antibodies, versus 3/17 (18 percent) controls (comprising This information can be found in the supplemental material of the Sulheim et al. (2014) paper. ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. 7 healthy adults and 10 umbilical cord blood samples from newborns). PCR amplification of retroviral DNA was positive for the HTLV-II gag protein in 72 percent of the pediatric cases versus 12 percent of controls (DeFreitas et al., 1991). No age-matched pediatric controls were used in this study, and in the 23 years since publication of these results, they have not been independently confirmed. A paper from Scotland describes coxsackie B virus antibody seropositivity in 47 children ages 5 to 14 years with a diagnosis of ME/CFS. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, 18/47 (38 percent) were positive, compared with a published rate in children ages ≤ 14 years of 5.5 percent with a positive coxsackie B virus IgM (Bell et al., 1988). Other studies, notably the Norwegian study of Sulheim and colleagues (2014), did not confirm such a high seroprevalence rate, and it is unclear why the IgM antibodies would remain positive long after the onset of ME/CFS. A retrospective study of 53 children with ME/CFS in New Jersey found seropositivity for EBV and/or in 66 percent of patients. For those with less than 12 months’ (n = 30), 12 to 24 months’ (n = 17), or more than 24 months’ (n = 6) duration of ME/CFS, seropositivity for EBV or or both was 63 percent, 82 percent, and 33 percent, respectively (Petrov et al., 2012). Evidence of active infection has not been detected after the initial onset of ME/CFS. Pathogens for which the serological evidence argues against a causal role in a large proportion of pediatric ME/CFS cases are CMV, HHV-6, coxsackie viruses, and parvovirus B19. There has been relatively little study of enteroviruses, however, and there is a relative paucity of data on . Because ME/CFS often begins after an apparent infection, an important issue regarding the pathophysiology of the illness is whether its symptoms are due to a persistent infection or to the triggering infection acting as a “hit and run” phenomenon, initiating immune system or other physiologic dysfunctions that in turn cause chronic symptoms. Assessment of Immune Impairment in Pediatric ME/CFS Methods for assessing immune system dysfunction are described in the section on immune impairment in adults with ME/CFS in . ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Evidence for Immune Impairment in Pediatric ME/CFS Among the five studies identified as relevant to this topic, one used the Jason pediatric definition of ME/CFS (Jason et al., 2006) and the remaining four used the Fukuda definition (CDC, 2012). These study results should be interpreted with caution. Several important methodological factors limit the strength of the results, including the relatively small sample size of four of the studies (Broderick et al., 2012; Itoh et al., 2012; Kavelaars et al., 2000; Kennedy et al., 2010a), which raises questions about the representativeness of the results. No study reporting an abnormality appears to have been replicated. The studies varied widely in the types of immune dysfunction addressed. Abnormalities were examined in the following areas: both proliferative and inhibitory responses of T cells to specific agents (Kavelaars et al., 2000); elevations in interleukin (IL)-8 and reductions in IL-23 (Broderick et al., 2012); increased anti-Sa (a 62 kDa protein found in those with autoimmune fatigue syndrome) antibodies (Itoh et al., 2012); increased proportions of lymphocytes and neutrophils undergoing apoptosis (Kennedy et al., 2010a); responses to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (Rowe, 1997). Kavelaars and colleagues (2000) examined T cell proliferative responses to dexamethasone, as well as cytokine production by terbutaline, in 15 adolescents with ME/CFS and 14 controls. The peripheral blood cells of those with ME/CFS had higher proliferative responses of T cells to phytohemagglutinin (p = 0.044) and a lower inhibition of proliferation with dexamethasone (p = 0.001). The inhibitory effect of terbutaline on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production was significantly lower in the ME/CFS patients, and terbutaline led to less enhancement of IL-10 production. Broderick and colleagues (2012) used a 16-cytokine ELISA assay to compare 9 adolescents who met criteria for ME/CFS after infectious mononucleosis with 12 recovered controls at 24 months postinfection. There were significant differences in IL-8 and IL-23 between the two groups. IL-8 was significantly higher in the ME/CFS patients. IL-2 was also higher in the ME/CFS patients but less dramatically different from IL-2 levels in controls than was IL-8. IL-23 was significantly lower in the ME/CFS patients. IL-5 was lower as well, but less dramatically so. Katz and colleagues (2013) conducted a small case-control study in 9 adolescents who developed ME/CFS after infectious mononucleosis and 9 controls who had recovered ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. uneventfully from the same illness. There were no differences between the groups in natural killer (NK) cell numbers or function. Itoh and colleagues (2012) studied 15 Japanese children with fibromyalgia and 21 with ME/CFS over time. All had presented with fatigue. The authors measured antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), precipitin antibodies, T cells, B cells, and NK cells. Most fibromyalgia patients had low positive ANA titers in the 1:40 to 1:80 range; one had anti-Sa antibodies. ME/CFS participants had higher ANA titers, 11 of which had increased by the time ME/CFS was diagnosed. Among those with ME/CFS, 86 percent were positive for anti-Sa antibodies. The target antigen for anti-Sa antibodies is a lens epithelium-derived growth factor thought to confer resistance to stress-induced cell death (Itoh et al., 2012). These results have not been replicated in large samples. In contrast to data in adults with ME/CFS, lymphocyte subsets and NK cell activity were in the normal range in these ME/CFS patients. Kennedy and colleagues (2010a) examined 25 children with ME/CFS from Great Britain and 23 healthy controls, focusing on markers of oxidative stress and measures of apoptosis. The ME/CFS participants had a significantly lower proportion of normal neutrophils (28 versus 46 percent) and a correspondingly higher proportion of neutrophils undergoing apoptosis relative to the healthy children (54 versus 36 percent). Similarly, those with ME/CFS had a significantly lower proportion of normal lymphocytes (44 versus 65 percent) and a correspondingly higher proportion of lymphocytes undergoing apoptosis (40 versus 25 percent). Rowe (1997) conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial of IVIG in 71 Australian adolescents with ME/CFS. There was a significant improvement in overall function at 6-month follow-up in those who had received IVIG in a dose of 1 gram/kg (max 60 grams) monthly for 3 months. Cell-mediated immunity was abnormal in 52 percent of ME/CFS participants at baseline. Given the scientific strength of the randomized controlled trial design, the larger sample size, and the reported benefit of IVIG for pediatric ME/CFS patients, further investigation of IVIG in the pediatric ME/CFS population is warranted. The overlap of ME/CFS symptoms with those of adrenal insufficiency, together with inconsistent reports of lower cortisol values in adults with ME/CFS, has prompted several investigations into neuroendocrine abnormalities in pediatric ME/CFS. Similarly, reports of orthostatic intolerance have led to investigations of catecholamines and other hormones involved in the regulation of circulation in pediatric ME/CFS patients. ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Assessment of Neuroendocrine Manifestations in Pediatric ME/CFS Methods for assessing neuroendocrine abnormalities are described in the section on neuroendocrine manifestations in adults with ME/CFS in . Evidence for Neuroendocrine Manifestations in Pediatric ME/CFS The committee reviewed the available literature on neuroendocrine abnormalities in pediatric ME/CFS and the differences from those presented in healthy and diseased controls when available. Several studies consistently found statistically lower mean cortisol levels in those with ME/CFS compared with controls (Nijhof et al., 2014; Segal et al., 2005; Sulheim et al., 2014; Tomoda et al., 2001). A study in the Netherlands compared a group of 108 adolescents with ME/CFS and 38 controls and found that those with ME/CFS had lower cortisol levels after awakening. The shape of the cortisol curves was similar for those with ME/CFS and controls, and it is unclear whether any adolescent with ME/CFS had clinically significantly low cortisol levels as opposed to statistically significant differences from controls. Cortisol levels at baseline did not predict recovery from ME/CFS during follow-up. The initial hypocortisolism was reversed after recovery from ME/CFS (Nijhof et al., 2014). In another cross-sectional study comparing 120 individuals with ME/CFS and 68 controls, performed in conjunction with a randomized trial of clonidine, those with ME/CFS showed lower urine cortisol-to-creatinine ratios (Sulheim et al., 2014). Tomoda and colleagues (2001) also found lower levels of cortisol and a 3-hour delay in the peak shift in cortisol in ME/CFS patients using 24-hour indwelling catheter measurements of cortisol every 4 hours. Segal and colleagues (2005) used the low-dose synacthen test (LDST) to evaluate for subtle hypocortisolism in 23 children with ME/CFS and 17 controls of similar age and sex. The controls were retrospective, selected from among those with other endocrine disorders in whom an LDST had been performed with normal results. Studying a group suspected of having adrenal insufficiency would have been expected to bias against detection of a lower cortisol level in those with ME/CFS. Despite this limitation, children with ME/CFS had significantly lower mean cortisol levels than controls throughout the test. Their peak cortisol was lower, and the time to reach the peak level was longer. Girls had a more attenuated response to synacthen than boys. One study examined the interaction between the neuroendocrine and ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. immune systems by measuring cortisol, adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), adrenaline, noradrenaline, and T cell proliferative responses to phytohemagluttinin and dexamethasone; cytokine production in response to terbutaline; and the response to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in a small sample of ME/CFS patients and controls. ACTH and cortisol responses were similar in response to CRH. Those with ME/CFS had higher proliferative responses of T cells to phytohemagluttinin but lower inhibition of proliferation with dexamethasone. The inhibitory effect of terbutaline on TNF-alpha production was lower in the ME/CFS patients, and there was less enhancement of IL-10 production (Kavelaars et al., 2000). It is important to note, however, that even in studies reporting lower cortisol levels in adolescents with ME/CFS than in controls, the mean cortisol levels reported for those with ME/CFS remain within the normal range. Very little work has been done to determine whether the cortisol differences are related to sleep cycle abnormalities, as has been suggested in some adult studies, or are a secondary reflection of another aspect of being chronically ill. Two studies found elevations in supine epinephrine and norepinephrine in pediatric ME/CFS patients compared with controls (Sulheim et al., 2014; Wyller et al., 2008b). Kavelaars and colleagues (2000) also found higher epinephrine levels but no differences in supine norepinephrine levels in ME/CFS patients compared with controls. No differences were found between patients and controls for dopamine, normetanephrines, and metanephrines at rest (Wyller et al., 2007b). Tomoda and colleagues (2001) monitored deep body temperature in 41 Japanese children with ME/CFS and 9 controls. They found that the mean and nadir core body temperatures were higher in the ME/CFS patients than in the controls (both p < 0.0001). Wyller and colleagues (2007b) studied thermoregulatory responses in 15 Norwegian ME/CFS adolescents and 57 controls. At baseline, ME/CFS patients had higher norepinephrine, epinephrine, and tympanic temperature than controls. During cooling of one hand, acral skin blood flow was reduced, vasoconstrictor events occurred at lower temperatures, and tympanic temperatures decreased more. However, catecholamines increased similarly in the two groups. ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Knook and colleagues (2000) examined salivary melatonin levels in 13 adolescents with ME/CFS and 15 controls. Sleep onset and duration were the same in the two groups, but melatonin levels were higher in the ME/CFS patients, particularly after 10 PM. Wyller and colleagues (2010) examined 67 Norwegian adolescents with ME/CFS and 55 controls. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels were lower in those with ME/CFS. Plasma renin and osmolality were increased; aldosterone, cortisol, and sex hormones did not differ. Segal and colleagues (2005) found that thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, and prolactin were no different between ME/CFS and control groups. Levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione (A4), and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) for ME/CFS patients were similar to age and pubertal stage norms. These findings are relevant in light of the high incidence of orthostatic and circulatory dysfunction in pediatric ME/CFS. A study suggesting a role for childhood trauma in ME/CFS used the broad empirical definition of ME/CFS, which resulted in a biased sample with overrepresentation of individuals with depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Heim et al., 2009). The unusually high proportion of subjects with serious psychiatric problems likely explains the study finding of an association between ME/CFS and adverse childhood experiences. No other studies have suggested a higher rate of childhood trauma in those with confirmed ME/CFS as opposed to nonspecific chronic fatigue. In a study of 22 Norwegian adolescents with ME/CFS, no participant reported prior sexual abuse (Gjone and Wyller, 2009). Fatigue is universal in pediatric ME/CFS, usually to a degree that is sufficient in combination with other symptoms to lead to marked functional impairment (Davies and Crawley, 2008; Knight et al., 2013a; Nijhof et al., 2011). Kennedy and colleagues (2010b) showed that among 25 children with ME/CFS, recruited from support groups in the United Kingdom, only 1 attended regular classes. Compared with healthy controls, Child Health Questionnaire scores for the ME/CFS group were lowest on global health, physical function, and role/social limitations due to physical problems. Those with ME/CFS had lower physical function and greater general impairment than children with type 1 diabetes and asthma. Of 211 children with ME/CFS referred to a specialist clinic in England, 62 percent attended school 2 days per week or less. The factor most closely associated with school attendance was better physical function, whereas anxiety, gender, ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. and age at assessment were not associated. Increasing fatigue was associated with worse physical function (Crawley and Sterne, 2009). In pediatric ME/CFS studies, the prevalence of pain symptoms in the aggregate is relatively common at the time of presentation of ME/CFS, as demonstrated by a study of Australian children (Knight et al., 2013a), a cross-sectional study of Dutch adolescents (Nijhof et al., 2011), and a study of a large referral population of British children (Davies and Crawley, 2008). The most prevalent pain symptom is headaches, reported in 75 to 81 percent of patients in these studies. Reports of other specific pain symptoms are much more variable across studies and are less frequent than reports of headaches overall. Myalgia was observed in 52 to 73 percent, abdominal pain in 16 to 100 percent, arthralgia in 12 to 67 percent, sore throat in 25 to 62 percent, and tender glands in 12 to 50 percent of children (Bell, 1995b; Davies and Crawley, 2008; Knight et al., 2013a; Nijhof et al., 2011). Two pediatric studies used factor analysis to examine whether ME/CFS symptoms can be grouped in a way that defines separate phenotypes. Rowe and Rowe (2002) found that the pattern of symptoms in adolescents with ME/CFS was similar to the pattern in Australian adults, although nausea, abdominal pain, fevers, sweats, sore throat, and tender glands were more prevalent among the adolescents. Their sample included 189 adolescents ages 10 to 18 years who had noted a definite onset of ME/CFS over hours to several days, as well as 68 healthy adolescents. Among those with ME/CFS, more than 87 percent had experienced the following within the preceding month: prolonged fatigue following minor activity, headache, the need for excessive sleep, loss of ability to concentrate, disturbed sleep, excessive muscle fatigue, and myalgia following minor activity. In more than 60 percent, these symptoms were rated as moderately severe or severe. Interestingly, 14 of the symptoms had a low response frequency among both ME/CFS cases and controls and were grouped as somatic or involuntary muscle sensations. These factors were not a good fit to the data, accounting for less than 79 percent of the variance and covariance. Reports of symptoms unrelated to ME/CFS had low frequencies. The authors concluded that evidence for somatization disorder among those with ME/CFS was negligible. In contrast, factor analysis applied to the 24 symptoms judged to be salient on the basis of their frequency and severity scores identified five factors labeled muscle pain and fatigue, neurocognitive, abdominal/head/chest pain, neurophysiological, and immunological. This model accounted for 97 percent of the variance and covariance in the observed data. The immunological symptoms had significant direct and indirect effects on the ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. other four key symptom factors and were thus judged to be primary (Rowe and Rowe, 2002). May and colleagues (2010) performed exploratory factor analysis on 333 children and adolescents evaluated at the Bath specialist ME/CFS service. The median age of the participants was 14.9 years, with a range of 2 to 18 years. Three main phenotypes were identified. Based on the symptom clusters, these were labeled musculoskeletal, migraine, and sore throat. The musculoskeletal factor had the heaviest loading on muscle pain, joint pain, and hypersensitivity to touch, and it appears to be closest to the category for muscle pain and fatigue in the Australian model. The migraine factor had the heaviest loading on headaches, abdominal pain, nausea, hypersensitivity to light/noise/touch, and dizziness, and it appears to be similar to the abdominal, head, and chest pain factor in the Australian model. The sore throat phenotype loaded most heavily on sore throat and tender glands, thereby appearing to be similar to the immunological factor in the Australian model. The British factor analysis did not identify factors that corresponded to the neurocognitive and neurophysiological models in the Australian work. Among the three phenotypes, the musculoskeletal factor had the strongest association with fatigue, while the sore throat phenotype was the least severely affected group. The migraine group had the lowest physical function and had worse school attendance. None of the phenotypes was associated with depression; the migraine phenotype was associated with increased anxiety (May et al., 2010). The two factor analyses thus achieved some qualitative similarity, although comparisons are limited by the different methods used to group and rate symptoms and by the types of symptoms collected. For example, the ascertainment of lightheadedness and other symptoms of orthostatic intolerance was incomplete. Whether the heterogeneous phenotypes reflect distinctive pathophysiologic factors is unknown. The data on orthostatic intolerance (notably POTS and NMH) and autonomic dysfunction in pediatric ME/CFS are strong and consistent across case definitions. While the available studies suggest the presence of only subtle neurocognitive problems at rest, children and adolescents with ME/CFS develop more robust and significant cognitive abnormalities under conditions of orthostatic stress or distraction. The evidence also indicates that PEM and unrefreshing sleep are common in pediatric ME/CFS, although studies are needed to better characterize the optimal method of assessing for these phenomena in children. Despite the evidence that these different pain symptoms are common in the aggregate, the high variability in the prevalence of these symptoms supports the committee’s decision to ""6 Pediatric ME/CFS.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. not require pain for a diagnosis of ME/CFS. It is well documented that ME/CFS can follow EBV and non-EBV infectious mononucleosis. There is no evidence that other pathogens are consistently associated with the onset of pediatric ME/CFS. While there is no evidence of classic immunodeficiency or endocrine disorders in pediatric ME/CFS, the literature describes several discrete abnormalities in immune and endocrine system function in affected children and adolescents. These findings need to be interpreted with caution because of several important methodological issues and the lack of replications of these studies. The committee adopted a 6-month duration of symptoms for the diagnosis of ME/CFS in children based on the literature described earlier in the chapter. Nonetheless, the committee emphasizes that this time criterion should not interfere with initiating appropriate symptom-based management long before 6 months has elapsed in children presenting with prolonged fatigue. Symptomatic treatment can begin at any point after the onset of fatigue as the diagnostic process continues to evaluate and exclude other potential causes for the patient’s symptoms. presents the committee’s recommendations on diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS in children and adolescents. There is sufficient evidence that orthostatic intolerance and autonomic dysfunction are common in pediatric ME/CFS; that neurocognitive abnormalities emerge when pediatric ME/CFS patients are tested under conditions of orthostatic stress or distraction; and that there is a high prevalence of profound fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, and post-exertional exacerbation of symptoms in these patients. There also is sufficient evidence that pediatric ME/CFS can follow acute infectious mononucleosis and EBV. Andersen, M. M., H. Permin, and F. Albrecht. 2004.

Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are serious, debilitating conditions that affect millions of people in the United States and around the world. ME/CFS can cause significant impairment and disability. Despite substantial efforts by researchers to better understand ME/CFS, there is no known cause or effective treatment. Diagnosing the disease remains a challenge, and patients often struggle with their illness for years before an identification is made. Some health care providers have been skeptical about the serious physiological - rather than psychological - nature of the illness. Once diagnosed, patients often complain of receiving hostility from their health care provider as well as being subjected to treatment strategies that exacerbate their symptoms. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome proposes new diagnostic clinical criteria for ME/CFS and a new term for the illness - systemic exertion intolerance disease(SEID). According to this report, the term myalgic encephalomyelitis does not accurately describe this illness, and the term chronic fatigue syndrome can result in trivialization and stigmatization for patients afflicted with this illness. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome stresses that SEID is a medical - not a psychiatric or psychological - illness. This report lists the major symptoms of SEID and recommends a diagnostic process.One of the report's most important conclusions is that a thorough history, physical examination, and targeted work-up are necessary and often sufficient for diagnosis. The new criteria will allow a large percentage of undiagnosed patients to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate care. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome will be a valuable resource to promote the prompt diagnosis of patients with this complex, multisystem, and often devastating disorder; enhance public understanding; and provide a firm foundation for future improvements in diagnosis and treatment. 3 Current Case Definitions and Diagnostic Criteria, Terminology, and Symptom Constructs and Clusters 4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations 5 Review of the Evidence on Other ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations Appendix D: Questionnaires and Tools That May Be Useful for Assessing ME/CFS Symptoms Appendix E: Biographical Sketches of Committee Members, Consultants, and Staff You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

The chapter then examines in turn the evidence on fatigue, post-exertional malaise (PEM), sleep-related symptoms, neurocognitive manifestations, and orthostatic intolerance and autonomic dysfunction in ME/CFS. One of the most significant challenges to achieving a better understanding of ME/CFS results from the methodological limitations of the current research base. Issues related to external and internal validity and to reliability frequently have led to inconsistent results across studies, as well as other shortcomings. Despite these limitations, however, the committee was able to glean evidence of symptoms, signs, and objective measures for ME/CFS. The evidence with respect to major symptoms and manifestations is presented in this chapter, while that related to other symptoms and manifestations and to pediatric ME/CFS is reviewed in and , respectively. This review of the evidence serves as the basis for the committee’s proposed diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, which are presented in . Studies on ME/CFS used different inclusion criteria and different sources of ME/CFS patients and control participants. The end result is het- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. erogeneity in both patient and control cohorts, creating an unclear picture of the symptoms and signs of the disorder and its outcomes. Findings are based on samples with a large majority of middle-aged women (late 40s to early 50s) who are Caucasian and of higher educational status, perhaps limiting the generalizability of the studies. Very few studies focused on other population subsets, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, or included ethnic and racial minority patients. Some studies recruited patients from specialized ME/CFS treatment centers, while others used community-based samples. These different sampling methods may result in patient groups that differ in demographic characteristics and symptom type and severity. Furthermore, those most severely affected by ME/CFS may be bedridden or homebound and may not have been included in any of these studies (Wiborg et al., 2010). Thus, there are selection biases in the studies’ sample composition. Some limitations also stem from issues regarding the case definitions or diagnostic criteria used in the studies (see for a review). Although a strong majority of studies used the Fukuda definition, a small number used various other definitions, thus complicating comparisons of the results. A major limitation of the Fukuda and other ME/CFS case definitions is their polythetic diagnostic criteria. Thus, two patients could have very little symptom overlap yet both be diagnosed with ME/CFS. Therefore, there is potential heterogeneity within and across patient samples in the literature that cannot be assessed because of the lack of reporting of symptom prevalence in most studies (Jason et al., 2012b). This problem is inherent in the study of any illness with polythetic diagnostic criteria. Finally, because most studies used the Fukuda definition to select cases, it is not possible to fully assess the evidence for the other diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. In many cases, studies lacked properly matched controls to account for confounders. The majority of published studies compared a small number of ME/CFS patients with healthy controls. Control groups including people with other illnesses, sedentary individuals, or people who meet different case definitions of ME/CFS have not commonly been used. Because almost all controls were healthy and most were physically active, the findings from those studies do not shed light on which symptoms and signs distinguish ME/CFS from other disorders with some overlapping symptoms. Some contradictory findings may also be due to the use of various scales, instruments, and measures for symptoms, some of which are imprecise, not comprehensive, or not validated. ME/CFS symptoms were derived mainly from patient self-reports, which raises questions about the internal validity of the study results. Moreover, relatively few studies were ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. longitudinal, so little light has been shed on the natural history of ME/CFS (Jason et al., 2011b). There also were few studies of the early stages of the illness. This is understandable given that the diagnosis can be made only after 6 months of symptoms (see and below), but nevertheless is a barrier to understanding the natural history of the illness. A lack of replication and validation in many studies limits the ability to assess the study findings critically. Few attempts have been made to follow up on or replicate intriguing findings in the literature to date. The dictionary definition of fatigue as a noun is “weariness from bodily or mental exertion.” Fatigue is not typically considered a disease but is commonly used in medicine to represent a broad spectrum of tiredness, from the physical, cognitive, or emotional feeling at the end of a long day to the emotional or physical toll of acute, chronic, or terminal illness (Gambert, 2005). Fatigue is one of the most common and nonspecific presenting complaints in primary care. Unfortunately, the word “fatigue” does not convey information about the cause, severity, or chronicity of fatigue or its impact on functionality. Although fatigue is a common experience, it has no unique physiological explanations or objective markers. A broad range of physical, medical, and mental health conditions and stressors may result in the complaint of fatigue (Matthews et al., 1991). Aging alone is associated with a gradual increase in fatigue and reduction in functional capacity for a variety of reasons (National Institute on Aging, 2007). Although overlap exists, fatigue usually can be distinguished from somnolence (also called drowsiness or sleepiness), which often is attributed to deprivation of sleep, primary sleep disorders, or sedating medications (Hossain et al., 2005). Thus, clinicians are challenged to integrate the subjective and objective evidence that can help identify the neurologic, malignant, infectious, inflammatory, cardiopulmonary, metabolic, endocrinologic, physical deconditioning, pharmacologic, or mental health factors that may underlie the presenting complaint of fatigue. (Note that a complete discussion of the differential diagnosis of fatigue is beyond the scope of this report.) Patients with ME/CFS almost always suffer from fatigue, and the importance of the symptom is illustrated by its central role in most of the ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. case criteria developed to date (see ). Regardless of what criteria are used, however, ME/CFS patients often have a level of fatigue that is more profound, more devastating, and longer lasting than that observed in patients with other fatiguing disorders. In addition, fatigue in ME/CFS is not the result of ongoing exertion, not lifelong, and not particularly responsive to rest (Jason and Taylor, 2002). Patients describe their fatigue as “exhaustion, weakness, a lack of energy, feeling drained, an inability to stand for even a few minutes, an inability to walk even a few blocks without exhaustion, and an inability to sustain an activity for any significant length of time” (FDA, 2013, p. 7). Some of the more extreme examples include “too exhausted to change clothes more than every 7-10 days”; “exhaustion to the point that speaking is not possible”; and “exertion of daily toileting, particularly bowel movements, sends me back to bed struggling for breath and feeling like I just climbed a mountain.” A few patients describe a “tired but wired” feeling (FDA, 2013, p. 14). Numerous efforts have been made to measure the nature and extent of fatigue in this population (Furst, 1999; Whitehead, 2009). Some patients improve, but most continue to experience some level of fatigue, physical and/or mental, ranging from mild to profound (Wilson et al., 1994). Jason and colleagues (2009) found that those with ME/CFS frequently report the occurrence of several distinct fatigue states that may diverge from commonplace perceptions of fatigue among the general population. They examined dimensions of fatigue in ME/CFS using a unique 22-item ME/CFS Fatigue Types Questionnaire administered to 130 patients and 251 healthy controls. Factor analysis demonstrated a five-factor structure of fatigue for ME/CFS patients and a one-factor solution for controls. The five types of fatigue that differentiated ME/CFS patients from controls were postexertional, wired, brain fog, energy, and flu-like fatigue (Jason et al., 2009, 2010a), clearly showing the complex nature of fatigue in ME/CFS. Earlier efforts to assess fatigue were made (Jason et al., 2011a), among others, by Chalder and colleagues (1993), who developed the Fatigue Scale; by Ray and colleagues (1992), who created the Profile of Fatigue-Related Symptoms; by Smets and colleagues (1995), who developed the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20); and by Krupp and colleagues (1989), who developed the Fatigue Severity Scale. Regarding the duration of fatigue, the Fukuda definition and the Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC) require 6 months for a diagnosis of ME/CFS. This 6-month requirement is supported by Nisenbaum and colleagues (1998), who showed that unexplained fatigue lasting for more than 6 months was related to symptoms included in the ME/CFS case definitions and that most other causes of similar fatigue do not last beyond 6 months. In their review of 39 measures of fatigue, Whitehead and colleagues (2009) found that although some measures were better than others, none ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. were ideal. Most measures have insufficient sensitivity and specificity to encompass all of the various and important aspects of fatigue in ME/CFS (Jason et al., 2011a). In addition, health care providers should note that a single assessment of fatigue severity may not provide a full understanding of the patterns of fatigue presenting over 1 day in ME/CFS patients (Jason and Brown, 2013). Fatigue may be most relevant when assessed relative to its impact on function. However, disability caused by fatigue may not reflect the levels of fatigue a patient is experiencing. For instance, despite feeling extremely fatigued, a person may continue working to survive economically and stop only when functionally impaired (Jason and Brown, 2013). provides additional examples and rates of functional impairment due to ME/CFS symptoms. In general, patients with ME/CFS experience a marked decrease in function across an array of domains, frequently attributed, at least in part, to their fatigue (Komaroff et al., 1996a). Efforts have been made to assess the impact of the disease on patients’ function, but most such efforts have been research based. One of the more commonly used tools in medical research as well as in ME/CFS studies is the Short Form 36-Item Questionnaire (SF-36) of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) (McHorney et al., 1993; Ware, 2002), a standardized and validated 36-item patient-report questionnaire with eight principal components or subscales used to determine the impact of illness on functionality. Early studies used this tool to distinguish ME/CFS from major depression, multiple sclerosis, acute infectious mononucleosis, hypertension, congestive heart failure, type II diabetes mellitus, acute myocardial infarction, unexplained chronic fatigue, and healthy controls (Buchwald et al., 1996; Komaroff et al., 1996a). The VT (vitality) subscale of the MOS SF-36, for example, a questionnaire used to assess function, is thought to reflect both mental and physical function (McHorney et al., 1993) and includes the sum of four questions about having a lot of energy, being full of life/pep, feeling worn out, or feeling tired, with higher scores reflecting greater vitality (Ware, 2002). VT scores are consistently much lower in ME/CFS patients with and without comorbidities than in healthy controls and patients with other chronic illnesses, including fibromyalgia. Examples of mean VT scores on the MOS SF-36 from various published studies for the general population and those with ME/CFS and other chronic fatiguing illnesses are summarized in to demonstrate the profoundly low scores for ME/CFS compared with the other conditions. Several of the studies in the table do not specify the scoring algorithm (raw versus normalized t score) for the MOS SF-36, ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Mean VT Score on the MOS SF-36 for ME/CFS Versus Other Fatigue Conditions NOTES: CHF NYHA III = congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class III; FM = fibromyalgia; HC = healthy control; HD = hemodialysis; HepC = chronic hepatitis C (without cirrhosis); MCS = multiple chemical sensitivity; MD = major depression; MSD 4+ = at least 4 musculoskeletal diseases; RA = rheumatoid arthritis; SSc = scleroderma/systemic sclerosis; VT = vitality subscale of the MOS SF-36. so that bias may exist in comparing VT scores across the studies. However, this bias is unlikely to explain the clear differences seen between the ME/CFS and non-ME/CFS groups in . While Jason and Brown (2013) demonstrated that the VT scores of ME/CFS patients ranged from 15 to 25 depending on subtyping strategies, other domains often are affected as well. Nacul and colleagues (2011a) found that scores on the role-physical (RP) subscale of the SF-36 were even more affected than scores on the VT subscale (version 2) but that all domains were impaired, with mental health being the best preserved. Jason and colleagues (2011c) found that impairments in VT, social functioning, and RP had the greatest sensitivity and specificity in identifying patients who met the Fukuda definition of ME/CFS. In one early study, all eight subscores of the SF-36 were lower in ME/CFS patients than in the general population and other disease comparison controls, with the exception of the mental health and role-emotional subscales in the controls with major depression (Komaroff et al., 1996a). It should be noted that, while widely used in research, the SF-36 may not be well suited to general clinical use because of user fees and the gen- The RP subscale combines the scores of four questions related to physical activity.

Brown and Jason, 2007; Buchwald et al., 1996; Jason and Brown, 2013; Komaroff et al., 1996a eral process of having to submit test results to the sponsor for scoring. The RAND-36 is an alternative version that is freely accessible, but it has a complex scoring algorithm (RAND, 1984). Fatigue, chronic fatigue, and particularly the impact of fatigue on function should be assessed in making a diagnosis of ME/CFS. Health care providers may use a range of questions and instruments to evaluate fatigue and its impact on function in these patients (see , ). However, ME/CFS should not be considered merely a point on the fatigue spectrum or as being simply about fatigue. Experienced clinicians and researchers, as well as patients and their supporters, have emphasized for years that this complex illness presentation entails much more than the chronic presence of fatigue. Other factors, such as orthostatic intolerance, widespread pain, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive dysfunction, and immune dysregulation, along with secondary anxiety and depression, contribute to the burden imposed by fatigue in this illness. The challenge in understanding this acquired chronic debility, unfortunately named “chronic fatigue syndrome” for more than two decades, will be to unravel those complexities. ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. There is sufficient evidence that fatigue in ME/CFS is profound, not the result of ongoing excessive exertion, and not substantially alleviated by rest. This fatigue results in a substantial reduction or impairment in the ability to engage in pre-illness levels of occupational, educational, social, or personal activities and persists for more than 6 months. PEM is an exacerbation of some or all of an individual’s ME/CFS symptoms that occurs after physical or cognitive exertion and leads to a reduction in functional ability (Carruthers et al., 2003). As described by patients and supported by research, PEM is more than fatigue following a stressor. Patients may describe it as a post-exertional “crash,” “exhaustion,” “flare-up,” “collapse,” “debility,” or “setback.” PEM exacerbates a patient’s baseline symptoms and, in addition to fatigue and functional impairment (Peterson et al., 1994), may result in flu-like symptoms (e.g., sore throat, tender lymph nodes, feverishness) (VanNess et al., 2010); pain (e.g., headaches, generalized muscle/joint aches) (Meeus et al., 2014; Van Oosterwijck et al., 2010); cognitive dysfunction (e.g., difficulty with comprehension, impaired short-term memory, prolonged processing time) (LaManca et al., 1998; Ocon et al., 2012; VanNess et al., 2010); nausea/gastrointestinal discomfort; weakness/instability; lightheadedness/vertigo; sensory changes (e.g., tingling skin, increased sensitivity to noise) (VanNess et al., 2010); depression/anxiety; sleep disturbances (e.g., trouble falling or staying asleep, hypersomnia, unrefreshing sleep) (Davenport et al., 2011a); and difficulty recovering capacity after physical exertion (Davenport et al., 2011a,b). In some cases, patients experience new symptoms as part of the PEM response. The following quote reflects the breadth and severity of symptoms associated with PEM in these patients: when I do any activity that goes beyond what I can do—I literally collapse—my body is in major pain, it hurts to lay in bed, it hurts to think, I can’t hardly talk—I can’t find the words, I feel my insides are at war. My autonomic system is so out of whack! I can’t see farsighted and glasses won’t help—only rest. My GI system is so messed up. Any food hurts it. I tried everything from elimination diets to all the GI meds. Nothing is working. My body jerks. The list goes on. There are days that I just want to cry because I can’t take care of myself—I need help. But, I have no help Personal communication; public comments submitted to the IOM Committee on the Diagnostic Criteria for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome for meeting 1, 2014.

I am sorry that I am not dying in the short-term, but I am living life waiting to die because no one takes this disease seriously. The types and thresholds of triggers of PEM, its onset, and its duration may vary among individuals and over the course of illness. PEM may occur after physical (Bazelmans et al., 2005; Davenport et al., 2011b; Nijs et al., 2010) or cognitive exertion (Arroll et al., 2014; Cockshell and Mathias, 2014; Smith et al., 1999). Patients also have described other potential triggers, such as emotional distress (Davenport et al., 2011a), physical trauma, decreased sleep quantity/quality, infection, and standing or sitting up for an extended period (FDA, 2013; Ocon et al., 2012). The type, severity, and duration of symptoms may be unexpected or seem out of proportion to the initiating trigger, which may be as mild as talking on the phone or being at the computer (Spotila, 2010). Patients report that PEM can be severe enough to render them bedridden (FDA, 2013). Although PEM may begin immediately following a trigger, patients report that symptom exacerbation often may develop hours or days after the trigger has ceased or resolved. Likewise, some studies have shown that PEM may occur quickly, within 30 minutes of exertion (Blackwood et al., 1998), while others have found that patients may experience a worsening of symptoms 1 to 7 days after exertion (Nijs et al., 2010; Sorensen et al., 2003; Van Oosterwijck et al., 2010; White et al., 2010; Yoshiuchi et al., 2007). The delayed onset and functional impairment associated with PEM also is supported by actigraphy data. ME/CFS participants enrolled in a walking program designed to increase their steps by about 30 percent daily were able to reach this goal initially, but after 4 to 10 days their steps decreased precipitously (Black and McCully, 2005). PEM is unpredictable in duration, potentially lasting hours, days, weeks, and even months (FDA, 2013; Nijs et al., 2010).

In several studies, healthy controls declared themselves recovered within 24 to 48 hours after physical or cognitive exertion, whereas fewer than 31 percent of ME/CFS subjects had returned to their prestressor baseline state by this time, and as many as 60 percent were still experiencing multiple symptoms after 1 week (Cockshell and Mathias, 2014; Davenport et al., 2011b; VanNess et al., 2010). The prevalence of PEM among ME/CFS patients as diagnosed by existing criteria varies from 69 to 100 percent (Chu et al., 2013; De Becker et al., 2001; Jason et al., 2011b; Kerr et al., 2010; Nacul et al., 2011b; Vermeulen and Scholte, 2003; Zhang et al., 2010). In a longitudinal study that followed a random, community-based sample for 10 years, 100 percent of participants fulfilling the Fukuda definition reported PEM as a symptom at some point during their illness (Jason et al., 2011b), even though the Fukuda definition does not require PEM for diagnosis. Prevalence estimates of PEM vary for two major reasons: (1) some studies use ME/CFS case definitions that require PEM, while others list it as an optional symptom; and (2) the way PEM is defined, operationalized, or queried for can affect how patients interpret the concept of PEM and whether they endorse it (Jason et al., 1999, 2004, 2014). The prevalence of PEM in healthy control subjects is considerably lower than in ME/CFS patients, ranging from 4 to 8 percent (Hawk et al., 2006b; Jason et al., 2011b; Kerr et al., 2010; Komaroff et al., 1996b; Zhang et al., 2010). Jason and colleagues (2013b) found that a greater percentage of ME/CFS patients than healthy controls experienced PEM symptoms (see ). After moderate thresholds for frequency and severity were applied, the percentage of controls who endorsed PEM decreased further, from 7 to 19 percent to 2 to 7 percent. Thus, applying increased severity or frequency thresholds for PEM may assist in identifying patients with ME/CFS (Hawk et al., 2006b). A few studies that compared ME/CFS with other diseases found that, although PEM was experienced by 19 to 20 percent of subjects with major Jason and colleagues (2013b) compared 236 ME/CFS patients with 86 healthy controls who completed the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire, rating the frequency and severity of 54 symptoms. Patient data were obtained from the SolveCFS BioBank, which includes patients diagnosed by a licensed physician using either the Fukuda definition or the CCC.

One study found that 64 percent of patients with major depressive disorder experienced PEM, but the authors did not describe how PEM was assessed (Zhang et al., 2010). As mentioned earlier, these prevalence estimates may vary depending on how PEM was defined and queried for, and thus they need to be interpreted with caution. PEM can be assessed subjectively by clinical history. It also can be assessed by standardized symptom questionnaires specific to ME/CFS and by comparison of self-reported symptoms and objective measures (such as functional impairment) before and after exertion or other types of stressors. Instruments and tools for individually assessing various symptoms exacerbated by PEM triggers are discussed in other sections of this chapter. This section is focused on questionnaires and objective tests used to determine whether a patient experiences PEM. Self-report questionnaires currently ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. are the more readily available way to assess whether a patient experiences PEM. Objective testing for PEM generally is costly and not easily accessible, and it may worsen the patient’s condition (Diamond, 2007; Nijs et al., 2010). Standardized symptom questionnaires with self-report items used to assess PEM include the CFS Medical Questionnaire (Komaroff et al., 1996c), CFS Screening Questionnaire (Jason et al., 1997), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Symptom Inventory (SI) (CDC, 2005), ME/CFS Fatigue Types Questionnaire (MFTQ) (Jason et al., 2009), and DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (DePaul Research Team, 2010). These questionnaires, which include items designed to measure the presence, duration, frequency, or severity of PEM, were developed from patient input to query specifically about PEM, and some were tested for psychometric properties (Hawk et al., 2006b; Wagner et al., 2005). However, they have been used primarily for subject recruitment in research, for comparison of diagnoses in research protocols, or for epidemiological assessments. Use of a standardized instrument is critical to measuring PEM accurately because slight differences in wording on various self-report items have been shown to change the prevalence of PEM in the same group of patients (Jason et al., in press); thus, how one asks about PEM can influence the responses. As indicated earlier in this chapter, individual experiences of PEM may vary widely in terms of triggers, onset, duration, severity, impairment, and symptoms that are exacerbated. For example, patients for whom normal daily activities, such as unloading the dishwasher, trigger PEM may not engage in exercise. Thus, an item that asks about fatigue after exercise will not capture these patients’ experiences with PEM. Similarly, responses to this item will not indicate PEM in patients who experience symptom exacerbation after cognitive exertion (Jason et al., in press). Thus, development of a sufficiently inclusive but probing clinical instrument is essential. Emerging evidence for objective indicators that may help us understand the presentation of PEM in ME/CFS patients centers on the two commonly reported domains in the PEM complex: recovery after physical exertion and cognitive function. Objective assessment of cognitive function is discussed in the section on neurocognitive manifestations later in this chapter. One common characteristic of PEM is delayed ability to return to prior levels of physical capacity after physical exertion. One way to have them demonstrate this delayed lack of recovery in patients with ME/CFS is to ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. have them perform two cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) separated by 24 hours—the first to assess current level of function and elicit illness relapse (CPET 1) and the second to measure changes in exercise capacity due to the challenge (CPET 2) (Keller et al., 2014; Snell et al., 2013; Vermeulen et al., 2010). However, the committee emphasizes that the CPET is not required to diagnose patients with ME/CFS. Further, this test carries substantial risk for these patients as it may worsen their condition (Nijs et al., 2010; VanNess et al., 2010). The CPET is used clinically to assess exercise capacity (maximal oxygen consumption or VOmax) and predict outcomes in cardiac patients. VOmax measured during repeated CPETs is both reliable (test-retest difference < 7 percent) (Katch et al., 1982; Taylor et al., 1955; Weltman et al., 1990) and reproducible (r > 0.95-0.99) (Balady et al., 2010; Bruce et al., 1973; Taylor et al., 1955). Several studies have found that, despite meeting objective indicators of maximal effort during both CPETs, ME/CFS patients have significantly lower results on CPET 2 than on CPET 1 on one or more of the following parameters: VOmax (Keller et al., 2014; VanNess et al., 2007; Vermeulen et al., 2010), VO at ventilatory threshold (Keller et al., 2014), and maximal workload or workload at ventilatory threshold (Keller et al., 2014; Snell et al., 2013). These findings support the 2-day CPET protocol as an objective indicator that physical exertion may decrease subsequent function in some ME/CFS patients. By contrast, a single CPET may be insufficient to document the abnormal response of ME/CFS patients to exercise (Keller et al., 2014; Snell et al., 2013). Although some ME/CFS subjects show very low VOmax results on a single CPET, others may show results similar to or only slightly lower than those of healthy sedentary controls (Cook et al., 2012; De Becker et al., 2000; Farquhar et al., 2002; Inbar et al., 2001; Sargent et al., 2002; VanNess et al., 2007). Thus, the functional capacity of a patient may be erroneously overestimated and decreased values attributed only to deconditioning. Repeating the CPET will guard against such misperceptions given that deconditioned but healthy persons are able to replicate their results, even if low, on the second CPET. The committee conducted a targeted literature search to identify research comparing self-reported or objectively assessed PEM in ME/CFS subjects and in those without the illness. The methodology used is described in . The findings from the literature are described below, but there are several limitations to consider when interpreting the evidence base, as described at the beginning of this chapter. ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Many studies found that fatigue increased and was prolonged after a physical stressor to a greater extent in ME/CFS patients than in healthy or sedentary controls. Findings of increased fatigue were consistent across different types of physical stressors, including subsequent maximal exercise tests (Davenport et al., 2011a,b), single maximal exercise tests (Bazelmans et al., 2005; Kishi et al., 2013; LaManca et al., 1998, 1999b, 2001; Meyer et al., 2013; Togo et al., 2010; VanNess et al., 2010), and other physical stressors (Black et al., 2005; Gibson et al., 1993; Nijs et al., 2010). When studies differentiated between mental and physical fatigue, both were found to have worsened in ME/CFS patients (Light et al., 2009, 2012; White et al., 2010, 2012). As noted earlier, cognitive exertion also may trigger increased mental and physical fatigue in ME/CFS patients (Arroll et al., 2014; Cockshell and Mathias, 2014). Mental fatigue tracks closely with physical fatigue (Light et al., 2009, 2012; Meyer et al., 2013; White et al., 2012). Subjected to a 3-hour standardized neuropsychological battery, healthy subjects experienced mental fatigue during and up to 3 hours after testing but recovered full mental energy, on average, by 7 hours posttest. In contrast, at 24 hours posttest, ME/CFS subjects continued to experience significant mental fatigue and did not return to their pretest mental energy levels for an average of 57 hours (Cockshell and Mathias, 2014). Exacerbation of Cognitive Symptoms Following Exertion or Orthostatic Challenge Although cognitive problems are common in ME/CFS patients, few studies have examined the effect of exertion on cognitive function. Some studies have demonstrated that a physical or orthostatic stressor may cause exacerbation of cognitive symptoms, including difficulty with concentration (Nijs et al., 2010); deficits in the speed of information processing (LaManca et al., 1998); and other self-reported cognitive problems (Meyer et al., 2013; VanNess et al., 2010). Studies also have shown decreased cognitive performance, such as on tests of focused and sustained attention, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, the Stroop test, and the N-back task (Blackwood et al., 1998; LaManca et al., 2001; Ocon et al., 2012). Findings of other studies, however, suggest that cognitive problems do not worsen after physical exertion (Claypoole et al., 2001; Cook et al., 2005; Yoshiuchi et al., 2007). Cognitive exertion also may trigger cognitive symptoms (Capuron et al., 2006; Ocon et al., 2012). For example, one study asked ME/CFS subjects and healthy controls to complete computerized tests of memory, at- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. tention, and psychomotor function and found that as the tests progressed, the performance of the ME/CFS subjects worsened significantly more than that of controls (Smith et al., 1999). On the other hand, the findings of some studies suggest that cognitive exertion alone may not necessarily trigger cognitive problems (LaManca et al., 1998; Marshall et al., 1997). These inconsistent results may be attributable to variations in subject selection, exercise testing procedures, and cognitive testing, which inhibit direct comparisons among studies. Many studies have demonstrated that pain is increased and prolonged after a physical stressor in ME/CFS subjects compared with healthy or sedentary controls. Similar to the evidence base for fatigue, reports of increased pain among ME/CFS subjects are consistent across maximal exercise tests (Davenport et al., 2011a,b; VanNess et al., 2010) and other physical stressors (Black et al., 2005; Nijs et al., 2010). In at least two studies, though, the increase in pain after exertion among ME/CFS subjects was not statistically significant compared with controls (Bazelmans et al., 2005; Kishi et al., 2013). In addition to the strong evidence demonstrating post-exertional effects on fatigue status, cognitive function, and pain, evidence is mounting for other symptoms and outcomes, albeit from a lesser number of studies to date. After an exercise stressor, ME/CFS patients compared with healthy controls demonstrated delayed recovery of muscle function and pH (Jones et al., 2010, 2012; Paul et al., 1999), increased depression or mood disturbances (Arroll et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2013), inappropriate autonomic responses (Cordero et al., 1996; LaManca et al., 2001), and amplification of problems with sleep (Davenport et al., 2011a,b; Kishi et al., 2013; Togo et al., 2010). Further studies confirming the different expression of genes (Light et al., 2009, 2012; Meyer et al., 2013; White et al., 2012) and immune biomarkers (Maes et al., 2012; Nijs et al., 2010, 2014; Sorensen et al., 2003; White et al., 2010) in patients with ME/CFS in response to physical exertion may help us to better understanding the pathophysiology of PEM. The existence of PEM can help physicians confirm a diagnosis of ME/CFS earlier rather than only after extensive exclusion of other conditions. Several studies have found that PEM best distinguishes ME/CFS from idio- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. pathic chronic fatigue (Baraniuk et al., 2013; Jason et al., 2002a) and may help distinguish it from other fatiguing conditions with a lower frequency of PEM, such as multiple sclerosis and major depressive disorder (Hawk et al., 2006a; Komaroff et al., 1996b). Further, PEM may be an important prognostic indicator because its continued presence or increased duration predicts a poorer outcome for ME/CFS patients (Taylor et al., 2002). PEM is a worsening of a patient’s symptoms and function after exposure to physical or cognitive stressors that were normally tolerated before disease onset. Subjective reports of PEM and prolonged recovery are supported by objective evidence, including failure to normally reproduce exercise test results (2-day CPET) and impaired cognitive function. These objective indices track strongly with the presence, severity, and duration of PEM. Patients’ experience of PEM varies, and some patients may have adapted their lifestyle and activity level to avoid triggering symptoms. As a result, health care providers should ask a range of questions (see , ) to determine whether PEM is present. Minimally, patients should be asked to describe baseline symptoms, the effects of physical or cognitive exertion, the time needed to recover to the pre-exertion state, and how they have limited their activities to avoid these effects. If the patient is unable to answer these questions clearly, health care providers may also ask the patient to track symptoms, activities, and rest in a diary—for example, in order to identify PEM patterns. There is sufficient evidence that PEM is a primary feature that helps distinguish ME/CFS from other conditions. Patients with ME/CFS frequently experience sleep-related problems such as insomnia, sleep disturbances, unrefreshing sleep, and nonrestorative sleep (FDA, 2013; Fossey et al., 2004). These symptoms are included in all existing ME/CFS case definitions and diagnostic criteria (see ). Unrefreshing sleep, or feeling as tired upon waking as before going to bed, is among the most common symptoms reported by ME/CFS patients, and only a small percentage of patients diagnosed with ME/CFS fail to report some type of sleep dysfunction (Carruthers et al., 2003; IACFS/ME, 2014; Jason et al., 2013b). This section summarizes the evidence on sleep-related signs and symptoms in ME/CFS reviewed by the committee to determine ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. whether such symptoms should be a component of its recommended diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. ME/CFS patients are more likely than healthy controls to experience sleep-related symptoms occurring at least half of the time and of at least moderate severity (see ) (Jason et al., 2013b). Although sleep-related symptoms also are reported by healthy persons and by chronically fatigued persons who do not fulfill ME/CFS criteria, a greater percentage of people fulfilling ME/CFS criteria report unrefreshing sleep, sleep disturbances, and difficulties falling asleep or waking up early in the morning (Komaroff et al., 1996a; Krupp et al., 1993; Nisenbaum et al., 2004) relative to these other groups. Sleep-related complaints may change throughout the course of the illness. For example, one study found that in the first few months of the illness, ME/CFS patients complain of hypersomnia, but as the disease progresses, they have trouble staying asleep (Morriss et al., 1997). A cross-sectional study of randomly selected patients found that sleep-related symptoms may become less frequent over the course of the illness (Nisenbaum et al., Percentage of ME/CFS patients and healthy controls reporting sleep-related symptoms of at least moderate severity that occurred at least half of the time during the past 6 months. NOTE: All patients fulfilled the Fukuda definition for CFS. SOURCE: Jason et al., 2013b. ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. 2003); however, this may be due to behavioral adaptation or changes in sleep medication. Sleep-related symptoms are listed differently in the various diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS (see ), and there is conflicting evidence on whether ME/CFS patients fulfilling different diagnostic criteria experience sleep-related symptoms differently. Those fulfilling the CCC reported significantly worse (in terms of frequency and severity, p < 0.05) unrefreshing sleep (Jason et al., 2012a, 2013a) and more difficulty falling asleep (Jason et al., 2012a) relative to those fulfilling the Fukuda definition. Similarly, another BOX 4-1 Sleep-Related Symptoms in Case Definitions and Diagnostic Criteria for ME/CFS 1994 Fukuda Case Definition of CFS (Fukuda et al., 1994) Unrefreshing sleep is a minor criterion (not required). Sleep apnea and narcolepsy are exclusionary conditions (as they are conditions that explain chronic fatigue). Canadian Consensus Criteria for ME/CFS (Carruthers et al., 2003, p. 16) Sleep dysfunction, including unrefreshing sleep or sleep quantity or rhythm disturbances such as reversed or chaotic diurnal sleep rhythms, is a required criterion for diagnosis. “Loss of the deeper phases of sleep is especially characteristic, with frequent awakenings, and loss of restorative feelings in the morning. Restless leg syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder often accompany sleep disturbance.” “It is important to rule out treatable sleep disorders such as upper airway resistance syndrome, obstructive and central sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome.” 2011 International Consensus Criteria for ME (Carruthers et al., 2011, p. 330) Sleep disturbance is a minor criterion (not required), which includes – disturbed sleep patterns, such as insomnia, prolonged sleep including naps, sleeping most of the day and being awake most of the night, frequent awakenings, awaking much earlier than before illness onset, and vivid dreams/nightmares; and – unrefreshing sleep, such as awakening feeling exhausted regardless of duration of sleep and daytime sleepiness. “Sleep disturbances are typically expressed by prolonged sleep, sometimes extreme, in the acute phase and often evolve into marked sleep reversal in the chronic stage.” ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. study found that patients fulfilling the International Consensus Criteria for ME (ME-ICC) reported significantly worse symptom scores for unrefreshing sleep, need to nap during each day, difficulty falling asleep, and difficulty staying asleep relative to those fulfilling the Fukuda definition (Brown et al., 2013). In contrast to these results, however, are those from two other studies. One study found that more patients fulfilling the Fukuda definition reported greater difficulty staying asleep than those fulfilling the CCC (Jason et al., 2004), while a second study reported no significant differences in sleep-related symptom scores between patients fulfilling the Fukuda definition and those fulfilling the ME-ICC (Jason et al., 2014). Regardless, it is clear that all the major diagnostic criteria include sleep-related symptoms. Chronic fatigue may be caused by sleep disorders; thus, most diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS require ruling out primary or treatable sleep disorders before a diagnosis of ME/CFS can be made (see ). Sleep apnea—whether obstructive, central, or undefined—is an exclusionary condition in several criteria, but there is less consistency regarding whether other sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy or the spectrum of obstructive or central sleep disorders, truly exclude ME/CFS (Carruthers et al., 2003; Fukuda et al., 1994; Jason et al., 2010b; NICE, 2007). Some researchers have noted that the inclusion of unrefreshing or nonrestorative sleep as a case-defining symptom, combined with listing sleep disorders as exclusionary conditions, may confuse the diagnosis and management of ME/CFS (Mariman et al., 2012; Unger et al., 2004). Taking a careful history of sleep complaints can help a clinician identify whether objective testing of patients with such complaints is indicated. As noted above, sleep-related symptoms may change over time in ME/CFS patients, and it is possible for sleep disorders to develop over the course of the illness (Morriss et al., 1997; Nisenbaum et al., 2003; Reeves et al., 2006). Furthermore, it is plausible that the development of other symptoms, such as pain or headache, over time may cause or contribute to sleep disorders, or that the development of a primary sleep disorder leads to widespread pain. Also, many ME/CFS patients are prescribed medications that may improve or worsen sleep-related symptoms (Armitage, 1999; Foral et al., 2011; Kierlin and Littner, 2011; Trivedi et al., 1999). Patients reporting symptoms of primary sleep disorders should be thoroughly evaluated to identify or rule out these conditions, as diagnosis and treatment of primary sleep disorders may be effective in reducing or relieving such symptoms (Qanneta, 2013; Reeves et al., 2006). Identifying insomnia in some patients may be useful therapeutically because techniques known to alleviate insomnia have been shown to be effective in fibromy- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. algia, a comorbid condition occurring in some ME/CFS patients (Edinger et al., 2005). Several questionnaires exist with which to capture patient-reported sleep symptoms and assess the subjective quality of sleep or sleep-related symptoms, although readily accessible clinical tools are not easy to find. The DePaul Symptom Questionnaire includes several items that can be used to assess the frequency and severity of symptoms that indicate sleep dysfunction in ME/CFS patients (DePaul Research Team, 2010). The Sleep Assessment Questionnaire also has been found to describe sleep abnormalities experienced by ME/CFS patients (Unger et al., 2004). And although not developed specifically for ME/CFS, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a validated tool for assessing subjective sleep quality (Buysse et al., 1989). It is important to consider frequency and severity thresholds when assessing subjective sleep complaints. In a study using the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire, for example, 65 percent of healthy controls reported unrefreshing sleep that occurred with mild severity at least a little of the time, yet only 16 percent of healthy controls reported unrefreshing sleep that occurred with moderate severity at least half of the time (Jason et al., 2013b). The percentages of ME/CFS patients reporting unrefreshing sleep at the same thresholds were 99 and 92 percent, respectively. Complaints of sleepiness or fatigue so severe as to result in a substantial decrease in activity often lead to referral to a sleep laboratory for evaluation of underlying sleep pathology. Polysomnography (PSG), the continuous monitoring of variables that define sleep states and stages, is a type of sleep study used to diagnose sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and narcolepsy (Kasper et al., 2005; Kushida et al., 2005). Sleepiness usually is the driving symptom for referral for PSG, yet many ME/CFS patients do not undergo sleep studies because they report being fatigued rather than being sleepy (Spitzer and Broadman, 2010a). And although PSG can be useful for diagnosing primary sleep disorders that are often comorbid with ME/CFS, many ME/CFS patients have normal sleep studies despite complaining of nonrestorative sleep (Reeves et al., 2006). Recently, new ways of assessing sleep quality have emerged and have been applied to assess these abnormalities in ME/CFS patients. The classic method for assessing sleep is to record the electroencephalogram (EEG) of a patient every 30 seconds to determine the stage of sleep (Kushida et al., 2005). In contrast, one new method uses the actual waveform of the EEG and determines power at different frequencies (Armitage et al., 2007; Duffy et al., 2011). Another new approach assesses transitions between sleep stages and determines the probability of occurrence of each transition (Kishi et al., 2008). PSG requires spending the night in a sleep laboratory, which limits its ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. use to those who are willing and able to travel to the laboratory for testing. PSG also may be less accessible in nonurban areas or too costly to include in a routine assessment (Oliveira et al., 2014; Rosen et al., 2012). However, home-based recording is a possibility. Moreover, the development of ambulatory monitoring methods, such as wrist actigraphy, may increase access to these diagnostic tests (Blackman et al., 2010; Corral-Penafiel et al., 2013; Libman et al., 2009). However, this method has been normed only for healthy people (Marino et al., 2013), and its use in people with sleep problems still needs to be validated. And, of course, wrist actigraphy cannot be used to evaluate patients for conditions such as sleep apnea (Morgenthaler et al., 2007). The committee conducted a targeted literature search to identify research comparing self-reported or objectively assessed sleep-related symptoms and signs in ME/CFS subjects and in those without the illness. Details of the search methodology are described in . The findings from the literature are described below, but there are several limitations to consider when interpreting the evidence base, in addition to those discussed earlier. In general, the design and implementation of these studies was highly heterogeneous. Most articles document case-control studies in which symptoms or signs were compared in groups of subjects with and without ME/CFS. Most studies used healthy controls as a comparison group, and several compared twin pairs in which one twin was diagnosed with ME/CFS and the other was healthy. Fewer studies used controls affected by other illnesses. The studies assessed varied outcomes of interest. Self-reported symptoms were assessed with many different questionnaires and scales. Several studies used PSG, but many used different testing protocols or diagnostic thresholds for sleep disorders. As with other literature on ME/CFS, the use of different diagnostic criteria for patient selection limits comparisons across studies. In particular, because of the variations in diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, some studies excluded patients with primary sleep disorders, while others included them. The following subsections describe in turn the evidence for primary sleep disorders in patients with ME/CFS and the evidence for sleep abnormalities in patients with ME/CFS that do not have primary sleep disorders. Note that for many studies, it was unclear whether ME/CFS patients with sleep disorders were included or excluded; these studies are not discussed below. ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Many of the sleep-related symptoms reported by ME/CFS patients—difficulty falling asleep, frequent or sustained awakenings, early-morning awakenings, and nonrestorative or unrefreshing sleep (persistent sleepiness despite sleep of adequate duration)—are types of insomnia (Kasper et al., 2005; Watson et al., 2003). Insomnia can have many causes, including other sleep disorders, such as sensory motor disorders (restless leg syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder), narcolepsy, and sleep disordered breathing (SDB). SDB constitutes a spectrum of breathing problems during sleep that range from subtle changes in the pattern of breathing to more severe snoring and obstructive sleep apnea. These disorders may result in multiple arousals during sleep, which can produce the daytime symptoms of sleepiness or fatigue (Cowan et al., 2014). Primary sleep disorders are fairly common in ME/CFS patients, with prevalence ranging from 19 to 69 percent (Creti et al., 2010; Gotts et al., 2013; Le Bon et al., 2000; Reeves et al., 2006). Studies have found sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome to be present in 13 to 65 percent of patients, followed by periodic limb movement disorder (4 to 25 percent), narcolepsy (5 to 7 percent), and restless leg syndrome (4 percent) (Creti et al., 2010; Gotts et al., 2013; Le Bon et al., 2000; Reeves et al., 2006). Effective treatments are available for many of these sleep disorders, but there is little evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing the sleep-related symptoms of ME/CFS aside from those caused by the sleep disorder. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a common treatment for SDB, and while it has been shown to reduce fatigue and sleepiness in people with obstructive sleep apnea (Tomfohr et al., 2011), reports of its improving ME/CFS symptoms are limited (Qanneta, 2014). One study of CPAP treatment in ME/CFS patients with sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (SAHS), a condition within the spectrum of SDB, found no difference in sleep-related symptoms between patients who were and were not compliant with the CPAP treatment. Further, there were no significant differences in symptoms, quality of life, or activity levels between ME/CFS patients with and without SAHS (Libman et al., 2009). One inference from these few studies is that sleep disorders can be considered an exclusionary diagnosis for ME/CFS only if treatment of the sleep disorder cures the ME/CFS symptoms. Some researchers have suggested that sleep disorders should be considered comorbid conditions rather than exclusionary criteria for a diagnosis of ME/CFS (Jackson and Bruck, 2012; Libman et al., 2009). Studies comparing clinical presentation in ME/CFS patients with and without sleep disorders have found no differences between the two groups (Le Bon et al., 2000; Libman et al., 2009), ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. but greater functional impairment has been reported in ME/CFS patients with some sleep disorders (Morriss et al., 1993). Studies that included ME/CFS patients with sleep disorders have found other objective abnormalities during sleep studies. One study found mean sleep latency to be greater in ME/CFS patients than in healthy controls (Bailes et al., 2006). Another found that ME/CFS patients spent less total time than controls in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (Whelton et al., 1992). And in another study, ME/CFS patients compared with controls experienced significantly lower sleep efficiency—the ratio between sleep time and total recording time—and significantly more time awake after falling asleep (Morriss et al., 1993); these results have been replicated (Togo et al., 2008). The studies described below excluded ME/CFS subjects that had previously been diagnosed with a sleep disorder. The authors of most of these studies explicitly describe their exclusion criteria, but studies also are included below if they selected participants that fulfilled the Fukuda definition for CFS, because sleep apnea and narcolepsy are exclusionary conditions. The selection criteria also may have differed in other ways (e.g., medication status), and the study designs (e.g., the type of control group) may have varied as well. Most of these studies found that ME/CFS patients without sleep disorders reported significantly more subjective sleep complaints than controls, but as described later, many failed to find major differences in objective measures of sleep (Majer et al., 2007; Reeves et al., 2006; Watson et al., 2004). More ME/CFS patients than controls reported unrefreshing sleep (Majer et al., 2007; Reeves et al., 2006) and problems sleeping (Majer et al., 2007). Self-reported sleep quality was significantly worse in ME/CFS patients than in healthy controls as measured by the PSQI (Le Bon et al., 2012; Neu et al., 2007, 2011; Rahman et al., 2011) and other questionnaires (Majer et al., 2007; Watson et al., 2004). PSQI sleep quality scores, however, were not associated with objective measures of sleep quality (Neu et al., 2007). ME/CFS patients also reported significantly more fatigue and sleepiness than healthy controls (Le Bon et al., 2012). A number of studies have compared sleep parameters measured through PSG in ME/CFS patients and healthy controls; however, comparisons across studies are difficult to make because of the use of various case definitions and methods of measurement. One study examined pairs of twins in which one twin had ME/CFS and the other was healthy. ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Compared with the healthy twins, the twins with ME/CFS reported more subjective complaints of insomnia, but objective measures of sleep were “remarkably similar” (Watson et al., 2003). Other studies generally have found only minor objective differences between ME/CFS patients and suitable comparison groups (Armitage et al., 2009; Majer et al., 2007; Neu et al., 2007; Reeves et al., 2006) or differences that were not statistically significant (Ball et al., 2004; Le Bon et al., 2007; Sharpley et al., 1997). These studies found that ME/CFS patients had decreased total sleep time, resulting in decreased sleep efficiency and less time spent in deep sleep, with some evidence for disturbed sleep in the form of more arousals and longer periods of being awake after sleep onset. There is growing evidence that ME/CFS patients experience abnormal sleep continuation compared with healthy controls. In one study, ME/CFS patients had higher levels of microarousal, despite the study’s exclusion of sleep disorders normally associated with microarousals (Neu et al., 2008). A study of sleep transitions also found that ME/CFS patients were more likely than normal controls to awaken during sleep, especially during the later hours of sleep (Kishi et al., 2008). The use of stratification strategies may help. One study stratified on sleep latency and sleep time to propose different sleep phenotypes (Gotts et al., 2013). Another stratified patients according to whether they felt more or less sleepy the morning after versus the night before the sleep study (Togo et al., 2008). The patients who reported feeling less sleepy had normal PSG, while those who reported feeling more sleepy showed evidence of more disrupted sleep. Also, in a follow-up study conducted after subjects had performed a stress test, patients who reported being less sleepy after a night of sleep had normal PSG, while those who reported feeling more sleepy were the group with sleep disruption (Togo et al., 2010). Multiple sleep latency tests (MSLTs) may be used to measure objective daytime sleepiness, which is characteristic of narcolepsy. Subjects are asked to nap, and the time it takes them to fall asleep—latency to nap—is measured several times during the day and averaged to determine a mean sleep latency for naps (Johns, 2000). A shortened latency to nap is indicative of increased sleepiness. One group of researchers found shortened latency to nap in ME/CFS patients compared with healthy controls (Neu et al., 2008; Watson et al., 2004), while others have failed to find significant differences (Majer et al., 2007; Reeves et al., 2006). The results of these studies suggest that narcolepsy is not a significant factor in ME/CFS. Supporting that conclusion is one study reporting an opposite result after a night of sleep deprivation. While one would expect this manipulation to result in short sleep latencies, the researchers found that one-third of the patients had difficulty falling asleep (Nakamura et al., 2010b). Such an outcome is consistent with the idea that the sleep disruption of some ME/CFS patients may reflect ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. a problem with sleep initiation and maintenance. It is important to note that MSLT can be used reliably to diagnose narcolepsy only when patients are in a stable state off potentially sedating medications (Thorpy, 1992). To study more homogeneous groups of patients, some researchers have examined sleep characteristics in different subgroups of ME/CFS patients. As an example, ME/CFS patients who also had postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) were found to have reduced daytime hypersomnolence compared with those without POTS (Lewis et al., 2013). Chronic pain is a common factor in sleep disorders resulting from a medical condition (Fishbain et al., 2010). A frequent cause of chronic widespread pain is fibromyalgia (FM)—a diagnosis that has substantial overlap with ME/CFS (Ciccone and Natelson, 2003). Several studies have compared evidence in ME/CFS patients with FM (CFS+FM) and those without FM (CFS only). In one study, FM was less frequent among ME/CFS patients with objective sleepiness as measured by short MSLT (< 10 minutes) (Le Bon et al., 2000). Some studies have found no differences in sleep parameters as measured through PSG between CFS+FM and CFS-only patients (Fischler et al., 1997; Spitzer and Broadman, 2010a,b). A study examining sleep-stage dynamics found differences between CFS+FM and CFS-only groups in transition probabilities and rates among sleep stages (Kishi et al., 2011). In CFS-only patients, the probability of transition from REM sleep to awake was significantly greater than in healthy controls. CFS+FM patients experienced significantly greater probabilities and rates of transition from waking, REM sleep, and S1 to S2, as well as greater probabilities and rates of transition from slow wave sleep (SWS) to waking and S1. Thus, CFS-only patients differed from those with CFS+FM. Another study found evidence of increased IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine that may contribute to disrupted sleep, during the sleep of CFS-only but not CFS+FM patients (Nakamura et al., 2010a); however, the magnitude of the difference was small. The role of cytokines in regulating sleep in ME/CFS remains a research question. Standard sleep studies are not substantially abnormal in people with ME/CFS. Several studies have found differences in sleep architecture in subsets of people with ME/CFS and in people with ME/CFS compared with healthy controls (Whelton et al., 1992), yet the current evidence base is not Fischler and colleagues (1997) did not exclude sleep disorders. ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. strong enough to identify ME/CFS-specific sleep pathology. It is clear, however, that people with ME/CFS universally report experiencing unrefreshing sleep, and further research will be important to determine whether there is a specific sleep abnormality common to ME/CFS patients or a heterogeneity of abnormalities that may define subsets of ME/CFS patients. In several case definitions and diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, primary treatable sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and narcolepsy are listed as exclusionary criteria for an ME/CFS diagnosis. However, there is evidence to suggest that primary sleep disorders should be considered important comorbid conditions in the differential diagnosis and that sleep complaints are complex. Further, there is little evidence that treatment of primary sleep disorders improves ME/CFS symptoms rather than simply reduces symptoms of the comorbid disorder. Despite the absence of an objective alteration in sleep architecture, the data are strong that the complaint of unrefreshing sleep is universal among patients with ME/CFS when questions about sleep specifically address this issue. While PSG is not required to diagnose ME/CFS, its use to screen for treatable sleep disorders when indicated is appropriate. Diagnosis of a primary sleep disorder does not rule out a diagnosis of ME/CFS. Description of Neurocognitive Manifestations in ME/CFS Impairments in cognitive functioning are one of the most frequently reported symptoms of ME/CFS. Patients describe these symptoms as debilitating and as affecting function as much as the physical symptoms that accompany this disease. During a survey of ME/CFS patients, descriptions of neurocognitive manifestations included, among others, “brain fog,” “confusion,” disorientation,” “hard to concentrate, can’t focus,” “inability to process information,” “inability to multitask,” and “short-term memory loss” (FDA, 2013). The short-term memory problems of ME/CFS patients include difficulty remembering something they just read. Patients usually report slowed information processing and impaired psychomotor functioning in more general terms as overall mental fatigue or slowed thinking (Constant et al., 2011; Larun and Malterud, 2007). In more severe cases, patients have difficulty completing tasks that require sustained attention and report problems performing even relatively simple activities such as watching television (FDA, 2013). Studies of the exact nature of neurocognitive deficits reported by patients with ME/CFS have shown that some patients meeting various current criteria for ME/CFS have different or ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. more severe impairments than others, but also that self-reported severity of impairments is not always associated with severity based on objective measures (Cockshell and Mathias, 2013). Prevalence of Neurocognitive Manifestations in ME/CFS Patients Estimates of the prevalence of neurocognitive manifestations in ME/CFS patients vary as a result of the different definitions used in research and the assessment of these manifestations using patient reports. The 2003 CCC, 2010 Revised CCC, and 2011 ME-ICC require the presence of neurological/cognitive manifestations for a diagnosis of ME/CFS, while the 1994 Fukuda definition and 2007 British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) Clinical Guidelines do not. Moreover, these various case definitions and diagnostic criteria are inconsistent in the manifestations or symptoms listed for this category. For instance, the Fukuda definition includes only “impaired memory or concentration” as one optional criterion, while the CCC requires the presence of two or more difficulties from a more extensive list of cognitive (confusion, impairment of concentration and short-term memory consolidation, disorientation, difficulty with information processing) or neurologic (perceptual and sensory disturbances, ataxia, muscle weakness, and fasciculations) manifestations. A study conducted in Belgium in a population of patients with chronic fatigue found a prevalence of 93 percent for attention deficit, 85.6 percent for memory disturbance, and 75.5 percent for difficulties with words for those fulfilling the Fukuda definition (De Becker et al., 2001). When applying frequency and severity scores of at least 2, Jason and colleagues (2013b) found that a greater percentage of ME/CFS patients than healthy controls reported neurocognitive symptoms of at least moderate severity that occurred at least half of the time (see ). Assessment of Neurocognitive Manifestations in ME/CFS Measurement of cognitive functioning is a challenge for researchers. While theoretical distinctions often are made among areas of cognition, such as memory, attention, and motor functioning, there presently are no “pure” measures that can directly test different areas of cognition individually rather than in the aggregate. Thus, while results of a specific neuropsychological test may be interpreted as evidence of a particular cognitive deficit, such as poor working memory, it is likely that any given test is actually measuring multiple aspects of cognitive function simultaneously. Additionally, an important distinction must be made between objective measures of cognitive deficits, which measure participants’ performance on cognitively demanding tasks, and subjective measures of cognitive func- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations.""

NOTE: All patients fulfilled the Fukuda definition for CFS. SOURCE: Jason et al., 2013b. tioning that ask individuals to report cognitive difficulties they encounter in their daily lives. Both objective and subjective measures are important in understanding ME/CFS, but in the following discussion of evidence on the neurocognitive characteristics of ME/CFS, the committee has chosen to focus primarily on objective tests that may provide some indication of the cognitive processes and possible causal mechanisms involved in ME/CFS. It is worth noting, however, that from the clinical perspective, neuropsychological testing has shown significant overlap between ME/CFS and control populations, and that self-report of cognitive issues offers a more reliable means of discriminating between these two groups (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010). Most studies focused on memory impairments test patients’ working memory (the ability to retain and make use of information in the short term) as measured by a range of neuropsychological tests. Researchers also divide memory tasks into various categories based on whether a task requires immediate (also related to working memory), short-term, or long-term memory; remembering something that has already happened (retrospective memory); or remembering to do something in the future (prospective memory). Tasks are divided as well by the type of content that is recalled (verbal or visual memory) (Attree et al., 2014; DeLuca et ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. al., 1995). Subjective measures used for memory testing include a range of different assessments, such as the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire, the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, or self-observation using a structured diary (Attree et al., 2014; Knoop et al., 2007). A meta-analysis of studies of cognitive functioning by Cockshell and Mathias (2010) found that the majority of objective tests used to assess memory function in ME/CFS asked participants to remember either verbal or written word lists, while some tested visual memory by having participants reproduce a complex figure from memory or remember visual patterns. Examples of verbal tests reported in the meta-analysis include the Selective Reminding Test, the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R), and the California Verbal Learning Test. Tests of visual memory reviewed included, among others, the Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure and the Pattern Recognition Test. Some tests included both verbal and visual components and fell in both categories. In addition, researchers use the n-back procedure to investigate the neurologic substrates of the working memory processes. The n-back task is a continuous performance measure whereby the subject is presented with stimulus sequences (i.e., visual, auditory, and olfactory) and is required to indicate when the current stimulus matches the one presented in “n” trials previously. This task requires the subject to maintain, update, and manipulate information and therefore is considered a demanding task. The n usually varies from 1 to 3. The responses of the n-back task can be correlated with neuroimaging reports of the activation of several brain regions (Owen et al., 2005). In the neuropsychological literature, attempts are made to distinguish between information processing speed (as measured by reaction time) and motor speed (movement time or tests of fine motor speed [e.g., finger tapping test]). Recent studies assessing psychomotor functioning in ME/CFS have separated these components, but together these tests evaluate reaction time as part of the motor component (Schrijvers et al., 2009; Van Den Eede et al., 2011). The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), the Attention Network Test (ANT), the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), and similar measures or testing batteries are used to assess attention deficits and reaction times. Reaction times on these tests frequently are used to judge information processing speed independent of motor speed (Majer et al., 2008; Michiels and Cluydts, 2001). Impairment in psychomotor functioning is demonstrated by both increased simple reaction time, in which subjects respond to a verbal or visual stimulus, and choice reaction time, which measures length of time responding to a stimulus involving multiple potential options (Den Eede et al., 2011). The PASAT and ANT can additionally be used to assess slowed information processing (Davis and Claypoole, 1997; Togo et al., 2013).

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Evidence for Neurocognitive Manifestations in ME/CFS The committee conducted a targeted literature search to identify research papers comparing the presence of neurocognitive manifestations in ME/CFS cases versus controls. The researchers assessed presentation of neurocognitive impairments either by self-report questionnaires or by objective testing using neurocognitive test batteries. The committee’s targeted search was limited to the past 10 years because of the large number of results but considered older research that was reviewed and cited in the introduction or discussion of more recent literature. The approach the committee used to review the literature is described in . The findings of the targeted literature review are presented below, with the caveats regarding the research base described at the beginning of this chapter. The literature shows with some consistency that neurocognitive problems such as memory impairment, slowed information processing, attention deficits, and impaired psychomotor function are highly prevalent in ME/CFS patients, as discussed in this section. Slowed information processing is the neurocognitive symptom of ME/CFS most consistently reported in objective neuropsychological testing, with evidence from twin studies showing that individuals with ME/CFS tend to process information more slowly than healthy individuals with similar intellectual abilities (Claypoole et al., 2007; Mahurin et al., 2004; Togo et al., 2013). Numerous papers both support and refute the existence of memory impairment in individuals with ME/CFS. Studies that do report impairment show a wide range in the measured severity of memory problems, with small to moderate and significant deficits in memory having been found for a range of cognitive tests, but not all (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010; Constant et al., 2011; Dickson et al., 2009; Majer et al., 2008). A large number of studies also have found impaired attention (Capuron et al., 2006; Cockshell and Mathias, 2010; Constant et al., 2011; Dickson et al., 2009; Hou et al., 2008, 2014; Hutchinson and Badham, 2013) and slowed reaction and movement times in people with ME/CFS (Den Eede et al., 2011; Majer et al., 2008; Schrijvers et al., 2009). Comparisons with other illnesses, such as sleep apnea and depression, suggest that psychomotor impairment in ME/CFS may be less severe than in those other illnesses (Neu et al., 2011; Schrijvers et al., 2009). In objective neuropsychological testing, individuals meeting criteria for ME/CFS have displayed deficits in working memory compared with healthy controls. These patients have been found to be impaired on tests that assess working memory over a sustained period of time (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010; DeLuca et al., 2004b). Attree and colleagues (2009) found ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. that ME/CFS patients rated themselves as more forgetful than controls on both prospective and retrospective memory. However, objective memory impairment was limited to retrospective not prospective memory in these patients. Michiels and colleagues (1996) found that reduced verbal and visual memory was the most consistent finding in individuals with ME/CFS compared with normal controls. With regard to verbal memory, moderate to large deficits were found on tests of list learning, including immediate recall, delayed recall, and recognition, while nonverbal memory for complex figures and spatial location was not impaired (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010). Numerous studies provide evidence that verbal memory impairment (often measured using the California Verbal Learning Test) likely is associated with ME/CFS (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010). However, because of the methodological weaknesses in much ME/CFS research, particularly the comparison of mean scores on neuropsychological tests rather than reporting of the number of impaired individuals, it is difficult to determine whether this impairment is characteristic of the illness or present only in a subset of patients (Vercoulen et al., 1998). ME/CFS patients compared with controls perform significantly worse on free-recall retrospective memory. Research findings offer some support for the deficient acquisition hypothesis, which proposes that retrospective memory deficits in ME/CFS patients are attributable to difficulties with encoding information due to slower information processing (impaired delayed recall) (Attree et al., 2009). This interpretation appears to be supported by findings that the verbal memory problems of these patients stem from delayed acquisition of information rather than inaccuracy in recall (DeLuca et al., 2004a). Furthermore, in studies of working memory, researchers have found that difficulties emerge only when ME/CFS subjects are required to perform time-dependent tasks (DeLuca et al., 2004a; Togo et al., 2013), implying that ME/CFS patients’ cognitive processes may be slower than but not otherwise different from those of healthy control patients. Memory impairment does appear to distinguish ME/CFS from such psychiatric disorders as depression and anxiety. The majority of studies examining severity of cognitive impairment, including memory problems, failed to find a relationship between such impairment and depression, even though ME/CFS patients have high rates of depression (Busichio et al., 2004; DeLuca et al., 1995; Short et al., 2002). In studies that divided ME/CFS patients according to whether they had a comorbid psychiatric condition, those without such a comorbidity showed more severe memory impairment (DeLuca et al., 2004b; Tiersky et al., 2003). It is less clear whether memory impairment may distinguish ME/CFS from other fatiguing illnesses. However, mental fatigue is an important correlate of working memory in ME/CFS patients, with a population-based sample of these patients showing a clear association between subjec- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. tive complaints of mental fatigue and objective measurements of memory (Capuron et al., 2006). Patients with ME/CFS who specifically reported mental fatigue were found to show significant impairment of working memory in the task of sustained attention/vigilance (a spatial working memory task of the CANTAB), suggesting higher cognitive fatigability (Capuron et al., 2006). Cognitive impairment in ME/CFS patients with mental fatigue was not attributable to mood disorders or psychotropic medication (Capuron et al., 2006). Slowed information processing appears to be one of the most easily distinguishable features of ME/CFS (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010, 2013; Michiels and Cluydts, 2001; Tiersky et al., 1997). Despite some contradictory evidence, a large number of papers have emerged supporting the idea that individuals with ME/CFS often display slowed information processing (Claypoole et al., 2007; DeLuca et al., 2004a; Togo et al., 2013). Positive evidence is provided by twin-control studies in which individuals with ME/CFS were compared with their twins who did not have the illness. These studies frequently revealed similar premorbid intellectual functioning (Claypoole et al., 2007; Mahurin et al., 2004) and no differences in content-dependent untimed testing, but significant differences in time-dependent tasks (Mahurin et al., 2004). Multiple studies have found that individuals with ME/CFS perform poorly compared with controls only in time-dependent tasks, with ME/CFS subjects showing no impairment in accuracy of information processing when given as much time as necessary to complete a task (DeLuca et al., 2004a; Mahurin et al., 2004). Also, in a meta-analysis of research studies, measures of both simple (reaction time task) and complex (PASAT) information processing speed showed moderate to large significant impairments in persons with ME/CFS compared with healthy controls (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010). As with memory impairment, ME/CFS patients without psychiatric comorbidity show greater delays in information processing. Moreover, some evidence suggests that slower information processing is not related to reduced effort, depression, anxiety, fatigue, or sleep problems, nor is it dependent on slowed motor functioning, psychological status, number or severity of ME/CFS symptoms, or overall functioning (Cockshell and Mathias, 2012, 2013). Researchers in the field consider this symptom to be a possible cause of other neurocognitive impairments, including difficulties with attention and memory (DeLuca et al., 2004a; Togo et al., 2013). For that reason, it may be useful to compare ME/CFS patients with this symptom with other control groups (e.g., besides those with depression), as slowed information processing speed has also been identified in other ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. clinical groups, such as patients with multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury (DeLuca and Kalmar, 2008). Considerable evidence shows that reduced attention is associated with ME/CFS (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010; Constant et al., 2011; Hou et al., 2014), although some research indicates that attentional deficits may be due to reduced information processing speed (Cockshell and Mathias, 2013). Cognition has been found to be weaker among patients with ME/CFS, who demonstrated an impaired ability to maintain attention and alertness (Constant et al., 2011). Several studies also have shown impairments in executive attention relative to healthy controls, with ME/CFS patients demonstrating greater difficulty concentrating on a particular element when confronted with potential distractions (Hou et al., 2014; Hutchinson and Badham, 2013). Some studies have confirmed the presence of objective impairments of attention in patients with ME/CFS compared with controls (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010; Hou et al., 2014). Differences have remained after patients showing low effort have been removed, suggesting that the differences cannot be explained by lack of effort (Constant et al., 2011). Some studies have demonstrated that ME/CFS patients display greater attentional bias toward linguistic and pictorial health-related threat stimuli (i.e., any factor that represents a danger to one’s health) (Hou et al., 2008, 2014). Other studies have failed to find attentional bias but have found greater mood volatility with rumination (Martin and Alexeeva, 2010), suggesting variability in the ability of ME/CFS patients to control and sustain attention. It is unclear whether this symptom can be used to distinguish ME/CFS from other disorders. Doing so would be difficult given that depression and anxiety can cause similar problems with attention (Moffoot et al., 1994) and have high comorbidity with ME/CFS (Attree et al., 2014). However, executive attention may be an option for distinguishing among subsets of the ME/CFS population, given some evidence of variability of this symptom in people with the illness (Hou et al., 2014). Studies of executive attention in children have shown that changes in the surface area of the anterior cingulate cortex account for a significant proportion of the variance in functioning on a test of cognitive control, suggesting that structural differences in this region of the brain could be a biomarker of conditions such as ME/CFS (Fjell et al., 2012). Deficits in patients may lead to poor activation or reduced connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex. Exploring this possibility could further the effort to identify biomarkers of the disorder. More research comparing attentional deficits in fatiguing disorders and psychiatric conditions is necessary for this question to be answered.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. The literature offers conflicting evidence for the presence of impaired psychomotor function in ME/CFS patients. Some studies have found no difference in motor coordination and motor speed between ME/CFS patients and controls (reaction time test) (Cockshell and Mathias, 2013). Moreover, a meta-analysis found that fine motor speed was not impaired in subjects with ME/CFS (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010). However, there are significant differences in the movement time of reaction time tests between people with ME/CFS and healthy controls (Cockshell and Mathias, 2010). These findings suggest that information processing deficits contributed to the noted deficits in the movement time of reaction time tasks, which reportedly are not pure measures of motor speed (Smith and Carew, 1987; Vercoulen et al., 1998). Moreover, because fine motor speed was not found to be impaired in persons with ME/CFS, motor functioning is unlikely to be the primary cause of slower reaction times. This conclusion is consistent with the findings of more recent studies previously mentioned (Schrijvers et al., 2009; Van Den Eede et al., 2011) that reaction time but not movement time was impaired in ME/CFS patients. On the other hand, considerable evidence that this symptom is associated with ME/CFS has been published (Davey et al., 2001; Lawrie et al., 2000; Marshall et al., 1997; Michiels et al., 1996). Results from a population-based study confirm and quantify alterations in motor speed in ME/CFS patients that are independent of psychiatric disorders or medication usage (Majer et al., 2008). In this study, ME/CFS patients recruited from the general population presented motor slowing after the researchers controlled for level of depressive symptoms. ME/CFS subjects also exhibited decreased motor speed, demonstrated by slower response times on the movement component of simple and choice reaction time tasks, a finding suggesting that these are primary features of cognitive changes in ME/CFS patients. The consistency of these results may provide clues to the involvement of neural circuits (i.e., basal ganglia) in ME/CFS. Further evidence of slowed psychomotor functioning is provided by twin-control studies in which individuals with ME/CFS were compared with their twins who did not have the illness (Claypoole et al., 2007; Mahurin et al., 2004). Studies of the brain in relation to ME/CFS have been performed for two purposes: to document any possible objective finding in ME/CFS and to develop diagnostic criteria for the disease. While in general these studies have been small (most with fewer than 20 patients with ME/CFS, usually fulfilling the Fukuda definition), most have shown statistically significant differ- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. ences between patients with the condition and controls using a wide range of technologies and in a variety of brain regions. One study found that ME/CFS patients had 8 percent less gray matter relative to healthy controls, and that this difference was correlated with lower levels of physical activity (De Lange et al., 2005). Puri and colleagues (2012) found similar losses of both white and gray matter in patients with ME/CFS. Another study found that cognitive-behavioral therapy for ME/CFS patients increased prefrontal cortical volume after 16 sessions, suggesting that changes in brain volume and structure associated with the illness may be reversible with treatment (De Lange et al., 2008). However, the authors do not indicate whether such changes cause or result from neurocognitive symptoms of ME/CFS. Recently, Nakatomi and colleagues (2014) found evidence of neuroinflammation in a small group of ME/CFS patients. While this was a small study (patients = 9, healthy controls = 10), it showed a significant increase in activated microglia or astrocytes using positron emission tomography (PET) in patients compared with controls. This study also found a positive correlation between activated microglia or astrocytes in the amygdala, thalamus, and midbrain and the cognitive impairment score of these subjects. The involvement of microglia could point to connectivity issues similar to those proposed with respect to the role of the anterior cingulate in maintaining attention. Spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed midbrain white matter and gray matter volume changes in these patients at fatigue onset, which the authors found to be consistent with an insult to the midbrain affecting multiple feedback control loops (Barnden et al., 2011). In other brain studies, Yamamoto and colleagues (2003) used PET scanning to show that serotonin transporters were significantly reduced in the rostral subdivision of the anterior cingulate in ME/CFS patients. Functional MRI (fMRI) has been used to show an association between the subjective feeling of mental fatigue and brain responses during fatiguing cognition (Cook et al., 2007); reduced basal ganglia activation (caudate and globus pallidus) also may contribute to fatigue (Unger et al., 2012). Murrough and colleagues (2010) found increased ventricular lactate in ME/CFS patients based on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) imaging. The same group later found further evidence that increased oxidative stress may play a role in ME/CFS pathophysiology (Shungu et al., 2012). In another study, ME/CFS patients who were not medicated were reliably differentiated from healthy controls and those with depression using EEG spectral coherence (Duffy et al., 2011). Some studies have found reduced activity in ME/CFS patients in regions of the brain associated with working memory during completion of a working memory task (Caseras et al., 2006), while others have found that individuals with ME/CFS appear to use more of their brain during working memory tasks (Lange et al., 2005). In addition, increased activation ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. has been seen by fMRI in ME/CFS patients in the occipito-parietal cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus, with decreased activation seen in the dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices (Caseras et al., 2008). Findings suggest that ME/CFS patients require additional neural resources (more activation) to achieve the same level of behavioral performance as controls on the PASAT and other neuropsychological tests (Cook et al., 2007; Schmaling et al., 2003). During high-demand tasks, ME/CFS patients showed reduced activation in dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices, showing differences only at the neurophysiological level. ME/CFS patients activated a large cluster in the right inferior/medial temporal cortex while undergoing 3-back condition testing—probably a compensatory strategy when working memory is dysfunctional or saturated as a result of ME/CFS (Caseras et al., 2006). Results are similar to those found in sleep-deprived healthy adults, so these findings could also be the consequence of sleep deprivation in ME/CFS patients (Caseras et al., 2006). These objective findings based on multiple technologies support the concept that ME/CFS patients, at least those meeting Fukuda definition, have objective brain differences from healthy controls. However, the varying locations of these findings make insights into etiology and possible treatments less clear, and subsets of patients have not yet been defined. Exacerbation of Cognitive Symptoms Following Exertion Evidence on the effect of exertion on cognitive function was provided earlier in the section on PEM. Collectively, the studies reviewed here support the notion that ME/CFS patients present with neurocognitive impairment. Slowed information processing, demonstrated by objective neuropsychological testing and potentially related to problems with white matter integrity, is one of the strongest neurocognitive indicators in support of a diagnosis of ME/CFS, particularly if there is evidence of normal functioning on untimed tests and impaired functioning on time-dependent tasks. The greater severity of memory and other neurocognitive deficits in ME/CFS patients without psychiatric comorbidity suggests that these deficits may be a distinguishing feature of the disease, or at the very least a means of defining subgroups within the ME/CFS population. Confirming the presence of this symptom using objective neuropsychological testing would support diagnosis of ME/CFS and possibly support diagnosis of a specific subset of ME/CFS patients, but it is not necessary for the diagnosis. ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. The presence of attention deficits or impaired psychomotor function could support diagnosis of ME/CFS or potentially a subset of the ME/CFS population, but only in combination with other neurocognitive impairments. There is sufficient evidence that slowed information processing is common in patients with ME/CFS, and a growing body of evidence shows that it may play a central role in overall neurocognitive impairment associated with the disease. Such a deficit may be responsible for the disability that results in loss of employment and loss of functional capacity in social environments. Orthostatic intolerance is defined as a clinical condition in which symptoms worsen upon assuming and maintaining upright posture and are ameliorated (although not necessarily abolished) by recumbency (Gerrity et al., 2002; Low et al., 2009). Symptoms in orthostatic intolerance syndromes are those caused primarily by (1) cerebral underperfusion (such as lightheadedness, near-syncope or syncope, impaired concentration, headaches, and dimming or blurring of vision), or (2) sympathetic nervous system activation (such as forceful beating of the heart, palpitations, tremulousness, and chest pain) (Low et al., 2009). Other common signs and symptoms of orthostatic intolerance are fatigue, a feeling of weakness, intolerance of low-impact exercise, nausea, abdominal pain, facial pallor, nervousness, and shortness of breath (Kanjwal et al., 2003; Legge et al., 2008; Raj, 2013). Orthostatic intolerance can occur as an isolated syndrome or in association with a variety of other comorbid disorders, including ME/CFS (Benarroch, 2012). The most prevalent forms of orthostatic intolerance in the general population, as well as among those with ME/CFS, are POTS and neurally mediated hypotension (NMH), with delayed variants of orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic tachycardia also being seen. Some individuals simply have low tolerance for upright posture without evidence of these objective circulatory changes (Bush et al., 2000; Rowe and Calkins, 1998). Symptoms that occur upon assuming or maintaining upright posture are among the most commonly reported clinical features of ME/CFS. In surveys of ME/CFS patients, along with dizziness, a drop in blood pressure, spatial disorientation, and fainting, many participants “reported an inability to stand for even a few minutes” (FDA, 2013, p. 7). Some indi- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. viduals described to the committee having difficulty standing, eating, and showering. Orthostatic symptoms also are a component of PEM: “[A crash is] not just the physical pain or it’s not just the head pain, it’s also more cognitive impairment, more orthostatic intolerance, more neurological issues … they’re very interrelated” (FDA, 2013, p. 8) (see the earlier section on PEM for more detail). The symptoms and triggers for orthostatic intolerance syndromes are similar regardless of the associated diagnoses, although severity typically is greater in those with ME/CFS and POTS than in those with POTS alone (Okamoto et al., 2012a; Stewart et al., 1999). Orthostatic intolerance can begin acutely following a viral illness (Freeman and Komaroff, 1997), other infections (Kanjwal et al., 2011), pregnancy, or trauma, or it can have an insidious onset (Raj, 2013). It is made worse by deconditioning (Parsaik et al., 2012). Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance often are exacerbated by prolonged periods of upright posture; low-impact exercise; exposure to warm environments; and, less commonly, meals. Circumstances in daily life that can act as triggers include standing in line, shopping, hot showers or baths, hot weather, overheated rooms, and even prolonged quiet sitting (Raj, 2013; Schondorf et al., 1999). Some patients with orthostatic intolerance feel somewhat better and more energized while exercising, but they often are much worse afterward, especially if they are standing in the “cool-down” period (Calkins et al., 1995). Women with orthostatic intolerance can have worse symptoms during their menstrual periods (Low et al., 2009). Prevalence of Orthostatic Intolerance and Autonomic Dysfunction in ME/CFS Patients The committee’s literature review identified six research articles in which orthostatic and autonomic symptoms are reported. The prevalence of orthostatic symptoms in ME/CFS varies widely in these publications, but in all of them is higher in ME/CFS subjects than in controls (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995; Miwa, 2014; Newton et al., 2007; Poole et al., 2000; Soetekouw et al., 1999; Timmers et al., 2002). The study by Bou-Holaigah and colleagues (1995) included 23 U.S. adolescents and adults with ME/CFS, 96 percent of whom reported lightheadedness, 96 percent nausea, 83 percent diaphoresis, 78 percent abdominal discomfort, 78 percent blurred vision, and 43 percent prior syncope. Orthostatic stresses reported as exacerbating fatigue included a hot shower (78 percent), prolonged standing (78 percent), a warm environment (74 percent), and episodes of lightheadedness (43 percent).

Those with ME/CFS had significantly higher rates of increased perspiration (57 percent versus 13 percent), decreased salivation (24 percent versus 3 percent), dysphagia (24 percent versus 0 percent), and constipation (22 percent versus 3 percent). Poole and colleagues (2000) evaluated 21 monozygotic twins discordant for CFS. Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance in the week before head-up tilt testing were graded on a 0 (none) to 5 (severe) scale. The CFS twins had significantly more severe dizziness (1.4 versus 0), lightheadedness (1.4 versus 0.3), nausea (0.6 versus 0), abdominal discomfort (0.7 versus 0.3), sweating (1.3 versus 0.4), chest pain (0.7 versus 0.3), and shortness of breath (0.8 versus 0.2). In a study of 36 Dutch adults with ME/CFS and 36 healthy controls, 28 percent of ME/CFS adults but no controls reported symptoms related to or avoidance of prolonged standing (Timmers et al., 2002). Newton and colleagues (2007) examined autonomic symptoms as measured by the detailed Composite Autonomic Symptom Score (COMPASS) questionnaire in 40 British adults with ME/CFS and 40 controls. The ME/CFS adults had significantly higher scores on domains assessing orthostatic tolerance, vasomotor, secretomotor, gastrointestinal, pupillomotor, and sleep problems, as well as higher total scores (mean [standard deviation] score 43.7 [16.6] versus 12.1 [10.2]; p < 0.0001). Finally, among 40 Japanese adults with ME/CFS, 28 (70 percent) reported symptoms of orthostatic intolerance, defined as the following symptoms while standing: disabling fatigue, dizziness, diminished concentration, tremulousness, sweating, lightheadedness, visual disturbances, palpitations, and nausea (Miwa, 2014). The above variability in symptom reporting is related in part to the methods and comprehensiveness of the ascertainment for orthostatic intolerance, but also to temporal changes. While some older studies refer to autonomic and circulatory abnormalities in those with neuromyasthenia (MacLean et al., 1944), papers drawing attention to orthostatic intolerance in ME/CFS did not appear until 1995 (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995; Rowe et al., 1995), the year after the Fukuda definition was published. As an example of the temporal changes in reporting, in a summary of clinical experience, Komaroff and Buchwald (1991) estimated that dizziness was present in 30-50 percent of patients. In a study published a decade later, Jason and colleagues (2002b) reported dizziness in 47 percent of adults with ME/CFS, 21 percent of those with depression, and 9 percent of nonfatigued participants. And Nacul and colleagues (2011b) reported a prevalence of “intolerance to be on your feet” of 61 percent among 265 ME/CFS subjects in England. A second source of variability in prevalence reports is the way in which orthostatic intolerance are classified. In the non-ME/CFS litera- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. ture on orthostatic intolerance, symptoms of cerebral underperfusion (e.g., cognitive symptoms such as difficulty concentrating) were attributed to the circulatory dysfunction (Low et al., 2009). In the ME/CFS literature, those problems often are reported as independent symptoms. While orthostatic stress was reported to cause worse fatigue and cognitive function in those with ME/CFS as compared with those without ME/CFS (Stewart et al., 2012; Streeten and Anderson, 1992), it is impossible to determine which component of the overall ME/CFS symptom complex is due to the circulatory disorder or to some other aspect of ME/CFS physiology. Few studies specified the postures in which people reported triggering of their ME/CFS symptoms, and few distinguished orthostatic headaches or orthostatic cognitive difficulties from general causes of these symptoms. The dilemma is illustrated by the prevalence of symptoms documented by Nacul and colleagues (2011b): 61 percent of British adult ME/CFS patients reported intolerance of being on their feet, but 94 percent also reported memory or concentration problems, 82 percent difficulty thinking, 72 percent intolerance to exercise, 66 percent sweatiness/cold hands and feet, and 65 percent headaches. How many of these other symptoms were related to orthostatic stress is impossible to discern from the paper. The Fukuda definition of CFS includes no mention of disorders in the regulation of heart rate and blood pressure in the differential diagnosis or management of ME/CFS symptoms (Fukuda et al., 1994). In the 2003 CCC, the diagnosis of ME/CFS can be made if—in addition to an illness of at least 6 months’ duration characterized by fatigue, PEM, sleep dysfunction, pain, and neurologic or cognitive manifestations—the individual also has one symptom from two of three of the following categories: autonomic manifestations, neuroendocrine manifestations, and immune manifestations. These categories are not mutually exclusive, but autonomic manifestations include the following: orthostatic intolerance, NMH, POTS, delayed postural hypotension, lightheadedness, extreme pallor, nausea and irritable bowel syndrome, urinary frequency and bladder dysfunction, palpitations with or without cardiac arrhythmias, and exertional dyspnea (Carruthers et al., 2003). In contrast, the NICE guidelines devote very little attention to circulatory dysfunction either in the differential diagnosis of fatigue as a symptom of ME/CFS or as a comorbid condition. The NICE guidelines recommend against performing a tilt table test routinely to aid in making a diagnosis of ME/CFS, but they do not comment on the potential utility of head-up tilt or standing tests for diagnosing comorbid orthostatic intolerance (NICE, 2007). The 2011 ME-ICC criteria list orthostatic intolerance as one of several qualifying abnormalities under the rubric of energy production/transportation impairments (Carruthers et al., 2011).

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. Assessment of Orthostatic Intolerance and Autonomic Dysfunction in ME/CFS When querying for orthostatic intolerance, clinicians should pose questions about the frequency and severity of lightheadedness, near-fainting (presyncope), syncope, sweating, palpitations, chest pain, orthostatic dyspnea, and related symptoms when individuals are sitting or standing for prolonged periods of time. Chronic fatigue, difficulty concentrating, exercise intolerance, nausea, and tremulousness are common across a variety of forms of orthostatic intolerance. Not all individuals report lightheadedness; some simply report feeling unwell when upright and they avoid these situations. Questions with a high yield include asking how individuals feel in the following circumstances: while waiting in line, at receptions, in choir, while shopping or at the mall, while sitting still for long periods, and when exposed to warm/stressful circumstances (e.g., summer weather; after hot showers, baths, and saunas; after episodes of fear, pain, or exposure to blood) (Grubb, 2005; Raj, 2013; Thieben et al., 2007). Several questionnaires are validated for use in adults with autonomic dysfunction or orthostatic intolerance syndromes, but they have not been evaluated specifically among those with ME/CFS. They include the Orthostatic Grading Scale (OGS) (Schrezenmaier et al., 2005); the Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ) (Kaufmann et al., 2012); and a series of questionnaires developed at the Mayo Clinic, beginning with the 169-item Autonomic Symptom Profile (ASP) (Suarez et al., 1999), followed by the 84-question COMPASS. The COMPASS has been further abbreviated to a 31-item questionnaire (COMPASS 31) (Sletten et al., 2012). Orthostatic vital signs—measured by taking heart rate and blood pressure in supine, sitting, and standing positions—often are measured within 2 minutes or less, and thus are insufficient to identify most forms of chronic orthostatic intolerance. Prolonged testing of at least 10 minutes usually is needed for a sufficient orthostatic challenge. Two forms of prolonged orthostatic testing (standing test and upright tilt test) are commonly employed (see ). The recommended duration of upright posture for detecting POTS is 10 minutes (Raj, 2013). Although neurally mediated hypotension can occur within the first 10 minutes of upright posture, an orthostatic ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. This test can be performed in any clinic. The individual lies supine for 5 minutes to yield a steady baseline, then stands quietly, leaning against a wall, for 10 minutes. The individual is instructed to avoid moving, shifting his or her weight, or engaging in leg and other muscle contraction maneuvers. Symptoms such as fatigue, lightheadedness, nausea, warmth, shortness of breath, headache, pain, and impaired concentration/mental fogginess are recorded on a 0-10 scale while the individual is supine and every 1-2 minutes while he/she is standing. Individuals also are encouraged to report changes in symptoms as they occur. Heart rate and blood pressure recordings are made every 1-2 minutes. The test must be observed because of the potential for syncope and injury. The standing test, while helpful in some cases, is not a substitute for prolonged head-up tilt testing, and has limited ability to identify those with neurally mediated hypotension, most of whom develop hypotension beyond the 10-minute duration of a typical standing test. The head-up tilt table test requires specialized equipment. The individual lies supine on the tilt table for 5-15 minutes. The table is then brought upright, usually to 70 degrees, for 10 to 60 minutes (usually 45 minutes if the goal is to evaluate for neurally mediated hypotension). Patient movement is discouraged. Heart rate is monitored continuously, and blood pressure is measured either continuously, using beat-to-beat measurements, or every 1-2 minutes for the first 10 minutes upright and every 5 minutes thereafter. Symptom reports usually are elicited every 2 minutes for the first 10 minutes upright and every 5 minutes thereafter, and recorded whenever major changes are reported by the individual. Passive tilt testing provokes a larger heart rate change in those with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) than does active standing beyond 5 minutes of upright posture (Plash et al., 2013). During prolonged head-up tilt, a variety of pharmacological agents, including isoproterenol and nitroglycerine, are employed to provoke syncope. However, these challenges can lead to abnormal tests in some healthy individuals, so they must be interpreted with caution, as is described elsewhere (Moya et al., 2009). Moreover, head-up tilt testing is no longer thought to be necessary to diagnose all forms of neurally mediated syncope (Moya et al., 2009). stress of more than 10 minutes of upright posture more commonly is required (Benditt et al., 1991). The median time to develop hypotension among adults with ME/CFS is 30 minutes in some studies (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995). Among those with ME/CFS, orthostatic symptoms during ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. tilt testing emerge within minutes, long before hemodynamic changes are documented (Razumovsky et al., 2003). Some investigators prefer to simulate orthostatic stress using lower-body negative pressure (LBNP), but these methods are used mainly in research settings (Wyller et al., 2008). Other methods used to capture physiological changes during upright tilt include transcranial Doppler ultrasound to measure cerebral blood flow velocity, capnography to measure expired CO, and near infrared spectroscopy to measure changes in cerebral tissue oxygenation (Naschitz et al., 2000; Ocon et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2002). Clinicians who evaluate those with orthostatic intolerance recognize that individuals with ME/CFS can develop an exacerbation of their typical symptoms not just during the head-up tilt test but for several days afterward. The committee’s literature search did not identify any publications describing this observation more formally, although administration of 1 liter of normal saline following the tilt test to reverse the post-tilt test exacerbation in symptoms is part of the tilt testing protocol in some centers (Rowe et al., 2001). Intravenous saline has been shown to improve orthostatic tolerance and to modify autonomic tone in those with neurally mediated syncope (Burklow et al., 1999) and after experimental prolonged bed rest (Takenaka et al., 2002). Evidence for Orthostatic Intolerance and Autonomic Abnormalities in ME/CFS This section examines the evidence for orthostatic intolerance and autonomic abnormalities in adults with ME/CFS. The methodology used for the committee’s literature review is described in . A full search for all forms of autonomic dysfunction (e.g., bladder dysfunction, gastrointestinal motility disorders) was not conducted. Instead, the committee elected to focus on circulatory abnormalities, as these are the most frequently reported autonomic abnormalities in ME/CFS. The most common forms of orthostatic intolerance are described in . Several studies reviewed were conducted by the same group of investigators. When it was not possible to ascertain from the description of the study methods whether the data were for independent study populations or some of the same patients on more than one occasion, the committee chose to select the most representative (or largest) of the studies for each group. The studies reviewed vary widely on several methodological variables, notably in the following categories: patient characteristics (age, duration of ME/CFS, severity of ME/CFS, the ME/CFS case definition used, whether subjects were selected based on autonomic symptoms, referral biases, whether ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. the testing was performed on patients seeking clinical care or those participating in a research study); preparation for the test (medications allowed, prior sodium intake, duration of pretest fast); the type of orthostatic testing (active standing, standing while leaning against a wall, head-up tilt table) and, with tilt testing, the protocol used (e.g., angle of the tilt table, time of day for the study, ambient room temperature, degree of movement permitted); criteria for abnormal response to orthostatic stress (earlier studies tended to report only rates of NMH, without reporting rates of BOX 4-3 Common Orthostatic Intolerance Syndromes POTS is defined by a heart rate increase between the supine position and 10 minutes of standing of more than 30 beats per minute (bpm) for adults or 40 bpm for adolescents, or a heart rate that reaches 120 bpm or higher over the first 10 minutes of upright posture in the absence of orthostatic hypotension. A diagnosis of POTS requires that the change in heart rate also be accompanied by characteristic orthostatic symptoms that include lightheadedness, blurred vision, headaches, difficulty concentrating, diaphoresis, nausea, palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath (Freeman et al., 2011). NMH refers to a reflex drop in blood pressure that occurs during upright posture, and is defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure of 25 mm Hg (compared with supine blood pressure) during standing or upright tilt table testing. It usually is preceded by orthostatic symptoms of lightheadedness, nausea, pallor, and warmth and accompanied at the time of hypotension by a slowing of the heart rate (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995). NMH sometimes is termed “neurocardiogenic syncope,” “vasodepressor syncope,” or “vaso-vagal syncope” (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995). OH involves an immediate and sustained drop of at least 20 mm Hg in systolic or 10 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure in the first 3 minutes of standing or upright tilt (Freeman et al., 2011). This is uncommon in ME/CFS, but a delayed form of OH has been recognized in ME/CFS patients, in which blood pressure changes occur after 3 minutes upright (Moya et al., 2009; Streeten and Anderson, 1992). ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. POTS, and studies employing less than 10 minutes of orthostatic stress reported rates of POTS, as these tests were not sufficiently prolonged to be able to exclude NMH). These methodological factors contributed to the variability in rates of orthostatic intolerance reported in the various studies. The literature search identified 14 studies of prolonged orthostatic testing in which adults with ME/CFS were compared with healthy controls (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995; De Lorenzo et al., 1997; Duprez et al., 1998; Hollingsworth et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2005; LaManca et al., 1999a; Naschitz et al., 2000, 2002; Poole et al., 2000; Razumovsky et al., 2003; Schondorf et al., 1999; Streeten et al., 2000; Timmers et al., 2002; Yataco et al., 1997), as well as three studies of subjects with ME/CFS without controls (Freeman and Komaroff, 1997; Reynolds et al., 2013; Rowe et al., 2001). None of the studies with controls and only one of the three studies without controls (Freeman and Komaroff, 1997) recruited participants based on the presence of autonomic symptoms. Of the 14 studies with healthy controls in which orthostatic testing lasted longer than 10 minutes, only 2 did not report a higher prevalence of either POTS or NMH among those with ME/CFS compared with controls (Duprez et al., 1998; Jones et al., 2005). The rates of reported abnormalities ranged from 0 percent (Duprez et al., 1998) to 96 percent (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995). The median proportion with hemodynamic abnormalities during the first 30-45 minutes upright in these studies was 37 percent in ME/CFS versus 7.5 percent in controls. In the three additional studies without controls, the reported rates of orthostatic intolerance ranged from 11 to 66 percent of adults with ME/CFS. This number needs to be interpreted with caution given the varying durations of orthostatic stress (ranging from 20 to 60 minutes) and other methodological differences in testing. The literature search identified seven studies with brief durations of orthostatic stress (2-10 minutes) (De Becker et al., 1998; Freeman and Komaroff, 1997; Hoad et al., 2008; Miwa, 2014; Natelson et al., 2007; Soetekouw et al., 1999; Winkler et al., 2004). The samples sizes ranged from 20 to 62 subjects with ME/CFS (median N = 37). Two studies used head-up tilt testing and five active standing as the orthostatic stressor. The prevalence of orthostatic intolerance was not documented in two studies in which the main focus was formal autonomic testing (De Becker et al., 1998; Soetekouw et al., 1999). In all of the remaining studies, the prevalence of POTS was numerically higher in adults ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. with ME/CFS than in controls (Freeman and Komaroff, 1997; Hoad et al., 2008; Miwa, 2014; Natelson et al., 2007; Winkler et al., 2004). Combining the data from these studies, the overall prevalence of POTS was 27 percent in adults with ME/CFS and 4.2 percent in healthy controls. The range of orthostatic abnormalities (including POTS, hypotension, and hypocapnia) in these studies with brief orthostatic testing varied widely—from 14 to 67 percent—in individual studies, reflecting differences in study measures, subject selection, and duration of orthostatic stress. The literature review identified five studies reporting orthostatic or ME/CFS symptoms following standing or tilt table testing. Upright posture was associated with provocation of fatigue symptoms and higher rates of lightheadedness, nausea, and warmth in 55-100 percent of subjects with ME/CFS (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995; Hollingsworth et al., 2010; Naschitz et al., 2000; Streeten et al., 2000). For example, during the first 45 minutes of head-up tilt, 100 percent of 23 ME/CFS participants reported worse fatigue, 91 percent lightheadedness, 91 percent increased warmth, 73 percent nausea, and 18 percent diaphoresis. Controls made no reports of similar symptoms (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995). One small study found a normalization of heart rate and blood pressure changes and improvement in ME/CFS symptoms after the acute application of a 45-mm Hg external compression device while subjects continued to stand (Streeten et al., 2000). In a study of 64 British adults with ME/CFS, 6 participants were unable to tolerate head-up tilt because of weakness. Of the remaining 58 with ME/CFS, 32 (55 percent) were symptomatic during the test, compared with 17/64 (27 percent) healthy controls. The types of symptoms were not specified (Hollingsworth et al., 2010). Research also has shown that the severity of orthostatic symptoms may predict the functional status of those with ME/CFS (Costigan et al., 2010). Open (nonblinded) treatment studies of ME/CFS subjects found improvement in function after increased sodium intake or pharmacological treatment of orthostatic intolerance (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995; De Lorenzo et al., 1997; Kawamura et al., 2003; Naschitz et al., 2004). However, randomized trials of fludrocortisone failed to confirm the efficacy of this treatment in adults as monotherapy or combined with hydrocortisone (Blockmans et al., 2003; Peterson et al., 1998; Rowe et al., 2001). More formal autonomic testing—using such measures as the cold pressor test, heart rate responses to deep breathing, handgrip tests, the Valsalva ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. maneuver, and quantitative sudomotor axon reflex tests—has not been conducted as extensively as have tests of the heart rate and blood pressure response to orthostatic stress. The majority of studies reporting the Valsalva ratio found no differences between ME/CFS and control groups (De Becker et al., 1998; Schondorf et al., 1999; Soetekouw et al., 1999; Winkler et al., 2004). Measures of heart rate variability have been used to examine the effects of autonomic tone on the heart noninvasively. ME/CFS is associated with enhanced sympathetic nervous system tone and reduced parasympathetic tone at baseline (Freeman and Komaroff, 1997; Frith et al., 2012; Sisto et al., 1995), in response to cognitive and orthostatic challenges (Beaumont et al., 2012; Yamamoto et al., 2003; Yataco et al., 1997), after walking (Cordero et al., 1996), and during sleep (Boneva et al., 2007; Rahman et al., 2011; Togo and Natelson, 2013; Yamaguti et al., 2013). Ambulatory blood pressure measurements in subjects with ME/CFS have had conflicting results. One study found significantly lower systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure in ME/CFS patients compared with controls, and a second found nighttime hypotension in ME/CFS patients (Newton et al., 2009; Van de Luit et al., 1998). Duprez and colleagues (1998), however, found no differences in daytime or nighttime blood pressure in ME/CFS patients. Of interest, although blood pressure did not differ in that study, there were significant differences in heart rate between ME/CFS cases and healthy controls throughout the 24-hour period. Studies measuring blood volume have found lower values in ME/CFS subjects than in controls. Hurwitz and colleagues (2010) found a total blood volume deficit of 15.1 percent in ME/CFS patients compared with controls. Streeten and Bell (1998) identified low red blood cell mass in 16 of 19 patients with ME/CFS and an overall total lower blood volume in 63 percent of ME/CFS patients. Okamoto and colleagues (2012b) identified a 10.4 percent lower total blood volume in subjects with ME/CFS and POTS compared with controls studied at the same center. Hurwitz and colleagues (2010) confirmed a lower cardiac index in ME/CFS patients (due to a 10.2 percent lower stroke index compared with sedentary and nonsedentary controls) and a cardiac contractility deficit of 25.1 percent. In a series of studies possibly involving some of the same patients, a high prevalence of orthostatic intolerance, associated with smaller heart on cardiothoracic ratios, was found in ME/CFS patients (Miwa, 2014; Miwa and Fujita, 2008, 2009, 2011). Hollingsworth and colleagues (2010) found a greater left ventricular work index with standing in ME/CFS patients compared with controls, suggesting that when the patients were standing, their hearts were working harder. These findings were associated ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. with the presentation of symptoms with standing in 95 percent of ME/CFS patients. Three studies examined orthostatic hypocapnia in subjects with CFS. Naschitz and colleagues (2000) found that end-tidal CO was similar for ME/CFS patients and controls when supine, consistent with the absence of hyperventilation at baseline, but end-tidal CO was lower for the ME/CFS subjects during upright tilt testing. These results were confirmed by Razumovsky and colleagues (2003) during prolonged head-up tilt testing and by Natelson and colleagues (2007) during 8 minutes of active standing. Three studies examined abnormalities in peripheral blood flow in ME/CFS patients using different physiologic or pharmacologic challenges. ME/CFS patients had abnormally prolonged vasodilation in response to transdermally applied acetylcholine (Khan et al., 2003), reduced oxygen delivery to muscles after exercise and after cuff ischemia (McCully and Natelson, 1999), and a strikingly increased venous contractile sensitivity to infused epinephrine (Streeten, 2001). These studies have yet to be replicated. Overlap of ME/CFS with Other Conditions Associated with Orthostatic Intolerance A small number of studies have examined the prevalence of ME/CFS symptoms in those diagnosed with POTS (Okamoto et al., 2012b) or vasovagal syncope (Kenny and Graham, 2001; Legge et al., 2008). Okamoto and colleagues (2012b) examined the prevalence of the ME/CFS symptoms of the Fukuda definition among those with POTS who did not satisfy the criteria for ME/CFS, comparing this group with those who had POTS together with ME/CFS. Those with POTS alone often reported an elevated prevalence of severe fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, impaired memory or concentration, muscle pain, and post-exertional fatigue, although they did not have a sufficient number of symptoms to satisfy the Fukuda definition. By definition, the prevalence of Fukuda symptoms was higher in ME/CFS subjects who also had POTS than in those with POTS alone, but the pattern of symptoms was similar between the two groups (Okamoto et al., 2012b). A high prevalence of hypotension and tachycardia is seen in FM, which, as noted earlier, is a clinical condition often comorbid with ME/CFS. Sym- ""4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations."" Institute of Medicine. 2015. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/19012. pathetic predominance of heart rate variability also is seen in FM studies (Martinez-Lavin, 2007; Martinez-Martinez et al., 2014). The prevalence of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and joint hypermobility is higher in ME/CFS patients than in healthy controls (Barron et al., 2002; Rowe et al., 1999). Studies also confirm high rates of fatigue as well as orthostatic and autonomic symptoms in those with hypermobility (Gazit et al., 2003) and the hypermobile form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (De Wandele et al., 2014a,b). There is consistent evidence that upright posture is associated with a worsening of ME/CFS symptoms, as well as the onset of other symptoms such as lightheadedness, nausea, and palpitations. While there is variability in the reported prevalence of orthostatic intolerance in ME/CFS, heart rate and blood pressure abnormalities during standing or head-up tilt testing are more common in those with ME/CFS than in those without ME/CFS. Heart rate variability analyses demonstrate a sympathetic predominance of autonomic tone in those with ME/CFS, including during sleep. Sufficient evidence indicates a high prevalence of orthostatic intolerance in ME/CFS, as measured by objective heart rate and blood pressure abnormalities during standing or head-up tilt testing or by patient-reported exacerbation of orthostatic symptoms with standing in day-to-day life. These findings indicate that orthostatic intolerance is a common and clinically important finding in ME/CFS. Armitage, R. 1999.

Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are serious, debilitating conditions that affect millions of people in the United States and around the world. ME/CFS can cause significant impairment and disability. Despite substantial efforts by researchers to better understand ME/CFS, there is no known cause or effective treatment. Diagnosing the disease remains a challenge, and patients often struggle with their illness for years before an identification is made. Some health care providers have been skeptical about the serious physiological - rather than psychological - nature of the illness. Once diagnosed, patients often complain of receiving hostility from their health care provider as well as being subjected to treatment strategies that exacerbate their symptoms. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome proposes new diagnostic clinical criteria for ME/CFS and a new term for the illness - systemic exertion intolerance disease(SEID). According to this report, the term myalgic encephalomyelitis does not accurately describe this illness, and the term chronic fatigue syndrome can result in trivialization and stigmatization for patients afflicted with this illness. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome stresses that SEID is a medical - not a psychiatric or psychological - illness. This report lists the major symptoms of SEID and recommends a diagnostic process.One of the report's most important conclusions is that a thorough history, physical examination, and targeted work-up are necessary and often sufficient for diagnosis. The new criteria will allow a large percentage of undiagnosed patients to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate care. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome will be a valuable resource to promote the prompt diagnosis of patients with this complex, multisystem, and often devastating disorder; enhance public understanding; and provide a firm foundation for future improvements in diagnosis and treatment. 3 Current Case Definitions and Diagnostic Criteria, Terminology, and Symptom Constructs and Clusters 4 Review of the Evidence on Major ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations 5 Review of the Evidence on Other ME/CFS Symptoms and Manifestations Appendix D: Questionnaires and Tools That May Be Useful for Assessing ME/CFS Symptoms Appendix E: Biographical Sketches of Committee Members, Consultants, and Staff You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

6d8fb8a6-9582-4749-9cf4-02f0f78dfad0,"Traditional Chinese Medicine Internal Organ Syndromes Internal organ syndromes require a practitioner to first make a general diagnosis before treatment can commence. In this way, is similar to Western medicine. However, a practitioner uses different methods to make a diagnosis -- taking into account the eight parameters, the vital substances, and the pernicious influences. Once a practitioner establishes a general diagnosis, the next step is to determine which organ systems are affected. This logical procedure leads to a final diagnosis that is specific enough to enable the physician to prepare a focused treatment plan. For example, a patient may have chronic night , irritability, and thirst -- general signs of deficiency -- but the practitioner still does not know which organ system to nourish at this point. Keeping in mind the normal functions of the organs, the practitioner might find further symptoms of , , and poor memory, concluding that the yin deficiency affects mostly the heart. The treatment plan would then include an to nourish heart yin. It is rare when all of the classic symptoms of a typical syndrome are present. In fact, it is more common for just a few symptoms to occur, and these often arise from two or three simultaneous patterns. For example, a person might have chronic spleen deficiency with symptoms of only poor appetite and loose stools. The same person could also have liver qi stagnation with the only symptom being once a month. If this person catches a on top of these underlying disorders, her symptoms would involve three separate patterns of disharmony. Early-stage and mild versions of syndromes may have very subtle symptom patterns; these require the diagnostic skills of an experienced practitioner. It is important to remember that the functions of organs in traditional Chinese medicine may overlap those of their Western counterparts, but they also have totally unrelated functions. For this reason, it is dangerous to attempt to find a standard correspondence between the two. For example, a chest cold might be diagnosed as a lung condition under both systems, but might be a kidney condition in traditional Chinese medical diagnostics. Both medical systems stand on their own strengths, but an attempt to artificially link the two can often make them less effective. Attempting to treat the simply with Chinese herbs that have antiviral qualities is less effective than getting an accurate diagnosis -- wind heat, for example -- and using a traditional formula for that wind heat. On the following pages, read more about syndromes that affect specific organs and the various conditions of imbalance that make up the foundation for an effective traditional treatment plan. Please keep in mind that many of these descriptions are for severe versions of the syndromes. The description of each pattern lists the full range of severity, from a mild set of symptoms to life threatening disease. If intervention takes place at the early stages, it is possible to restore balance before the symptoms become more severe.

Lung syndromes are common, as the lungs are in direct contact with the external environment; therefore, they are the organs most subject to attacks by external pernicious influences. They are also prone to disorders of deficiency and dryness, due to their need for a somewhat moist environment to function. (Each organ has its ""favorite"" climate, and a moist environment helps the lungs function.) Since the lungs govern , they affect the energy of the entire body if they become qi deficient. This syndrome is characterized by shortness of breath, weak voice, spontaneous , chronic weak cough, fatigue, bright pale face, frequent colds, a weak pulse, and a pale tongue. Some corresponding Western conditions might be , , , , depressed immune function, , and . The treatment principle is to tonify lung qi with such as (ren shen) and Astragalus (huang qi). A chronic deficiency pattern, lung yin deficiency produces such symptoms as night sweats, low-grade , dry , small amounts of sticky phlegm or no phlegm, dry mouth, thirst, red cheeks, vocal distortions (weak voice, hoarseness, pitch changes), heat in the ""five palms"" (palms, soles, and sternum), red tongue with little or no coat, and a small rapid pulse. Western diagnoses are smoker's cough, , chronic sore throat, or chronic bronchitis. Treatment is to tonify lung yin and clear deficiency heat with herbs such as Rehmannia (sheng di huang) or Ophiopogon (mai men dong). This acute excess syndrome produces chills, possibly a mild fever, nasal congestion, , upper body aches, a cough with clear or white phlegm that is easy to expectorate, and a tight, floating pulse. The common cold, , and the early stages of are considered to be wind cold conditions in traditional Chinese medicine. The treatment principle is to ""release the exterior"" with warm, diaphoretic herbs such as Ephedra (ma huang). This acute pattern differs somewhat from wind cold due to the influence of heat. Symptoms include a fever worse than the chills, a loud cough with yellow phlegm, sore throat, and a rapid, floating pulse. Treatment involves cooling herbs that release the exterior, such as honeysuckle (jin yin hua) or field mint (bo he). Copious amounts of clear or white phlegm is the main symptom of this excess syndrome. Other symptoms are shortness of breath, fullness in the chest, a thick, greasy tongue coating, slippery pulse, and a worsening of the symptoms when lying down. Corresponding Western conditions are chronic bronchitis with an acute episode, asthma, and . Treatment involves herbs that clear phlegm from the lungs such as Pinellia (ban xia). A serious internal excess pattern, hot phlegm stagnation produces such symptoms as difficulty breathing, thirst, a loud, frequent cough with green-yellow or bloody phlegm, a fishy smell on the breath, constipation, dark urine, chest pain, high fever, red tongue with a thick yellow coat, and a slippery, rapid pulse. Western diagnoses could be lung abscess, acute bronchitis, or pneumonia. Cooling antibiotic herbs, such as Houttuynia (yu xing cao) and Scutellaria (huang qin), are used. Symptoms of this syndrome include a dry cough, dry and cracked tongue coat, loss of voice, dry nose, sore, dry throat, and a floating, rapid pulse. Although it shares some aspects of yin deficiency, dryness attacking the lung is acute and external, while yin deficiency is chronic and internal. Another distinguishing factor is the lack of deficiency heat signs such as night sweats and ""five palm heat."" Some corresponding Western conditions are the common cold, acute bronchitis, later-stage pneumonia, allergy, and due to an overly dry environment. Herbs that moisten the lungs and release the exterior, such as Phragmites (lu gen) and kudzu (ge gen), are used. On the next page, find out about syndromes that affect the spleen -- an organ vital to digestion and the circulatory system -- and how to treat spleen syndromes.

Spleen syndromes range from those that involve digestion to those that affect the circulatory system. The main functions of the spleen are to transform food and fluids, nourish the , and control the , keeping it within the blood vessels. For this reason, most patterns of disharmony of the spleen involve poor appetite and digestion, , and bleeding disorders. The spleen prefers a dry environment, so it is prone to conditions of dampness from climate and dietary factors. It is especially sensitive to cold, damp weather and cold or raw foods, both of which are fertile ground for the pathogenic factor of dampness. When the spleen functions properly, the body is strong and well nourished. Blood, fluids, and the organs are also in their proper places; thus there is no deficient-type bleeding (blood), edema (fluids), or prolapse (organs). When the qi of the spleen is deficient, the spleen is unable to perform its functions of digestion. In addition to the typical qi deficiency signs of fatigue and pale face and tongue, additional symptoms specific to the spleen include poor appetite, weight loss, fullness and sleepiness after eating, and loose stools. (Other conditions are associated with spleen qi deficiency, such as sagging organs and bleeding, but these are discussed as separate syndromes.) Some corresponding Western conditions are ulcers, , chronic , , chronic , and . Treatment consists of tonifying spleen qi with herbs such as (ren shen). The classic formula to tonify spleen qi is Four Gentlemen decoction (Si Jun Zi Tang). This more severe version of spleen qi deficiency has the above-mentioned symptoms as well as cold signs such as cold hands and feet, edema, a desire for warm food and drinks, abdominal discomfort after eating cold food, and with undigested food in the stools. Western diseases that fit this syndrome are chronic , infection with , , and . The treatment principle is to tonify spleen qi and yang and warm the interior with herbs such as ginseng (ren shen), Astragalus (huang qi), (gan jiang), and black pepper (hu jiao). Since spleen qi supports the organs with its uplifting energy, this aspect of deficient qi is associated with a prolapse (sagging) and a sensation of bearing down in the internal organs. Some organs affected are the stomach, transverse colon, uterus, and rectum. Hemorrhoids are also a condition of spleen qi collapse. In some cases, can occur from lack of to ""hold things up,"" or retain the fetus with ""upward"" force. Treatment is to ""raise the middle qi"" with classic formulas such as Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (""Decoction to Tonify the Middle Burner and Raise the Vital Energy""). This formula contains herbs such as ginseng (ren shen) and Astragalus (huang qi) to build the spleen qi, along with herbs that have an uplifting energy such as Bupleurum (chai hu) and Cimicifuga (sheng ma). Another function of spleen qi is to keep the blood flowing within the vessels. When this function is disturbed, standard symptoms of spleen qi deficiency occur along with bleeding under the skin (easy ), excessive menstrual bleeding, , and blood in the urine or stools. Since this bleeding is due to deficiency, the color of the blood is often lighter than might occur in excess bleeding disorders such as heat in the blood. Some of the Western disease patterns that could fall into this pattern are any chronic bleeding diseases, , bleeding , bruising from deficiency, and . The treatment is to tonify spleen qi and tonify blood. The classic formula for this purpose, Eight Treasure Decoction (Ba Zhen Tang), combines the standard formulas for qi and blood tonification. This excess pattern arises when the dampness pernicious influence overwhelms the spleen. Symptoms include abdominal fullness and bloating, , , watery stool, lack of thirst, sticky sensation and sweet taste in the mouth, dizziness, heavy feelings in the body, and a thick, greasy coat on the tongue. Some corresponding Western conditions are stomach ""flu,"" chronic gastritis, chronic , ulcers, and hepatitis. The treatment involves the use of fragrant herbs that ""penetrate the dampness and wake up the spleen,"" such as patchouli (huo xiang). In this excess disharmony condition, the dampness symptoms combine with those of heat. They are: , yellow eyes, bitter taste in the mouth, nausea, vomiting, dislike of greasy food, burning urine and diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and mouth sores. Some Western diagnoses are hepatitis, gallbladder disease, and acute gastroenteritis. The treatment principle is to clear damp heat with herbs such as Coptis (huang lian) and Artemisia (yin chen hao). On the next page, read descriptions about conditions that affect the heart and how Chinese medicine can help alleviate signs and symptoms associated with heart problems.

Heart and pericardium syndromes can manifest themselves either physically -- as in some circulatory conditions such as cold hands and feet -- or in mental or emotional disturbances. Insomnia is a common complaint of peoplewith heart syndromes. The heart governs the blood and vessels and is the seat of the mind and spirit. Generally, external pernicious influences don't affect the heart directly; instead, they typically attack the pericardium, the sac around the heart known in Chinese medicine as the ""heart protector."" The pericardium is considered the sixth , but its functions are typically linked with the heart. The shield between the heart and the exterior, the pericardium protects the heart from the invasion of external pathogenic factors. In almost all disharmonies of the heart, palpitations are a key symptom. This pounding of the heart occurs in both excess and deficiency patterns. are the key symptom in this deficiency pattern. Other symptoms are spontaneous (sweating without exertion or overheating), physical and mental , , pale face, and a weak pulse, especially in the heart area on the left wrist. This pattern can correspond to chronic fatigue, (chronic mental and physical weakness), or heart disease involving the muscle, valves, or vessels. The treatment principle for this deficiency is to tonify heart qi with standard qi tonics such as ginseng (ren shen), along with that act specifically on the heart, such as Schizandra (wu wei zi) and Biota (bai zi ren). This syndrome has all the symptoms of heart qi deficiency with the addition of cold symptoms: feeling cold in the limbs or entire body; purple face, tongue, and lips due to cold stagnating the circulation; and a slow, choppy, and intermittent pulse. A deeper, more serious condition than qi deficiency, heart yang deficiency typically corresponds to a Western diagnosis of true . The treatment is to tonify heart yang with moxibustion and herbs such as ginseng (ren shen) and aconite (fu zi). : Aconite is a highly toxic herb, and it should only be used in a formula prepared and supervised by a qualified practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. A more severe version of heart yang deficiency, heart yang collapse produces all the symptoms of qi and yang deficiency plus copious cold sweats, extreme cold in the limbs, very weak breathing, a minute pulse, and abnormal shen that precedes a comatose state. Corresponding Western diagnoses are or , so this syndrome requires hospitalization. In China, the person receives herbal treatment while hospitalized. Typical treatment is an intravenous drip of Salvia (dan shen) and oral doses of ginseng (ren shen) and aconite (fu zi). This pattern of deficiency involving the blood produces symptoms of palpitations, fearfulness and a propensity to be easily startled, , excessive while asleep, mental restlessness, forgetfulness, dizziness, pale face and tongue, and a thin, small pulse. The insomnia is due to an insufficient amount of blood to provide a calm foundation for the spirit. Possibly corresponding to anemia or emotional imbalances, this deficiency syndrome is treated by tonifying heart blood with herbs such as (dang gui) and longan fruit (long yan rou). This syndrome of deficiency heat produces red cheeks, night sweats, ""five palm heat,"" dry mouth, thirst for small amounts of water, mental restlessness, insomnia, palpitations, low-grade fever, forgetfulness, excessive dreaming, red tongue with little or no coat, and a small, rapid pulse. A person with this deficiency has difficulty remaining asleep -- the heat condition wakes them. Because the heart is the seat of the spirit, an insufficiency of calming, nurturing yin or blood in the heart results in agitation. and can match this pattern, which is treated with herbs that clear heat and tonify heart yin such as Emperor's Teapills (Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan). This excess heat pattern produces symptoms that include a red face, dry mouth with a desire for lots of water, a red tip and prickles on the tongue with possible ulcers and pain, bitter taste in the mouth, burning urine, mental restlessness, insomnia, and a full, rapid pulse. Excess heat signs are stronger than those of heat due to yin deficiency. Some corresponding Western conditions are , high blood pressure, or tongue infection. The treatment aims to clear heat and calm the spirit with and herbs such as lotus seed sprouts (lian zi xin) and Coptis (huang lian). This serious heart condition has symptoms of a sharp, stabbing pain in the heart area, pain that can radiate up the arm, purple face and tongue, fatigue, palpitations, and a choppy, wiry, or intermittent pulse. It sometimes occurs with heart yang or qi deficiency and includes the symptoms common to these patterns. Corresponding Western diseases are , coronary arte­riosclerosis, or -- all requiring intensive medical intervention. Treatment involves regulating the qi and vitalizing the blood with circulatory stimulants such as Salvia (dan shen) and Panax pseudoginseng (san qi). This excess condition is characterized by excess heat causing a red face and eyes, irrational and possibly violent behavior, nonstop loud talking, anger, a red tongue with a greasy yellow coat, and a rapid, slippery pulse. It corresponds to the Western diagnoses of mental illness, mania, or . The treatment for hot phlegm confusing the heart is to calm the spirit and clear heat and phlegm with acupuncture and herbs such as Coptis (huang lian) and Borneol (bing pian). In this condition, which is related to the above syndrome but with less heat, symptoms include a pale tongue with a white coating, mental confusion, difficulty speaking (muttering to oneself, drooling), the sound of phlegm in the throat, and possible . Some corresponding Western diseases are , , , or mental illness. The treatment principle is to clear the phlegm and revive the consciousness with scalp acupuncture and herbs that resolve phlegm and wake up the spirit, such as Calamus (shi chang pu). The main syndrome of the pericardium is known as ""heat crushing the pericardium,"" which is characterized by a high , mental confusion, , and, possibly, . This pattern can appear in acute febrile diseases with a high fever, such as encephalitis or , where the sudden high temperature affects the consciousness. Treatment includes the use of acupuncture points on the pericardium meridian, along with herbs that clear excess heat, such as tree peony root (mu dan pi). On the next page, learn about the liver, the organ that aids in detoxification, and the syndromes that affect it. Chinese medicine is adept at treating liver syndromes.

Liver syndromes are commonly seen in clinical practice, since the and toxicity of modern life (poor diet, chemicals in our food and environment, stress, overwork, etc.) take a toll on the liver. Since the liver plays the central role in the smooth flow of and emotion in the body, disharmony of the liver can affect any of the other organs. Typically, disorders of the or stress-related ailments indicate a problem with the liver. This is one of the most common diagnoses in . When the qi of the liver is stuck, symptoms of frustration, irritability, , , fullness in the chest, menstrual disorders, and can occur. This excess condition can also arise in a person who has experienced long-term depression or frustrations, creating a vicious cycle of cause and effect. Some Western conditions that fit this pattern are , depression, , or . Treatment with often has an immediate effect in relieving the symptoms. A classic formula known as Xiao Yao Wan (""Free and Easy Wanderer Pills"") is also very effective in rectifying this liver syndrome. This excess heat pattern mainly affects the upper body, since heat rises naturally. The entire face is red, with additional signs and symptoms of red eyes, anger, , ringing in the ears (), bitter taste in the mouth, , , dark urine, red tongue with a yellow coat, and a full, rapid pulse. The condition can arise from long-term stagnation of qi due to anger, , or chronic liver imbalances that develop into heat patterns. Some corresponding Western diagnoses are , alcoholism, , acute hepatitis, gallbladder infection, ear infection, and . Treatment involves clearing heat and regulating the liver with acupuncture and herbal formulas such as Long Dan Xie Gan Wan. When dampness accumulates in the body and combines with heat in the liver and gallbladder, this excess syndrome develops. Its symptoms are and dark urine, which are caused by a stagnation of yellow bile that backs up and is excreted through the skin and urine. Additional symptoms include a lack of appetite, an aversion to greasy food, digestive problems, bitter taste in the mouth, , , burning , a red tongue with a thick, greasy yellow coat, and a slippery, rapid pulse. In Western medicine, most of these symptoms are typical of acute hepatitis or , but this pattern can also correspond to , vaginal discharges, testicular pain, and . The treatment principle is to clear heat and drain dampness with herbs such as rhubarb root (da huang), gentian (long dan cao), and Artemisia (yin chen hao). Since the liver is in charge of the smooth flow of qi, any abnormal body movements are typically related to liver imbalances due to wind. This internal wind is considered an excess pattern, but it can arise from a variety of causes, such as blood deficiency, excess heat, or liver deficiency. The cardinal symptoms involve abnormal movements such as shaking, spasms, tics, rigidity, and . Dizziness, headache, and difficulty in speaking may also occur. The tongue and pulse signs depend on which underlying pattern has caused the stirring of wind, but the pulse is usually wiry, a typical sign of liver imbalance. This pattern is seen in stroke patients and those with and cases of seizures associated with a high fever, , and hypertension. Acupunc­ture can be a very effective treatment, as are herbs that clear liver wind and heat, such as Gastrodia (tian ma), Uncaria (gou teng), and Chrysanthemum (jua hua). If the problem is caused by depletion, the underlying deficiency must be tonified. For example, if wind is due to deficient liver yin, treatment must both tonify the liver yin and subdue the wind. The liver meridian encircles the genital area, so localized disorders in the reproductive organs are often traced to a blockage in that meridian. This syndrome is characterized by pain in the groin, lower abdomen, and testicles and is relieved by application of heat. This pattern typically corresponds to a but may also be present in cold-type menstrual disorders and . Treatment involves warming with moxa and using herbs that regulate qi and warm the liver meridian, such as Galangal (gao liang jiang) and lychee seed (li zhi he). This syndrome has the typical symptoms of blood deficiency: pale face and tongue, dizziness, dry skin, and thin pulse. The condition of the eyes and nails are clues to the state of the liver, so symptoms may include pale, cracked nails, blurred vision, itchy eyes, night blindness, and visual distortions such as spots and floaters. Menstrual flow may be scanty or nonexistent, and lack of nourishment to the tendons from liver blood deficiency can lead to pain, numbness, or cramping in the legs. Possible Western diagnoses are , malnutrition, hypertension, menstrual disorders, and eye problems. Treatment involves tonifying the blood with standard blood tonics such as (dang gui), cooked Rehmannia (shu di huang), and Polygonum multiflorum (he shou wu), along with herbs that specifically nourish the liver such as Lycium fruit (gou qi zi). This syndrome exhibits the usual signs of ""five palm heat"": red cheeks, night sweats, red tongue with no coat, and a thin, rapid pulse. Additional symptoms specific to the liver are dizziness, irritability, and dry, irritated eyes. Treatment involves tonifying liver yin and clearing heat with formulas such as Chrysanthemum, Lycium, and Rehmannia Pills (Qi Ju Di Huang Wan). If liver yin deficiency continues without treatment, the deficiency heat rises to the head. Known as liver yang rising, it produces additional symptoms of headache and anger. It is an intermediate syndrome -- more severe than a simple yin deficiency but less severe than liver fire. Some Western diagnoses are anemia, chronic hepatitis, hypertension, eye problems, , and menstrual disorders. Treatment involves sedating the excess liver yang with formulas such as Gastrodia and Uncaria Combination (Tian Ma Gou Teng Yin). If the yang rising symptoms are especially severe, heavy herbs that settle yang, such as oyster shell (mu li), are added. Joe is a 40-year-old executive with a high-stress lifestyle, often working overtime. He drinks coffee frequently to ""keep up his energy,"" and his meals often consist of pastries from a vending machine. His colleagues complain he is prone to bouts of sudden anger for no good reason, so they keep their distance. He always seems to have a stiff neck, and his face and eyes are often red. His doctor is very concerned about his high blood pressure, and his wife has warned him that she will leave him if he doesn't stop yelling at her at the slightest provocation. This is a classic case of excess liver yang or fire, caused by Joe's lifestyle and diet. The symptoms can be alleviated with acupuncture and herbal therapy. However, to achieve lasting healing, Joe's life needs a major overhaul. In addition to working less, the most important change he must make is to eliminate coffee, since it directly overheats the liver. Since caffeine withdrawal can also cause similar symptoms, green tea is a good substitute at first. Although it still has some caffeine, green tea has a cooling energy that disturbs the liver far less. And it can be decreased or eliminated later without causing discomfort. A well-balanced diet is also essential, since a deficient diet harms the liver and also leads to qi deficiency and a consequent craving for stimulants. Exercise and stress-reduction techniques will also help lower blood pressure and create an appetite for good food. Once Joe's liver cools down with lifestyle changes, acupuncture, and herbal therapy, he will be much less prone to outbursts of anger. He can then take cooling tonics such as American ginseng, which will give him extra energy without creating all the side effects of coffee.

Kidney syndromes can have an effect anywhere in the body, since the kidneys are the source of and for the entire body. They are the storage site for the essence, the substance responsible for growth, fertility, and vitality, so the kidneys are only subject to syndromes of deficiency. Patterns of deficient , yin, or yang are often traced to a corresponding syndrome of deficiency within the kidneys; similarly, a long-term depletion in any organ eventually depletes the kidneys. The kidney yang is the source of metabolic fire (the heat needed for digestion and other bodily functions) for the entire body. When kidney yang is depleted, symptoms are cold hands and feet, frequent urination with clear urine or water retention and edema, night urination, pallor, pain in the lower back and knees, low sex drive, apathy, and an aversion to cold environments. This chronic condition can correspond to the Western conditions of nephritis, , adrenal insufficiency, chronic , , and . Treatment involves tonifying the ""life-gate fire"" by applying heat from moxibustion at a point below the second lumbar vertebra. The standard herb formula is Rehmannia Eight (Ba Wei Di Huang Wan), which contains that nourish the kidneys along with hot metabolic stimulants such as cinnamon bark (rou gui) and aconite (fu zi). This syndrome exhibits all the above symptoms of yang deficiency, but in this case the lack of yang leads to a debility in fluid transformation (fluids don't move to their proper locations; instead, they collect in organs or limbs). The specific symptoms related to this metabolic failure include edema in the lower body, abdominal fullness, nausea, difficulty breathing, or with thin mucus, and small amounts of clear urine. This syndrome can correspond to congestive heart failure or nephritis. Treatment consists of tonifying kidney yang as above, with the addition of diuretic herbs such as Plantago seeds (che qian zi) and ginger root skin (sheng jiang pi). This condition of deficiency heat is due to a depletion of the yin. Typical yin deficiency signs of red cheeks, night , ""five palm heat,"" dry mouth, a red tongue with little or no coat, and a thin, rapid pulse occur. In addition, depletion symptoms specific to the kidneys occur, such as concentrated urine, nocturnal emissions of semen, , overactive sex drive, , , , and sore low back and knees. This pattern might match Western diagnoses of lumbago, , , hyperthyroidism, and psychological or emotional disorders. The standard base formula for all varieties of kidney yin deficiency is (Liu Wei Di Huang Wan). The kidney essence is responsible for growth, development, and reproduction. Children with this deficiency may exhibit late closure of the soft spots in the skull, slow growth, late development of speech and walking, or . Adults may experience premature aging, fragile bones, loss of teeth and hair, infertility, and poor memory. In children, the syndrome is entirely genetic; in adults the pattern arises from old age or ""burning the candle at both ends."" Treatment consists of tonifying kidney yin and yang; the balance of warm and cold herbs is tailored to fit the individual situation. In addition, herbs are used that specifically strengthen the essence, such as privet fruit (nu zhen zi) and Cuscuta (tu si zi).

Although the small intestine's functions are to separate food and fluids into essential and waste components, it is considered a . As such, its patterns of disharmony are usually related to a dysfunction in a such as the heart or spleen. Various forms of are effective at treatingsmall and large intestine syndromes. The large intestine has the same functions in as it does in Western physiology: receiving food from the small intestine, separating the fluids, and passing on the remainder as waste. Dysfunctions of the large intestine typically involve a disruption in one of these activities, often due to poor dietary habits. This pattern can arise in a deficiency of spleen yang. Symptoms include pain around the navel that is relieved with pressure and heat, watery or loose stools, frequent clear urination, and a gurgling sound in the abdomen. The tongue is pale with a white coat, and the pulse is deep, empty, and slow. Some corresponding Western conditions are infections with the organism, , , chronic dysentery, or -related digestive disorders. Treatment involves tonifying spleen yang with moxibustion and warm, strengthening such as (ren shen) and ginger (gan jiang). Excess heat in the heart can be transferred to the small intestine, since the two organs are paired in a yin/yang relationship. When this occurs, the symptoms include frequent dark burning urine, thirst, a red tip on the tongue, mental restlessness, and a rapid, full pulse. Although the cause is often emotional hyperactivity, the excess heat shows up in the urine in a typical Western diagnosis of . The treatment principle is to clear heat from the heart and small intestine with and herbs such as Lophatherum (dan zhu ye) and lotus sprout (lian zi xin). Often associated with stagnant liver qi, this pattern exhibits distention and pain in the lower abdomen that feels worse when pressure is applied, distention and pain in the groin, gurgling sounds in the abdominal area, pain relief after passing gas, a pale tongue with a thin, white coat, and a deep, wiry pulse. Corresponding Western conditions might be of the small intestine, , food allergies, and enteritis. Since it is a disorder of stagnant qi, acupuncture and stress reduction are particularly helpful to treat it. Herbal therapy includes herbs to regulate , such as Bupleurum (chai hu), white peony root (bai shao), and Cyperus (xiang fu). This excess syndrome is characterized by , a bloated, painful abdomen, , explosive burning diarrhea with a bad smell, concentrated urine, thirst, a red tongue with a thick yellow coat, and a full, rapid pulse. It is associated with acute bacterial dysentery or any serious infection. Treatment involves clearing excess heat from the large intestine with cooling purgative herbs such as rhubarb (da huang) and Mirabilite (mang xiao). This pattern is similar to the excess heat syndrome described above, with the addition of the influence of dampness, which makes recovery slower than with simple excess heat. The dampness also creates the additional symptoms of , a sensation of not being finished when defecating, blood or pus in the stools, intermittent fever, a slippery pulse, and a greasy yellow tongue coating. This pattern corresponds to acute amoebic dysentery or and is treated with herbs that clear dampness and heat from the large intestine, such as Coptis (huang lian) and Pulsatilla (bai tou weng). This excess pattern has symptoms of abdominal bloating with pain that gets worse when pressure is applied, constipation, , , deep, full pulse, and a greasy, thick white coat on the tongue. It is seen in intestinal blockages due to a hernia or scar tissue and is often seen in children. Typically, surgery is required. If the blockage is only partial, acupuncture and strong purgative herbs such as Croton (ba dou) can alleviate the symptoms. This excess pattern, which combines excess heat with qi and blood stagnation, causes sharp, fixed abdominal pain that worsens when pressure is applied, bloating, constipation or diarrhea, vomiting, fever, a deep-red tongue with a thick yellow dry coat, and a full, wiry, rapid pulse. Possible Western diagnoses are , , and some dysentery. This is a serious condition, and proper medical intervention is essential. An acupuncture point on the leg known as Lanwei is specific for appendicitis. Since this condition can be caused by hardened feces blocking the appendix, stimulating this point could dislodge the blockage, explaining this point's effectiveness in treating early-stage appendicitis. Treatment includes cooling, purgative herbs such as rhubarb root (da huang) and herbs such as tree peony root (mu dan pi) to move stagnant qi and blood. The fluid deficiency in this syndrome can arise from old age, dehydration after an illness, delivery of a baby, or chronic infections. The symptoms are chronic constipation, dry mouth, dry stools, small and rapid pulse, and a dry, red, and cracked tongue. The treatment principle for this syndrome is to clear heat and moisten the intestines with herbs such as Cannabis seeds (huo ma ren) and Rehmannia root (sheng di huang). Usually a result of spleen yang deficiency, this pattern has symptoms of watery diarrhea without a strong smell, abdominal pain relieved by pressure and warmth, gurgling abdominal sounds, a worsening of symptoms after eating cold food, deep weak pulse, and a pale, swollen tongue with teeth marks. Treatment includes herbs that tonify spleen yang, such as dried ginger (gan jiang), as well as moxibustion to points on the abdomen. On the next page, learn more about another organ of the digestive tract -- the stomach. Chinese medicine can be quite effective in treating stomach syndromes.

Stomach syndromes typically include digestive disturbances because all the stomach's functions involve breaking down food. Since the stomach and spleen are intimately related in a /polarity, imbalances in one organ often affect the other. This syndrome of internal excess heat is characterized by a burning pain in the upper abdominal area, excessive hunger even after eating, thirst, , in the mouth, pain and bleeding in the gums, , , red tongue with a thick, dry yellow coat, and a strong, rapid pulse. Some parallel Western diagnoses might be or , and treatment involves that clear stomach fire, such as Coptis (huang lian). This excess syndrome, usually due to overeating, can have either cold or heat signs. Symptoms include a lack of appetite, a full, bloated feeling in the stomach, nausea, vomiting, , and acid belching. Treatment of food stagnation includes herbs that move in the stomach, such as green tangerine peel (qing pi), along with herbs that relieve the food stagnation itself. If the person has overindulged in fatty foods, the herb of choice is hawthorn berries (shan zha); when the syndrome results from overeating of grains, barley sprouts (mai ya) are preferred. Symptoms of this deficiency syndrome include a lack of appetite, thirst with an inability to drink more than a few sips, dry mouth and lips, dry stools, a thin, rapid pulse, and a red tongue with no coat, especially in the center. Since the stomach yin is the source of the tongue coat, its corresponding area in the middle of the tongue appears especially peeled. This syndrome can match a Western diagnosis of chronic gastric ulcer or . The herbal treatment focuses on tonifying stomach yin with herbs such as Dendrobium (shi hu) and Ophiopogon (mai men dong). A pattern of deficiency typically involving the spleen, it has symptoms of ""dirty water stagnation"": When the person moves, it is possible to hear liquids splashing. Other symptoms of this pattern are dull pains in the stomach area that are relieved by pressure and warmth, excessive sputum in the mouth, , bloating, and . The pulse is slow, weak, slippery, and deficient, while the tongue is pale with a greasy white coat. This pattern of deficiency could possibly correspond to a Western diagnosis of , infection with the organism, or chronic gastroenteritis. Moxibustion to points on the abdomen is quite helpful in treating a cold disorder such as this. Herbal therapy includes use of herbs that are warming to the stomach such as (gan jiang), tonics such as (ren shen), and dampness-draining herbs such as Poria (fu ling). On the next page, learn about the symptoms and signs of gallbladder and urinary bladder syndromes. These syndromes are frequently affected by other organs, such as the liver and kidneys.

Before undertaking any course of treatment, the reader must seek the advice of their physician or other health care provider. Gallbladder and urinary bladder syndromes can be caused or exacerbated by problems with other organs. The gallbladder is affected by the liver, and the urinary bladder is affected by the kidneys. This is because the gallbladder is related to the liver in a /relationship and by physical proximity. The liver produces , while the gallbladder stores and secretes it. Since a strong gallbladder helps a person be assertive and decisive, imbalances in the organ can lead to indecision and timidity. The urinary bladder performs the functions of receiving waste water from the kidneys and excreting it from the body. It is paired in a yin/yang relationship with the kidneys, so a deficiency in the urinary bladder is typically related to a deficiency in the kidneys. The kidneys have no excess syndromes, so any excess pattern in the urinary tract is diagnosed as a urinary bladder dishar­mony. This syndrome is described in the section on under ""Liver and Gallbladder Damp Heat."" When the gallbladder is weak and under the influence of dampness, this syndrome can develop. Its symptoms are , blurry vision, , being easily startled, indecisiveness, frightening , vomiting with a bitter taste, dull pain or distention in the rib area, a pale, puffy tongue with a greasy white coating, and a slippery, wiry pulse. Corresponding Western conditions might include emotional or psychological disorders, (especially in people who are overweight), and menopausal symptoms. Treatment for this syndrome includes that calm the spirit and clear phlegm from the gallbladder, such as Gallbladder Warming Decoction (Wen Dan Tang). This excess pattern has symptoms of pain and distention in the lower abdomen, frequent urination that is burning and produces dark urine, possible stones or blood in the urine, low back pain, and a rapid, slippery pulse. The tongue is red with a thick, greasy yellow coating, especially in the back area of the tongue, which corresponds to the lower burner. Some possible corresponding Western diagnoses are , urinary tract stones, or prostate disorders. The treatment principle is to clear lower burner damp heat with herbs such as Dianthus (qu mai), Phellodendron (huang bai), and Andrographis (chuan xin lian). If the kidney qi or yang is depleted, this deficiency syndrome can occur in the bladder. Symptoms are frequent urination that is clear and copious, occasional difficulty in urinating, inability to hold in the urine, bed-wetting, feelings of cold and pain in the lower abdomen or lower back, a deep, weak pulse, and a pale, moist, puffy tongue with a thin white coat. It can be diagnosed as a chronic urinary tract infection or prostate disorder, and treatment involves moxibustion on the lower abdomen. Herbal therapy focuses on tonifying kidney yang with herbs such as Rehmannia (shu di huang), Aconite (fu zi), and cinnamon bark (rou gui).

FACT CHECKED BY Ever since reared its ugly head and upended our world, long-lasting symptoms of the virus have been varied and hard to pinpoint—until now. ""A survey conducted by Dr. Natalie Lambert of Indiana University School of Medicine and Survivor Corps analyzed the long-term experiences COVID-19 survivors are having with the virus. The COVID-19 'Long Hauler' Symptoms Survey identified 98 long-lasting symptoms."" Click through from least common to most common to see if you've experienced any. Read on, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these . Syncope is when you faint or pass out, usually due to a temporary drop in blood flow to the brain, reports the finds syncope may be the presenting symptom of a COVID-19 infection, even in those who are asymptomatic. ""Recognizing this possibility is of extreme importance, especially in the initial phase of COVID-19 infection,"" warn the researchers. When lymph nodes throb or swell, it's a sign of trauma around the neck area, an infection, or a bacterial illness related to a cold or sore throat, reports . COVID-19 is generally known as a respiratory virus that can also affect your throat and sinuses.  Your thyroid is an essential element to your body's proper functionality. According to , it ""plays a major role in the metabolism, growth and development of the human body."" It does this by releasing the perfect amount of thyroid hormones at the perfect times. Some COVID-19 sufferers report having elevated thyroid levels as a long-lasting symptom of the virus. Anemia is ""a condition in which you lack enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your body's tissues,"" says the . The most common type of anemia is associated with not getting enough iron. The condition makes you feel tired and weak. In some cases, it may even cause chest pain and dizziness, which are common long-lasting symptoms of coronavirus.  The symptoms of herpes, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and trigeminal neuralgia are varied and may include fatigue, inflamed throat, fever, and facial pain. These are also common symptoms of COVID-19 and 38 sufferers who participated in the survey reported experiencing symptoms of these conditions after the virus was gone. GERD is acid reflux and it's commonly known to cause excessive salivation, or drooling. According to , trauma or infections in the throat, such as sinus infections or swollen adenoids, can cause GERD, which may lead to drooling.  Scientists are studying the rare but potentially severe personality changes that COVID-19 may cause in patients. According to an article published in , symptoms related to the brain are often overlooked as medical professionals focus on the physical aspects of the virus.  However, depression, personality changes, and confusion are some long-lasting symptoms that some COVID-19 sufferers may experience. Thrush is small, white lesions inside your mouth caused by an imbalance of bacterial growth, more specifically an overgrowth of Candida, according to . Some people are more prone to developing thrush but it may also be common with COVID-19 survivors. Since the virus affects your respiratory system and throat, imbalances in the mouth and tongue may also occur.  Your hormones are important because they regulate your appetite, mood, sexual function, and body temperature. According to , a hormone imbalance may be caused by stress, an unhealthy lifestyle, or a buildup of toxins in the body.  COVID-19 sufferers may experience this imbalance as the virus wreaks havoc on their respiratory system and as their immune system works hard to fight it off.  A urinary tract infection occurs when germs get into the urethra and begin to spread throughout the urinary tract, says to ""found a potentially dangerous overlap of classical urinary symptoms and the as yet not fully described symptoms of COVID-19."" Urinary frequency and the virus may be related, which explains its potential cause of UTIs in patients. Kidney issues, including protein in the urine, was a long-lasting symptom of COVID-19 for 47 survey participants. The specific ways the virus affects kidneys isn't known yet, but according to , it may invade kidney cells or the low levels of oxygen the virus causes may be what contribute to these long-lasting kidney problems. While it's not a serious issue, dry scalp and dandruff can be uncomfortable and embarrassing. According to , dandruff can be caused by changes in hormones, so it makes sense that it's related to the virus.  There are many causes of low blood pressure, such as genetics, your diet, or dehydration. According to the , low blood pressure is also related to infections and hormone fluctuations, which is why it may be a long-lasting symptom of COVID-19.  ""COVID toes"" are an emerging symptom of the virus that may not be as common as the other symptoms, such as cough or fever. COVID toes occur when the toes develop a rash or lesions. According to , from the Cleveland Clinic, rashes on the skin are common with viral infections such as COVID-19. The survey found that 59 participants had this strange side effect after being infected with coronavirus.  , it's possible that coronavirus could cause an eye infection, such as conjunctivitis, also known as pinkeye. The concludes that styes are caused by bacterial infections, which could explain the relationship to this eye condition and the virus.  Foot pain can be caused by a number of ailments, such as corns, plantar fasciitis, or achilles tendon injuries. """" may contribute to this pain since some patients can have trouble walking or sleeping due to lesions on their toes. In most cases, this strange symptom goes away so the foot pain should also subside. A goiter is an ""abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland,"" according to the . While a goiter doesn't necessarily mean the thyroid isn't functioning correctly, it does indicate that there's a potential hormonal imbalance causing the thyroid gland to grow abnormally. 70 survey respondents dealt with a goiter after COVID-19, possibly due to the hormonal effects the virus has on the body. Cracked or dry lips can occur in especially cold or hot weather or may be a sign of dehydration. When a virus like COVID-19 takes hold, dry lips may also occur because viruses are likely to cause dehydration. The suggests using lip balm, drinking plenty of fluids, and refraining from picking at the dry skin to get this symptom to go away. COVID-19 is a respiratory virus so it's no wonder those who contracted the illness feel a cold or burning sensation in their lungs. However, this symptom may last longer than the virus since 74 survey participants reported this feeling after coronavirus was gone. An concludes that many COVID-19 sufferers felt this ""slow burn"" for a while, until it either worsened and was treated or went away completely. COVID Symptoms Usually Appear in This Order, Study Finds , bluish lips or face is an emergency of COVID-19. When your lips turn blue, it's a sign your blood oxygen has dipped to extreme levels. The survey found that 77 participants claimed they experienced low blood oxygen after contracting coronavirus. One reason for this is that lung capacity may not have fully recovered from the respiratory virus. defines arrhythmia as a heart rhythm problem and explains it happens when ""electrical impulses that coordinate your heartbeats don't work properly, causing your heart to beat too fast, too slow or irregularly."" A studied hospitalized coronavirus patients and found some of them suffered bradyarrhythmias or cardiac arrests. The study concluded heart traumas and abnormalities like these are ""likely the consequence of systemic illness and not solely the direct effects of COVID-19 infection."" In the survey, 80 participants reported jaw pain as a long-lasting symptom of COVID-19. According to the , jaw pain may be caused by bone problems, stress, infection, sinus issues, or tooth grinding. It's known that coronavirus causes aches and pains, so this jaw pain may be a lingering side effect of the body fighting off the virus. For COVID-19 sufferers, a painful scalp may be a side effect of the dandruff the virus may cause or aches and pains associated with the illness. According to , scalp pain or ailments may occur after recovering from a high fever, when dealing with a thyroid issue, or if you have poor nutrition. , a ""tingling, burning, or 'fizzing' sensation"" was reported from several COVID-19 patients. This sensation may be a side effect of other symptoms, such as aches and pains or fever. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, back pain intensity can range ""from a dull, constant ache to a sudden, sharp or shooting pain.""  Those recovering from illness may report this pain due to a decrease in movement over the past few days or due to the usual aches and pains of their sickness. 84 survey respondents claimed mid-back pain or pain at the base of their ribs after COVID-19. It's usually treated with muscle relaxants, gentle stretching, heat, or ice. After potentially experiencing a fever while fighting off COVID-19, sufferers may be surprised by the strange long-lasting symptom of a low body temperature once they've recovered. According to , a low body temperature may occur with an infection or may be a sign of diabetes or a low thyroid level. A low temperature may also be the culprit for chills, since the body attempts to warm up with narrowed blood vessels. Your veins circulate the blood around your body and when you're too cold or hot, your blood vessels may constrict or widen. This may be due to having a fever, then low body temperature, or it may be a sign of dehydration. According to the , these bulging veins may be due to inactivity or damaged blood valves. Arthralgia (joint pain) is a common symptom of coronavirus and a published in the found that at least one patient in the 40 that were studied experienced joint pain. This joint ailment may linger in those who had the virus, causing hand or wrist pain to remain. defines costochondritis as ""inflammation of the cartilage that connects a rib to the breastbone (sternum)."" that the risk for developing a chest wall infection like costochondritis is increased with respiratory trauma, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. Since COVID-19 is a respiratory illness, it's not surprising that 98 survey respondents who had the virus claimed costochondritis as a lingering symptom.  Simple Ways to Avoid a Heart Attack, According to Doctors , a spike in blood pressure could be caused by a number of factors, such as stress, thyroid problems, or certain medications. A study published by the American College of Cardiology found a potential link between the virus and the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, which is a ""critical neurohormonal pathway that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance."" This may explain the changes in blood pressure these patients experienced after coronavirus.  , acute kidney damage occurs in about 15% of COVID-19 patients, some of which never had kidney problems before. The survey found that 115 respondents have kidney pain after coronavirus, which may be a sign that the virus has caused kidney damage. The long-term extreme effects of COVID-19 still remain a mystery, but the survey found that 119 people who had the virus suffered from brain pressure. A published in the Journal of the Brazilian Society of Tropical Medicine found a potential link between COVID-19 and benign intracranial hypertension, a condition that causes pressure in the brain. These symptoms are usually temporary but can be serious if they get worse and are left untreated. 7 Tips You Must Follow to Avoid COVID, Say Doctors , swollen lymph nodes are usually a sign that your body is fighting an infection. Your glands are working hard to flush out toxins and cells through lymph fluid. When your body fights a virus like COVID-19, lymph nodes may swell as all hands are on deck trying to get rid of the illness.  Extreme Pressure at Base of Head or Occipital Nerve One of the common symptoms of COVID-19 is a headache but 128 survey participants reported feeling extreme pressure at the base of their head or occipital nerve after recovering from the virus. According to the , pressure at the occipital nerve (the nerves that run through the scalp) may be caused by muscle tightness or pinched nerves. These nerves may experience pressure or pain during an infection or due to blood vessel inflammation.  , the virus may be associated with a number of different skin rashes. The study found two different types of rashes that occurred in some patients infected with the coronavirus: petechial flexural eruption and digitate papulosquamous rashes. These skin conditions could occur at any time during and after infection and may contribute to the feeling of burning skin. Body, joint, and bone aches are common with coronavirus and most other illnesses. According to , when the immune system is in overdrive, it causes an immune response that ramps up your white blood cells and causes them to produce glycoproteins called interleukins. These can cause joint pain, bone pain, and swelling. , this condition is called phantosmia or olfactory hallucinations and they're commonly caused by upper respiratory infections like the virus. These feelings of hot blood rushing may be due to blood vessel irregularities caused by the virus or remnants of a fever. According to , this sudden rise in temperature may be your immune system cranking up in an attempt to continue killing off the virus. The study found that ""elevated body temperature helps certain types of immune cells to work better."" Chills without a fever was a long-lasting COVID-19 symptom for 154 survey participants. It could be the body's way of continuing to regulate temperature and recover from a previous fever. According to , chills without a fever may also indicate your body is under stress and fighting a viral or bacterial infection or you're dealing with low blood sugar, which makes sense if you didn't eat much while you were sick. , your neck doesn't have much protection or support so neck pain is common. Since the virus is known to cause muscle and joint pain, as well as body aches, your sensitive neck is more susceptible to this lingering symptom.  , tongue pain and soreness can be caused by a number of factors, such as infection, hypothyroidism, or a tumor in the pituitary gland. A study published in the found that oral mucosal lesions may be associated with COVID-19 patients, which could explain this long-lasting virus symptom. , one of the most common symptoms of COVID-19 is a fever. The body may need time after a fever has dissipated to recover and regulate its temperature. This may be why 165 survey respondents claim to have heat intolerance after being infected with COVID-19. As the immune system fights off the virus, it raises and lowers the body's temperature accordingly, which may cause this heat intolerance to linger. Those who contracted COVID-19 and experienced ""COVID toes"" or other skin-related symptoms may also be dealing with swollen hands and feet. According to the , this swelling is called edema and it could be linked to kidney or heart problems, both of which may be caused by coronavirus. Dry skin may be attributed to the rashes and cutaneous manifestations that some people develop on their skin due to the virus. However, according to the , dry skin may also be attributed to a decline in fluid intake, which can happen when you're sick. It may also be a telling sign of a thyroid problem or hormonal imbalance. , ""High blood pressure is not a documented symptom of COVID-19, but it can exacerbate the symptoms of the virus."" The 181 survey respondents who report experiencing high blood pressure after having COVID-19 likely already suffered from this condition but fighting the virus may have made it worse. , COVID-19 symptoms generally include a dry cough and sore throat. Living with a dry cough and sore throat throughout the course of the virus may cause this dry throat to remain for a while, even after testing negative for COVID-19. Post-nasal drip is when mucus drips down the back of your throat and it's common after you've had a stuffy or runny nose. After dealing with allergy or sinus issues or infections, post-nasal drip can linger for a while. If one's body produced extra mucous and fluids in an attempt to fight off the virus, this mucus may continue to drip. According to , you can treat post-nasal drip by staying hydrated, taking a nasal decongestant, or inhaling steam, such as from a hot shower. COVID-19 survivors who had severe cases are likely to experience extreme weight loss. According to an article posted by , it's common for patients who survive severe infections or illnesses to lose weight. When sufferers are placed on ventilators or hospitalized for long periods of time, their bodies don't obtain the proper nutrition or muscle-building exercise. The body is also under stress fighting off the virus, which can cause this weight loss to occur. , it's not uncommon for patients recovering from COVID-19 to feel irritable or angry. The virus may have mental health effects that make it hard for those who have recovered to go back to work or their daily routine without mood swings. Patients who were hospitalized may experience irritation and symptoms similar to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after being released. Unhealthiest Habits on the Planet, According to Doctors , muscle twitches may be caused by stress, lack of nutrients, or lack of sleep. Coronavirus is known to make its sufferers tired and their bodies stressed from fighting the virus, so this may explain muscle twitching. In some cases, it may be a sign of muscle damage or nervous system disorders. Mild confusion or ""brain fog"" is a common symptom of coronavirus and most colds, flues, and viruses. According to an , this confusion may occur because the body's systems are focused on fighting the illness, not giving enough focus, blood, or alertness to the brain. , persistent pressure or pain in the chest is a symptom of COVID-19 and 210 survey participants claim to continue feeling this symptom after the virus is gone. As a respiratory virus, it's possible that this pain or pressure is actually being felt in the lungs. However, according to , stroke, heart failure, arrhythmias, and other cardiac events have also been linked to coronavirus so sufferers should take this lingering symptom seriously. A loss of sense of taste is a common symptom of COVID-19 but 221 survey respondents claim the virus may have completely changed their sense of taste.  According to a loss of sense of taste or partial loss may cause tastes to change. These changes may also be caused by a decrease in taste buds or changes in the way the nervous system processes certain taste sensations. Tinnitus is a ringing or noise in the ear and 233 survey respondents claim they now experience this ringing or humming in the ears after recovering from COVID-19. According to the , the onset of tinnitus may occur due to stress and anxiety, after there's been damage to the inner ear, or when other conditions or diseases are developed. , ""Viral infections have detrimental impacts on neurological functions, and even cause severe neurological damage."" 243 survey participants reported feeling nerve sensations after COVID-19, which may be due to neurological damage caused by the virus.  When you contract an illness or a virus like coronavirus, your body's working overtime to fight it. According to , your body needs more fluids when you're sick and if it doesn't get the fluids, you're likely to suffer from constant thirst. It's your body's way of telling you it's not getting enough fluids to continue fighting and recovering from the virus. In some COVID-19 cases, patients have developed rashes on their skin. According to a , some coronavirus patients suffered from enanthem, a skin rash that looks like small white spots on the mucous membranes.  Other patients had widespread urticaria, or hives, on their skin. Other rashes were also found in some COVID-19 patients who were studied. Scientists aren't sure if this side effect is directly related to the virus or attributed to certain medications. , ""floaters"" are little specks or lines that float around in your field of vision every once in a while. If you constantly see floaters or they're accompanied by flashes of light, it may indicate you have a retina tear or vitreous detachment, which occurs when vitreous gel in the eye separates from the retina. In the survey, 249 respondents claimed to suffer from floaters or flashes of light in their vision after COVID-19. As with most illnesses, coronavirus is associated with muscle aches and pains. Patients with COVID-19 who were bedridden or spent an extended period of time inactive may experience upper back pain due to immobility. According to , upper back pain isn't as common as lower back pain but may be caused by muscle strain, poor posture, or pressure on the spinal nerves. Fatigue is a common symptom of coronavirus but some sufferers are having trouble shaking off that tiredness. According to an , it's possible that COVID-19 may lead to chronic illness, including chronic fatigue. Scientists are tracking these symptoms amongst sufferers who seek treatment so they can get a grasp on what other symptoms may lead to chronic illness. , tremors may be caused by stress, anxiety, or too much caffeine. Tremors or shakes when you pick up a glass of water or hold a piece of paper may also indicate that you have essential tremor (ET), which is a neurological disorder that causes these shakes. These tremors may occur because the body is recovering from the stress of the virus, they may indicate ET, or there may be another underlying cause. , muscle cramps usually occur after heavy exercise, when you're experiencing muscle fatigue, or if your body's dehydrated. Since the virus and other illnesses are notorious for dehydrating your body and causing muscle fatigue, these calf cramps may be an explainable symptom of coronavirus. Massaging, stretching, and warm compresses could help mitigate these cramps. reviewed the relationship between ocular symptoms and coronavirus in Chinese patients. It found that 27% of those studied complained of itchy, dry, and red eyes. Some even began to develop sore and dry eyes a few days before any other COVID-19 symptoms. Researchers feel this may be because coronavirus ""infects the mucosa membrane epithelium and even lymphocytes, which are both abundant in ocular surface tissue."" , when your ears are clogged ""your eustachian tubes — which run between your middle ear and the back of your nose — become obstructed."" It may cause pressure, ear pain, muffled hearing, or dizziness. The survey found that 267 participants experienced clogged ears as a long-lasting symptom of COVID-19. Since clogged ears are common with a stuffy nose and other respiratory illnesses or sinus infections, it's a common symptom of coronavirus. To relieve pressure, you can try popping your ears or taking a nasal decongestant. While weight gain isn't a symptom of the virus, stress from getting sick, lockdown and quarantine may be to blame for the extra pounds. A study published in the analyzed italian citizens placed on strict lockdown and observed their lifestyle and eating habit changes. It found that 48.6% of the population studied gained weight. While the virus itself may not be to blame for this side effect, the stress and anxiety of lifestyle changes could be. While it's not usually listed as a common symptom of COVID-19, many who got the virus also suffered from nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or other gastrointestinal problems. The survey found that 314 respondents claimed they still suffered from nausea or vomiting after coronavirus. According to , these gastrointestinal symptoms were varied and some felt them well before a diagnosis. Others only dealt with these symptoms for one day. Shortness of Breath or Exhaustion From Bending Over Shortness of breath is a common symptom of COVID-19 but 318 survey participants reported that they continued to feel shortness of breath or exhaustion when they bent over. According to , this may be a sign of an ongoing pulmonary problem or heart problem. While shortness of breath is common with COVID-19 sufferers, those who have recovered should seek medical attention if this symptom doesn't seem to be going away. COVID-19 causes myalgia, pain in a muscle or a group of muscles. An article published in concludes that myalgia in COVID-19 patients lingers longer than it may with other illnesses. Lower back pain is usually associated with pneumonia or poor lung function and since COVID-19 is a respiratory virus, it makes sense that patients are more likely to experience this type of muscle pain. While not a common symptom of COVID-19, many who contracted the virus did report gastrointestinal problems. This could explain why 344 survey respondents reported dealing with abdominal pain well after contracting the virus. In a study published through the American Gastrological Association, 31.9% of COVID-19 patients studied claimed to have gastrointestinal problems associated with the virus.  While a dry cough is most commonly associated with coronavirus, some patients may experience phlegm in the back of their throat during the later stages. For coronavirus patients dealing with phlegm, the suggests taking an expectorant to help get the mucus out and make your cough more productive. Staying hydrated and drinking warm beverages may also help to break up the phlegm.  Loss of taste, called ageusia, and loss of smell, called anosmia, are common symptoms of the virus and the duration of these symptoms  varies by patient. A study published in the analyzed Korean COVID-19 sufferers and the duration of this specific symptom. The study found that, ""Most patients with anosmia or ageusia recovered within 3 weeks."" As COVID-19 takes its course, patients may report symptoms that change frequently. For example, a patient may begin experiencing a headache and fever, then move onto shortness of breath and muscle aches. According to , ""U.S. COVID-19 patients report a wide range of symptoms across a spectrum of illness severity."" ""Heartburn occurs when stomach acid backs up into the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach (esophagus),"" according to . Since the virus is known to cause gastrointestinal problems, some patients may take longer to recover from these inconsistencies than others. Avoiding alcohol, spicy foods, and large meals may help curb these long-lasting symptoms. Neuropathy is weakness or numbness due to nerve damage. Since the virus can do some damage to the nervous system, this may be a lingering symptom for some sufferers. According to a report published in the Elsevier Public Health Emergency Collection, COVID-19 may even disguise itself as motor peripheral neuropathy without other symptoms. Nerve fibers may be more sensitive when a patient is infected with the virus, causing this numbing of the hands and feet. As a pandemic, COVID-19 sufferers are required to quarantine, which may mean isolating from loved ones and not being able to engage in activities they enjoy. A analyzed mental side effects of the virus and concluded that medical professionals should watch their patients for signs of depression or some neuropsychiatric syndromes well after recovery. , the CDC recently added ""runny nose"" as a symptom of COVID-19. 414 survey respondents claimed a congested or runny nose as a lingering symptom of the virus. A runny nose is one way to get rid of the mucus in your body after the virus, so it may persist until the mucus is gone. Blurry vision may be a sign of nerve damage or may also occur when other COVID-19 symptoms are going strong, such as a fever or headache. According to the , blurred vision may also be a symptom of endophthalmitis, which is an infection of tissue or fluids inside the eye. If this is the case, quick treatment is required to prevent blindness. Dr. Shilpi Khetarpal, MD from the Cleveland Clinic, hair loss isn't necessarily a symptom of COVID-19 but may be a side effect of the virus. She states, ""We are seeing patients who had COVID-19 two to three months ago and are now experiencing hair loss."" In the survey, 423 respondents reported experiencing hair loss after coronavirus. Dr. Khetarpal says this may be due to a change in diet, high fever, extreme weight loss, or any other ""shock to the system"" that COVID-19 may have caused. on coronavirus patients and found that 96% of patients recovered from chills and 97% recovered from fever. While most recovered from all COVID-19 symptoms, 34% still revealed that they were suffering from one or more lasting symptoms when interviewed four to eight days after testing positive. 65% of sufferers returned to their usual state of health around seven days after testing positive but chronic medical conditions, age, weight, gender, and other factors may affect how long symptoms, such as fever and chills, last. , tachycardia occurs when your heart beats over 100 beats per minute. It's a form of arrhythmia, or a heartbeat disorder. In the survey, 448 respondents experienced tachycardia after suffering from COVID-19. It may be the body's response to stress, trauma, or illness. However, if tachycardia is left untreated and continues to occur, it can lead to serious complications, such as heart failure or stroke. Partial or complete loss of sense of smell is a common symptom with COVID-19 and many other respiratory viruses, according to . Since your olfactory system is so close to your respiratory system, virus cells can enter into nerve and receptor cells and cause damage. It can take a long time for these cells to repair and some cells may never fully recover from the virus. , night sweats are different from regular sweating because they occur only at night and include intense sweating, enough to soak through your clothes and sheets. It's possible that night sweats are present due to a residual fever but they may also be caused by thyroid level issues, menopause, anxiety, or infections. New medication or other lingering symptoms, such as chills and muscle aches, may also contribute to long-lasting night sweats. While not all coronavirus sufferers experience a sore throat, it's one of the common symptoms the CDC lists for the virus. According to, viruses and infections cause sore throats, which may be why this is a lingering symptom for some coronavirus patients. While it's not the most common, diarrhea is listed by the CDC as a symptom of COVID-19. A analyzed 206 patients with low severity COVID-19 and 48 experienced digestive problems first before other coronavirus symptoms. Diarrhea lasted an average of 14 days for COVID-19 patients in the study. Even after the fever, headache, and dry cough have disappeared, some patients who have ""recovered"" from COVID-19 may experience heart palpitations. A examined 100 recovered COVID-19 patients and found that 78 of them had ""cardiac involvement"" while 60% had ongoing myocardial inflammation. Ongoing heart issues, such as palpitations, may be long-lasting for COVID-19 patients, regardless of their illness severity.  explains that as your immune system attempts to fight off COVID-19 or any type of illness, white blood cells produce interleukins to help join the fight. While these interleukins are useful in fighting off the virus cells, they also cause muscle and joint pain. The immune response may still be heightened in these recovering patients, causing this joint pain to last. A lingering cough can be a side effect of any type of cold, flu, or illness. According to a study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Chinese COVID-19 patients, 61.7% developed a dry cough. As a respiratory virus, the cough associated with COVID-19 may take a long time to go away because your body is attempting to get rid of lingering mucus and phlegm.  What Taking a Multivitamin Every Day Does To Your Body Chest pain or pressure was a common lingering COVID-19 symptom among survey participants. Since coronavirus affects the lungs and respiratory system, this chest pain may be attributed to the virus still settling in the body. According to , sudden, sharp chest pains are referred to as pleurisy and it may indicate that the lung walls are inflamed. Pleurisy may be a sign of pneumonia or another type of infection, so recovered COVID-19 patients should see a doctor if this symptom persists. COVID-19 is a respiratory virus that also has nervous system side effects. According to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians Open, ""symptoms including headache, dizziness, vertigo, and paresthesia have been reported."" This may be due to decreased oxygen levels, dehydration, fevers, or headaches also caused by the virus. paper published in the analyzes potential long-term neurological effects of COVID-19 on patients who experienced severe cases. Memory problems and cognitive decline are potential side effects for some of these patients.  Since the virus affects the nervous system, memory problems may be a lingering side effect for some patients, especially those who suffered severe cases. poll conducted by the American Psychiatric Association, about 36% of Americans feel coronavirus has had a serious impact on their mental health. Between quarantining, social isolation, and worry about developing a severe case of coronavirus, it's no wonder anxiety is a lingering symptom for COVID-19 patients. Sleep is crucial because it keeps the immune system functioning properly, heightens brain function, stabilizes mood, and improves mental health. 782 survey respondents claimed they were having difficulty sleeping, even after recovering from COVID-19. This lack of sleep may be due to anxiety or worry about the virus or may be attributed to other lingering symptoms, such as muscle pain or cough. Setting specific bedtimes and only using your bed for sleep may help with these difficulties. Dr. Sandhya Mehla with the Hartford HealthCare Headache Center, ""It is estimated that headache is a symptom of COVID-19 in about 13% of patients with COVID-19. It is the fifth most common COVID-19 symptom after fever, cough, muscle aches, and trouble breathing."" In the survey, 902 participants claimed that a headache was a long-lasting symptom after COVID-19. This may be due to dehydration, congestion, or other symptoms of coronavirus, such as a fever. After recovering from COVID-19, some patients find it hard to exercise or be active, even if they were fit before contracting the virus. 916 survey participants reported that they were still unable to exercise after recovering from coronavirus. According to a , researchers recommend that patients who suffered from severe cases of COVID-19 wait at least two weeks before resuming light exercise. This allows time for doctors to see if heart or lung conditions develop that could make it dangerous to engage in physical activity.  The long-term effects of COVID-19 are unknown since the virus is so new but researchers are seeing certain neurological effects on patients who have recovered. analyzed these neurological conditions and found that 40% of the patients analyzed experienced confusion and conscious disturbance. This is commonly referred to as ""brain fog"" and many patients express feeling this way while recovering from coronavirus.  , shortness of breath is when you feel like you can't get enough air or your chest is tight. Most people feel this way after exercising or if they're experiencing a panic attack. However, patients with COVID-19 may feel shortness of breath without even moving since it's a common symptom of the virus. In the survey, 924 COVID-19 patients claimed that shortness of breath or difficulty breathing was a long-lasting coronavirus symptom.  Body aches are a common symptom of many illnesses, including coronavirus. In this survey, 1,048 participants reported feeling these body aches after their COVID-19 diagnosis. According to , ""Your body aches when you have the flu because your immune system is revving up to fight infection."" It's not necessarily the virus that causes these aches but your body's own reaction to the virus invasion.  Fatigue was the most common lingering symptom of coronavirus. According to , the average recovery time for mild coronavirus cases is around two weeks but three to six weeks for severe or critical cases. Lingering fatigue may be a sign that your body is still fighting the virus or is recovering from the fight. If you experience any of these conditions, it may or may not be COVID-19—contact a medical professional immediately. Stay healthy and keep others healthy, too: Wear your get tested if you think you have coronavirus, avoid crowds (and bars, and house parties), practice social distancing, only run essential errands, wash your hands regularly, disinfect frequently touched surfaces, and to get through this pandemic at your healthiest, don't miss these .

FACT CHECKED BY Ever since reared its ugly head and upended our world, long-lasting symptoms of the virus have been varied and hard to pinpoint—until now. ""A survey conducted by Dr. Natalie Lambert of Indiana University School of Medicine and Survivor Corps analyzed the long-term experiences COVID-19 survivors are having with the virus. The COVID-19 'Long Hauler' Symptoms Survey identified 98 long-lasting symptoms."" Click through from least common to most common to see if you've experienced any. Read on, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these . Syncope is when you faint or pass out, usually due to a temporary drop in blood flow to the brain, reports the finds syncope may be the presenting symptom of a COVID-19 infection, even in those who are asymptomatic. ""Recognizing this possibility is of extreme importance, especially in the initial phase of COVID-19 infection,"" warn the researchers. When lymph nodes throb or swell, it's a sign of trauma around the neck area, an infection, or a bacterial illness related to a cold or sore throat, reports . COVID-19 is generally known as a respiratory virus that can also affect your throat and sinuses.  Your thyroid is an essential element to your body's proper functionality. According to , it ""plays a major role in the metabolism, growth and development of the human body."" It does this by releasing the perfect amount of thyroid hormones at the perfect times. Some COVID-19 sufferers report having elevated thyroid levels as a long-lasting symptom of the virus. Anemia is ""a condition in which you lack enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your body's tissues,"" says the . The most common type of anemia is associated with not getting enough iron. The condition makes you feel tired and weak. In some cases, it may even cause chest pain and dizziness, which are common long-lasting symptoms of coronavirus.  The symptoms of herpes, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and trigeminal neuralgia are varied and may include fatigue, inflamed throat, fever, and facial pain. These are also common symptoms of COVID-19 and 38 sufferers who participated in the survey reported experiencing symptoms of these conditions after the virus was gone. GERD is acid reflux and it's commonly known to cause excessive salivation, or drooling. According to , trauma or infections in the throat, such as sinus infections or swollen adenoids, can cause GERD, which may lead to drooling.  Scientists are studying the rare but potentially severe personality changes that COVID-19 may cause in patients. According to an article published in , symptoms related to the brain are often overlooked as medical professionals focus on the physical aspects of the virus.  However, depression, personality changes, and confusion are some long-lasting symptoms that some COVID-19 sufferers may experience. Thrush is small, white lesions inside your mouth caused by an imbalance of bacterial growth, more specifically an overgrowth of Candida, according to . Some people are more prone to developing thrush but it may also be common with COVID-19 survivors. Since the virus affects your respiratory system and throat, imbalances in the mouth and tongue may also occur.  Your hormones are important because they regulate your appetite, mood, sexual function, and body temperature. According to , a hormone imbalance may be caused by stress, an unhealthy lifestyle, or a buildup of toxins in the body.  COVID-19 sufferers may experience this imbalance as the virus wreaks havoc on their respiratory system and as their immune system works hard to fight it off.  A urinary tract infection occurs when germs get into the urethra and begin to spread throughout the urinary tract, says to ""found a potentially dangerous overlap of classical urinary symptoms and the as yet not fully described symptoms of COVID-19."" Urinary frequency and the virus may be related, which explains its potential cause of UTIs in patients. Kidney issues, including protein in the urine, was a long-lasting symptom of COVID-19 for 47 survey participants. The specific ways the virus affects kidneys isn't known yet, but according to , it may invade kidney cells or the low levels of oxygen the virus causes may be what contribute to these long-lasting kidney problems. While it's not a serious issue, dry scalp and dandruff can be uncomfortable and embarrassing. According to , dandruff can be caused by changes in hormones, so it makes sense that it's related to the virus.  There are many causes of low blood pressure, such as genetics, your diet, or dehydration. According to the , low blood pressure is also related to infections and hormone fluctuations, which is why it may be a long-lasting symptom of COVID-19.  ""COVID toes"" are an emerging symptom of the virus that may not be as common as the other symptoms, such as cough or fever. COVID toes occur when the toes develop a rash or lesions. According to , from the Cleveland Clinic, rashes on the skin are common with viral infections such as COVID-19. The survey found that 59 participants had this strange side effect after being infected with coronavirus.  , it's possible that coronavirus could cause an eye infection, such as conjunctivitis, also known as pinkeye. The concludes that styes are caused by bacterial infections, which could explain the relationship to this eye condition and the virus.  Foot pain can be caused by a number of ailments, such as corns, plantar fasciitis, or achilles tendon injuries. """" may contribute to this pain since some patients can have trouble walking or sleeping due to lesions on their toes. In most cases, this strange symptom goes away so the foot pain should also subside. A goiter is an ""abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland,"" according to the . While a goiter doesn't necessarily mean the thyroid isn't functioning correctly, it does indicate that there's a potential hormonal imbalance causing the thyroid gland to grow abnormally. 70 survey respondents dealt with a goiter after COVID-19, possibly due to the hormonal effects the virus has on the body. Cracked or dry lips can occur in especially cold or hot weather or may be a sign of dehydration. When a virus like COVID-19 takes hold, dry lips may also occur because viruses are likely to cause dehydration. The suggests using lip balm, drinking plenty of fluids, and refraining from picking at the dry skin to get this symptom to go away. COVID-19 is a respiratory virus so it's no wonder those who contracted the illness feel a cold or burning sensation in their lungs. However, this symptom may last longer than the virus since 74 survey participants reported this feeling after coronavirus was gone. An concludes that many COVID-19 sufferers felt this ""slow burn"" for a while, until it either worsened and was treated or went away completely. COVID Symptoms Usually Appear in This Order, Study Finds , bluish lips or face is an emergency of COVID-19. When your lips turn blue, it's a sign your blood oxygen has dipped to extreme levels. The survey found that 77 participants claimed they experienced low blood oxygen after contracting coronavirus. One reason for this is that lung capacity may not have fully recovered from the respiratory virus. defines arrhythmia as a heart rhythm problem and explains it happens when ""electrical impulses that coordinate your heartbeats don't work properly, causing your heart to beat too fast, too slow or irregularly."" A studied hospitalized coronavirus patients and found some of them suffered bradyarrhythmias or cardiac arrests. The study concluded heart traumas and abnormalities like these are ""likely the consequence of systemic illness and not solely the direct effects of COVID-19 infection."" In the survey, 80 participants reported jaw pain as a long-lasting symptom of COVID-19. According to the , jaw pain may be caused by bone problems, stress, infection, sinus issues, or tooth grinding. It's known that coronavirus causes aches and pains, so this jaw pain may be a lingering side effect of the body fighting off the virus. For COVID-19 sufferers, a painful scalp may be a side effect of the dandruff the virus may cause or aches and pains associated with the illness. According to , scalp pain or ailments may occur after recovering from a high fever, when dealing with a thyroid issue, or if you have poor nutrition. , a ""tingling, burning, or 'fizzing' sensation"" was reported from several COVID-19 patients. This sensation may be a side effect of other symptoms, such as aches and pains or fever. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, back pain intensity can range ""from a dull, constant ache to a sudden, sharp or shooting pain.""  Those recovering from illness may report this pain due to a decrease in movement over the past few days or due to the usual aches and pains of their sickness. 84 survey respondents claimed mid-back pain or pain at the base of their ribs after COVID-19. It's usually treated with muscle relaxants, gentle stretching, heat, or ice. After potentially experiencing a fever while fighting off COVID-19, sufferers may be surprised by the strange long-lasting symptom of a low body temperature once they've recovered. According to , a low body temperature may occur with an infection or may be a sign of diabetes or a low thyroid level. A low temperature may also be the culprit for chills, since the body attempts to warm up with narrowed blood vessels. Your veins circulate the blood around your body and when you're too cold or hot, your blood vessels may constrict or widen. This may be due to having a fever, then low body temperature, or it may be a sign of dehydration. According to the , these bulging veins may be due to inactivity or damaged blood valves. Arthralgia (joint pain) is a common symptom of coronavirus and a published in the found that at least one patient in the 40 that were studied experienced joint pain. This joint ailment may linger in those who had the virus, causing hand or wrist pain to remain. defines costochondritis as ""inflammation of the cartilage that connects a rib to the breastbone (sternum)."" that the risk for developing a chest wall infection like costochondritis is increased with respiratory trauma, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. Since COVID-19 is a respiratory illness, it's not surprising that 98 survey respondents who had the virus claimed costochondritis as a lingering symptom.  Simple Ways to Avoid a Heart Attack, According to Doctors , a spike in blood pressure could be caused by a number of factors, such as stress, thyroid problems, or certain medications. A study published by the American College of Cardiology found a potential link between the virus and the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, which is a ""critical neurohormonal pathway that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance."" This may explain the changes in blood pressure these patients experienced after coronavirus.  , acute kidney damage occurs in about 15% of COVID-19 patients, some of which never had kidney problems before. The survey found that 115 respondents have kidney pain after coronavirus, which may be a sign that the virus has caused kidney damage. The long-term extreme effects of COVID-19 still remain a mystery, but the survey found that 119 people who had the virus suffered from brain pressure. A published in the Journal of the Brazilian Society of Tropical Medicine found a potential link between COVID-19 and benign intracranial hypertension, a condition that causes pressure in the brain. These symptoms are usually temporary but can be serious if they get worse and are left untreated. 7 Tips You Must Follow to Avoid COVID, Say Doctors , swollen lymph nodes are usually a sign that your body is fighting an infection. Your glands are working hard to flush out toxins and cells through lymph fluid. When your body fights a virus like COVID-19, lymph nodes may swell as all hands are on deck trying to get rid of the illness.  Extreme Pressure at Base of Head or Occipital Nerve One of the common symptoms of COVID-19 is a headache but 128 survey participants reported feeling extreme pressure at the base of their head or occipital nerve after recovering from the virus. According to the , pressure at the occipital nerve (the nerves that run through the scalp) may be caused by muscle tightness or pinched nerves. These nerves may experience pressure or pain during an infection or due to blood vessel inflammation.  , the virus may be associated with a number of different skin rashes. The study found two different types of rashes that occurred in some patients infected with the coronavirus: petechial flexural eruption and digitate papulosquamous rashes. These skin conditions could occur at any time during and after infection and may contribute to the feeling of burning skin. Body, joint, and bone aches are common with coronavirus and most other illnesses. According to , when the immune system is in overdrive, it causes an immune response that ramps up your white blood cells and causes them to produce glycoproteins called interleukins. These can cause joint pain, bone pain, and swelling. , this condition is called phantosmia or olfactory hallucinations and they're commonly caused by upper respiratory infections like the virus. These feelings of hot blood rushing may be due to blood vessel irregularities caused by the virus or remnants of a fever. According to , this sudden rise in temperature may be your immune system cranking up in an attempt to continue killing off the virus. The study found that ""elevated body temperature helps certain types of immune cells to work better."" Chills without a fever was a long-lasting COVID-19 symptom for 154 survey participants. It could be the body's way of continuing to regulate temperature and recover from a previous fever. According to , chills without a fever may also indicate your body is under stress and fighting a viral or bacterial infection or you're dealing with low blood sugar, which makes sense if you didn't eat much while you were sick. , your neck doesn't have much protection or support so neck pain is common. Since the virus is known to cause muscle and joint pain, as well as body aches, your sensitive neck is more susceptible to this lingering symptom.  , tongue pain and soreness can be caused by a number of factors, such as infection, hypothyroidism, or a tumor in the pituitary gland. A study published in the found that oral mucosal lesions may be associated with COVID-19 patients, which could explain this long-lasting virus symptom. , one of the most common symptoms of COVID-19 is a fever. The body may need time after a fever has dissipated to recover and regulate its temperature. This may be why 165 survey respondents claim to have heat intolerance after being infected with COVID-19. As the immune system fights off the virus, it raises and lowers the body's temperature accordingly, which may cause this heat intolerance to linger. Those who contracted COVID-19 and experienced ""COVID toes"" or other skin-related symptoms may also be dealing with swollen hands and feet. According to the , this swelling is called edema and it could be linked to kidney or heart problems, both of which may be caused by coronavirus. Dry skin may be attributed to the rashes and cutaneous manifestations that some people develop on their skin due to the virus. However, according to the , dry skin may also be attributed to a decline in fluid intake, which can happen when you're sick. It may also be a telling sign of a thyroid problem or hormonal imbalance. , ""High blood pressure is not a documented symptom of COVID-19, but it can exacerbate the symptoms of the virus."" The 181 survey respondents who report experiencing high blood pressure after having COVID-19 likely already suffered from this condition but fighting the virus may have made it worse. , COVID-19 symptoms generally include a dry cough and sore throat. Living with a dry cough and sore throat throughout the course of the virus may cause this dry throat to remain for a while, even after testing negative for COVID-19. Post-nasal drip is when mucus drips down the back of your throat and it's common after you've had a stuffy or runny nose. After dealing with allergy or sinus issues or infections, post-nasal drip can linger for a while. If one's body produced extra mucous and fluids in an attempt to fight off the virus, this mucus may continue to drip. According to , you can treat post-nasal drip by staying hydrated, taking a nasal decongestant, or inhaling steam, such as from a hot shower. COVID-19 survivors who had severe cases are likely to experience extreme weight loss. According to an article posted by , it's common for patients who survive severe infections or illnesses to lose weight. When sufferers are placed on ventilators or hospitalized for long periods of time, their bodies don't obtain the proper nutrition or muscle-building exercise. The body is also under stress fighting off the virus, which can cause this weight loss to occur. , it's not uncommon for patients recovering from COVID-19 to feel irritable or angry. The virus may have mental health effects that make it hard for those who have recovered to go back to work or their daily routine without mood swings. Patients who were hospitalized may experience irritation and symptoms similar to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after being released. Unhealthiest Habits on the Planet, According to Doctors , muscle twitches may be caused by stress, lack of nutrients, or lack of sleep. Coronavirus is known to make its sufferers tired and their bodies stressed from fighting the virus, so this may explain muscle twitching. In some cases, it may be a sign of muscle damage or nervous system disorders. Mild confusion or ""brain fog"" is a common symptom of coronavirus and most colds, flues, and viruses. According to an , this confusion may occur because the body's systems are focused on fighting the illness, not giving enough focus, blood, or alertness to the brain. , persistent pressure or pain in the chest is a symptom of COVID-19 and 210 survey participants claim to continue feeling this symptom after the virus is gone. As a respiratory virus, it's possible that this pain or pressure is actually being felt in the lungs. However, according to , stroke, heart failure, arrhythmias, and other cardiac events have also been linked to coronavirus so sufferers should take this lingering symptom seriously. A loss of sense of taste is a common symptom of COVID-19 but 221 survey respondents claim the virus may have completely changed their sense of taste.  According to a loss of sense of taste or partial loss may cause tastes to change. These changes may also be caused by a decrease in taste buds or changes in the way the nervous system processes certain taste sensations. Tinnitus is a ringing or noise in the ear and 233 survey respondents claim they now experience this ringing or humming in the ears after recovering from COVID-19. According to the , the onset of tinnitus may occur due to stress and anxiety, after there's been damage to the inner ear, or when other conditions or diseases are developed. , ""Viral infections have detrimental impacts on neurological functions, and even cause severe neurological damage."" 243 survey participants reported feeling nerve sensations after COVID-19, which may be due to neurological damage caused by the virus.  When you contract an illness or a virus like coronavirus, your body's working overtime to fight it. According to , your body needs more fluids when you're sick and if it doesn't get the fluids, you're likely to suffer from constant thirst. It's your body's way of telling you it's not getting enough fluids to continue fighting and recovering from the virus. In some COVID-19 cases, patients have developed rashes on their skin. According to a , some coronavirus patients suffered from enanthem, a skin rash that looks like small white spots on the mucous membranes.  Other patients had widespread urticaria, or hives, on their skin. Other rashes were also found in some COVID-19 patients who were studied. Scientists aren't sure if this side effect is directly related to the virus or attributed to certain medications. , ""floaters"" are little specks or lines that float around in your field of vision every once in a while. If you constantly see floaters or they're accompanied by flashes of light, it may indicate you have a retina tear or vitreous detachment, which occurs when vitreous gel in the eye separates from the retina. In the survey, 249 respondents claimed to suffer from floaters or flashes of light in their vision after COVID-19. As with most illnesses, coronavirus is associated with muscle aches and pains. Patients with COVID-19 who were bedridden or spent an extended period of time inactive may experience upper back pain due to immobility. According to , upper back pain isn't as common as lower back pain but may be caused by muscle strain, poor posture, or pressure on the spinal nerves. Fatigue is a common symptom of coronavirus but some sufferers are having trouble shaking off that tiredness. According to an , it's possible that COVID-19 may lead to chronic illness, including chronic fatigue. Scientists are tracking these symptoms amongst sufferers who seek treatment so they can get a grasp on what other symptoms may lead to chronic illness. , tremors may be caused by stress, anxiety, or too much caffeine. Tremors or shakes when you pick up a glass of water or hold a piece of paper may also indicate that you have essential tremor (ET), which is a neurological disorder that causes these shakes. These tremors may occur because the body is recovering from the stress of the virus, they may indicate ET, or there may be another underlying cause. , muscle cramps usually occur after heavy exercise, when you're experiencing muscle fatigue, or if your body's dehydrated. Since the virus and other illnesses are notorious for dehydrating your body and causing muscle fatigue, these calf cramps may be an explainable symptom of coronavirus. Massaging, stretching, and warm compresses could help mitigate these cramps. reviewed the relationship between ocular symptoms and coronavirus in Chinese patients. It found that 27% of those studied complained of itchy, dry, and red eyes. Some even began to develop sore and dry eyes a few days before any other COVID-19 symptoms. Researchers feel this may be because coronavirus ""infects the mucosa membrane epithelium and even lymphocytes, which are both abundant in ocular surface tissue."" , when your ears are clogged ""your eustachian tubes — which run between your middle ear and the back of your nose — become obstructed."" It may cause pressure, ear pain, muffled hearing, or dizziness. The survey found that 267 participants experienced clogged ears as a long-lasting symptom of COVID-19. Since clogged ears are common with a stuffy nose and other respiratory illnesses or sinus infections, it's a common symptom of coronavirus. To relieve pressure, you can try popping your ears or taking a nasal decongestant. While weight gain isn't a symptom of the virus, stress from getting sick, lockdown and quarantine may be to blame for the extra pounds. A study published in the analyzed italian citizens placed on strict lockdown and observed their lifestyle and eating habit changes. It found that 48.6% of the population studied gained weight. While the virus itself may not be to blame for this side effect, the stress and anxiety of lifestyle changes could be. While it's not usually listed as a common symptom of COVID-19, many who got the virus also suffered from nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or other gastrointestinal problems. The survey found that 314 respondents claimed they still suffered from nausea or vomiting after coronavirus. According to , these gastrointestinal symptoms were varied and some felt them well before a diagnosis. Others only dealt with these symptoms for one day. Shortness of Breath or Exhaustion From Bending Over Shortness of breath is a common symptom of COVID-19 but 318 survey participants reported that they continued to feel shortness of breath or exhaustion when they bent over. According to , this may be a sign of an ongoing pulmonary problem or heart problem. While shortness of breath is common with COVID-19 sufferers, those who have recovered should seek medical attention if this symptom doesn't seem to be going away. COVID-19 causes myalgia, pain in a muscle or a group of muscles. An article published in concludes that myalgia in COVID-19 patients lingers longer than it may with other illnesses. Lower back pain is usually associated with pneumonia or poor lung function and since COVID-19 is a respiratory virus, it makes sense that patients are more likely to experience this type of muscle pain. While not a common symptom of COVID-19, many who contracted the virus did report gastrointestinal problems. This could explain why 344 survey respondents reported dealing with abdominal pain well after contracting the virus. In a study published through the American Gastrological Association, 31.9% of COVID-19 patients studied claimed to have gastrointestinal problems associated with the virus.  While a dry cough is most commonly associated with coronavirus, some patients may experience phlegm in the back of their throat during the later stages. For coronavirus patients dealing with phlegm, the suggests taking an expectorant to help get the mucus out and make your cough more productive. Staying hydrated and drinking warm beverages may also help to break up the phlegm.  Loss of taste, called ageusia, and loss of smell, called anosmia, are common symptoms of the virus and the duration of these symptoms  varies by patient. A study published in the analyzed Korean COVID-19 sufferers and the duration of this specific symptom. The study found that, ""Most patients with anosmia or ageusia recovered within 3 weeks."" As COVID-19 takes its course, patients may report symptoms that change frequently. For example, a patient may begin experiencing a headache and fever, then move onto shortness of breath and muscle aches. According to , ""U.S. COVID-19 patients report a wide range of symptoms across a spectrum of illness severity."" ""Heartburn occurs when stomach acid backs up into the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach (esophagus),"" according to . Since the virus is known to cause gastrointestinal problems, some patients may take longer to recover from these inconsistencies than others. Avoiding alcohol, spicy foods, and large meals may help curb these long-lasting symptoms. Neuropathy is weakness or numbness due to nerve damage. Since the virus can do some damage to the nervous system, this may be a lingering symptom for some sufferers. According to a report published in the Elsevier Public Health Emergency Collection, COVID-19 may even disguise itself as motor peripheral neuropathy without other symptoms. Nerve fibers may be more sensitive when a patient is infected with the virus, causing this numbing of the hands and feet. As a pandemic, COVID-19 sufferers are required to quarantine, which may mean isolating from loved ones and not being able to engage in activities they enjoy. A analyzed mental side effects of the virus and concluded that medical professionals should watch their patients for signs of depression or some neuropsychiatric syndromes well after recovery. , the CDC recently added ""runny nose"" as a symptom of COVID-19. 414 survey respondents claimed a congested or runny nose as a lingering symptom of the virus. A runny nose is one way to get rid of the mucus in your body after the virus, so it may persist until the mucus is gone. Blurry vision may be a sign of nerve damage or may also occur when other COVID-19 symptoms are going strong, such as a fever or headache. According to the , blurred vision may also be a symptom of endophthalmitis, which is an infection of tissue or fluids inside the eye. If this is the case, quick treatment is required to prevent blindness. Dr. Shilpi Khetarpal, MD from the Cleveland Clinic, hair loss isn't necessarily a symptom of COVID-19 but may be a side effect of the virus. She states, ""We are seeing patients who had COVID-19 two to three months ago and are now experiencing hair loss."" In the survey, 423 respondents reported experiencing hair loss after coronavirus. Dr. Khetarpal says this may be due to a change in diet, high fever, extreme weight loss, or any other ""shock to the system"" that COVID-19 may have caused. on coronavirus patients and found that 96% of patients recovered from chills and 97% recovered from fever. While most recovered from all COVID-19 symptoms, 34% still revealed that they were suffering from one or more lasting symptoms when interviewed four to eight days after testing positive. 65% of sufferers returned to their usual state of health around seven days after testing positive but chronic medical conditions, age, weight, gender, and other factors may affect how long symptoms, such as fever and chills, last. , tachycardia occurs when your heart beats over 100 beats per minute. It's a form of arrhythmia, or a heartbeat disorder. In the survey, 448 respondents experienced tachycardia after suffering from COVID-19. It may be the body's response to stress, trauma, or illness. However, if tachycardia is left untreated and continues to occur, it can lead to serious complications, such as heart failure or stroke. Partial or complete loss of sense of smell is a common symptom with COVID-19 and many other respiratory viruses, according to . Since your olfactory system is so close to your respiratory system, virus cells can enter into nerve and receptor cells and cause damage. It can take a long time for these cells to repair and some cells may never fully recover from the virus. , night sweats are different from regular sweating because they occur only at night and include intense sweating, enough to soak through your clothes and sheets. It's possible that night sweats are present due to a residual fever but they may also be caused by thyroid level issues, menopause, anxiety, or infections. New medication or other lingering symptoms, such as chills and muscle aches, may also contribute to long-lasting night sweats. While not all coronavirus sufferers experience a sore throat, it's one of the common symptoms the CDC lists for the virus. According to, viruses and infections cause sore throats, which may be why this is a lingering symptom for some coronavirus patients. While it's not the most common, diarrhea is listed by the CDC as a symptom of COVID-19. A analyzed 206 patients with low severity COVID-19 and 48 experienced digestive problems first before other coronavirus symptoms. Diarrhea lasted an average of 14 days for COVID-19 patients in the study. Even after the fever, headache, and dry cough have disappeared, some patients who have ""recovered"" from COVID-19 may experience heart palpitations. A examined 100 recovered COVID-19 patients and found that 78 of them had ""cardiac involvement"" while 60% had ongoing myocardial inflammation. Ongoing heart issues, such as palpitations, may be long-lasting for COVID-19 patients, regardless of their illness severity.  explains that as your immune system attempts to fight off COVID-19 or any type of illness, white blood cells produce interleukins to help join the fight. While these interleukins are useful in fighting off the virus cells, they also cause muscle and joint pain. The immune response may still be heightened in these recovering patients, causing this joint pain to last. A lingering cough can be a side effect of any type of cold, flu, or illness. According to a study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Chinese COVID-19 patients, 61.7% developed a dry cough. As a respiratory virus, the cough associated with COVID-19 may take a long time to go away because your body is attempting to get rid of lingering mucus and phlegm.  What Taking a Multivitamin Every Day Does To Your Body Chest pain or pressure was a common lingering COVID-19 symptom among survey participants. Since coronavirus affects the lungs and respiratory system, this chest pain may be attributed to the virus still settling in the body. According to , sudden, sharp chest pains are referred to as pleurisy and it may indicate that the lung walls are inflamed. Pleurisy may be a sign of pneumonia or another type of infection, so recovered COVID-19 patients should see a doctor if this symptom persists. COVID-19 is a respiratory virus that also has nervous system side effects. According to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians Open, ""symptoms including headache, dizziness, vertigo, and paresthesia have been reported."" This may be due to decreased oxygen levels, dehydration, fevers, or headaches also caused by the virus. paper published in the analyzes potential long-term neurological effects of COVID-19 on patients who experienced severe cases. Memory problems and cognitive decline are potential side effects for some of these patients.  Since the virus affects the nervous system, memory problems may be a lingering side effect for some patients, especially those who suffered severe cases. poll conducted by the American Psychiatric Association, about 36% of Americans feel coronavirus has had a serious impact on their mental health. Between quarantining, social isolation, and worry about developing a severe case of coronavirus, it's no wonder anxiety is a lingering symptom for COVID-19 patients. Sleep is crucial because it keeps the immune system functioning properly, heightens brain function, stabilizes mood, and improves mental health. 782 survey respondents claimed they were having difficulty sleeping, even after recovering from COVID-19. This lack of sleep may be due to anxiety or worry about the virus or may be attributed to other lingering symptoms, such as muscle pain or cough. Setting specific bedtimes and only using your bed for sleep may help with these difficulties. Dr. Sandhya Mehla with the Hartford HealthCare Headache Center, ""It is estimated that headache is a symptom of COVID-19 in about 13% of patients with COVID-19. It is the fifth most common COVID-19 symptom after fever, cough, muscle aches, and trouble breathing."" In the survey, 902 participants claimed that a headache was a long-lasting symptom after COVID-19. This may be due to dehydration, congestion, or other symptoms of coronavirus, such as a fever. After recovering from COVID-19, some patients find it hard to exercise or be active, even if they were fit before contracting the virus. 916 survey participants reported that they were still unable to exercise after recovering from coronavirus. According to a , researchers recommend that patients who suffered from severe cases of COVID-19 wait at least two weeks before resuming light exercise. This allows time for doctors to see if heart or lung conditions develop that could make it dangerous to engage in physical activity.  The long-term effects of COVID-19 are unknown since the virus is so new but researchers are seeing certain neurological effects on patients who have recovered. analyzed these neurological conditions and found that 40% of the patients analyzed experienced confusion and conscious disturbance. This is commonly referred to as ""brain fog"" and many patients express feeling this way while recovering from coronavirus.  , shortness of breath is when you feel like you can't get enough air or your chest is tight. Most people feel this way after exercising or if they're experiencing a panic attack. However, patients with COVID-19 may feel shortness of breath without even moving since it's a common symptom of the virus. In the survey, 924 COVID-19 patients claimed that shortness of breath or difficulty breathing was a long-lasting coronavirus symptom.  Body aches are a common symptom of many illnesses, including coronavirus. In this survey, 1,048 participants reported feeling these body aches after their COVID-19 diagnosis. According to , ""Your body aches when you have the flu because your immune system is revving up to fight infection."" It's not necessarily the virus that causes these aches but your body's own reaction to the virus invasion.  Fatigue was the most common lingering symptom of coronavirus. According to , the average recovery time for mild coronavirus cases is around two weeks but three to six weeks for severe or critical cases. Lingering fatigue may be a sign that your body is still fighting the virus or is recovering from the fight. If you experience any of these conditions, it may or may not be COVID-19—contact a medical professional immediately. Stay healthy and keep others healthy, too: Wear your get tested if you think you have coronavirus, avoid crowds (and bars, and house parties), practice social distancing, only run essential errands, wash your hands regularly, disinfect frequently touched surfaces, and to get through this pandemic at your healthiest, don't miss these .

Abstract Abstract Diabetic neuropathy is a debilitating disorder that occurs in nearly 50 percent of patients with diabetes. It is a late finding in type 1 diabetes but can be an early finding in type 2 diabetes. The primary types of diabetic neuropathy are sensorimotor and autonomic. Patients may present with only one type of diabetic neuropathy or may develop combinations of neuropathies (e.g., distal symmetric polyneuropathy and autonomic neuropathy). Distal symmetric polyneuropathy is the most common form of diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic neuropathy also can cause motor deficits, silent cardiac ischemia, orthostatic hypotension, vasomotor instability, hyperhidrosis, gastroparesis, bladder dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction. Strict glycemic control and good daily foot care are key to preventing complications of diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic neuropathy can affect any part of the nervous system. This nerve disorder should be suspected in all patients with type 2 diabetes and in patients who have had type 1 diabetes for more than five years. In some instances, patients with diabetic neuropathy have few complaints, but their physical examination reveals mild to moderately severe sensory loss. Idiopathic neuropathy has been found to precede the onset of type 2 diabetes or to occur as an early finding in the disease. Tight glycemic control can prevent, delay, or slow the progression of diabetic neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes. Patients with diabetes should be educated about proper foot care and should check their feet daily. All patients with diabetes should have an annual foot examination by a health care professional. A = consistent, good-quality patient-oriented evidence; B = inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence; C = consensus, disease-oriented evidence, usual practice, opinion, or case series. See page 2029 for more information. Tight glycemic control can prevent, delay, or slow the progression of diabetic neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes.

See page 2029 for more information. Abstract The primary types of diabetic neuropathy are sensorimotor and autonomic . A patient may have only one type of neuropathy or might develop different combinations of neuropathies. Diabetic mononeuropathy (cranial, truncal, peripheral nerves) Diabetic mononeuropathy (cranial, truncal, peripheral nerves) Sensory neuropathies can be classified as distal symmetric polyneuropathy, focal neuropathy (e.g., diabetic mononeuropathy), and diabetic amyotrophy. Motor neuropathies are identified by the muscles that are involved. Autonomic neuropathies may be classified by the system that is affected (e.g., endocrine, gastrointestinal, genitourinary). Symptoms of various forms of diabetic neuropathy are listed in . Muscular symptoms: muscle weakness (not fatigue), atrophy, balance problems, ataxic gait Sensory symptoms: pain, paresthesia, numbness, paralysis, cramping, nighttime falls, antalgic gait Cardiovascular symptoms: exercise intolerance, fatigue, sustained heart rate, syncope, dizziness, lightheadedness, balance problems Gastrointestinal symptoms: dysphagia, bloating, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, loss of bowel control Genitourinary symptoms: loss of bladder control, urinary tract infection, urinary frequency or dribbling, erectile dysfunction, loss of libido, dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, anorgasmia Sudomotor (sweat glands) symptoms: pruritus, dry skin, limb hair loss, calluses, reddened areas Other symptoms: difficulty driving at night, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, cognitive changes Muscular symptoms: muscle weakness (not fatigue), atrophy, balance problems, ataxic gait Sensory symptoms: pain, paresthesia, numbness, paralysis, cramping, nighttime falls, antalgic gait Cardiovascular symptoms: exercise intolerance, fatigue, sustained heart rate, syncope, dizziness, lightheadedness, balance problems Gastrointestinal symptoms: dysphagia, bloating, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, loss of bowel control Genitourinary symptoms: loss of bladder control, urinary tract infection, urinary frequency or dribbling, erectile dysfunction, loss of libido, dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, anorgasmia Sudomotor (sweat glands) symptoms: pruritus, dry skin, limb hair loss, calluses, reddened areas Other symptoms: difficulty driving at night, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, cognitive changes Once a careful history and a thorough physical examination have established the presence of diabetic neuropathy , assessment strategies can help in management. Screen for symptoms of diabetic neuropathy (see ). Review diabetes history, disease management, daily glycemic records, and previous hemoglobin A1C levels. Identify any family history of diabetes or neuropathy. Review medication history (including use of over-the-counter products and herbal or homeopathic products) and environmental exposures. Review for other causes of neuropathy, including vitamin B12 deficiency, alcoholism, toxic exposures, medications, cancers, and autoimmune disease. Supine and standing blood pressure for postural hypotension Cardiovascular examination to look for arrhythmias, absent or diminished pulses, edema, or delayed capillary refilling Cutaneous examination to look for extremity hair loss, skin or nail changes (including callus), and pretrophic (red) areas, especially between toes Neurologic examination using the 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein (10-g) nylon filament test (10-g monofilament test) Inspection of feet for asymmetry, loss of arch height, or hammer toes Sensorimotor examination and evaluation of cranial nerves, muscle strength, and range of motion Document distribution, intensity, and type of sensory or motor deficits. Evaluate small nerve fibers with temperature, light touch, or pinprick testing. Test large nerve fibers by vibratory sensation, position sense, muscle strength, sharp-dull discrimination, and two-point discrimination. Autonomic examination, including orthostatic blood pressure measurements Consider heart rate variability tests and electrocardiography if sensory neuropathy is present or symptoms warrant further evaluation. Consider heart rate variability tests in the patient who has had type 1 diabetes for 10 years or type 2 diabetes for five years; consider cardiac stress testing before the patient starts an exercise program.

Abstract In sensory nerve damage, the nerves with the longest axons usually are affected first, resulting in a stocking-and-glove distribution. Small fiber damage affects sensation of temperature, light touch, pinprick, and pain. Large fiber damage diminishes vibratory sensation, position sense, muscle strength, sharp-dull discrimination, and two-point discrimination. Polyradiculopathies and severe band-like abdominal pain also may occur. Polyradiculopathy may be identified by electromyography or a sensory examination that shows altered sensation along the course of the nerve trunk. Bilateral thigh pain or weakness with atrophy of the iliopsoas, quadriceps, and adductor muscles also may be present. Physical findings involving the L2, L3, and L4 nerve roots or an abnormal electromyograph should alert the physician to the presence of polyradiculopathy. When evaluating for sensorimotor neuropathy, it is important to ask the patient about recent falls and to look for loss of Achilles and patellar tendon reflexes, gait ataxia, and balance problems. Distal symmetric polyneuropathy, the most common form of diabetic neuropathy, affects approximately 40 percent of patients who have had diabetes for 25 years or longer. Most often, this neuropathy develops in the feet. The course is chronic and progressive; in rare cases, however, the neuropathy resolves spontaneously in six to 12 months. Distal symmetric polyneuropathy predisposes patients to variable pain, motor dysfunction, nerve palsies, ulcers, burns, infections, gangrene, and Charcot’s disease. Affected patients also may develop neuropathic cachexia syndrome, which includes anorexia, depression, and weight loss. When testing is performed in patients with distal symmetric polyneuropathy and initial skin ulceration, almost 70 percent deny hypoesthesia, and about 50 percent can sense a cotton wisp and pinprick. Diabetic mononeuropathy has an acute onset and usually is asymmetric. Cranial, truncal, and peripheral nerves are involved. The neuropathy generally resolves spontaneously in three to 12 months, but in rare cases it may last for years. Patients with diabetic mononeuropathy may develop visual changes or muscle weakness involving cranial nerves III, IV, and VI, as well as Bell’s palsy. Cranial nerve III involvement results in ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and diplopia with sparing of pupillary function. The median, radial, and lateral popliteal nerves are the most common sites of peripheral nerve involvement. Occasionally, nerve palsies affect several unilateral nerves. When multiple nerves are involved, the term “mononeuropathy multiplex” is used. Vasculitis should be ruled out as a cause of the symptoms. Diabetic amyotrophy, also known as femoral neuropathy or proximal motor neuropathy, usually is bilateral and frequently is associated with weight loss. This condition causes thigh muscle weakness, as well as variable pain and loss of the patellar reflex. Diabetic amyotrophy tends to occur more often in older male patients with type 2 diabetes. Thigh muscle atrophy is prominent, disabling, and usually limited to the iliopsoas, quadriceps, and adductor muscles. Less often, the anterolateral calf muscles are involved. Recovery usually is spontaneous in six to 12 months, but amyotrophy may recur. Increasing circumferential thigh measurements may not indicate recovery because muscle can be replaced by fatty tissue. Abstract Diabetic autonomic neuropathy can develop in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Although autonomic neuropathy may occur at any stage of diabetes, usually it develops in patients who have had the disease for 20 years or more with poor glycemic control. The reported prevalence of diabetic autonomic neuropathy varies widely, depending on the cohort studied and the methods of assessment. In autonomic disease, the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nerves are affected. Myelinated and unmyelinated nerve damage is found. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy may lead to hypoglycemic unawareness and increased pupillary latency. Many investigators have considered autonomic neuropathies to be irreversible. However, cardiac sympathetic dysinnervation has been shown to regress with tight glycemic control. The risk of cardiovascular events is at least two to four times higher in patients with diabetes. Cardiovascular neuropathy is a result of damage to vagal and sympathetic nerves. Clinical findings may include exercise intolerance, persistent sinus tachycardia, no variation in heart rate during activities, and bradycardia. Baroreceptor disease contributes to supine hypertension. In a patient with type 1 diabetes, an autonomic imbalance may result in a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG), which may predispose the patient to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. Diabetic neuropathy also can reduce appreciation of ischemic pain, which may delay appropriate medical therapy and lead to death. Orthostatic blood pressure measurements may be used to evaluate cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. Stress testing should be considered before any patient with diabetes starts an exercise program. Vasomotor neuropathy frequently causes orthostatic hypotension by affecting the splanchnic and peripheral vascular beds. Symptoms of syncope or dizziness often have day-to-day variability and may be exacerbated by insulin therapy or the postprandial state, in which there is splanchnic shunting of blood. The evaluation should include vital signs, an ECG, and orthostatic blood pressure measurements. In diabetic neuropathy, neuronal input to the peripheral vasculature is decreased or absent. Resultant peripheral vasomotor instability can manifest as persistent excess peripheral circulation (hyperemia) and peripheral edema. Loss of sympathetic tone in the blood vessels results in maximal vasodilation, which can lead to arteriovenous shunting in the soft tissue and bone. Increased blood flow through the bone causes calcium to wash from the cortical stores. Defective bone homeostasis and bone demineralization may result. The occurrence of peripheral vasomotor instability and peripheral sudomotor neuropathy is termed “autosympathectomy.” The patient with autosympathectomy has peripheral vasomotor reflexes similar to those in a nondiabetic patient after sympathectomy. The mechanism by which the body senses and responds to changes in blood pressure by reflex vasodilation or contraction of peripheral vessels is impaired. Autosympathectomy and distal symmetric polyneuropathy are considered necessary for the development of Charcot’s disease (diabetic neuropathic arthropathy). Sudomotor neuropathy may cause hyperhidrosis and heat intolerance in the upper torso or anhidrosis in the lower extremities. Temperature elevation is rare, but sometimes occurs. The skin of the extremities may feel pruritic and may display thinning, hair loss, dryness, flaking, cracks, increased callus formation, and nail dystrophies. These skin changes increase the risk of ulceration. Gastrointestinal autonomic neuropathy may cause paresis anywhere in the digestive tract, with damage to small myelinated and unmyelinated splanchnic nerves. Reduced contraction amplitudes of the tubular esophagus may cause mild dysphagia. Motility studies, such as scintigraphy after a radiolabeled meal, are helpful in the evaluation of nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and delayed gastric emptying. Diabetic diarrhea is caused by increased or uncoordinated transit time in the small intestine, bacterial overgrowth, or increased intestinal secretion. Stool cultures and flexible sigmoidoscopy may be helpful in excluding other causes of diarrhea, such as parasitic infection, colon cancer or polyps, celiac sprue, and inflammatory bowel disease. Decreased transit time in the large intestine may cause constipation or impacted stool. Abdominal radiography or computed tomography may reveal megacolon or fecal impaction. Neuropathic fecal incontinence also may occur in patients with gastrointestinal autonomic neuropathy. A reduced threshold of conscious rectal sensation is manifested by a decreased resting anal sphincter pressure. In patients with diabetic bladder dysfunction, inability to sense a full bladder and detrusor muscle hypoactivity cause retention and incomplete voiding of urine. These conditions can progress to overflow incontinence and urinary tract infections. Hyperglycemia alone also can cause increased urine production and incontinence. The evaluation of the patient with diabetes who has bladder dysfunction should begin with a review of medications. Drugs that impair detrusor contractility and increase urethral tone include calcium channel blockers, anticholinergics, alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists, narcotics, antidepressants, and antipsychotics. Further work-up should include a patient’s voiding record, post-void residual testing, and urinalysis. Cystometric and urodynamic studies confirm the diagnosis. Erectile dysfunction can occur at an early age in men with diabetes. It develops in 35 percent of men with diabetes between 20 and 59 years of age and 65 percent of men with diabetes 60 years or older. The primary cause is pelvic plexus neuropathy; a decrease in nitric oxide, which is required to initiate an erection, contributes to the condition. Routine screening is important because erectile dysfunction may occur before the development of other autonomic signs. The evaluation of erectile dysfunction includes a sexual history, a genital examination, a serum testosterone level, and prolactin and thyrotropin levels. In women, diabetic neuropathy may cause vaginal dryness, decreased perineal sensation, dyspareunia, reduced libido, or anorgasmy. Routine screening should be performed because sexual dysfunction may precede other autonomic signs. A detailed sexual history, pelvic examination, and urinalysis help rule out other diagnoses. Abstract Early detection and control of diabetes and coexisting risk factors for neuropathy (e.g., smoking, alcohol abuse, hypertension) can prevent, delay, or slow the progression of diabetic neuropathy. The Diabetes Control Complications Trial (DCCT) demonstrated that tight glycemic control may result in a 60 percent reduction in the risk of developing clinical neuropathy. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has adopted the DCCT-established standards for tight glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes, 13 to 39 years of age at initiation of the study: a mean blood glucose level of 155 mg per dL (8.6 mmol per L) and a hemoglobin A1C value of 7.2 percent. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the A1C value should be less than 7.0 percent, and peak postprandial plasma glucose levels should be less than 180 mg per dL (10.0 mmol per L). No clinical trial data are available on the effects of glycemic control in older patients, in young children, or in patients with advanced complications. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommends an A1C value of less than 6.5 percent in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Daily foot care is essential for preventing complications of diabetic neuropathy (). Patients should be instructed to inspect their feet daily for dry or cracking skin, fissures, plantar callus formation, and signs of infection between the toes and around the toenails. Application of topical ointments to intertriginous areas should be avoided. Properly fitted footwear is crucial. New shoes are a common cause of ulceration and should be broken in slowly. Patients also should avoid sources of possible trauma, such as walking barefoot, cutting nails incorrectly, and exposing their feet to hot objects or chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide, iodine, or astringents (e.g., witch hazel). At each visit, the physician should examine the patient’s feet visually to detect evidence of neuropathy or early lesions. The ADA recommends a thorough annual foot examination by a health care professional for all patients with diabetes. The feet should be checked for skin breaks, red or callused areas, decreased or absent pedal pulses, and delayed capillary refilling, bony deformities, and protective sensation. Protective sensation is assessed by the 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein (10-g) nylon filament test (10-g monofilament test; ). The 10-g monofilament test for diabetic neuropathy. Calluses must be reduced before testing is performed. The 10-g monofilament test for diabetic neuropathy. Calluses must be reduced before testing is performed. Once a patient has diabetic neuropathy, foot care becomes essential for preventing ulceration, infection, and amputation. A multidisciplinary team approach can reinforce preventive advice and help the patient develop and maintain good foot care habits. Choose a single article, issue, or full-access subscription.

ece91875-a69c-4606-8dd2-18f4ca4c3dec,"The Fibromyalgia Spectrum – Part of the Big Picture in Understanding Fibromyalgia By Mark J. Pellegrino, MD* • ProHealth.com • June 8, 2010 Fibromyalgia • ME & C.F.S. Lyme Disease • Natural Wellness  Dr. Pellegrino has seen more than 25,000 FM patients in his practice at , and has been a fibromyalgia patient himself since childhood. As a senior resident at The Ohio State University in 1988, I gave a lecture on Fibromyalgia at the Physical Medicine Grand Rounds. One of my lecture slides was entitled “Fibromyalgia, A Spectrum of Conditions?” I discussed how Fibromyalgia appears to be a “broader” condition with specific subsets. Fibromyalgia was in that area between normal and disease – the “gray” area. Some of the subsets were closer to normal, involving regional pain only, or milder symptoms without numerous associated conditions. Some subsets were closer to abnormal, with some features of connective tissue or rheumatic diseases, but were not quite “there.” Today I’m convinced Fibromyalgia is indeed a “broader” condition with various subsets. I believe this information is helpful in explaining why everyone’s symptoms are different even though they all have Fibromyalgia. This chapter addresses how the Fibromyalgia spectrum is part of the big picture in understanding Fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia Is a Distinct Medical Entity, and Appropriately So We have long recognized, however, that many conditions overlap it, and various conditions exist that can lead to secondary Fibromyalgia. Dr. Muhammad Yunus, MD, [a professor and FM specialist at the University of Illinois College of Medicine] has developed the concept of Dysregulation Spectrum Syndrome (DSS) to describe how conditions overlap.(1) Dr. Yunus describes DSS as representing various associated conditions that share similar clinical characteristics and pathologic mechanisms with Fibromyalgia. Ten conditions are in the DSS umbrella: Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, tension headaches, migraine headaches, primary dysmenorrhea, periodic limb movement disorder, restless leg syndrome, temporomandibular pain syndrome, and myofascial pain syndrome. He predicts other entities will be added to this list in the future. [Note: Dr. Yunus is also a co-author of the American College of Rheumatology’s proposed new, broader, diagnostic criteria for Fibromyalgia, published May 13, 2010.] According to Dr. Yunus, Conditions in DSS Share a Number of Characteristics: Patients with different conditions sharing similar profiles. Common shared symptoms, such as pain, poor sleep, fatigue, and female predominance. No “diagnostic” pathology that can be measured. Shared psychological complaints such as depression and anxiety. Treatments directed at the central nervous system leading to improvement. I have discussed the Fibromyalgia spectrum with my patients to help them understand the various subsets possible. I do not see Fibromyalgia as a member of a bigger family, but as the main condition. It is the “founding father” and keeps its name. If Fibromyalgia is the founding father, then the various overlapping conditions and subsets become the children. The name Fibromyalgia remains, but different subsets have unique characteristics and together they become the Fibromyalgia spectrum. This diagram shows the concept of the Fibromyalgia spectrum. The Fibromyalgia entity partially overlaps with the normal entity on one side and the disease entity on the other side. Within the Fibromyalgia entity are 8 subsets. The first subset is in the most “normal” portion of Fibromyalgia, and the 8th subset is in the most “diseased” portion of Fibromyalgia. Each number represents a distinct subset with distinct characteristics. The Eight Subsets of the Fibromyalgia Spectrum Are: Predisposed state Prodromal [preceding] state Undiagnosed Fibromyalgia Regional Fibromyalgia Generalized Fibromyalgia Fibromyalgia with particular associated conditions Fibromyalgia with coexisting mild disease Secondary Fibromyalgia reactive to disease. An individual can move up this spectrum – from a lower numbered subset to a higher numbered subset, but once in a particular subset, she/he does not return to a lower numbered subset. One can achieve a remission, but stays in that subset. In other words, there is no going back. Let’s review the features of each subset. The individual is asymptomatic. Clinical Fibromyalgia is not present in this state. The individual is at risk for developing Fibromyalgia due to hereditary factors, which may include one or both parents with Fibromyalgia or a rheumatic/connective tissue disease, or a sibling or first-degree relative with Fibromyalgia. Prodromal means , or the state leading to the condition. Clinical Fibromyalgia is still not present. There is no widespread pain or painful tender points. The individual is not asymptomatic, however. Associated conditions common with Fibromyalgia may be present in this stage, such as headaches, restless leg syndrome, fatigue, or irritable bowel syndrome. Pain may be present at times, but intermittently (not chronic, persistent pains). Even though the individual may have one or more associated condition(s), widespread persistent pain is not present, so therefore Fibromyalgia is not yet present. Typical Fibromyalgia pain must be present before we can diagnose clinical Fibromyalgia, no matter how many associated conditions may be present, but those who have numerous associated conditions are at risk. Chronic pain is now present, either regional or generalized in nature. This is the point of no return. The person has painful tender points which may or may not meet the American College of Rheumatology-defined 11 of 18 criteria. The person in this stage usually has milder symptoms and has not yet seen a doctor or been officially diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. If this individual were to see a knowledgeable physician, that diagnosis would be made. Individuals in this stage have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, but not generalized. Chronic pain is limited to one or a few areas such as the upper body or the low back. The symptoms may wax and wane. Usually, this subset is triggered by a trauma. I believe myofascial pain syndrome is part of this regional Fibromyalgia, and both terms are essentially synonymous. Myofascial pain syndrome has become familiar through the work of the late Dr. Janet Travell, MD, and Dr. David Simons, MD.(2) Myofascial pain syndrome is defined by painful muscles and the presence of triggerpoints and taut bands of muscle fibers which are ropey and painful when palpated. An involuntary shortening of the fibrous muscle band can create a local twitch response. Some of those who work with myofascial pain syndrome will argue that it is a separate distinct entity from Fibromyalgia. I disagree. The similarities between myofascial pain syndrome and Fibromyalgia are far greater than their differences. They both have trigger points, tender points, ropey muscles, sympathetic nerve dysfunction, ATP abnormalities, peripheral and central mechanisms, regional and generalized versions, and associated conditions. Sound familiar? The treatments are essentially the same. As our clinical experience has evolved and our knowledge and research have become more refined, I think it is clear that myofascial pain syndrome is a part of the overall Fibromyalgia spectrum. Subscribe to the World's Most Popular Newsletter (it's free!) Individuals with regional Fibromyalgia, over time, often develop generalized Fibromyalgia. Or they can remain in this stage indefinitely. Identifying the regional stage early and treating it can definitely help to prevent progression. Individuals in this stage have widespread pain and tender points. They will usually meet the American College of Rheumatology-defined 11 of 18 criteria, but as previously explained, one can still have generalized Fibromyalgia with fewer tender points. Various associated conditions seen with Fibromyalgia can be present – sleep disorder, irritable bowel syndrome, depression, fatigue, and so on. These associated conditions are not taking on a life of their own, so to speak, but are part of the whole and managed with the overall Fibromyalgia treatment. Regional Fibromyalgia can progress to this subset. Various causes of generalized Fibromyalgia include genetic factors, trauma, infections, and more, but secondary Fibromyalgia from a primary disease is not included in this subset. Subset 6: Fibromyalgia with Particular Associated Conditions People in this group have developed associated conditions that are giving them particular problems which appear as “separate” entities requiring separate attention. Some of these particular associated conditions include irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome [ME/CFS], fatigue, tension/migraine headaches, and depression. None of these conditions in themselves have “classic” disease laboratory markers or cause tissue destruction, yet they may require treatments in addition to the overall Fibromyalgia treatment. Another associated condition is dysautonomia (dysfunction of the small nerves), which can cause abnormalities such as hypoglycemia [low blood sugar], hypotension [low blood pressure], cardiac arrhythmia, irritable bowel syndrome, and vascular headaches. Individuals in this category have a specific disease, and also have Fibromyalgia. The disease doesn’t necessarily cause Fibromyalgia, but can aggravate it if it’s already present. Examples of diseases that can be present and worsen the Fibromyalgia symptoms include: (hypothyroidism, low estrogen, low growth hormone, and low cortisol) (yeast, parasite or viral infections). (lupus, autoimmune disorders, dry eyes syndrome described by Dr. Don Goldenberg, MD, [Chief of Rheumatology at Newton-Wellesley Hospital and Professor of Medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine] may be part of a low grade Sjogren’s syndrome). (cervical spinal stenosis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, scoliosis). (multiple sclerosis, polio sequelae, neuropathy, head injury residuals). For example, people who have both diabetes and Fibromyalgia will often have more painful Fibromyalgia because the diabetes caused the nerves to be more sensitive. Diabetes is a common cause of neuropathy, or damage to the small nerves, which is painful in itself and even more so with Fibromyalgia. One needs to keep the diabetes under good control to help the pain. . I see a number of people who have Fibromyalgia along with a lung problem such as emphysema, asthma, chronic bronchitis, or heavy tobacco use. Cigarette smoking can increase Fibromyalgia pain. The nicotine in the smoke causes constriction of the blood vessels, decreasing blood flow, oxygen, and nutrients to the muscles, thereby increasing pain and spasms. Also, carbon monoxide in smoke enters the bloodstream and binds to the hemoglobin molecules in the blood. this blocks oxygen from binding to the hemoglobin, further decreasing oxygen availability to the muscles (and increasing pain). Stop smoking and your muscles will feel better! These diseases exist concurrently with Fibromyalgia but probably do not cause it. Any of these diseases can progress from a mild to a more severe state, and Fibromyalgia worsens as the disease worsens. The physician determines if the disease is coexisting with and aggravating Fibromyalgia (subset 7), or if a disease caused the Fibromyalgia (subset 8). Subset 8: Secondary Fibromyalgia Reactive to Disease Individuals in this category have secondary Fibromyalgia. They have a primary disease (for example lupus, rheumatoid arthritis) – and Fibromyalgia developed as a result of this disease. People in this subset probably wouldn’t have Fibromyalgia if they never had the primary disease. The primary disease requires treatment, and Fibromyalgia may improve with this treatment. However, the Fibromyalgia often requires its own treatment, and can continue to be a major problem even when the primary disease is treated or is in remission. I find that the Fibromyalgia spectrum provides a useful clinical model for me when evaluating and treating my patients. It helps me to “organize” them better! When I diagnose Fibromyalgia, I try to be as specific as possible about what the cause is and what subset it fits. This helps me to better explain Fibromyalgia to the patients and to individualize their treatment programs. Of course, if I’ve diagnosed it would be subset 4 or greater. The patient wouldn’t be seeking a medical consultation for subsets 3, 2, or 1. If possible, I note the cause. Each subset can have flare-ups or remissions within it, and I note that as well, if appropriate. Subsets 1, 2, and 3 [predisposed state, prodromal state, undiagnosed Fibromyalgia] are useful in appreciating the progression of Fibromyalgia through the spectrum, and can be helpful when advising patients and family members who have specific concerns and questions. Let’s Review Some Patient Profiles to Determine the Subset they Fit into in the Fibromyalgia Spectrum Mary is a 25-year-old receptionist with severe neck and shoulder pain. She had always been very active with aerobics and bicycling and had never had any pain requiring treatment until after a motor vehicle accident… when she was rear-ended and suffered a whiplash injury. The pain never went away, and when I saw her I found numerous painful tender points and trigger points with localized spasms in the neck and shoulder muscles. (subset 4). She was most likely predisposed to Fibromyalgia, and a traumatic event triggered the development of her regional Fibromyalgia. She “leaped” from predisposed state (subset 1) to regional Fibromyalgia (subset 4). Martha is a 30-year-old housewife. She was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia 5 years ago, and she was at a stable baseline with her home program of stretches, exercises, and using a hot tub. In the past year, she has been having increasing pain and fatigue, and difficulty managing her Fibromyalgia. She reports that in the past year she has been getting frequent yeast infections. She is on birth control pills and has had a couple of bladder infections requiring antibiotics in the past year. Her more recent history is otherwise unremarkable. – chronic yeast infection (subset 7). Her birth control pills, antibiotic treatment, and perhaps Fibromyalgia have contributed to the chronic yeast infection. In turn, the yeast infection has aggravated her Fibromyalgia. [See also Dr. Pellegrino’s explanation of “Candidiasis – Yeast Infection and Nutritional Repair.” ] Jamie is a 38-year-old school teacher. She has lupus, diagnosed when she was 13 years old, and has been on various medications since then. She has been in remission for a number of years, but has developed widespread pain. Her sedimentation rate is not elevated to suggest active inflammation. Her clinical exam does not reveal any joint inflammation or active lupus findings, but she does have 16 of 18 painful tender points. (subset 8). In her case, the lupus is in remission, but her Fibromyalgia is causing her problems and needs to be treated. Jamie’s 12-year-old son has been complaining of leg pains. The pains occur at nighttime, and Jamie has to rub the legs and use warm compresses. The pediatrician told her his pains were growing pains. Jamie’s son gets occasional headaches, and sometimes he feels exhausted. He plays many sports, and if he works out a lot his muscles are very sore for several days. On exam, there are no areas of pain or painful tender points. (subset 2). He is at risk because his mother has Fibromyalgia and a connective tissue disease, and he has some associated conditions with intermittent pains, but has not developed the persistent widespread pain or painful tender points yet. Bob is 42 years old and has an awful lot of pain for his age. His pains are more severe than everyday pain, and sometimes he has had to miss work. He is an assembly line worker. He mentions this to his primary care doctor when he is there for his yearly physical. He is examined and found to have 12 of 18 positive painful tender points. (subset 3) until he became official, “entering the books” with generalized Fibromyalgia (subset 5) after he saw his primary care doctor. There is much disagreement and controversy among medical professionals and patients about categories and subsets of Fibromyalgia or similar conditions. I’m not attempting to stir the waters with my version of the Fibromyalgia spectrum – rather I’m trying to help you understand the fairly complicated nature of the condition and the different types I see. I find this model useful and practical in my everyday clinical practice. Remember one of my mottos: Keep things as simple as possible and make sure they make sense!

And recently in June 2007, Yunus, et al. published a report in the journal Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism suggesting that Fibromyalgia and overlapping disorders be categorized as “Central Sensitivity Syndromes” (CSS), based on “mutual associations” and evidence for central sensitization (hypersensitization of the central nervous system) among several of the disorders.

Your opinion matters! 12 thoughts on “The Fibromyalgia Spectrum – Part of the Big Picture in Understanding Fibromyalgia” I enjoyed this article, but wondered why Chronic Fatigue Syndrome wasn’t mentioned. I believe it should be included in the description of subsets 7 and 8. CFS often co-exists with Fibromyalgia. I was diagnosed with CFS two weeks after I was diagnosed with FM; both diagosises made after over four years of searching, with my symptoms increasing. Thank you so very much for the good information in this article! It puts FM in easier to understand stages. I agree with you DeborahLynn. I was actually diagnosed with my CFS/ME in 1996 and diagnosed with Fibro in 2000. So I was to wondering why that didn’t get mentioned in any of the subsets. My fatigue is terrible, but come lately my pain is almost unbearable. If what you say is true, we all MUST find a way to work with those in these early stages to save the from this horrible disease, fibromyalgia. The severe pain and aldenia came on me like a storm when I was only 8. I am now 52 and in stage 7. Without morphine and Lyrica I am a non-functional invalid. I think fibromyalglia is a malfunction in the pain pathways in the gut and brain. Like the way memories are developed in the brain in layers that become deeper and clearer over time, For example, you drive to a new friend’s house for the first time and get lost; the second time you study the directions at every turn, the third time you are not confident, but you remember the landmarks along the way. The next time you make it without difficulty. Later, you can make the drive there without even thinking about it. You know many details of the landmarks along the way. Decades later, you could drive there in you sleep and clearly remember the details of the things along the way. I believe pain and the memory of pain get’s laid down in the gut and brain in layers in a similar manner. You can call the pain back up at will through your memories. You can experience the pain again and again. How and why the system malfunctions so that pains start firing off all over the body for no good reason is the mystery. In my case, the years that I was 7 and 8 I lived in constant fear of my family breaking up and that if it did, no one wanted me. I was very anxious and depressed and worried about it daily. I continually thought about “what ifs” running bad event over and over in my mind. After I was exposed to hazardous chemicals, the fibromyalgia came on me like a storm. I had already laid down the perfect route for it by memorizing the details of every painful experience I had ever had. I got no sympathy or treatment until I was 45. The boy you mention in this article needs help. Ask him if he is thinking through his heartaches repeatedly. He and others in stage 1&2 need to know the risk and learn to “set your mind on things above” and not dwell on painful events and not call up memories of them. I hope to God you are wrong about the impossibility of moving downward on your scale. Thank you for this article it helps people to understand that Fibromyalgia has several stages and you could be a part of any one of them. However, even though there are studies and headway being made in Fibro research there is still no real good treatment. All of the doctors I have seen for my conditions tell me that non of them are disabling, but my pain level is so great most of the time it is hard for me to go up or down my steps, then the other conditions kick in and I can’t leave the house. I haven’t been able to find a doctor that will acutally listen to me about what is going on with my body. Please continue the research because even though I haven’t found a doctor to help me, the information you give is very helpful. It helps me feel that I am not losing my mind!!! I found this article helpful in clarifying the several stages of this disorder, most of which I have personally experienced. It is especially strengthening to realize that depression and anxiety are a part of the disorder, and not a psychosomatic symptom or reaction. To everyone who suffers from this, I want to say: it can be managed. I was diagnosed in 1999 after several years of near disability. Since then, I am much improved. Most of the time I am pain free, except for relapses which occur primarily when I am over stressed, over extended physically, or I eat something I shouldn’t. To achieve this state, I have used alternative health care practitioners almost exclusively, since Western trained doctors are completely unprepared to deal with this disorder. A fact which almost all of you know by now! There have been changes, however: now I mostly have to cope with CFS, a chronic exhaustion. I can do no exercise without tremendous pain the next day, and a 2-3 day recovery. I need a LOT of sleep; and wake up unrefreshed in any case. I have eliminated dairy, wheat, gluten, soy, and acid from my diet. It’s hard but it helps. EVen with all the dietary changes, I still struggle with weight gain, and find it hard to slim down. The primary health care system I use is Homeopathy. I strongly recommend you find a Homeopathic physician and consult him or her regularly. This is one system that really works and has no side effects, though it may take some time. I too feel that Dr. Pelligrino should have discussed the subject of ME/CFS in relation to Fibromyalgia. I know there is much controvery with the primary issue being that CFS was given an erroneous name for a potentially very serious disorder. Myalgic Encephalomyelitis was defined decades ago. CFS research and awareness has suffered because of that mistake. Regardless, there’s much misdiagnosis because doctors are not aware of either disorder although perhaps more so ME/CFS. But the truth is that many, many have ME/CFS as the primary disorder just as he listed many other disorders that Fibromyalgia accompanies other disorders. I have primary ME/CFS with associated Fibromyalgia. I’ve had this nearly 25 years and was diagnosed by Dr. Lapp, one of the worlds leading experts. I find Dr. Pelligrino’s books to be very good but leaving out ME/CFS is a serious mistake for those patients who are going to end up being misdiagnosed. Great article and graphic. I plan on sharing this with my support group as well as my new doctor. It explains why all of us can have FMS, but have different and varying symptoms. I do agree that CFS should have been included since most of us have both. On a personal note, I KNEW smoking was not helping the FMS or RA….I needed to see it in print…hopefully this will help me quit for good. I used to live about 25 miles from Dr. Pellegrino’s office in Ohio and he confirmed that I had fibromyalgia as my internist and I thought. I can’t say enough good things about him! I’ve never had a doctor talk to me for so long and take such an exhaustive history. Reading this article I am definitely a 7. Other than the fibro I’ve been “healthy” (if that word really even applies) but 2 months ago I suddenly had a seizue. I’ve never had a seizure in my life, and I am 44! None of the doctors can tell me why it happened, but I am certain that it’s the fibro. Considering that fibro is now pretty much regarded as a neurological problem, it only makes sense that it’s the reason for the seizure. So now I have yet another pill to swallow — WooHoo!! My condition started as ME (in 78 before anyone knew anything about it), progressed to diagnosed FM in the early 90’s, and stayed somewhat steady: relasping, sort of remitting, for years until I entered menopause._____ Then my condition got much worse, and I happened to find a doctor who recognised Lyme disease, and has treated me for over 2 years. I’m now on maintenance herbs, diet, etc. to manage the Lyme infections, which has gradually gone away, but I seem to be left with CFS/ME and FM._____ It’s very frustrating to work so hard, and end back in a state of almost total inactivity, especially now that the brain fog is gone: my mind is raring to go, but the body just won’t move._____ An important point I’d like to make: When I went to the Lyme forums, I found most had been diagnosed with ME and FM before finding out they had lyme disease all along. That “flu that never goes away” could well be the initial bite and infection infiltration. Most don’t see the bull’s eye that is the bugs moving away from the site of entry._______ I think everyone who has these conditions should try to find a lyme literate medical professional to rule out (or in) the possibility of Lyme disease. This article by Dr Pellegrino has opened my eyes to some of the why’s of what is going on with my body. I live with nearly all of the conditons that are secondary to Fibro. In addition to that I have scoliosis with soft tissue damage at L3 to L5 of the spine (pain daily0, chronic depression, CMP, carpel tunnel, heel spur, thyroid disease, and the list goes on. I choose what I will do on a daily basis based on what hurts the most. I find that the weather changes also contribute greatly to making some of the conditions worse. Luckily I do not have to work anymore, but the low pension is a challenge. I have also found that a lot of organizations do not recognize Fibromyalgia as a real condition. Whether it be good or bad it sure would be appropriate to have Fibromyalgia classified appropriately as a REAL condition or dare I say a disease. I have always used Professor Yunus’ idea to help me understand my familial illness. I like Doctor Pellegrino’s very practical book too. However I think very differently about fibromyalgia. To me it is always a symptom of an underlying illness with an unidentified cause. I think the same about chronic fatigue and irritable bowel and other symptoms associated with these conditions. Recently good studies are pointing us strongly in the direction of infection being a major cause of unrelenting fibromyalgia. If not the infection itself then an immune system dysfunction which doesn’t easily correct itself. Most people with CFS/ME have fibromyalgia. Most people with FMS have post exertional fatigue. Studies by Prof Alan Light have demonstrated the underlying immunological dysfunction occurring after exertion in people with CFS and FMS. It is outstanding work. The cytokine upregulation of substanceP, IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-13 and many other neuropeptides explain the pain amplification and possibly the ibs and some of the fatigue. More work is needed to relate the many other symptoms but no doubt there is research around which can relate the syptoms to immunological factors. I don’t think you get fibromyalgia because you have CFS or vice versa. I think they are both consequences of an underlying illness/infection state. Some people will get more pain, some people will get more fatigue, still others will be bugged mainly by IBS. These differences are probably as a result of genetics and historical behaviour. INFECTION – IMMUNOLOGICAL RESPONSES – NEUROLOGICAL RESPONSES Someone like me who developed bad postural habits, then suffered a car accident with consequent cervical, lumber and thoracic (minor) injury is a sitting duck for fibromyalgia, if I get the infection, because I have pain sources. Without the infection they are just minor niggles now and then – at least that is what an MRI would predict. The first Rheumatologist I saw diagnosed reactive arthropathy. He focused on the severe bouts of diarrhea, fibromyalgia and muscle cramps. He was wrong. The treatment failed to help after one year. The second Rheumatologist diagnosed FMS and Rx amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant). This reduced the pain to a more tolerable half but did little for the fatigue, cramps and diarrhea. Then I read Prof Yunus’ paper and I realised that FMS was just a label to describe one lot of prominent symptoms which the Rheumatologist was oriented to diagnose as an illness. Then my wife and daughter became ill. With the same set of symptoms – just in a different degree: Symptoms in order of disabling effect: ME: fibromyalgia, post exertional fatigue, muscle cramps, diarrhea, orthostatic intolerance, new vascular headaches, memory problems, insomnia, vertigo, trembling, jerks and cognitive fuzz. WIFE: severe p.e. fatigue, trembling, diarrhea, jerks, cognitive fuzz, fibromyalgia, diplopia, memory problems, orthostatic intolerance, general dystonia. DAUGHTER: cognitive fuzz, diarrhea, candidiasis, multiple chemical sensitivity, fibromyalgia, orthostatic intolerance, p.e. fatigue, excessive unrestful sleep. My wife was diagnosed CFS and my daughter was diagnosed MCS by different Physicians of course. Now it seems highly unlikely that we have three people in such close relationship with totally different illnesses. I believe we do not have different illnesses but we differ in our symptoms. My daughter was a world champion athlete and doesn’t have pain sources to be magnified but she has had allergic sensitivities for many years. My wife has been a very energetic boom or bust driving sort of person who has suffered a few crashes of energy in the past. The point I am driving at is that it is possibly the genetic and lifestyle differences which account for much of the differences in symptoms, not the different symptomatic labels given to the illness. So I do adhere to Prof Yunus theory but maybe go one step further and say this is a hypersensitivity neuro-immune dysfunction. Like you, after many years of fms/cfs I had several collapses rendering me unconscious for several seconds which appeared to be a seizure but was actually probably caused by taking DHC (dihydrocodeine) in conjunction with neurontin (gabapentin) for pain. I could feel the collapse coming on for a few seconds with a strange disorientation and vertigo. Having been off the DHC/gabapentin for 11 months now I have had no further problems. You may have another underlying illness but I would check on the drugs if you are taking any. Iatrogenic (medically induced) complications are common in these illness.

CLAY, MD, Martin Army Community Hospital Family Medicine Residency, Fort Benning, Georgia   See related handout on , written by the authors of this article. Abstract Abstract Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing when compared with blood pressure from the sitting or supine position. It results from an inadequate physiologic response to postural changes in blood pressure. Orthostatic hypotension may be acute or chronic, as well as symptomatic or asymptomatic. Common symptoms include dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, nausea, palpitations, and headache. Less common symptoms include syncope, dyspnea, chest pain, and neck and shoulder pain. Causes include dehydration or blood loss; disorders of the neurologic, cardiovascular, or endocrine systems; and several classes of medications. Evaluation of suspected orthostatic hypotension begins by identifying reversible causes and underlying associated medical conditions. Head-up tilt-table testing can aid in confirming a diagnosis of suspected orthostatic hypotension when standard orthostatic vital signs are nondiagnostic; it also can aid in assessing treatment response in patients with an autonomic disorder. Goals of treatment involve improving hypotension without excessive supine hypertension, relieving orthostatic symptoms, and improving standing time. Treatment includes correcting reversible causes and discontinuing responsible medications, when possible. Nonpharmacologic treatment should be offered to all patients. For patients who do not respond adequately to nonpharmacologic treatment, fludrocortisone, midodrine, and pyridostigmine are pharmacologic therapies proven to be beneficial. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing compared with blood pressure from the sitting or supine position. Alternatively, the diagnosis can be made by head-up tilt-table testing at an angle of at least 60 degrees. Orthostatic hypotension is often found in older patients and in those who are frail. It is present in up to 20 percent of patients older than 65 years. In one study, the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension was 18 percent in patients older than 65 years, but only 2 percent of these patients were symptomatic. In the absence of volume depletion, younger patients with orthostatic hypotension usually have chronic autonomic failure. A related problem, postprandial hypotension, is common in older patients and those with autonomic dysfunction. In postprandial hypotension, there is a decrease in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mm Hg within 75 minutes of a meal.  Enlarge     Print Consider head-up tilt-table testing in patients with symptoms of orthostatic hypotension despite normal vital signs, or in patients who are unable to stand for orthostatic vital sign measurements.

Abstract A normal hemodynamic response to changes in posture requires normal function of the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous systems. Standing results in blood pooling of approximately 500 to 1,000 mL in the lower extremities and splanchnic circulation. This initiates an increase in sympathetic outflow, which increases peripheral vascular resistance, venous return, and cardiac output, thereby limiting the decrease in blood pressure. These compensatory mechanisms result in a decrease in systolic blood pressure (5 to 10 mm Hg), an increase in diastolic blood pressure (5 to 10 mm Hg), and an increase in pulse rate (10 to 25 beats per minute). However, orthostatic hypotension may result if there is inadequate intravascular volume, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, decreased venous return, or inability to increase cardiac output in response to postural changes. Decreased cerebral perfusion produces the neurologic symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. Abstract Orthostatic hypotension may be acute or chronic. Patients may present with light-headedness, blurred vision, dizziness, weakness, and fatigue, or with syncope (in the acute care setting). Less commonly, they may present with neck and shoulder pain, orthostatic dyspnea, and chest pain.  outlines the differential diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension, which may be caused by a number of things, including dehydration, blood loss, medication, or a disorder of the neurologic, cardiovascular, or endocrine system.  Evaluation of suspected orthostatic hypotension begins by identifying reversible causes and underlying associated medical conditions. lists historical features that suggest a specific diagnosis in the patient with orthostatic hypotension. In addition to assessing for symptoms of orthostasis, the physician should elicit symptoms of autonomic dysfunction involving the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems.  Enlarge     Print  Enlarge     Print Historical Clues to Diagnosis of Orthostatic Hypotension Abnormal uterine bleeding, fatigue, rectal bleeding Amaurosis fugax, aphasia, dysarthria, unilateral sensory and motor symptoms Congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, pericarditis Relapsing neurologic symptoms in various anatomic locations Historical Clues to Diagnosis of Orthostatic Hypotension Abnormal uterine bleeding, fatigue, rectal bleeding Amaurosis fugax, aphasia, dysarthria, unilateral sensory and motor symptoms Congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, pericarditis Relapsing neurologic symptoms in various anatomic locations Key physical examination findings in the evaluation of suspected orthostatic hypotension are listed in . A detailed assessment of the motor nervous system should be performed to evaluate for signs of Parkinson disease, as well as cerebellar ataxia. Blood pressure and pulse rate should be measured in the supine position and repeated after the patient has been standing for three minutes. As many as two-thirds of patients with orthostatic hypotension may go undetected if blood pressure is not measured while supine. However, a retrospective review of 730 patients found that orthostatic vital signs had poor test characteristics (positive predictive value = 61.7 percent; negative predictive value = 50.2 percent) when compared with tilt-table testing for the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. Head-up tilt-table testing should be ordered if there is a high index of suspicion for orthostatic hypotension despite normal orthostatic vital signs, and it may be considered in patients who are unable to stand for orthostatic vital sign measurements.  Enlarge     Print Physical Examination Clues to Diagnosis of Orthostatic Hypotension Cogwheel rigidity, festinating gait, lack of truncal rotation while turning, masked facies Confusion, dry mucous membranes, dry tongue, longitudinal tongue furrows, speech difficulty, sunken eyes, upper body weakness Study of 55 patients 61 to 98 years of age in emergency care setting found these findings highly reliable Decreased libido, impotence in men; urinary retention and incontinence in women Dependent lower extremity edema, stasis dermatitis Right-sided congestive heart failure, venous insufficiency Physical Examination Clues to Diagnosis of Orthostatic Hypotension Cogwheel rigidity, festinating gait, lack of truncal rotation while turning, masked facies Confusion, dry mucous membranes, dry tongue, longitudinal tongue furrows, speech difficulty, sunken eyes, upper body weakness Study of 55 patients 61 to 98 years of age in emergency care setting found these findings highly reliable Decreased libido, impotence in men; urinary retention and incontinence in women Dependent lower extremity edema, stasis dermatitis Right-sided congestive heart failure, venous insufficiency A description of head-up tilt-table testing and its indications are outlined in , and shows a patient undergoing the testing. The procedure is generally considered safe, but serious adverse events such as syncope and arrhythmias have been reported. All staff involved in performing tilt-table testing should be trained in advanced cardiac life support, and resuscitation equipment should be readily available.  Four common abnormal patterns can be seen in response to tilt-table testing . The test may be useful in distinguishing orthostatic hypotension from other disorders that can present with symptoms of orthostasis, such as neurocardiogenic syncope. Sensitivity of tilt-table testing for diagnosing neurocardiogenic syncope is as high as 65 percent, and specificity is as high as 100 percent.  Enlarge     Print Indications and Procedure for Head-Up Tilt-Table Testing High probability of orthostatic hypotension despite an initial negative evaluation (e.g., Parkinson disease) Patients with significant motor impairment that precludes them from having standing vital signs obtained Monitor the course of an autonomic disorder and its response to therapy Perform tilt-table testing in a quiet room with a temperature of 68°F to 75°F (20°C to 24°C). The patient should rest while supine for five minutes before testing is started. Heart rate should be measured continuously and an automated device should measure blood pressure at regular intervals. The table should be slowly elevated to an angle between 60 to 80 degrees for three minutes. The test is considered positive if systolic blood pressure falls 20 mm Hg below baseline or if diastolic blood pressure falls 10 mm Hg below baseline. If symptoms occur during testing, the patient should be returned to the supine position immediately.

In older patients, a report of dizziness upon standing may not correlate with the finding of orthostatic hypotension. A prospective study of older women found that use of anxiolytics or sleeping aids once weekly and cigarette smoking were more closely associated with postural dizziness without orthostatic hypotension than with a finding of orthostatic hypotension on tilt-table testing. In patients with Parkinson disease, classic symptoms of orthostatic hypotension are not reliably present in those who have autonomic dysfunction. A study of 50 patients with Parkinson disease found that only one-half of the patients who developed orthostatic hypotension during tilt-table testing were symptomatic. The study also found that patients with Parkinson disease who undergo tilt-table testing may need to be tested for longer than the recommended three minutes because only nine of 20 patients who developed orthostatic hypotension did so within three minutes. Extending the test to 11 minutes resulted in 15 of 20 patients being diagnosed, whereas 29 minutes was necessary to detect orthostatic hypotension in all patients. In acute care settings , syncope may be the initial presentation of orthostatic hypotension. A prospective study of 611 patients presenting to an emergency department following a syncopal episode found that 24 percent had orthostatic hypotension. Patients with syncope should be admitted if they have known cardiovascular disease, associated chest pain, an abnormal electrocardiogram, suspected pulmonary embolism, or new cardiovascular or neurologic findings on examination.       Orthostatic Hypotension Evaluation: Acute Care Setting Algorithm for the evaluation of suspected orthostatic hypotension in the acute care setting. Orthostatic Hypotension Evaluation: Acute Care Setting Algorithm for the evaluation of suspected orthostatic hypotension in the acute care setting. For patients without loss of consciousness, or those who are not considered at high cardiac or neurologic risk despite syncope, the evaluation shifts to rapidly identifying and treating reversible causes. If there is no evidence of intravascular volume depletion, or no response to volume resuscitation, then other causes should be considered. Several laboratory, imaging, and ancillary tests may be indicated .  Enlarge     Print Ancillary Tests in the Evaluation of Orthostatic Hypotension Elevated ratio or elevated serum creatinine may suggest intravascular volume depletion Electrolyte abnormalities from vomiting or diarrhea, or as cause of cardiac conduction abnormalities; clues to adrenal insufficiency (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia) Cerebral computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging Congestive heart failure, structural heart disease Ancillary Tests in the Evaluation of Orthostatic Hypotension Elevated ratio or elevated serum creatinine may suggest intravascular volume depletion Electrolyte abnormalities from vomiting or diarrhea, or as cause of cardiac conduction abnormalities; clues to adrenal insufficiency (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia) Cerebral computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging Congestive heart failure, structural heart disease Those who seek evaluation as outpatients are likely to have chronic etiologies of orthostatic hypotension , or they may have been referred for further testing upon discharge from the emergency department or hospital. They may be more likely to present with undifferentiated descriptions of dizziness as a symptom. If possible, potentially contributing medications should be discontinued and the patient reevaluated. If orthostatic hypotension persists, laboratory testing for underlying causes should include a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, vitamin B level, and morning cortisol .  Orthostatic hypotension is often neurogenic in patients whose history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not suggest another cause. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assess for possible etiologies of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension . If the cause still is not apparent, autonomic testing may be indicated. The autonomic test most often used is the head-up tilt-table test.       Orthostatic Hypotension Evaluation: Outpatient Setting Algorithm for the evaluation of suspected orthostatic hypotension in the outpatient setting.

Adapted from Freeman R. Clinical practice. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. N Engl J Med. . Abstract Acute orthostatic hypotension generally resolves with treatment of the underlying cause. In patients with chronic orthostatic hypotension, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments may be beneficial. All patients with chronic orthostatic hypotension should be educated about their diagnosis and goals of treatment, which include improving orthostatic blood pressure without excessive supine hypertension, improving standing time, and relieving orthostatic symptoms. Nonpharmacologic treatment should be offered to all patients initially. If potentially contributing medications cannot be discontinued, then patients should be instructed to take them at bedtime when possible, particularly antihypertensives. Patients should avoid large carbohydrate-rich meals (to prevent postprandial hypotension), limit alcohol intake, and ensure adequate hydration. Patients should be encouraged to keep a symptom diary and avoid identified precipitating factors. Older patients should consume a minimum of 1.25 to 2.50 L of fluid per day to balance expected 24-hour urine losses. Water boluses (one 480-mL glass of tap water in one study and two 250-mL glasses of water in rapid succession in another study) have been shown to increase standing systolic blood pressure by more than 20 mm Hg for approximately two hours. Sodium may be supplemented by adding extra salt to food or taking 0.5- to 1.0-g salt tablets. A 24-hour urine sodium level can aid in treatment. Patients with a value of less than 170 mmol per 24 hours should be placed on 1 to 2 g of supplemental sodium three times a day and be reevaluated in one to two weeks, with the goal of raising urine sodium to between 150 and 200 mEq. Patients on sodium supplementation should be monitored for weight gain and edema. Lower-extremity and abdominal binders may be beneficial. A randomized, single-blind controlled study using tilt-table testing demonstrated effective management of orthostatic hypotension by application of lower-limb compression bandages. An exercise program focused on improving conditioning and teaching physical maneuvers to avoid orthostatic hypotension has proven to be beneficial. Patients should actively stand with legs crossed, with or without leaning forward. Squatting has been used to alleviate symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Other maneuvers include isometric exercises involving the arms, legs, and abdominal muscles during positional changes or prolonged standing. Toe raises, thigh contractions, and bending over at the waist are recommended. In patients who do not respond adequately to nonpharmacologic therapy for orthostatic hypotension, medication may be indicated. . Fludrocortisone, which is a synthetic mineralocorticoid, is considered first-line therapy for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension. Dosing should be titrated within the therapeutic range until symptoms are relieved, or until the patient develops peripheral edema or has a weight gain of 4 to 8 lb (1.8 to 3.6 kg). Adverse effects include headache, supine hypertension, and congestive heart failure. Hypokalemia, which is dose-dependent and can appear within one to two weeks of treatment, may occur. In one study, hypokalemia developed in 24 percent of participants taking fludrocortisone, with a mean onset of eight months. . Midodrine, a peripheral selective alpha-1-adrenergic agonist, significantly increases standing systolic blood pressure and improves symptoms in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. Patients should not take the last dose after 6:00 p.m. to avoid supine hypertension. Adverse effects include piloerection, pruritus, and paresthesia. Its use is contra-indicated in patients with coronary heart disease, urinary retention, thyrotoxicosis, or acute renal failure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a recommendation to withdraw midodrine from the market because of a lack of post-approval effectiveness data. Continued approval of the drug is currently under review. Its use generally should be restricted to subspecialists. It is believed to have a synergistic effect when combined with fludrocortisone. . Pyridostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that improves neurotransmission at acetylcholine-mediated neurons of the autonomic nervous system. In a double-blind crossover study, patients were randomized to groups receiving 60 mg of pyridostigmine; 60 mg of pyridostigmine with 2.5 mg of midodrine; 60 mg of pyridostigmine with 5 mg of midodrine; or placebo. Compared with the placebo group, treatment groups demonstrated a decreased drop in standing diastolic blood pressure without worsening supine hypertension. Adverse effects include loose stools, diaphoresis, hypersalivation, and fasciculations. outlines nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic options for the management of orthostatic hypotension.  Enlarge     Print Physical maneuvers (e.g., squatting, bending at waist) Sodium supplementation (up to 1 to 2 g three times per day) Starting dosage of 0.1 mg per day, titrate in increments of 0.1 mg per week, maximum dosage of 1 mg per day Hypokalemia, headache, supine hypertension, congestive heart failure, edema Systemic fungal infections, hypersensitivity to drug class Starting dosage of 2.5 mg three times per day, titrate with 2.5-mg increments weekly until maximum dosage of 10 mg three times per day Supine hypertension, piloerection, pruritus, paresthesia Acute renal failure, severe heart disease, urinary retention, thyrotoxicosis, pheochromocytoma 2.5 mg: $112 ($140) for 100† 5 mg: $200 ($256) for 100* 10 mg: $291 ($616) for 100† Starting dosage of 30 mg two to three times per day, titrate to 60 mg three times per day Cholinergic effects, including loose stools, diaphoresis, hypersalivation, fasciculations Hypersensitivity to pyridostigmine or bromides, mechanical intestinal or urinary obstruction *—Estimated retail price based on information obtained at (accessed April 20, 2011).

8b85fac0-5eab-46bf-8fb8-d5d28cff0017,"Animals that maintain a fairly constant internal body core temperature (regulate their own body temperature to maintain a constant core body temperature)- The maintenance of a constant body temperature (temperature homeostasis) requires that heat loss = rate of heat production (heat gain)The body is equipped with both nervous and hormonal mechanisms to regulate metabolic rate and the amount of heat loss in response to body temperature changes to maintain a constant body temperature Body core temperature regulation is critical because cellular structures and metabolic pathways are affected by temperatureThe goal of temperature regulation is to maintain a constant core temperature and thus prevent overheating or cooling- To maintain a constant temperature, heat loss must equal heat gain - Regulation is therefore achieved by controlling the rate of heat production and heat loss Normal core temperature is 37 degrees C- Above 45 degrees C may destroy proteins and enzymes, causing inability to produce cellular energy and causing cell death- Below 34 degrees C may cause slowed metabolism and arrhythmias (can also lead to death In order to maintain temperature homeostasis, homeotherms use a furnace to maintain body temperature at a constant level- The body temperature is set near the high end of the survival range and is held constant by continuous metabolic heat production coupled with a small but continual heat loss Temperature regulation by heat generation and conservation is very efficient, whereas cooling capacity is much more limited During exercise, body temperature is regulated by making adjustments in the amount of heat that is lost and minimize the increase in body temperature - Circulatory system transports heat - Blood has high capacity to store heat - When the body is attempting to lose heat, blood flow is increased to the skin to promote heat loss to the environment- The nervous system also increases sweat production via eccrine sweat glands When the goal of temperature regulation is to prevent heat loss, blood is directed away from the skin towards the interior of the body to prevent additional heat loss Within the body, temperature varies a great deal; - In general, there is a gradient between core temperature (i.e. deep central areas including the heart, lungs, and abdominal organs) and the ""shell"" (skin) temperature The ideal thermal gradient from body core to skin surface is 4 degrees C - In extreme cold however, this gradient may be as much as 20 degrees C Even within the core, temperature varies from one organ to another - Why we must be precise when recording where the temperature measurements were obtained (i.e. specify skin or core temperature) Temperature Measurement During Exercise: Deep-Body (Core) Temperature Provides more information about how body temperature is being regulated (the temperature that we are more concerned about)Deep-body (core) temperature can be accomplished using- Mercury thermometers- Thermocouples or thermistors- Ingestible core temperature pills Measured at the rectum, ear, or esophagus - Usually in the laboratory (has limitations in a field setting)- Most common site is the rectum to measure deep-body core temperature during exercise (can also do this by measuring at esophagus) - Eardrum is good estimate of actual brain temperatureIngestible temperature sensor telemetry system- Useful for taking deep-body temperature measurements during practice sessions - Uses a low-peer radio frequency transmission to communicate with a temperature monitor Temperature Measurement During Exercise: Skin Temperature Skin temperature can be measured by placing temperature sensors (thermistors) on the skin at various locations- Then, mean skin temperature is calculated by averaging the sum of temperaturesTskin = (T forehead + T chest + T forearm + T thigh + T calf + T abdomen + T back)/7Skin temperature can provide useful information about the temperature gradient between the deep body (core) temperature and skin - Magnitude of this gradient is useful for body heat loss In order to regulate body temperature and thus maintain a constant core temperature, the hypothalamus works as a thermostat- Initiates an increase in the production of heat when body temperature falls- Initiates increase in rate of heat loss when body temperature risesTemperature regulation is controlled by both physical and chemical processes The body produces internal heat due to normal metabolic processes- At rest or during sleep, metabolic heat production is small- During intense exercise, heat production is largeHeat production in the body can be classified as voluntary or involuntary- Voluntary: exercise- Involuntary: shivering or biochemical heat production by the the action of hormones (non shivering thermogenesis) Accomplished through exerciseBecause the body is only 20-30% efficient at most, 70-80% of energy expended during exercise appears as heat - Can result in a large heat load during intense exercise - Prolonged exercise in hot/humd environment serves as series test of body's ability to lose heat Accomplished through shivering and non shivering thermogenesisShivering: maximal shivering can increase the body's heat production by 5x the resting valueNonshivering thermogenesis: biochemical heat production caused by secretion of thyroxine and catecholamine hormones (involuntary heat production caused by action of hormones)- Thyroxine: released by thyroid gland; increases metabolic rate of all cells in the body- Catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine): causes increase in rate of cellular metabolism as well - Increase in heat production due tot he combined influences of thyroxine and catecholamines is called non shivering thermogenesis Can occur by four processes:- Radiation- Conduction- Convection- Evaporation First three require a temperature gradient to exist between the skin and the environment- Not very effective in Texas heat as evaporation- In many cases, evaporation can be the only way to lose heat during exerciseHigh heat reduces the body's ability to lose heat by radiation/conduction/convectionHigh humidity reduces the body's ability to lose heat by evaporation Transfer of heat via infared rays- Involves the transfer of heat from the surface of one object to the surface of another with no physical contact (i.e. sun transferring het tot the earth via radiation) Accounts for 60% of heat loss at rest- Occurs because skin temperature is greater than the temperature of surrounding objects (walls, floor, etc) and a net loss of body heat occurs due to the thermal gradient Can also be a method of heat gain- i.e. on hot sunny days when surface temperature is greater than skin temperature Thus, radiation an result in either heat loss or gain Heat loss due to contact with another surface; the transfer of heat from the body into the molecules of cooler objects in contact with its surfaceIn general, the body loses only small amounts of heat due to this processi.e. transfer of heat from the body to a metal chair while a person is sitting- Heat loss occurs as long as the chair is cooler than the body surface in contact with it Form of conductive heat loss in which heat transferred to air or water molecules in contact with the body - Air or water molecules are warmed and move away from the source of the heat (the body) and are replaced by cooler moleculesi.e. a fan moving large quantities of air past the skin- Increases the number of air molecules coming in contact with the skin and thus promotes heat loss The amount of heat loss that occurs due to convection is dependent on the magnitude of the airflow over the skin - Under calm wind conditions, cycling at high speeds would improve convective cooling when compared to cycling at slow speeds i.e. Swimming in cool water (water temperature less than skin temperature) also results in convective heat loss- Water's effectiveness in cooling is about 25x greater than that of air at the same temperature Heat is transferred from the body to water (sweat) on the surface of the skin , which is then converted to water vapor once the water gains sufficient heat (energy); heat from the skin converts water to water vapor- Evaporation occurs due to the vapor pressure gradient between skin and air When body temperature rises above normal, as during exercise, the nervous system stimulates sweat glands to secrete sweat onto the surface of the skin - As sweat evaporates, heat is lost to the environment, which in turn lowers skin temperatureBody loses 0.58 kcal heat/ml sweat evaporated- 1 L sweat results in heat loss of 580 kcal 25% heat loss at rest- Most important means of heat loss during exercise (in cool/moderate environment)- When exercise is performed in a hot environment, evaporation is the only means of losing body heat The pressure exerted by water molecules that have been converted to gas (water vapor) Dependent upon air and relative humidity - At any given temperature, a rise in humidity causes increased vapor pressure Evaporation of sweat from the skin depends on:- Temperature and relative humidity (ambient conditions) - Convective currents around the body- Amount of skin surface exposed to the environmentAt high environmental temperatures, relative humidity is the most important factor influencing the rate of evaporative heat loss - High relative humidity reduces the rate of evaporation by reducing the vapor pressure gradient- Cooling via evaporation is therefore most effective under conditions of low humidityHigh relative humidity reduces the vapor pressure gradient between the skin and the environment - On a hot/humid day, (RH = 80-90%) the vapor pressure int the air is close to the vapor pressure on moist skin - Skin vapor pressure = 32 mmHgHigh sweating rate in a hot/humid environment results in useless water loss- Sweating per se does not cool the skin, the evaporation does - For evaporative cooling to occur, the vapor pressure on the skin must be greater than the vapor pressure in the air Heat produced that is not lost is stored in body tissues- Will raise body temperature Body heat gain during exercise = heat produced - heat loss Amount of heat required to raise body temperature:- specific heat of human body is 0.83 kcal/kgHeat required to raise body temp 1 degree C (specific heat of the body) = specific heat x body mass The body's temperature regulatory center; responds to increases or decreases in body core temperature to maintain a set point temperature around 37 degrees CInput to the hypothalamus comes from receptors in both the skin and coreChange in environmental temperature is first detected by thermal receptors in the skin - Transmits impulses to the hypothalamus, which initiates the appropriate response to maintain the set-point temperatureTemperature sensitive neurons also located in the spinal cord and hypothalamus to sense changes in core temperature Responds to increased core temperature by increasing heat loss1) Sweating: stimulates the sweat glands to commence sweating and increase evaporative heat loss2) Cutaneous vasodilation: vasomotor control center withdraws normal vasoconstrictor tone to the skin to promote cutaneous vasodilation- Increases skin blood flow and allows for increased heat lossWhen core temperature returns to normal, the stimulus to promote sweating and vasodilation are removed - i.e. example of negative feedback Responds to decreased core temperature by minimizing heat loss and increasing heat production1) Cutaneous vasoconstriction: vasomotor control center directs peripheral blood vessels to vasoconstrictor (decreased skin blood flow prevents heat loss)2) Involuntary shivering: produces heat under significant core temperature drops 3) Catecholamine release: initiates release of norepinehrine to increase the rate of cellular metabolism (nonshivering thermogenesis)4) Thyroxin release: indirectly increases thyroxine production and release, which increases cellular heat production (nonshivering thermogenesis)Promotes pilorection (goosebumps); increases insulation space for fur-bearing animals As exercise intensity increases:- Energy output increases- Heat production (metabolic rate) increases- Total heat loss increases- Body core temeprature incrases- Heat loss via evaporation increases - Convective and radiative heat loss decreases1) Heat production increases - This occurs due to muscular contraction and is directly proportional to the exercise intensity - Venous blood draining the exercising muscle distributes the excess heat throughout the body core- As core temperature increases, thermal sensors in the hypothalamus sense the increase in blood temperature - Hypothalamus integration sensor detects difference in the thermal set point and the stimuli received- Responds by directing the nervous system to commence sweating and to increase blood flow to the skin to increase body heat loss and minimize the increase in body temperature - Causes new internal body core temperature to reach a new elevated steady-state level (does not result in a change in the set-point) 2) Linear increase in body core temperature- Core temperature proportional to the active muscle mass (due to increased metabolic rate from higher intensities) - Higher net heat loss3) Lower convective and radiant heat loss- Higher evaporative heat loss As ambient temperature increases:- Heat production remains constant- Lower convective and radiant heat loss- Higher evaporative heat loss Increase in body temperature is directly related to exercise intensity (not the environmental temperature)- Body heat load increases with intensity- Linear increase in energy output, heat production, and total heat loss as a function of work rateMechanisms of heat loss during exercise- Evaporation (most important means of heat loss) - Convection (small contribution)- Radiation (small role in total heat loss) As temperature increases at constant intensity:- Total energy output and heat production remain constant- The contribution of heat loss from convection and radiation decreases- At around 20 degrees C, evaporation becomes the primary mechanism for evaporative heat loss and heat loss from evaporation increasesMethod of heat loss during continuous exercise is modified according to ambient conditions Measure of the body's perception of how hot it feels- Relative humidity added to air temperature ex: - air temperature = 80 degrees F- relative humidity = 80%- heat index = 89 degrees F High relative humidity reduces evaporative heat loss- Lowers heat loss (heat is lost at a slower rate)- Increases body temperature Inability to lose heat- Higher core temperature- Risk of hyperthemia and heat injuryHigher sweat rate (eccrine sweat glands stimulated by sympathetic cholinergic control at a higher rate) - May be as high as 4-5 L/hr- Risk of dehydration Sweat rate depends on body mass and training level of working out in the heat- Better training stimulates earlier onset of sweating and higher sweat rate throughout the exercise Guidelines:- Exercise during the coolest part of the day- Minimize exercise intensity and duration on hot/humid days- Expose a maximal surface area of skin for evaporation- Provide frequent rests/cool-down breaks with equipment removal - Avoid dehydration with frequent water breaks- Rest/cool down breaks should be in the shade and offer circulating, cool air- Measure body weight at the beginning and end of training session to determine the amount of fluid replacement required Dehydration of 1-2% of body weight can impair performanceGuidelines:1) Hydrate prior to performance - 400-800 ml fluid within 3 hours prior to exercise2) Consume 150-300 ml fluid every 15-20 min- Volume adjusted based on environmental conditions3) Ensure adequate dehydration- Consume equivalent of 150% weight loss- 1 kg body weight = 1.5 L fluid replacement- Monitor urine colorSports drinks are superior to water for rehydration Exercise Performance is Impaired in a Hot Environment Exercise performance is impaired in a hot environment- Performance during prolonged, sub maximal exercise (i.e. marathon) is impaired in a hot/humid environment- Performance during intermittent, high-intensity exercise (i.e. rugby, soccer, 15 min on cycle) is also compromised Exercise in the heat accelerates muscle fatigue and impairs exercise performance due to a combination of metabolic events: 1) Heat-related muscle fatigue- During long and intermittent exercise2) Accelerated glycogen metabolism- Increased lactate and accumulation and carbohydrate metabolism -

e6db0869-bb75-43be-a8e4-fa8148daf41d,"What is Chronic Fatigue Syndrome & Myalgic Encephalomyelitis? The disease known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) in the United States has historically been called myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) abroad. The acronym ME/CFS is currently used by researchers to reflect the difference in nomenclature. Even though the case definitions of the two illnesses do not match, specialists in the US who treat chronic fatigue syndrome acknowledge that the diseases are fundamentally the same. The primary characteristics of the illness are a profound, unrelenting loss of energy that is not relieved by rest; post-exertional malaise, which is a worsening of all symptoms following minimal mental or physical exertion; sleep disorder; cognitive impairment resulting in slowed processing of information, reduced focus and attention, and pain. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome & ME is a “multi-system disease,” that is, it affects several systems in your body simultaneously: the immune system, the nervous system, and the endocrine system. Because cells of all three systems share the same receptors, any illness that affects one of these systems will affect the other two. There have been thousands of research papers on ME/CFS documenting multiple physiological abnormalities in patients with ME/CFS. The most consistent among these abnormalities is immune system dysfunction, notably reduced natural killer cell (NK) function. Natural killer cells are part of the innate immune system, which means they don’t need prior contact with pathogens in order to form antibodies. (That is why they are “natural” killer cells.) NK cells provide a rapid response to viral infections and tumor cells. Reduced NK function indicates, among other things, that the immune system is unable to clear viruses. Reduced NK function has been one of the most consistent immunological findings among people with ME/CFS. In fact, it is so consistent that the Japanese originally called the disease LINKS, which stood for Low Natural Killer Cell Syndrome. One of the earliest immune system studies was performed in 1994 by Barker et al. They found that NK cell dysfunction was a “common manifestation of CFS.” Further studies led by Ogawa, and Ojo Amaize confirmed that NK cells were not properly activated, and, when they were, had low cytotoxicity. Ojo Amaize et al. concluded that low cytotoxicity of NK cells was consistent with flu-like symptoms, and, perhaps, the reactivation of viruses. Not every study has found a reduction of NK function, which has led to a debate in the research community as to whether ME/CFS should be classified an immune disease. The most recent of the NK studies, conducted by Brenu et al., cleared up some of the confusion. The immune system changes minute by minute. As a consequence, studies that take a “snapshot” of immune markers through a single blood draw will have variable results. Brenu’s group looked at immune markers over a period of a year. The study demonstrated that NK (natural killer) cytotoxic activity remained consistently decreased in ME/CFS patients during the course of the disease. Brenu’s group also found consistent pro-inflammatory cytokines (immune system chemicals). The persistent upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines is a marker of chronic inflammation and persistent viral infection in many disease states. In 1990 Nancy Klimas was one of the first researchers to find a distinct pattern of cytokines in ME/CFS patients. More recently, Maes et al. found that inflammatory cytokines and immune markers were not only elevated, but were associated with specific symptoms, including fatigue, sadness, autonomic symptoms, and a flu-like malaise, concentration difficulties, failing memory, and a subjective experience of infection. Other immune irregularities, such as antibodies to cardiolipin, seem to indicate that an autoimmune process is involved (Hokama). Anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) are found in autoimmune diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, and scleroderma. Other indicators of an autoimmune process are the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in about one-third of ME/CFS patients, as well as antiphospholipid antibodies (Berg). The most telling evidence that ME/CFS is fundamentally an immune disorder comes from the fact that it is chronic. Any chronic illness points to an immune system that is not operating efficiently. There have been many studies documenting nervous system abnormalities in patients with ME/CFS. In the early 1990s, the late Dr. Jay Goldstein developed a theory in which he proposed that ME/CFS was the result of an injury to the limbic system, which is an area located deep in the brain just above the brainstem, and is involved with memory, emotion, and regulation of the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system regulates homeostasis in the body: appetite, body temperature, blood pressure, blood sugar, sleep, wakefulness, heart rate, digestion, and sex drive. Goldstein’s theory was based on a careful observation of symptoms in his patients, but he also made SPECT scans that showed blood flow was reduced in the brains of people with ME/CFS. Functional MRIs (fMRI) measuring brain responsiveness during the performance of mental tasks show that people with ME/CFS have slower processing speed, loss of focus, and poor short-term memory (Caseras, Tanaka). Using a similar technique, a group of Dutch researchers in Holland led by de Lange, mapped structural brain structure and volume in CFS patients and healthy controls with high-resolution structural magnetic resonance images using voxel-based morphometry, a form of statistical analysis that measures the shape, size and position of brain structures. The de Lange study found “substantial and consistent” reductions in gray matter volume in two groups of ME/CFS patients as compared with controls. Reductions in both white and gray matter have been found by subsequent researchers (Barnden, Puri et al.). In 2011, Puri et al. concluded that their data supported the hypothesis that “significant neuroanatomical changes occur in CFS, and are consistent with the complaint of impaired memory that is common in this illness.” Their data also indicated that “subtle abnormalities in visual processing, and discrepancies between intended actions and consequent movements, may occur in CFS/ME.” One of the most significant brain studies was recently published by a group of Japanese researchers. Using PET scans, Yasuhito Nakatomi et al. found that neuroinflammation is higher in ME/CFS patients than in healthy controls. They also found that inflammation in certain areas of the brain – the cingulate cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, midbrain, and pons – correlated with the symptoms. Patients who reported impaired cognition, for example, showed neuroinflammation in the amygdala, which is known to be involved in memory. This research not only demonstrates the connection between neuroinflammation and cognitive symptoms, it takes us full circle back to Jay Goldstein’s limbic hypothesis, as most of the areas of the brain showing inflammation were located in the limbic system. The third major system affected by ME/CFS is the endocrine system. The endocrine system is a collection of glands that secrete hormones directly into the circulatory system. These hormones are then carried to a target organ. The major endocrine glands are the pineal gland, hypothalamus, and pituitary gland in the brain; the pancreas; the sex glands (ovaries, testes); the thyroid and parathyroid glands; the gastrointestinal tract; and the adrenal glands. When glands signal each other in sequence this is referred to as an axis, e.g. the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis figures prominently in ME/CFS literature. In 1991 a research team led by Dr. Mark Demitrack published a study demonstrating abnormalities in the HPA axis in patients with ME/CFS. The study showed decreased levels of cortisol, blunted response of the pituitary gland to corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), and enhanced sensitivity to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). While the test results ruled out primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease), they did indicate a dysregulation in the HPA axis, which would lead to excessive fatigue, as well as many other symptoms typical of low adrenal function. The authors concluded that their test results indicated “a mild central adrenal insufficiency” in ME/CFS patients, most likely originating in the hypothalamus. Subsequent studies by Dinan et al., Maes et al., Cleare et al., and Scott et al. found significant disruptions of the HPA axis, as well as reductions in DHEA (a precursor to sex hormones), and blunted responses to chemical signals sent by the brain (De Becker). Low growth hormone (GH) levels have also been found in ME/CFS patients (Berwaerts at al.) Growth hormone is released during sleep by the pituitary gland. Given that insomnia is one of the primary symptoms of ME/CFS it is not surprising that GH levels would drop. Low GH is associated with a loss of vitality in adults, or, in common parlance, fatigue. The mitochondria are small structures within cells that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecule that generates cellular energy. ATP is essential for every function in the body, which means that when the powerhouses of energy production, the mitochondria, are damaged and levels of ATP decline, the body literally runs out of energy. If low levels of ATP are sustained, there can be lasting damage to the heart, which is highly dependent on ATP. Mitochondrial dysfunction has also been linked to diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, cancer, and liver disease, all of which produce profound fatigue. The first doctor to suggest mitochondrial damage in people with ME/CFS was Dr. Melvin Ramsay, the physician who documented the Royal Free Hospital outbreak in the 1950s. In an article written in 1978, Dr. Melvin Ramsay proposed that “abnormal muscular fatigability is the dominant clinical feature and it is suggested that mitochondrial damage may provide an explanation for this phenomenon.” Not long after Dr. Ramsay’s observation, the Drs. Behan found concrete evidence of damaged mitochondria in muscle biopsies of patients with post-viral syndrome. Out of 50 samples, mitochondrial degeneration was obvious in 40 of the biopsies. Significantly, they also noted the presence of “ragged red mitochondria,” a sign of mitochondrial disease. The authors concluded that their findings provided the first evidence that post-viral syndrome “may be due to a mitochondrial disorder precipitated by a virus infection.” Since that time, ME/CFS specialists have accepted the fact that ME/CFS produces mitochondrial damage. Dr. Cheney has long held that ME/CFS is a mitochondrial disease, a position strongly supported by research showing mitochondrial dysfunction in the muscles of ME/CFS patients – as indicated by the production of excess lactate. Because the heart is composed of muscle tissue, cardiac function will be affected by reduced mitochondrial output. A 2003 study by Peckerman et al. documented cardiac impairment in ME/CFS patients. Test results showed that patients with severe ME/CFS had “significantly lower stroke volume and cardiac output than the controls and less ill patients.” The authors proposed that in patients with ME/CFS, “blood pressure is maintained at the cost of restricted flow, possibly resulting in a low flow circulatory state. Thus, there might be periods in daily activities when demands for blood flow are not adequately met, compromising metabolic processes in at least some vascular compartments.” Dr. Cheney has proposed that this impairment in diastolic function is what lies at the heart of the majority of ME/CFS symptoms. If cardiac output is low to begin with, standing up would reduce it to levels so low that a person would experience dizziness, black-outs, and even fainting. Once cardiac output is sufficiently reduced, all other systems would decline as well. The body, in an effort to supply blood to the heart, would restrict blood flow to other organ systems, such as the gut. As a consequence, digestion would be impaired, with resultant dysbiosis, malabsorption, and a host of GI problems. Blood flow to the brain would also decline, leading to cognitive problems, depression and anxiety, and impairment of hypothalamic function. With reduced blood flow, the immune system, which depends on the vascular system for transport, could not function efficiently; latent viruses and secondary infections would proliferate. The liver, an organ which relies heavily on blood flow, could not detox the body sufficiently, leading to a buildup of toxins. Under these conditions, exercise would not only strain the system, it could be dangerous. According to Dr. Sarah Myhill, mitochondrial dysfunction is the central mechanism of ME/CFS. Her explanation of mitochondrial damage is that when the body is stressed, the demands placed on ATP production can exceed the supply. In people with ME/CFS, the body is continually stressed by an overworked immune system and secondary infections, resulting in a depletion of overall ATP, which damaged mitochondria cannot regenerate. Once stores are low, the cells begin to convert glucose into lactic acid, which is the reason why ME/CFS patients so quickly switch to anaerobic metabolism during exercise. The net result is exhaustion at the metabolic level. In a study conducted in 2009 by Dr. Myhill and two colleagues, Dr. Myhill measured the levels of five biomarkers indicative of mitochondrial function in the sera of ME/CFS patients. The results of the study indicated that when analyzed together, these markers were predictive of illness severity in ME/CFS patients. The researchers concluded that their findings strongly implicated mitochondrial dysfunction as the immediate cause of ME/CFS symptoms. However, they could not determine whether the damage to mitochondrial function was a primary effect, or an effect secondary to cellular hypoxia or oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is both the product and the cause of mitochondrial dysfunction. That being said, there is also ample evidence that viruses can directly cause extensive damage to mitochondria. The herpes simplex virus causes massive damage to mitochondrial DNA, contributing to cell death and tissue damage. Viruses can also use mitochondrial proteins for replication, induce cell apoptosis (cell death), and increase the production of free radicals. Mitochondrial disease shares many common features with ME/CFS. Both illnesses share similar markers – evidence of oxidative stress, high lactate levels, low acyl-carnitine, and low glutathione levels (which has been proposed as a marker for mitochondrial diseases) are common lab findings in both mitochondrial disease and ME/CFS. Both illnesses are heterogeneous, manifesting in different organs and at different rates of severity. Both are difficult to diagnose. And finally, exercise intolerance is a hallmark characteristic of both illnesses, a feature which no doubt led Dr. Ramsay to conclude that ME was a mitochondrial disease. Given the overlap in lab results, symptoms, and treatment, there is no reason not to consider ME/CFS as an acquired mitochondrial disease.

Dr. Kenny De Meirleir has proposed that the translocation of intestinal flora into the bloodstream is what causes the chronic immune activation of ME/CFS. The mechanism through which intestinal bacteria enter the bloodstream is known as “leaky gut” (intestinal permeability), a condition that compromises the protective barrier of the intestinal wall, allowing large molecules and bacteria that would otherwise be trapped in the intestines to pass through. In 2012 Dr. Maes et al. measured responses to intestinal flora in blood samples from 128 patients with ME/CFS. The researchers found higher levels of IL-1, TNF alpha, neopterin and elastase (an enzyme that destroys bacterial proteins) than in controls, indicating an immune response to bacteria in the bloodstream. Furthermore, IL-1, TNF alpha and neopterin were significantly related to fatigue, flu-like malaise, autonomic symptoms, neurocognitive disorders, sadness and irritability. The authors concluded that “increased translocation of commensal bacteria may be responsible for the disease activity in some ME/CFS patients.” Not only do translocated intestinal flora activate the immune system, their by-products, particularly hydrogen sulfide (the gas that produces the “rotten egg” smell), can exert profound effects on the endocrine system, including a decrease in core body temperature, sleep apnea, reduced heart and respiration rates, and a severe metabolic drop. Excess hydrogen sulfide can also inhibit mitochondrial oxygen utilization. In related work, Marian Dix Lemle has proposed that the production of excess hydrogen sulfide is responsible for the mitochondrial dysfunction that lies at the base of ME/CFS symptomatology. These three researchers have, between them, established a mechanism that would account for all ME/CFS symptoms. Marian Lemle has identified the chemical component. Dr. De Meirleir has explained the cause for its increase in the gut, and Dr. Maes has identified the mechanism through which it causes symptoms- translocation. All of these components directly reflect the influence of the microbiome. Increasingly, scientists are looking at the microbiome’s role in disease. The microbiome is the community of bacteria, and other micro-organisms that inhabit our bodies. Often, when researchers refer to the microbiome, they are talking about the trillions of bacteria that inhabit our intestines, and that enable us to digest our food, absorb nutrients, and protect us from pathogens. Alterations in the microbiome have been found in a number of diseases and conditions, such as autism, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, major depression, and ME/CFS. Most promising for patients is the potential therapeutic value of altering the microbiome to treat these illnesses. When Butt et al. analyzed the microbiota of patients with ME/CFS, they found that changes in the gastrointestinal microbial ecology were “significantly associated with fatigue symptoms” as well as neurological and cognitive function. Borody et al. addressed this problem by treating 60 patients with bacteriotherapy (fecal transplant). The results of the treatment were promising. Of the 60 patients, 42 responded well to the treatment. Most impressive was the fact that after 15 years, 12 of those patients were still symptom free. The authors concluded that “bacteriotherapy achieves initial success rate of 70% in CFS and a 58% sustained response.” Results like these have prompted Dr. Ian Lipkin to initiate a million-dollar project to study the microbiome of ME/CFS patients (McGrath). Lipkin believes that “populations of fungi, bacteria and viruses in the colon can have an impact on the immune system and give rise to cytokine activation which could cause the symptom complexes we see in ME/CFS.” It is difficult to estimate how many people suffer from ME/CFS when there are so many case definitions. Using a very broad case definition, such as the Oxford Case Definition, which only requires six months of fatigue, would result in enormously inflated numbers, as it could capture people with depression, deconditioning, and rare diseases, such as Behçet’s, Ehlers-Danlos, Primary Immune Deficiency, early MS, rare forms of leukemia, and so on. A narrow case definition, such as the Canadian Consensus Criteria or International Consensus Criteria, would produce more accurate statistics, but these definitions are used almost exclusively by ME/CFS experts, not by government agencies charged with establishing prevalence and incidence. The fact that so few doctors have the expertise to diagnose ME/CFS confounds the problem. In 2003, Reyes et al. published a 4-year study conducted in Wichita, Kansas. The overall prevalence of CFS was 235 per 100,000 persons, which meant 800,000 people in the U.S. had the disease. CFS was more than four times more common among women (373 per 100,000) than among men (83 per 100,000). Only 16 percent had received a diagnosis and medical treatment for their illness. According to the CDC, there are currently In Great Britain, there are roughly 250,000 . One the minimum prevalence rate of ME/CFS at 0.2%. (Nacul et al.) ME/CFS Australia estimated that there were 180,000 Australians with ME in 2002. That number has since grown. The 2005 conducted by Statistics Canada indicated that there were 333,816 Canadians diagnosed with ME/CFS. In the Netherlands, prevalence may be as high as 3.6% in the working population, which is considerably higher than the US rate. (Huibers et al.) Sweden has also reported a high prevalence rate of 2.6%. (Evengård et al.) There have been very few systematic epidemiological studies conducted in Africa, but one study suggested that the rates might be higher in Nigeria than in the US. (Njoku et al.) The prevalence of CFS in a community population in Japan was 1.0% in 2011, or roughly 300,000 nationwide. VIDEO: What is Chronic Fatigue Syndrome? Not what you might think.

What Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder that can make someone feel faint or dizzy. It happens when the autonomic nervous system (ANS) doesn't work as it should. The autonomic nervous system is the body's ""autopilot"" system, controlling things like heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing. The autonomic nervous system problems seen in POTS (also called ) can affect children and adults. Symptoms vary from mild to disabling. What Happens in Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? The autonomic nervous system keeps blood pressure at the right level for the brain no matter what position a person is in — standing (vertical), lying flat on the back (called supine), and sitting or reclining (called recumbent). Usually when a person stands, the nerves of the autonomic nervous system tell blood vessels in the lower body to constrict (tighten). The tightening vessels work against gravity to keep blood from collecting in the legs. This automatic response makes sure the brain has enough blood flow to work well. If there is not enough blood flow to the brain, a person may feel lightheaded or pass out every time they stand. In POTS, the autonomic nervous system doesn't work in the usual way, so the blood vessels don't tighten enough to make sure there is enough blood flow to the brain. To try to keep enough blood flowing to the brain, the autonomic nervous system makes the beat a lot faster instead. What Are the Signs & Symptoms of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? POTS is named for an unusual jump in the heart's beating speed that happens when a person stands. Other symptoms that can happen with POTS include: heart palpitations (feeling the heart beat or race) lightheadedness (almost passing out; vision tunnels or goes gray or dark) Most POTS symptoms happen only when standing or changing to a standing position.

POTS affects more girls than boys, and is more common when one or both parents had POTS. It often begins in the early or mid-teens. How Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Diagnosed? There's no single test to diagnose POTS. Doctors start by doing a complete physical exam and taking a . POTS causes a heart rate increase of 40 or more beats per minute within 10 minutes of when someone moves from a supine (lying down) position to a standing one. The heart rate goes up dramatically, with little if any drop in blood pressure. Doctors can measure this easily. Sometimes, doctors do a ""tilt-table test."" In this test, a person is strapped to a table, then tilted from a supine (lying on the back) position into a standing position while heart rate and blood pressure are monitored. Doctors also make sure the problem isn't due to anything besides the autonomic nervous system. Depending on the symptoms, tests might be done on other parts of the body. These might check the blood, heart, brain, eyes, ears, kidneys, muscles, nerves, hormones, digestive tract, and more. Typically, a diagnosis of POTS is confirmed when symptoms have lasted for several months and no other causes are found. If someone has POTS, the medical team will look for reasons that the autonomic nervous system doesn't respond normally to standing. Finding an answer can help treatments work well.

POTS is a form of orthostatic intolerance, the development of symptoms that come on when standing up from a reclining position, and that may be relieved by sitting or lying back down. The primary symptom of an orthostatic intolerance is lightheadedness, fainting and an uncomfortable, rapid increase in heartbeat. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Menu What is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)? Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a condition that affects circulation (blood flow). It involves the autonomic nervous system (which automatically controls and regulates vital bodily functions) and sympathetic nervous system (which activates the fight or flight response). POTS is a form of orthostatic intolerance, the development of symptoms that come on when standing up from a reclining position, and that may be relieved by sitting or lying back down. The primary symptom of an orthostatic intolerance is lightheadedness, fainting and an uncomfortable, rapid increase in heartbeat. Heart rate and blood pressure work together to keep the blood flowing at a healthy pace, no matter what position the body is in. People with POTS cannot coordinate the balancing act of blood vessel squeeze and heart rate response. This means the blood pressure cannot be kept steady and stable. Each case of POTS is different. POTS patients may see symptoms come and go over a period of years. In most cases, with proper adjustments in diet, medications and physical activity, a person with POTS will see an improvement in quality of life. Also, if an underlying cause is found and is treated, POTS symptoms may subside. There are various forms of POTS. The most common are: : Peripheral denervation (loss of nerve supply) leads to poor blood vessel muscles, especially in the legs and core body. : Overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. : Reduced blood volume can lead to POTS. Low blood volume can cause similar symptoms that may overlap in neuropathic and hyperadrenergic POTS. The majority of POTS patients are women ages 13-50 years old. About 450,000 people suffer from POTS in the United States. Patients may develop POTS after a viral illness, serious infections, medical illness, pregnancy and trauma such as head injury. The condition may develop as aftermath of a significant illness (especially associated with hospitalization and prolonged immobilization). POTS may develop in those who have had a recent history of mononucleosis. People with certain autoimmune conditions such as Sjogren’s syndrome and celiac disease can be at higher risk. Sjogren’s can be evaluated by blood testing, dry eye test, lip biopsy and rheumatology consult. Celiac disease can be tested through blood work, gastroenterology consult, and if needed biopsies of the small intestines. What are the symptoms of (POTS)? POTS symptoms can be uncomfortable and frightening experiences. Patients with POTS usually suffer from two or more of the many symptoms listed below. Not all patients with POTS will have all these symptoms. Dizziness/lightheadedness especially in standing up, prolonged standing in one position, or long walks. Headaches and body pain/aches (may feel flu-like); neck pain. Insomnia and frequent awakenings from sleep, chest pain and racing heart rate during sleep, excessive sweating. Shakiness/tremors especially with adrenaline surges. Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 06/02/2017. National Institutes of Health.

BOND, LT, MC, USNR, National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland A more recent article on persistent night sweats is available. Abstract Evaluation When History and Physical Are Unrevealing Abstract Evaluation When History and Physical Are Unrevealing Night sweats are a common outpatient complaint, yet literature on the subject is scarce. Tuberculosis and lymphoma are diseases in which night sweats are a dominant symptom, but these are infrequently found to be the cause of night sweats in modern practice. While these diseases remain important diagnostic considerations in patients with night sweats, other diagnoses to consider include human immunodeficiency virus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia, and several less common diseases. Antihypertensives, antipyretics, other medications, and drugs of abuse such as alcohol and heroin may cause night sweats. Serious causes of night sweats can be excluded with a thorough history, physical examination, and directed laboratory and radiographic studies. If a history and physical do not reveal a possible diagnosis, physicians should consider a purified protein derivative, complete blood count, human immunodeficiency virus test, thyroid-stimulating hormone test, erythrocyte sedimentation rate evaluation, chest radiograph, and possibly chest and abdominal computed tomographic scans and bone marrow biopsy. The symptom of night sweats is commonly encountered in clinical medicine, but there are no data regarding its actual frequency. Night sweats has been defined as drenching sweats that require the patient to change bedclothes. This definition, however, probably does not describe the majority of patients who may complain of the symptom, and not all reports or studies cited through this article use this strict definition. The key words “night sweats” and “nocturnal hyperhidrosis” were used to search the MEDLINE literature from 1966 to July 2001, , 13th ed. CD-ROM, and the January 1999 (PDR) Electronic Library CD-ROM. Abstracts for 338 citations in the MEDLINE literature were reviewed for articles, letters, and commentaries about diagnoses that had night sweats as a feature. There were 16 matches for night sweats in Harrison's and 11 pharmaceuticals with night sweats as a reported side effect in the PDR. Abstract Evaluation When History and Physical Are Unrevealing An extensive list of diagnostic considerations in patients with night sweats is provided in .  The history and physical examination are aimed at revealing associated symptoms that will narrow this broad differential diagnosis and guide additional studies. lists diagnostic actions to be considered based on findings from the history and physical.

In its pulmonary form, reactivation TB generally presents with cough in addition to the constitutional symptoms of weight loss and low-grade fever. Many patients experience night sweats several times per week. A history of (or risk factors for) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is important. The most common complaint with HIV infection is fever, with or without night sweats. This may be because of the virus or the result of HIV sequelae such as lymphoma or opportunistic infections. Most patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphoma have a history of fever, weight loss, and night sweats. AIDS-related infections might also cause night sweats, including complex (MAC) infection and cytomegalovirus (CMV) syndromes. MAC infection in patients with HIV typically presents with fever, weight loss, and night sweats. It is a late complication of HIV infection that generally occurs in patients with CD4 cell counts of less than 100 cells per mm. TB also can be present in a patient infected with HIV. In this population, patients often present in the classic manner with cough, fever, and night sweats. Sometimes, travel history is helpful in evaluating the potential for other infectious diseases. Persons with the chronic pulmonary form of histoplasmosis present similarly to those who have TB, with an increasing productive cough, weight loss, and night sweats. Persons with coccidioidomycosis may present with cough, fever, and night sweats. Risk factors for endocarditis also should be determined. The symptoms of infectious endocarditis are protean and include fever, chills, fatigue, sweats, and malaise. These night sweats may be related to nocturnal fever caused by transient bacteremia. Low-grade fever that may be associated with night sweats is the most common systemic symptom of Hodgkin's disease. High fluctuating fevers accompanied by drenching night sweats (Pel-Ebstein fevers) may persist for several weeks with Hodgkin's disease. Night sweats may be the only presenting complaint for some patients. One study of patients with Hodgkin's disease who had sweating as their only symptom found a correlation with unperceived elevations in body temperature, or minor febrile pulses. Occasionally, patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma also may experience night sweats. A history of recent upper respiratory infection may be significant because infectious mononucleosis (IM), usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus, may cause night sweats, particularly during the acute phase. In a study where the symptoms of IM were compared with other upper respiratory infections, night sweats were significantly more common in patients with IM. By the third week of illness, heterophile antibodies were positive in 90 percent of patients. If heterophile antibodies are not elevated, but the diagnosis is strongly suspected, IgM antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus viral capsid antigen (anti-VCA) may be measured, because they can be elevated for weeks to months after infection. Women in the appropriate age range should be asked about symptoms of menopause, because patients with ovarian failure may experience hot flushes. Some women may experience a predominance of these during nocturnal hours. An elevated follicle-stimulating hormone test may be helpful in diagnosing menopause when the history is unclear. Patients with diabetes experiencing nocturnal hypoglycemia may have night sweats without other hypoglycemic symptoms. This may be caused by missing a meal or performing unusually excessive exercise. Patients who are receiving large doses of evening insulin may be especially prone to nocturnal hypoglycemia. Risk factors for hypoglycemia may include tight diabetes control, renal insufficiency, polypharmacy, higher sulfonylurea or insulin doses, and advanced age. An association between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and night sweats has been suggested. Informal observations suggest that patients treated for GERD often have dramatic relief of their night sweats. Physicians should inquire about symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as nervousness, palpitations, weight loss, and menstrual irregularity. The heat intolerance of hyperthyroidism may lead to night sweats, especially when combined with over-bundling or an overheated room. Sleeping partners should be questioned about the patient's sleeping habits (snoring, apneic spells, and daytime sleepiness). Obstructive sleep apnea is a relatively common disorder affecting up to 4 percent of middle-aged men. It may be a common cause of heavy night sweats. Several medications may contribute to night sweats, but antipyretics are the most common. Acetaminophen and aspirin are cited as causes of night sweats. This is most likely a rebound effect as the antipyretic effects subside. Use of some antihypertensives, anti-depressants, tamoxifen (Nolvadex), leuprolide (Lupron), and niacin are possibly causal as well.  Alcohol use, particularly alcohol dependence, also may cause night sweats. The PDR search revealed 11 pharmaceutical agents that were labeled as having night sweats as a side effect .

Drugs with the Labeled Side Effect of Night Sweats Information from Physicians' desk reference. 53rd ed. Montvale, N.J.: Medical Economics, 1999. Directed inquiry of symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia, anxiety, depression, and rheumatologic diseases may be useful. While not specifically revealed in the searches, it is likely that any disease that results in autonomic overactivity (e.g., congestive heart failure via neurohumoral activation) may result in night sweats. Carcinoid syndrome should be a consideration if the patient (usually in the sixth to eighth decade of life) has a history of attacks of severe cyanotic flushing of the skin that lasts from minutes to days and is associated with other symptoms such as watery diarrhea, wheezing, hypotension, or edema. Symptoms are caused by a tumor that secretes serotonin and other biologically active substances. The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma should be considered for patients with paroxysms of headache, palpitations, and sweating—especially in combination with hypertension. The paroxysms typically last from minutes to hours and may occur with varying frequency from once per month to multiple times in a 24-hour period. On physical examination, the patient's vital signs (particularly temperature and blood pressure) and body habitus should be noted. Lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly may prompt an evaluation for possible lymphoma or leukemia. Lymph nodes in either form of lymphoma are generally nontender and firm. Most patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma present with cervical lymphadenopathy, while those with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma present with peripheral lymphadenopathy. Biopsy is essential for diagnosis. Signs of immunocompromise may include cachexia or oral candidiasis. The oropharynx should be examined for redundant tissue consistent with the findings in obstructive sleep apnea. A fine hand tremor, exophthalmos, eyelid lag, or hyperreflexia suggests hyperthyroidism. An elevated blood pressure in association with night sweats may prompt an evaluation for pheochromocytoma. Signs of endocarditis such as splinter hemorrhages (dark red linear streaks under the nails), Janeway lesions (small, nodular hemorrhages on palms and soles), Osler's nodes (small, tender nodules on finger or toe pads), and a heart murmur should be sought as well. Evaluation When History and Physical Are Unrevealing Abstract Evaluation When History and Physical Are Unrevealing If the history and physical examination fail to reveal the possible etiology of the patient's symptoms, consider obtaining a complete blood count, purified protein derivative test, chest radiograph, and thyroid-stimulating hormone test. These tests are widely available, not particularly costly, and help rule out many of the potential diagnoses. An HIV test and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) evaluation may be added if necessary . The ESR evaluation helps rule out disorders that may cause night sweats but otherwise are relatively silent early in their course, such as endocarditis and Takayasu's arteritis. Evaluation of a patient with night sweats and no associated symptoms. (CBC = complete blood count; ppd = purified protein derivative; CXR = chest radiograph, TSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone; HIV = human immunodeficiency virus; ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate; HACEK = aemophilus species, ctinobacillus, ardiobacterium, ikenella, ingella; CT = computed tomographic) Evaluation of a patient with night sweats and no associated symptoms. (CBC = complete blood count; ppd = purified protein derivative; CXR = chest radiograph, TSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone; HIV = human immunodeficiency virus; ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate; HACEK = aemophilus species, ctinobacillus, ardiobacterium, ikenella, ingella; CT = computed tomographic) An elevated ESR and positive blood cultures are present in more than 90 percent of cases of endocarditis. An echocardiogram also may assist in the evaluation of a patient with suspected endocarditis. Takayasu's arteritis is a chronic inflammatory disease involving the aorta and its branches. Its cause is unknown. It also has been called pulseless disease because of the physical examination finding of diminished pulses in the upper extremities. A patient with Takayasu's arteritis may present with malaise, fever, night sweats, arthralgias, and weight loss months before vessel involvement is noted. An elevated ESR is a characteristic, but nonspecific laboratory finding. Diagnosis would be confirmed by aortography. If the screening tests are normal and nocturnal GERD is suspected, a trial of antireflux measures may be considered. If the patient continues to complain of night sweats, a diary of the patient's temperature variations through the night may be helpful in revealing the presence or absence of febrile micropulses. Febrile pulses should reprompt a search for lymphoma or endocarditis. Blood cultures should be obtained to include cultures designated for the fastidious, gram-negative HACEK (aemophilus species,ctinobacillus, ardiobacterium, ikenella, and ingella) organisms, which are not found with routine culture methods. Computed tomographic scans of the chest and abdomen, and a bone marrow biopsy to evaluate for silent neoplastic or granulomatous disease would complete the work-up. If all studies are negative, the patient can be reassured that the night sweats are most likely benign (may be the result of over-bundling). The patient should be taught to do self lymph node examinations and report any changes noted in the absence of active infection. The patient should report development of any new symptoms and continue annual health examinations. Choose a single article, issue, or full-access subscription.

1f305a66-3644-4b2d-9c95-92b032999369,"The causes of illness in traditional Chinese medicine are determined by a number of factors. Some of these causes are considered external, as in the six pernicious influences: wind, cold, heat, dryness, dampness, and summer heat. Other causes are considered internal, as in the seven emotions: , joy, worry, pensiveness, sadness, , and shock. Other factors that play a role in the development of disease are , lifestyle, and accidents. When the body is healthy, its various substances and energies are in harmonious balance, both internally and in relation to the external environment. When this innate vitality (true qi) and (wei qi) are strong, it is difficult for externally contracted disease to gain a foothold, especially if the invading pathogen is weak.  However, an exceptionally strong pathogen can overwhelm even a healthy person, especially if the person has been weakened by , , overwork, or other lifestyle factors. For example, a person with a strong immune system might avoid catching a , even if a sick person on him. However, if he drinks a test tube full of the same , his strong immune system will be no match for such an onslaught. On the other hand, a person with very weak wei qi can catch whatever pathogen may be around due to his or her exceptionally weak defenses. This is the reason the elderly and young children are most at risk during epidemics. This interplay between wei qi (also called good qi) and pathogenic factors (evil qi) determines whether a person gets sick, how the body responds to illness, and how long it takes for health to return. Go to the next page to learn about the six pernicious influences in traditional Chinese medicine. For more about traditional Chinese medicine, treatment, cures, beliefs, and other interesting topics, see: How to Treat Common Ailments with Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine for Coughs, Colds, Flu, and Allergies Traditional Chinese Medicine for the Digestive System The six pernicious influences, also known as the six pathogenic factors, six excesses, or six evils, are the causes of disease that often arise from outside . They are wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and summer heat. Although Western medicine recognizes only and bacteria as external pathogens, the Chinese observed that the body mirrors certain climatic conditions. Although a of ""wind and cold invading the "" might sound primitive, this type of diagnosis accurately describes the way a certain type of pathogenic factor behaves inside the human body. The wind symptoms act just like wind in nature: They come and go, often without warning. Similarly, the cold symptoms act as they do in nature: they cause contraction, they slow functions down, and they make the person feel cold. The high degree of effectiveness in treating this type of disorder (such as with herbs that ""repel wind and scatter cold"") is proof that the diagnosis is much more than a mere philosophical idea. Although Western medicine might be able to isolate the virus causing this condition, it still has no safe and effective way of treating the virus, other than relieving some of the symptoms it causes. On the other hand, thousands of years of trial and error through observation of nature and the human body have led to numerous effective treatments in Chinese medicine for viral infections that fit this pattern. When learning about and discussing the various internal ""climates"" of the human body, it is important to remember that they may not always match the external climate. It is quite common for a person to develop symptoms of cold and dampness in rainy winter weather, but it is also possible to develop heat symptoms under the same weather conditions. Illness is the combination of the particular pathogen involved and a person's unique response to it. It is also possible for the pernicious influences to arise from internal causes. In this case, they usually result from a chronic internal imbalance. Descriptions of the six pernicious influences follow. Go to the next page to learn about wind, the first pernicious influence in traditional Chinese medicine. For more about traditional Chinese medicine, treatment, cures, beliefs, and other interesting topics, see: How to Treat Common Ailments with Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine for Coughs, Colds, Flu, and Allergies Traditional Chinese Medicine for the Digestive System The pernicious influence of wind is considered the major cause of illness in traditional Chinese patterns of disharmony. It combines readily with other pathogens, giving rise to syndromes known as wind cold, wind heat, and wind dampness. This pathogenic factor possesses the qualities of wind in nature, appearing without warning and constantly changing. Considered a yang form of evil qi (a pathogenic factor), it often attacks the upper body, head, , and . Wind causes movement, so it is usually involved when there are symptoms of twitching, spasms, or shaking. The organ most often affected by external wind is the ; internal wind most commonly is related to an imbalance in the liver. In this syndrome, the pernicious influence of wind combines with that of cold. The person experiences symptoms of chills, (which is less severe than the chills), , , nasal congestion, and stiffness and pain in the shoulders, upper back, neck, and occipital area (back of the head). Cold causes objects to contract, and its effects in the body are no different. It causes chills, and the shivering causes the muscles to become tight and stiff. Although actual shivering may not occur, the person has difficulty staying warm, even when dressed properly for the conditions. Wind cold is traditionally treated with warm, diaphoretic (sweat-inducing) herbs to disperse the cold and repel the wind. Caused by a combination of pathogens, this syndrome is seen typically in the or . The person may have symptoms of red face, high fever, sore throat, red eyes, thirst, red tongue, and a rapid pulse. Treatment for wind heat syndrome includes herbs that clear heat and repel wind. is a manifestation of this pattern. Like dampness in nature, which is persistent and requires time to eradicate, the dampness pathogenic influence is difficult to cure and takes some time to resolve. The influence of wind also causes the pain to migrate from joint to joint, sometimes disappearing for a while only to reappear without warning. Treatment for this syndrome includes herbs that drain dampness and improve circulation of qi and blood through the affected areas. Moxibustion therapy -- the application of heat -- is particularly helpful in this situation. This is a sudden attack of edema (swelling due to severe fluid retention), usually from , , or acute nephritis (inflammation of the kidney). Diaphoretic (sweat-inducing) or diuretic (urine-producing) herbs are used along with and moxibustion to treat this condition. The herbs help the body eliminate fluid, moxibustion helps the body metabolize fluids and improves circulation, and acupuncture moves stagnant fluids and expels the pathogenic factor. This category includes any skin condition that appears suddenly. Since dampness often plays a role in this condition, it can be difficult to treat. Treatment can include herbs that ""scatter wind, clear heat, and drain dampness."" For example, if the is red and burns, herbs that clear heat are also used. Monitoring the diet is always an essential part of treatment. , in particular, should be avoided in skin conditions, since it heats up the blood, further increasing the wind. This is an internal condition of the liver that can result from a long-term imbalance; the usual chronic patterns are liver yin deficiency or deficiency. Signs of this condition are various abnormal body movements, such as twitching, shaking, convulsions, and spasms. The liver is in charge of the smooth movement of qi and blood in the body as well as harmonious movement within the body. An imbalance in the liver impairs this function, producing abnormal movement, and the influence of wind stirs this movement at unpredictable times. If heat is too extreme, it can cause a sudden collapse, as in . It can also cause sudden convulsions, such as those that occur in children with a high fever. Compare this internal process with what happens in nature when rising hot air causes gusts of high wind. Since the liver stores blood, a deficiency of blood affects the liver, leading to wind. This condition can produce numbness and cramping. When the blood is tonified, these symptoms disappear. Go to the next page to learn how the cold is a pernicious influence in traditional Chinese medicine. For more about traditional Chinese medicine, treatment, cures, beliefs, and other interesting topics, see: How to Treat Common Ailments with Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine for Coughs, Colds, Flu, and Allergies Traditional Chinese Medicine for the Digestive System The cold pathogenic factor is considered a yin evil qi. Its nature is to slow movement down, causing tightness, contraction, stagnation, and impaired circulation. When it is an external pathogenic factor, cold can attack the skin, muscles, and lungs. When it is an internal pathogenic factor, cold can cause an impairment in the normal functions of the spleen, stomach, and . In combination with the pathogenic factor of wind, cold attacks the exterior of the body and the , causing chills, lack of sweating, occipital headache (pain at the base of the skull), upper body aches, tight shoulders and neck, and a congested nose. The influence of wind causes the symptoms to appear suddenly and affect the upper body, while cold causes the muscles to contract, causing the stiffness and pain. Nasal secretions are clear -- another sign of cold. The treatment principle is to repel the wind and disperse the cold with warm diaphoretic herbs, acupuncture, and moxibustion. Traditionally known as cold bi (blockage) pain, this condition typically takes the form of body aches or joint pain that is relieved by warmth. The most common Western diagnosis for this pattern is . Since the syndrome is caused by cold, the joint may actually feel cold to the touch, and the pain typically gets worse in cold weather. The Chinese treatment principle is to increase circulation and warm the acupuncture meridians through which qi and blood circulate by means of moxibustion, acupuncture, and herbs. In this externally caused disorder, cold causes digestive symptoms such as abdominal pain, clear vomit, and watery diarrhea. Although it usually accompanies an externally contracted cold or stomach bacteria or (what we commonly refer to as stomach """"), this syndrome can also be caused by eating cold foods such as ice cream. The liver meridian passes through the genital area, and this condition is a manifestation of cold in that meridian. Symptoms include or shrinking and pain. Moxibustion, acupuncture, and herbs can effectively correct this imbalance in a short time. If a person has an underlying deficiency of spleen yang (deficiency in energy and heat needed in order to digest ), cold can severely impair digestive function. Symptoms of spleen yang deficiency include watery stools with undigested food, cold extremities, edema, and a slow pulse. When a person with this underlying deficiency is also affected by external cold pathogens, the imbalance is especially difficult to eliminate. Treatment first expels the cold pathogenic factor. Then it tonifies the yang aspect of the spleen and kidneys to bring about a long-term increase in the body's basic , or its ability to maintain the heat needed for proper digestion, which is known in traditional Chinese medicine as life-gate (metabolic) fire. Spleen yang deficiency is treated with moxibustion and warming herbs that tonify spleen yang. Since the kidneys are the source of yang metabolic fire for the entire body, a deficiency in kidney yang can make the individual especially prone to cold. The symptoms of kidney yang deficiency include an inability to stay warm, cold extremities, low sex drive, frequent urination, edema (fluid retention), and pain in the low back. The yang deficiency can be corrected with long-term application of moxibustion and consumption of herbs that tonify kidney yang, thereby increasing metabolic fire. Go to the next page to learn about heat and dampness in traditional Chinese medicine. For more about traditional Chinese medicine, treatment, cures, beliefs, and other interesting topics, see: How to Treat Common Ailments with Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine for Coughs, Colds, Flu, and Allergies Traditional Chinese Medicine for the Digestive System Heat and dampness, two of the six pernicious influences in traditional Chinese medicine, have opposite effects on the body. While heat causes increased activity, dampness brings stagnation to a system. Each of these influences has its own set of syndromes associated with its effects. Heat, or fire, is a yang pernicious influence. As in nature, heat causes expansion and in­creased activity. When out of balance, heat can lead to irritability, fever, and inflammatory conditions. By its nature, heat rises, appearing as a red face and eyes, , and . If heat affects the heart or liver, anger may result. Heat tends to affect the body fluids, leading to thirst, , and dark urine. Since it can produce wind, heat can lead to spasms. This very common condition appears mostly as the common cold and flu. Wind combines with heat to produce symptoms of , sore throat, thirst, , sweating, rapid pulse, and sometimes a red tip of the tongue. The treatment principle is to repel the wind and clear the heat with and herbal formulas. Symptoms of this yang excess condition are, typically, irritability, thirst, dry throat, concentrated (dark or burning) urine, constipation, red tongue with a yellow coat, and a full, rapid pulse. Other symptoms depend on the organ affected. For example, heart fire produces severe emotional disturbances; stomach fire can cause ; liver fire might stir up extreme anger; lung fire might bring about an accumulation of yellow mucus in the . In all cases, the treatment is to clear the excess heat with herbs and with manipulation of acupuncture points that have an affinity for the organ affected. This syndrome is caused by a deficiency in the yin, cooling aspect of an organ; the resulting imbalance causes heat to flare up. The general symptoms of deficiency heat are red cheeks, night sweats, irritability, chronic inflammation, red tongue with no coat, and a thin, rapid pulse. Other symptoms depend on the organ affected. When the kidneys have deficiency heat, chronic urinary tract infections can occur; deficiency heat in the lungs -- which can arise from cigarette -- can lead to a chronic dry ; and the heat from heart yin deficiency can cause insomnia. In nature, dampness soaks the ground and everything that comes in contact with it, and stagnation results. Once something becomes damp, it can take a long time for it to dry out again, especially in wet weather. The yin pathogenic influence of dampness has similar qualities: It is persistent and heavy, and it can be difficult to resolve. A person who spends a lot of time in the rain, lives in a damp environment, or sleeps on the ground may be susceptible to external dampness. Similarly, a person who eats large amounts of , cold foods and drinks, greasy foods, and sweets is prone to imbalances of internal dampness. Dampness has both tangible and intangible aspects. Tangible dampness includes phlegm, edema (fluid retention), and discharges. Intangible dampness includes a person's subjective feelings of heaviness and dizziness. A ""slippery"" pulse and a greasy tongue coating usually accompany both types of dampness. In general, symptoms of dampness in the body include water retention, swelling, feelings of heaviness, coughing or vomiting phlegm, and skin rashes that ooze or are crusty (as in ). Since dampness is heavy, it has a tendency to sink downward to affect the lower parts of the body: A person may experience a feeling of sinking or heaviness, and swelling frequently affects the legs. These characteristics are the opposite of wind, which has a tendency to affect the upper part of the body. When dampness combines with heat, the condition of damp heat develops, which can cause such symptoms as dark burning urine, sticky foul-smelling stools, yellow vaginal discharges, and . This form of the is characterized by chills, headache, afternoon fever, nausea, and . A person may describe feeling as if a wet towel is wrapped around the head. Treatment includes moxibustion and aromatic herbs that repel wind and drain dampness. This condition is characterized by a dull and heavy pain and numbness that can persist in certain joints. Rheumatic pain that gets worse in damp weather is a good example of this type of imbalance. The condition tends to be chronic and resistant to treatment. Treatment with acupuncture and moxibustion can relieve the stiffness and pain. Herbs that clear wind damp, such as mulberry branches (sang zhi) and twigs (gui zhi), are used to decrease swelling and improve circulation, following the Chinese principle of using ""branches (tree limbs) to treat branches (body limbs)."" This condition includes any skin inflammation that also has a weepy, damp nature, such as eczema, skin ulcers, and allergic reactions that produce a discharge (skin eruptions that ooze or that are crusty). Herbs are used both internally and in the form of topical poultices. Typically due to an imbalance in the spleen, symptoms of internal dampness include , diarrhea, lack of appetite, undigested food in the stools, fatigue, and possible edema in the abdominal area. When a person coughs up mucus right after eating ice cream, it shows that a cold spleen produces dampness. Since excessive dampness in the spleen is stored in the lungs, a damp spleen can often lead to frequent colds and allergies. Treatment of internal dampness focuses on eliminating the dampness with diuretic herbs and activating the spleen with tonifying herbs. Go to the next page to learn about dryness and summer heat in traditional Chinese medicine. For more about traditional Chinese medicine, treatment, cures, beliefs, and other interesting topics, see: How to Treat Common Ailments with Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine for Coughs, Colds, Flu, and Allergies Traditional Chinese Medicine for the Digestive System Dryness and summer heat, the last of the six pernicious influences in traditional Chinese medicine, both have deleterious effects on the body's moistures. Associated syndromes include , , , and excessive . Dryness is a yang pernicious influ­ence. It is associated with the autumn season due to the lack of humidity in most areas at that time of year. Its influence on the body is drying and astringent. It can easily deplete the body fluids, causing constipation, dry , concentrated urine, dryness in the throat and nose, thirst, and dry skin. Dryness typically enters the body through the nose and mouth, quickly affecting the . This syndrome is viewed traditionally as the leftover heat from summer teaming up with the dryness of autumn to attack the body. Symptoms include , headache, thirst, dry mouth, dry nose, dry eyes, dry cough with scanty mucus, red tongue, and a rapid pulse. Treatment involves the use of moistening herbs combined with herbs that repel wind. are considered healing foods in conditions of dryness; they are very moistening and are readily available in the autumn season. Traditionally considered an illness of late autumn, this pattern has symptoms of chills, mild fever, lack of sweating, dry cough, nasal congestion, dry and itchy throat, and a wiry and floating pulse. Treatment is very similar to that for wind cold, with the addition of some moistening herbs. In this chronic condition, the body fluids have been depleted over time. It can be both a result or cause of yin or deficiency, and it is more commonly seen in the elderly. In its more acute form, internal dryness can result from the depletion of body fluids due to sweating, vomiting, , or bleeding. Prolonged internal or external heat usually has a detrimental long-term effect on body fluids, depleting them. Typical symptoms of internal dryness are dry, itchy skin, thirst, constipation, and a chronic shortage of body fluids. Treatment depends on the particular organ and vital substance affected by the imbalance. Yin or blood tonics are typically employed along with herbs that assist the body in retaining fluids. Summer heat is a yang pernicious influence that typically occurs in the heat and humidity of summer. It is ""uprising and spread out,"" meaning it affects the head, causing thirst, red face, and headache, and it causes a person to lie down with the limbs spread out. The excessive sweating also leads to dark, concentrated urine, and depletion of the body's yin can occur. The extreme heat also affects the , leading to restlessness or even coma in severe cases such as . When summer heat combines with dampness due to humidity and overconsumption of sugary drinks, such as , the spleen is also affected. This leads to a loss of appetite, , vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. Treatment of summer heat is complex, depending on the organs and additional pathogenic factors involved. Usually, herbs are used that clear excess heat from within the body along with herbs that moisten the interior. Two common foods that are very effective in the treatment of this pattern are (xi gua) and mung beans (lu dou). There is also a point behind the knees associated with clearing heat; holding ice behind the knees helps the body cool down quickly. When digestive disturbances occur due to a combination of dampness and summer heat, cooling herbs are combined with herbs that clear turbid dampness, such as (huo xiang). On the next page, you'll learn about the seven emotions in traditional Chinese medicine. For more about traditional Chinese medicine, treatment, cures, beliefs, and other interesting topics, see: How to Treat Common Ailments with Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine for Coughs, Colds, Flu, and Allergies Traditional Chinese Medicine for the Digestive System Each organ has a preferred internal environment, which supports its optimum functional abilities. The spleen is especially vulnerable to the influence of cold and dampness, for example, both in the external climate and in the diet. Since the spleen is the most important organ involved in digestion, this preference can be seen when a person eats too much cold, raw food. For example, ice cream is cold and it promotes dampness since it is both sweet and a dairy product. A person who eats too much ice cream, especially in cold weather, often has poor digestion and loose stools. When the spleen is cold and damp, it also causes the body to produce excessive mucus, which then overwhelms the lungs, leading to frequent colds, asthma, and allergies. (If you have ever coughed up mucus after eating ice cream, you have experienced the way cold produces dampness.) On the other hand, hot, cooked foods nourish the spleen, especially when combined with warming, drying herbs such as or black pepper. Eating foods such as this, especially in cold weather, leads to strong digestion, and the body produces less mucus, making the person less susceptible to colds and other respiratory ailments. If an organ's optimum functional environment is maintained, the organ will perform efficiently, contributing to the health of the entire body. The seven basic emotions related to organ function are anger, joy, worry, pensiveness, sadness, , and shock (fright). Although the mind/body connection has been acknowledged only relatively recently in Western medicine, the interaction of emotions with the physical body is an essential aspect of traditional Chinese medicine. Each organ has a corresponding emotion; imbalance of this emotion can affect the organ's function. For example, prolonged anger can lead to an imbalance in the liver. At the same time, liver imbalances can produce symptoms of anger, often leading to a self-perpetuating cycle. In discussing the emotional aspect of the disease process, it is important to remember that it is normal to experience the full range of emotions. It is only when a particular emotion is experienced over a prolonged period or with particular intensity that it becomes a source of imbalance. It is obviously important for a person with severe emotional problems to get professional help from a trained psychotherapist. But even in these cases, the therapy is more effective when the corresponding organ imbalance is rectified. is especially effective in treating disorders of the emotions. Even when it is not completely effective in treating a physical ailment, it almost always brings about a state of emotional peacefulness. Anger is associated with the liver. By its nature, anger causes qi to rise, leading to a red face and red eyes, , and . This matches the pattern of liver fire rising. Anger can also cause liver qi to ""attack the spleen,"" producing lack of appetite, , and (often experienced by those people who argue at the dinner table or eat while driving). In a more long-term view, suppressed anger or frustration often causes liver qi to become stagnant; this might result in or menstrual disorders. It is interesting to note that people who take herbs to release stagnant liver qi often experience bouts of anger as the stagnation is relieved. The anger passes as the condition clears. Similarly, anger and irritability are often the determining factor in diagnosing liver qi stagnation. Many people are relieved to know their rage has a physiologic basis. It is essential to avoid drinking when treating anger-related liver disorders, as coffee heats the liver and greatly intensifies the condition. The emotion of joy is connected with the . A disorder related to joy may sound perplexing, since most people want as much joy in their life as possible. The disorders from this emotion are not caused by happiness; rather, the imbalance comes from too much excitement or stimulation, or sudden good news that comes as a shock to the system. When evaluating levels, psychologists look at all sources of stress, both positive and negative. Clearly the or a job loss is a significant source of stress. However, a or job promotion, while a happy occasion, is also a source of stress. A person who is constantly on the go, partying, and living a life of excess can eventually develop heart imbalances with palpitations, , and . A person with heart imbalances may also exhibit emotional symptoms, since the heart is the seat of the spirit (shen). A person with extreme disturbances of heart shen might be seen chattering happily to himself with outbursts of . Such behavior results from the heart organ's inability to provide a stable resting place for the spirit. This type of imbalance is treated with acupuncture along the heart meridian. Herbal treatments consist of formulas that nourish heart blood or yin. If heart fire disturbs the spirit, herbs that clear heat from the heart are used. A very common emotion in our stress-filled society, worry can deplete the energy of the spleen. This can cause digestive disturbances and eventually lead to : A weakened spleen cannot efficiently turn food into qi, and the lungs are unable to extract qi from air efficiently. A person who worries too much ""carries the weight of the world on her shoulders,"" a good description of how a person feels when her weak spleen qi leads to dampness. Treatment would include moxa and herbs that strengthen the spleen, allowing a person the energy to deal with life's problems instead of dwelling on them. Too much thinking or obsessing about a topic can also deplete the spleen, causing a stagnation of its qi. A person with this condition may exhibit such symptoms as , forgetting to eat, and bloating after eating. In time, the person may develop a pale complexion from a deficiency of spleen qi. This can eventually affect the heart, causing the person to dream about the same subjects at night. Students are often affected by this imbalance; the standard treatment is use of herbs that tonify heart blood and spleen qi. Sadness or grief affects the , producing fatigue, shortness of breath, crying, or depression. Treatment for this condition involves acupuncture to points along the lung and kidney meridians. Often, herbal formulas are used that tonify the qi or yin of the lungs. The emotion of fear is related to the . This relationship can readily be seen when extreme fear causes a person to urinate uncontrollably. In children, this can also manifest as , which psychologists have linked to insecurity and anxiety. Long-term anxiety due to worrying about the future can deplete the kidneys of yin, yang, and qi, eventually leading to chronic weakness. Treatment involves tonifying the kidneys with yin or yang tonics, depending on the particular symptoms. Shock is especially debilitating to the kidneys and heart. The ""fight or flight"" reaction causes an excessive release of adrenaline from the that sit on top of the kidneys. This causes the heart to respond with palpitations, anxiety, and insomnia. Chronic stress from shock can be very debilitating to the entire system, causing a wide range of problems. Severe shock can have a long-term effect on the heart shen, as is evident in victims of syndrome. Treatment involves psychotherapy, herbs that calm the spirit and nourish the heart and kidneys, and regular acupuncture treatments. Go to the next page to learn about the effect of poor dietary habits in traditional Chinese medicine. For more about traditional Chinese medicine, treatment, cures, beliefs, and other interesting topics, see: How to Treat Common Ailments with Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine for Coughs, Colds, Flu, and Allergies Traditional Chinese Medicine for the Digestive System Poor dietary habits are a major cause of disease. Since is the medicine we take most often, many illnesses can be quite difficult to treat unless changes occur in a person's . Some of the eating and drinking habits that can lead to disease are explained below. It is important to consider the time it takes food to pass through the stomach. Simple can leave the stomach after about 20 minutes, while more concentrated , starches, and may take 4 to 5 hours. If the stomach contains partially digested food when the person eats another meal, the digestive process can be seriously impaired. This would be similar to getting a small fire started with kindling and then dumping a load of logs on the fire. Even though logs are good fuel, the fledgling fire was not ready for so much fuel. Conversely, if a person waits too long between meals, secretion of digestive juices stops. This would be akin to letting the kindling go out before putting logs on the fire. We need to eat when the stomach signals true hunger. Consumption of liquids is also an important cause of imbalance. If a person drinks a large glass of cold after a meal, the digestive juices become diluted. (The stomach secretes just enough to digest a particular meal.) Also, the stomach needs a certain amount of heat for the chemical reactions of the digestive process to take place; cold liquids slow the reaction. It is best for the contents of the stomach to be a soup-like consistency, since too much dryness can also disturb digestion. Achieving this consistency can be accomplished by sipping liquids, preferably warm, along with a meal. In China and other Asian countries, it is common to serve soup with almost every meal. If a person desires cool water, the water should be consumed at least half an hour before a meal or three hours after a meal, when the stomach is empty. Foods have different energetic qualities; something appropriate for one type of person or climate might be unhealthy for another body type or weather pattern. For example, cold and raw foods are very healthy in hot weather or for a person who has too much internal heat. Conversely, these foods can deplete the spleen qi and yang and cause dampness in cold weather or in persons who have too much internal cold. In coastal California, for example, residents experience all four seasons in a twenty-four hour day. It might be foggy and cold in the morning, making a of hot grains or soup an appropriate choice. By midday, it can be sunny and hot, a good time to consume fruits and salads. Similarly, spicy food is appropriate for cold weather or persons who are yang deficient, but it can cause imbalance in hot weather, especially in persons who have internal heat. This goes to show that no food is always healthy; it is a matter of choosing foods that match the internal and external climates. Certain foods, such as sweets or , are meant to be used infrequently and in small quantities; overconsumption can cause a wide range of problems. Malnutrition due to undereating can lead to a chronic deficiency of qi and . While more common in developing countries, this condition is also seen in developed countries in conditions of poverty and in persons who suffer from emotional imbalances and substance abuse. Treatment includes herbs that tonify qi and blood, along with an improvement in nutritional intake. In the West, overconsumption is a far more common problem, leading to a high incidence of , , , , and . In traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture is used to reduce cravings; dietary and lifestyle counseling are also important. The human body is designed to process a wide variety of foods to meet our needs. Fad diets or addictions to a narrow range of foods can be debilitating. Some essential nutrients are likely to be missing from a narrow diet. By eating a wide assortment of different-colored vegetables, whole grains, and proteins, we can receive the we need to function at a high level of wellness. Although more common in developing or tropical countries, parasites are a problem all over the world. They can wreak havoc on the digestive organs, damaging the qi of the spleen and stomach. Herbs that kill parasites are quite strong, so it is important to have an accurate diagnosis through a stool test before beginning treatment. Other sources of contamination are toxins produced by bacterial contamination in the course of processing food. Meats are especially susceptible to this sort of pathogen; you should always cook meat thoroughly to kill virulent microorganisms. Water-borne pathogens are another source of disease, and of questionable quality should always be boiled. Treatment of pathogenic microorganisms depends on the type of pathogen involved. In general, gastrointestinal distress caused by microorganisms can be treated with herbal medicines. Although herb formulas can be remarkably effective, they should be considered a first-aid measure until a person can see their health care practitioner.

Moderate exercise strengthens the and and stimulates the flow of blood and lymph, the body's filtration system, which filters out toxins. In fact, exercise is the only way to pump lymph through the body, since lymph isn't powered by the heart. Some of the traditional Chinese ideas about lack of exercise are expressed in the ancient texts: When a person oversleeps, he typically feels tired all day. This refers to the fact that lack of exercise causes the to atrophy. Stagnant water easily becomes spoiled, and stagnant qi and blood can lead to many different illnesses. On the other hand, too much activity can hurt the body. This is especially true if a person is fighting a or is already depleted and in need of rest. In these cases, almost any exercise can drain the qi. Some of the traditional ideas about excessive activity: Since the eyes are intimately connected with the liver, excessive use of the eyes can drain that organ. The liver stores the blood, so stressing it in this way depletes the blood supply. People who must stand all day at work, especially on a concrete floor, can vouch for the truth of this statement. Some of the conditions that can be caused by standing too much are sore feet, painful joints, and . is a very common condition, especially among runners. Computer work and repetitive stress injuries are also frequent causes of tendon injury. ""Too much work for the heart injures the spirit (shen)."" Since the heart is the seat of the mind, too much mental work affects the spirit. It is important to get sufficient physical exercise to avoid this imbalance. The liver blood can also be depleted by too much work, as can be seen in marathon runners who no longer have . When they ease up on their workouts, their menstrual periods usually return. ""Too much work for the kidneys hurts the essence (jing)."" Each individual has a different capacity for sexual activity, depending on their age and their constitution. Overindulgence in sexual activity, however, can lead to a depletion of the , causing fatigue and chronic . Go to the next page to learn about other causes of illness in traditional Chinese medicine.

We inherit our prenatal qi and essence from our parents. This genetic inheritance is outside our control, and it can be the determining factor in a number of ailments. For example, if a man's grandfather and father both died of in their 40s, he will be much more likely to develop heart disease than a person with a similar lifestyle whose ancestors lived into their 90s. It is necessary for a person with a weak inherited constitution to pursue a very healthy lifestyle to avoid disease. These causes of disease are self-explanatory. However, a person with strong qi and will recover from injuries much faster than a person who is deficient in these vital substances. Traditional Chinese medicine is especially effective in treating injuries of all types. This is especially common with Western medicine, where the list of possible side effects for a drug might fill two pages of text. A recent study found that in some hospitals, as many as 30 percent of patients at any given time are receiving treatment for the side effects of the drugs they're taking. Herbal medicine can be very helpful in reducing many of these side effects; patients in Chinese hospitals, for example, are routinely prescribed herbs to help counteract the side effects of chemotherapy. Although herbal medicine is exceptionally safe, side effects can occur, although they are rarely serious. For example, many herbs are hard to digest and can cause loose stools. An herbalist takes this into account when preparing a formula for a patient, adding specific herbs to counteract these side effects. If herbs are improperly prescribed, on the other hand,the side effects can be more severe. For example, a person who suffers from should never be given the herb Ephedra (ma huang), since it can cause a rise in blood pressure. For this reason, traditional Chinese medical texts also list formulas that are used to counteract the effects of improper treatments.

Symptoms vary depending on the areas affected. Common signs and symptoms of the different types of diabetic neuropathy include: bladder problems, such as incomplete bladder emptying What are the different types of diabetic neuropathy? The term neuropathy is used to describe several types of nerve damage. In people with diabetes, there are four main types of neuropathy. The most common form of neuropathy is peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy usually affects the feet and legs, but it can also affect the arms or hands. Symptoms are varied, and can be mild to severe.

You’ll typically feel full too quickly and be unable to finish a meal. Delayed digestion often makes it more difficult to control blood glucose levels, too, with frequently alternating high and low readings. Also, symptoms of , such as sweating and heart palpitations, can go undetected in people with autonomic neuropathy.

What Happens in Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? What Are the Signs & Symptoms of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? What Causes Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? Who Gets Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? How Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Diagnosed? How Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Treated? What Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder that can make someone feel faint or dizzy. It happens when the autonomic nervous system (ANS) doesn't work as it should. The autonomic nervous system is the body's ""autopilot"" system, controlling things like heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing. The autonomic nervous system problems seen in POTS (also called postural tachycardia syndrome) can affect children and adults. Symptoms vary from mild to disabling. What Happens in Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? The autonomic nervous system keeps blood pressure at the right level for the brain no matter what position a person is in — standing (vertical), lying flat on the back (called supine), and sitting or reclining (called recumbent). Usually when a person stands, the nerves of the autonomic nervous system tell blood vessels in the lower body to constrict (tighten). The tightening vessels work against gravity to keep blood from collecting in the legs. This automatic response makes sure the brain has enough blood flow to work well. If there is not enough blood flow to the brain, a person may feel lightheaded or pass out every time they stand. In POTS, the autonomic nervous system doesn't work in the usual way, so the blood vessels don't tighten enough to make sure there is enough blood flow to the brain. To try to keep enough blood flowing to the brain, the autonomic nervous system makes the beat a lot faster instead. What Are the Signs & Symptoms of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? POTS is named for an unusual jump in the heart's beating speed that happens when a person stands. Other symptoms that can happen with POTS include: heart palpitations (feeling the heart beat or race) lightheadedness (almost passing out; vision tunnels or goes gray or dark) Most POTS symptoms happen only when standing or changing to a standing position. But these may happen without standing: sweating without a cause (such as exercise or warm weather) What Causes Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? POTS might first be noticed after a viral infection or an injury. But it's hard to tell if one of these caused POTS or just happened around the same time that POTS became a problem. Research to learn more about the cause of POTS is underway. Who Gets Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)? POTS affects more girls than boys, and is more common when one or both parents had POTS. It often begins in the early or mid-teens. How Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Diagnosed? There's no single test to diagnose POTS. Doctors start by doing a complete physical exam and taking a . POTS causes a heart rate increase of 40 or more beats per minute within 10 minutes of when someone moves from a supine (lying down) position to a standing one. The heart rate goes up dramatically, with little if any drop in blood pressure. Doctors can measure this easily. Sometimes, doctors do a ""tilt-table test."" In this test, a person is strapped to a table, then tilted from a supine (lying on the back) position into a standing position while heart rate and blood pressure are monitored. Doctors also make sure the problem isn't due to anything besides the autonomic nervous system. Depending on the symptoms, tests might be done on other parts of the body. These might check the blood, heart, brain, eyes, ears, kidneys, muscles, nerves, hormones, digestive tract, and more. Typically, a diagnosis of POTS is confirmed when symptoms have lasted for several months and no other causes are found. If someone has POTS, the medical team will look for reasons that the autonomic nervous system doesn't respond normally to standing. Finding an answer can help treatments work well. How Is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Treated? POTS is a chronic (long-term) problem. So doctors try to prevent and manage the things that cause it. That way, a child or teen doesn't have to take medicines for a long time.  a slow increase in exercise, starting with seated, reclined, or horizontal exercises (such as rowing, recumbent bicycling, and swimming) raising the head of the bed so some pressure stays in the blood vessels in the legs during sleep psychological counseling to help manage stress and choices that trigger symptoms The autonomic nervous system is involved in many body functions, so managing all the symptoms related to it can be hard. Sometimes, patients try a few different treatments to find what works well without unpleasant side effects. Multiple doctor's visits may be needed to find the best combination of treatments that improve symptoms. POTS symptoms usually improve over time. Often, they'll completely disappear as kids grow. If a clear and treatable cause is corrected, the symptoms are likely to go away more quickly. Note: All information is for educational purposes only.

Claudia Chaves, MD, is board-certified in cerebrovascular disease and neurology with a subspecialty certification in vascular neurology. The autonomic nervous system regulates a variety of body process that takes place without conscious effort. The autonomic system is the part of the that is responsible for regulating involuntary body functions, such as heartbeat, blood flow, breathing, and digestion. This system is further divided into three branches: the sympathetic system, the parasympathetic system, and the enteric nervous system.﻿ The autonomic nervous system is also made up of a third component known as the which is confined to the gastrointestinal tract. The parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system helps maintain normal body functions and conserves physical resources. This division also performs such tasks as controlling the bladder, slowing down heart rate, and constricting eye pupils. The sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system regulates the responses. This division also performs such tasks as relaxing the bladder, speeding up heart rate, and dilating eye pupils. The autonomic nervous system operates by receiving information from the environment and from other parts of the body. The sympathetic and parasympathetic systems tend to have opposing actions in which one system will stimulate a response where the other will inhibit it.﻿ Traditionally, stimulation has been thought to take place through the sympathetic system while inhibition was thought to occur via the parasympathetic system. However many exceptions to this have been found. Today, the sympathetic system is viewed as a quickly responding system that mobilizes the body for action where the parasympathetic system is believed to act much more slowly to dampen responses. For example, the sympathetic nervous system will act to raise blood pressure while the parasympathetic nervous system will act to lower it. The two systems work in conjunction to manage the body’s responses depending upon the situation and need. If, for example, you are facing a threat and need to flee, the sympathetic system will quickly mobilize your body to take action. Once the threat has passed, the parasympathetic system will then start to dampen these responses, slowly returning your body to its normal, resting state. The autonomic system controls a variety of internal processes including:﻿ Production of body fluids including sweat and saliva The autonomic nerve pathways connect different organs to the brain stem or spinal cord. There are also two key neurotransmitters, or chemical messengers, that are important for communication within the autonomic nervous system: is often used in the parasympathetic system to have an inhibiting effect. often works within the sympathetic system to have a stimulating effect on the body. When the parasympathetic and sympathetic components of the autonomic nervous systems become out of sync, people can experience an autonomic disorder, also called dysautonomia.  There are numerous types of autonomic disorders, each with its own unique set of symptoms, including:﻿ Understanding Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction These disorders can occur alone, or as a result of other conditions that cause disruption in the autonomic nervous system, including: Discover How Doctors Diagnose and Treat Dysautonomia If you or someone you love is experiencing disruptions in the autonomic nervous system, you may experience one or more of the following symptoms. Some people experience one cluster of symptoms at one time, and another set of symptoms at other times. The symptoms can be fleeting and unpredictable or triggered by specific situations or actions, like after ingesting certain foods or after standing up quickly.﻿ Understanding Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction Diagnosis of an autonomic disorder requires a doctor's evaluation, which may include a physical examination, recording blood pressure when the patient is both lying down and standing, testing of the sweat response, and an electrocardiogram. Diagnosing an autonomic disorder is often tricky since both the physical exam and laboratory tests can come back normal. If you suspect that you might have some type of autonomic disorder, it's important to find a healthcare provider who doesn't dismiss your symptoms as ""all in your head,"" and who is willing to take the prolonged trial-and-error to diagnose and treat your condition. There is currently no ""cure,"" however depending on the type of autonomic disorder, there are ways to treat the symptoms. Discover How Doctors Diagnose and Treat Dysautonomia The autonomic nervous system plays an important role in the human body, controlling many of the body's automatic processes. This system also helps prepare the body to cope with stress and threats, as well as returning the body to a resting state afterward. Learning more about this part of the nervous system can give you a better understanding of the processes that underlie many human behaviors and responses.

Aims and Objectives: This study was conducted to assess the cardiac sympathovagal responses in the AS patients using Valsalva maneuver (VM) and tilt-table test (TTT). Materials and Methods: A total of 30 AS patients having Bath AS Disease Activity Index of [greater than or equal to]4 were included in this study. The same numbers of age- and sex-matched controls were also selected. The blood pressure (BP) and electrocardiogram were recorded during VM and TTT. The Valsalva ratio and 30:15 ratio were calculated. Results: During VM, there is a statistically significant decrease in the Valsalva ratio in the cases (P < 0.05). After TTT, there is a significant decrease in 30:15 ratio and significant increase in systolic BP (SBP) in the cases (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The Valsalva ratio in the cases is decreased indicating the parasympathetic loss which is further supported by the decrease in 30:15 ratio observed after TTT. The increase in SBP in cases also supports the shifting of sympathovagal balance toward the sympathetic side. KEY WORDS: Valsalva Maneuver; Tilt-Table Test; Ankylosing Spondylitis; Autonomic Nervous System INTRODUCTION Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease involving the spine and sacroiliac joints most commonly. Fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain/swelling, local tenderness, and morning stiffness are the diagnostic presenting symptom of the AS. Some extra-articular manifestations are also observed in AS such as neurological involvement [1] and heart diseases. [2] The cardiac complication of AS is well known which is often associated with aortic regurgitation, conduction defects, and arrhythmias. [2] Since, AS is autoimmune in origin, therefore, the involvement of nervous system is also expected. Abnormalities of both the central and peripheral nervous system are described in inflammatory rheumatic diseases such as autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. [3] However, only some studies have shown the involvement of autonomic nervous system with the conflicting results with different degrees of involvement. [4,5] It is well known that autonomic nervous system regulates the visceral functions such as heart rate (HR), intestinal motility, urination, sexual activity, and many other visceral functions. As the human body tries to adjust according to the changes in the environment, it is constantly being exposed to various forms of stresses. Therefore, if there is any abnormality in the functions of the autonomic outflow, it will affect the visceral functions which may be presented as abnormal gastric, urinary, and sexual functions. Prolonged pain of musculoskeletal origin causes changes in the sympathetic and parasympathetic functions. Sympathetic hyperactivation has already been shown in fibromyalgia, [6] migraine, [7] and chronic neck and shoulder pain. [8] The sympathetic and parasympathetic systems work together to maintain the harmony of the human physiology, but this state can be disrupted by the chronic pain. The autonomic nervous system governs the cardiovascular system and this principle has led to various studies showing relations between autonomic dysfunctions and chronic pain. [9,10] Since any alterations in the autonomic nervous system bring about the changes in the cardiovascular parameters such as blood pressure (BP) and HR, therefore, Valsalva maneuver (VM) and tilt-table test (TTT) were performed to evaluate the cardiac sympathovagal activities in the patients suffering from the AS. MATERIALS AND METHODS The present study was conducted after obtaining approval from the Ethical Committee (Ref No. Dean/2014-15/EC/512), Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, to understand the autonomic reactivity in the patients suffering from AS using VM and TTT. All the patients (mean age 34 [+ or -] 2.11) were informed about this study and were enlisted after their written consent. Age- and sex-matched controls (mean age 35 [+ or -] 2.61) were also included in this study for the various comparisons. Selection of Cases and Controls The patients suffering from AS satisfying the Modified New York Criteria for AS[11] were included in this study. The disease activity was measured by the Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI). This index consists of 1-10 scale (one indicates no problem and ten indicates the maximum problem) and the scores are given according to their answers after asking the five questions regarding the five major symptoms of the AS. These five symptoms are fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain/swelling, local tenderness, and morning stiffness. The patients suffering from AS having BASDAI score of >4 were included in this study. The history of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyper/hypothyroidism, and uremia or the use of any medication such as diuretics, calcium channel blocker, neuroleptics, antiepileptic, antidepressant, and [alpha]/[beta] blockers was considered as exclusion criteria for the selection of patients. Only female patients were selected to avoid the gender-related differences in the response. The age- and sex-matched healthy persons were selected for the comparisons of various parameters and were defined as controls. 30 female patients were selected from the Pain Clinic, Sir Sunderlal Hospital, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, based on the exclusion and inclusion criteria as described above. Non-random method was adopted for the selection of the cases during 1 year. Same numbers of controls were also selected in this study for the comparisons of the various parameters. Study Plan All the patients were advised to avoid the foods and drinks containing caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol at least 12 h before the test. They were also advised to avoid the strenuous activities such as swimming, running, jumping, and any kind of sports at least 2 h before the recordings. The patients were advised to take light meal containing less fat with 6-8 h of deep sleep in the previous night. All tests were performed before 12 noon after a light breakfast. The temperature of the laboratory was maintained at 25 [+ or -] 2[degrees]C, with minimum light, and noise. The patients were briefed about the various procedures to be done during the test. They were allowed to lie down on the bed and were given 10-15 min of rest before the onset of recordings. The BP was measured using digital BP apparatus (Omron Healthcare Company Limited, Japan) and electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration (using stethograph) were recorded by Polyrite D (RMS, Chandigarh, India). Furthermore, HR, Valsalva ratio, and 30:15 ratio were computed from the ECG. Valsalva Maneuver An abrupt transient voluntary elevation of intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressures against the closed glottis is known as VM. For this purpose, the patient blows into the mouthpiece of an aneroid manometer up to 40 mmHg for 15 s. Interpretation of the test is more accurately performed by Valsalva ratio; it is the ratio of the longest R-R interval within 20 beats of maneuver to the shortest interval during the maneuver. In this study, a plastic disposable mouthpiece was placed in the tube of aneroid sphygmomanometer with the patient in sitting position and ECG leads were connected in standard limb lead-II configuration. The patient breathes into a disposable plastic mouthpiece attached to aneroid manometer to maintain pressure at 40 mmHg for 15 s. ECG was recorded up to 45 s after the maneuver and Valsalva ratio was computed manually. This procedure was performed thrice and the average of the ratio from the 3 Valsalva tests was considered as the final result. Tilt Table Test The BP, HR, and respiratory changes were recorded after 10-15 min of rest while patients were lying on the tilt table horizontally. The tilt table is self-designed, manually driven, and made by a local carpenter which enables the patients to change the posture at 90[degrees] vertical within 3-4 s. This is the advantage of our tilt table over the electric motor-driven tilt table which takes 10-15 s time in changing the posture which may allow the person for the cardiovascular adjustment. In TTT, the HR changes and systolic BP (SBP) changes occurring due to the postural changes were recorded. The posture was changed from lying to standing expecting for maximum orthostatic effects on the cardiovascular system. The 30:15 ratio was calculated after the tilting of table at 90[degrees] for the assessment of HR functions. Difference in SBP between lying and after standing for 1 min was recorded and the values were interpreted. Any decrease in SBP <10 mmHg was considered as normal, between 11 and 20 mmHg as borderline, and >30 mmHg as abnormal value. Statistical Analysis Data are presented in the form of mean [+ or -] standard error mean. Statistical analysis is done using GraphPad Prism version 6. Unpaired student's t-test was used wherever required. The P < 0.05 is considered as statistically significant. RESULTS Valsalva Maneuver The international normative Valsalva ratio (longest to shortest R-R interval) during VM is [greater than or equal to]1.21 and considered abnormal if it is [less than or equal to]1.21. In this study, the mean Valsalva ratio of cases is 1.10 [+ or -] 0.05 versus Valsalva ratio in controls of 1.30 [+ or -] 0.07. When compared, it was found significantly lesser than the control (P < 0.05; Figures 1 and 2). When Valsalva ratio of controls was compared with the international normative values of Valsalva ratio ([greater than or equal to]1.21), it was greater but not significant. Tilt Table Test (Lying to Standing) HR Changes (30:15 Ratios) The international normative HR changes (30th: 15th beat R-R ratio) from lying to standing is [greater than or equal to]1.04, borderline between 1.01 and 1.04, and abnormal if [less than or equal to]1.00. In this study, the mean HR changes of cases are 0.92 [+ or -] 0.02 and mean HR changes of controls are 1.05 [+ or -] 0.03, when compared, it was found significantly lesser than the control (P < 0.05; Figures 3 and 4). When mean HR changes of control were compared with the international normative values ([greater than or equal to]1.04) of HR changes, it was found similar. Changes in SBP The international normative SBP change from lying to standing is [less than or equal to]10 mmHg, borderline between 11 and 20 mmHg, and abnormal if [greater than or equal to]30 mmHg. In this study, the changes in mean SBP after the change of posture (from lying to standing) of cases is 10.04 [+ or -] 0.89 mmHg and controls is 7.06 [+ or -] 0.76 mmHg. When compared, it was found significantly greater than the controls (P < 0.05; Figures 3 and 4). The SBP changes of female cases were compared with international normative value and were found within the normal limit. [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] [FIGURE 2 OMITTED] [FIGURE 3 OMITTED] [FIGURE 4 OMITTED] DISCUSSIONS AS is a chronic inflammatory disease which involves skeletal and extra-articular organs such as the lungs, eyes, heart, and neurological system. [5,12,13] The young adults between 20 and 40 years of age are most commonly affected with this disease [11] in contrary to the normal belief of involvement of older age group. The most common cardiac involvement in AS is aortic regurgitation, myocarditis with conduction disturbances, myocardial fibrosis causing abnormalities of left ventricular relaxation, and pericarditis. [14] These patients exhibit the five major symptoms such as fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain/swelling, local tenderness, and morning stiffness which cause pain and severe discomfort to the patients. It is established that prolonged pain and discomfort causes alteration in the autonomic outflow. The autonomic nervous system governs the cardiovascular system and this fact has resulted to various studies showing relations between autonomic dysfunction and chronic pain. [9,10] Since any alterations in the autonomic nervous system bring about the changes in the cardiovascular parameters such as BP and HR, therefore, VM and TTT were performed in this study to evaluate the autonomic reactivity. The increase in HR during exercise is due to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system with simultaneous suppression of the parasympathetic nervous system. [15] The fall in HR immediately after exercise is considered to be the parasympathetic reactivation together with sympathetic withdrawal. During VM, intrathoracic pressure is increased and the overall parasympathetic outflow of the body is decreased. As the increased intrapulmonary pressure causes the excitation of stretch receptors in the lung and nerve impulses generated converges on the cardioinhibitory area in the medulla. As a consequence, the parasympathetic outflow to the visceral organs is decreased. Since heart is also receiving the parasympathetic innervations; therefore, the decreased parasympathetic supply leads to decreased R-R interval and thereby resulting tachycardia. In this study, the AS cases had significantly lower Valsalva ratio as compared to the age- and sex-matched controls indicating parasympathetic loss. It is well established that decrease in Valsalva ratio indicated parasympathetic loss. The decrease in parasympathetic activity may be due to sustained stimulation of the nociceptors which might be the cause for the shifting of sympathovagal balance toward sympathetic side in the patients suffering from the AS. The assumption of the standing position after supine rest for 30 min results in venous pooling of blood and a transient decrease in cardiac output eliciting reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system and a withdrawal of cardiac parasympathetic tone. This is reflected by characteristic changes in HR which increases abruptly toward a primary peak at around 3 s and secondary peak at around 12 s. It then declines to a relative bradycardia at about 20 s and then gradually increases again. [16] In TTT, the HR changes and SBP changes from lying to standing were observed. In the cases, 30:15 ratio was found significantly lesser than the controls. This is indicative of decreased parasympathetic reactivity in the AS cases in comparison to the controls. In this study, the HR changes occurring after TTT is similar to the HR changes occurring during VM which is further supporting that there is a decrease in parasympathetic reactivity in the patients suffering from AS. The above findings are consistent with the work performed on the chronic pain using handgrip test and deep-breath test elsewhere.[17] However, the sample size is the limitation of this study; because of non-availability of the sufficient number of AS patients. Furthermore, planning of the interventional study could have been more informative in this type of study. CONCLUSION The value of Valsalva ratio is decreased in the AS patients in comparison to the controls indicating the parasympathetic loss which is further supported by the decrease in 30:15 ratio observed after the TTT. The increase in SBP in cases also supports the shifting of cardiac sympathovagal balance toward the sympathetic side in the AS patients. REFERENCES [1.] Wollheim FA. Ankylosing spondylitis.

HRV was measured in 54 young children (28 male/26 female) who underwent surgery for CHD, as well as in 51 children in a control group. The low-/high-frequency ratio was the only significantly increased parameter (1.8 +/– 1.39 versus 1.25 +/– 0.88; p=0.01) in the group of children operated on. We also studied the effect of an atriotomy on HRV. There was no statistically significant difference in this group. HRV is decreased in children after surgery for CHD compared to the control group, but atriotomy does not seem to play a direct role in this modification. Heart rate variability; Congenital heart disease; Heart surgery Heart rate variability is a parameter that varies over time, under the influence of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems []. It is a simple and accessible tool in cardiological practice. Analysis of heart rate variability is a sensitive and non-invasive method that allows the exploration of sympathovagal balance [,]. We can predict that autonomic (ANS) activity will be modified in patients who have undergone surgery for CHD. Numerous studies have consistently shown that heart surgery, especially after repair of a tetralogy of Fallot [-] and Fontan surgeries [-] leads to a significant reduction in heart rate variability. A decrease in parasympathetic tone or increase in sympathetic tone predisposes to the development of arrhythmias and leads to a higher risk of sudden death in CHD [,]. Moreover, it is well demonstrated that a decrease in HRV eventually may appear not only as a consequence of decreased activities of sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of ANS, but also as independent metabolic phenomen, related to possible impairment of , especially cells of sinoatrial node (SAN) that may be less responsive to the neural and humoral impacts []. The extents, to which the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are affected, as well as the possibility for reinnervation, are not known. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of heart surgery on sympathetic and parasympathetic activity in children after surgery for heart disease, and to compare HRV in patients that did and did not had an atriotomy at the time of the surgical repair. In this single centre, retrospective study we report heart rate parameters on 54 patients with CHD who had undergone surgery and a control group of 51 young patients with structural normal hearts (). Patients with factors that could influence the modulation of the HRV were excluded from the study, this included patients with left ventricular dysfunction and treatment with antiarrhythmic dugs and beta-blockers. Consort flow diagram on enrolment of patients into the study. Electrocardiography, echocardiography and 24 h Holter monitoring were analysed. In the group of patients with who underwent surgery, there were 28 males and 26 females. Mean age at surgery was 2.57 +/– 3.3 years (median 0.72, minimum 0.01, maximum 15.34). Twenty patients underwent for a left-to-right shunt, 11 for a single ventricle, 9 for right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, 5 for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, 6 for transposition of the great vessels, 1 for Ebstein’s anomaly and 2 for double discordance (). These patients were divided into two groups: the first had surgery with atriotomy and the second had surgery without atriotomy. Cohort of patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease, classified as per type of congenital heart disease. All the patients were in sinus rhythm at the initial evaluation. Patients on anti-arrhythmic agents and those with a rhythmic anomaly on Holter monitoring were excluded. Echocardiography showed good systolic function in all patients, with an ejection fraction of greater than 60% and no significant valvular anomalies. Structural heart disease and underlying arrhythmias were ruled out in the control group by clinical examination, electrocardiography and echocardiography. Data are expressed in frequencies for the nominal variables and in mean +/– standard deviation or median +/– interquartile for the continuous variables. A multivariate regression analysis was used to compare the two groups undergoing surgery and the control group. A non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the two surgical groups, with and without atriotomy. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). 24 h Holter monitoring was used to analyse the HRV. The assessment included a frequency-domain analysis and a time-domain analysis, as recommended by the Task Force of the European Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology []. The frequency-domain analysis includes the low frequency component (LF), the high frequency component (HF), the total power (TP) and the low/high frequency ratio (LF/HF). Time-domain analysis parameters include the average duration of the RR intervals (RR), the standard deviation of totality of RR intervals (SDNN), the standard deviation of the RR intervals in 5 min segments analysed over 24 h (SDANN), the number of intervals in which the difference between successive RR intervals was greater than 50 ms divided by the total number of RRs (pNN50), and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), all measured in milliseconds (). The pNN50, the RMSSD and the HF reflect parasympathetic activity. The TP expresses global variability []. There is disagreement about the significance of the LF; some authors believe it to be a marker of sympathetic activity, while others consider it to be influenced by both sympathetic and vagal activity. RR: Length of Time between RR Intervals; SDNN: Standard Deviation of all Normal RR Intervals over a Period of 24 h; SDANN: Standard Deviation of RR Intervals Averaged out over 5 min Periods; pNN50: Percentage of Differences of Greater than 50 ms between Successive RR Intervals; RMSSD: Square Root of the Mean Squared Differences of Successive RR Intervals; TP: Total Power; LF: Low Frequency; HF: High Frequency Indicators of heart rate variability in the surgical group: comparison between patients with atriotomy vs. non-atriotomy surgery. ’s clinical and electrocardiographic features are shown in . There was no significant difference in terms of age, sex, average and PR interval. QRS and QT intervals were longer in the children who underwent surgery in comparison with the control group (p<0.01). CHD: Congenital Heart Disease; bpm: beats per minute General characteristics of the study population. The different parameters of HRV were compared (). The only parameter that showed a significant statistical difference was the low/high frequency ratio (LF/HF), which reflects the sympathetic– parasympathetic balance; this was higher in patients who had had surgery for CHD in comparison with the control group (1.8 +/– 1.39 versus 1.25 +/– 0.88; p=0.01). RR: Length of Time between RR Intervals; SDNN: Standard Deviation of all Normal RR Intervals over a Period of 24 h; SDANN: Standard Deviation of RR Intervals Averaged out over 5 min Periods; pNN50: Percentage of Differences of Greater than 50 ms between Successive RR Intervals; RMSSD: Square Root of the Mean Squared Differences of Successive RR Intervals; TP: Total Power; LF: Low Frequency; HF: High Frequency Indicators of heart rate variability in the patients with and without operated congenital heart disease. In the group of children who had undergone surgery, there was no significant difference between those whose surgery included an atriotomy and the group without atriotomy. This study shows that there is a reduction in HRV after surgery for CHD in young children, but it was unable to demonstrate that atrial incision had an effect on this reduction. Following surgery, the main factors responsible for postoperatory arrhythmias include surgical scars, haemodynamic status and the action of the autonomic nervous system. Butera et al. [] demonstrated significant reduction in HRV in the setting of a decrease vagal tone in a study including 39 patients after Fontan procedure. Davos et al. [] showed that autonomic nervous system dysfunction persisted for a long time after a Fontan procedure. Previous studies evaluating the topography of the cardiac in the adult heart, have demonstrated the presence of sympathetic ganglia at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium, at the level of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. Other ganglia are present at the junction of the atrium and appendage and on the anterosuperior wall of the right atrium. Extensive manipulation of atrial tissue during , as is the case in Fontan procedures, can damage the intracardiac ganglia or the postganglionic nerve endings innervating the sinus node and the atrioventricular node. Different factors have been found responsible for the decrease in HRV in the postoperative period. Some of them are related to the administration of medications in the post-operative time, such as betablockers, flecainide and propafenone. Others are related to structural and functional changes, in particular the presence of post-operatory myocardial dysfunction []. Extracorporeal circulation may also cause an imbalance in the ANS, either due to the secretion of catecholamines, to partial vagal denervation by surgical damage or to ischaemia, as demonstrated by Bronner et al. []. Shusterman et al. [] showed that the pattern of changes in the RR intervals, rather than the absolute value of the indices, contributes to arrhythmogenesis in the adult population. Because of this, the LF/HF ratio is considered to be a strong predictor of []. There is limited literature on the effects of open heart surgery in HRV in the young age. Our study focuses on the evaluation of the heart rate changes in a population of children after congenital heart disease repair. It demonstrates that there is a significant difference in the LF/ HF ratio after surgery for CHD in children when compared to a control group. This change in the sympathetic – balance seems to be independent of the presence of an atrial incision during the surgical procedure. Unlike complex heart surgery – in particular Fontan-type operations, which necessarily involve extensive atrial manipulation – most of our surgical population was represented by non-complex procedures without extensive atrial scars. Moreover, the acute effect of circulation was not evaluated since the Holter analysis was carried out an average of 6 years after operation. not demonstrate a direct effect of atriotomy on this reduction. The effect of atriotomy remains to be proven by other studies. Hammond HK, Froelicher VF (1985) Normal and abnormal heart rate response to exercise. Prog Cardiovasc Dis 27: 271-296.

HRV was measured in 54 young children (28 male/26 female) who underwent surgery for CHD, as well as in 51 children in a control group. The low-/high-frequency ratio was the only significantly increased parameter (1.8 +/– 1.39 versus 1.25 +/– 0.88; p=0.01) in the group of children operated on. We also studied the effect of an atriotomy on HRV. There was no statistically significant difference in this group. HRV is decreased in children after surgery for CHD compared to the control group, but atriotomy does not seem to play a direct role in this modification. Heart rate variability; Congenital heart disease; Heart surgery Heart rate variability is a parameter that varies over time, under the influence of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems []. It is a simple and accessible tool in cardiological practice. Analysis of heart rate variability is a sensitive and non-invasive method that allows the exploration of sympathovagal balance [,]. We can predict that autonomic (ANS) activity will be modified in patients who have undergone surgery for CHD. Numerous studies have consistently shown that heart surgery, especially after repair of a tetralogy of Fallot [-] and Fontan surgeries [-] leads to a significant reduction in heart rate variability. A decrease in parasympathetic tone or increase in sympathetic tone predisposes to the development of arrhythmias and leads to a higher risk of sudden death in CHD [,]. Moreover, it is well demonstrated that a decrease in HRV eventually may appear not only as a consequence of decreased activities of sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of ANS, but also as independent metabolic phenomen, related to possible impairment of , especially cells of sinoatrial node (SAN) that may be less responsive to the neural and humoral impacts []. The extents, to which the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are affected, as well as the possibility for reinnervation, are not known. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of heart surgery on sympathetic and parasympathetic activity in children after surgery for heart disease, and to compare HRV in patients that did and did not had an atriotomy at the time of the surgical repair. In this single centre, retrospective study we report heart rate parameters on 54 patients with CHD who had undergone surgery and a control group of 51 young patients with structural normal hearts (). Patients with factors that could influence the modulation of the HRV were excluded from the study, this included patients with left ventricular dysfunction and treatment with antiarrhythmic dugs and beta-blockers. Consort flow diagram on enrolment of patients into the study. Electrocardiography, echocardiography and 24 h Holter monitoring were analysed. In the group of patients with who underwent surgery, there were 28 males and 26 females. Mean age at surgery was 2.57 +/– 3.3 years (median 0.72, minimum 0.01, maximum 15.34). Twenty patients underwent for a left-to-right shunt, 11 for a single ventricle, 9 for right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, 5 for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, 6 for transposition of the great vessels, 1 for Ebstein’s anomaly and 2 for double discordance (). These patients were divided into two groups: the first had surgery with atriotomy and the second had surgery without atriotomy. Cohort of patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease, classified as per type of congenital heart disease. All the patients were in sinus rhythm at the initial evaluation. Patients on anti-arrhythmic agents and those with a rhythmic anomaly on Holter monitoring were excluded. Echocardiography showed good systolic function in all patients, with an ejection fraction of greater than 60% and no significant valvular anomalies. Structural heart disease and underlying arrhythmias were ruled out in the control group by clinical examination, electrocardiography and echocardiography. Data are expressed in frequencies for the nominal variables and in mean +/– standard deviation or median +/– interquartile for the continuous variables. A multivariate regression analysis was used to compare the two groups undergoing surgery and the control group. A non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the two surgical groups, with and without atriotomy. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). 24 h Holter monitoring was used to analyse the HRV. The assessment included a frequency-domain analysis and a time-domain analysis, as recommended by the Task Force of the European Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology []. The frequency-domain analysis includes the low frequency component (LF), the high frequency component (HF), the total power (TP) and the low/high frequency ratio (LF/HF). Time-domain analysis parameters include the average duration of the RR intervals (RR), the standard deviation of totality of RR intervals (SDNN), the standard deviation of the RR intervals in 5 min segments analysed over 24 h (SDANN), the number of intervals in which the difference between successive RR intervals was greater than 50 ms divided by the total number of RRs (pNN50), and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), all measured in milliseconds (). The pNN50, the RMSSD and the HF reflect parasympathetic activity. The TP expresses global variability []. There is disagreement about the significance of the LF; some authors believe it to be a marker of sympathetic activity, while others consider it to be influenced by both sympathetic and vagal activity. RR: Length of Time between RR Intervals; SDNN: Standard Deviation of all Normal RR Intervals over a Period of 24 h; SDANN: Standard Deviation of RR Intervals Averaged out over 5 min Periods; pNN50: Percentage of Differences of Greater than 50 ms between Successive RR Intervals; RMSSD: Square Root of the Mean Squared Differences of Successive RR Intervals; TP: Total Power; LF: Low Frequency; HF: High Frequency Indicators of heart rate variability in the surgical group: comparison between patients with atriotomy vs. non-atriotomy surgery. ’s clinical and electrocardiographic features are shown in . There was no significant difference in terms of age, sex, average and PR interval. QRS and QT intervals were longer in the children who underwent surgery in comparison with the control group (p<0.01). CHD: Congenital Heart Disease; bpm: beats per minute General characteristics of the study population. The different parameters of HRV were compared (). The only parameter that showed a significant statistical difference was the low/high frequency ratio (LF/HF), which reflects the sympathetic– parasympathetic balance; this was higher in patients who had had surgery for CHD in comparison with the control group (1.8 +/– 1.39 versus 1.25 +/– 0.88; p=0.01). RR: Length of Time between RR Intervals; SDNN: Standard Deviation of all Normal RR Intervals over a Period of 24 h; SDANN: Standard Deviation of RR Intervals Averaged out over 5 min Periods; pNN50: Percentage of Differences of Greater than 50 ms between Successive RR Intervals; RMSSD: Square Root of the Mean Squared Differences of Successive RR Intervals; TP: Total Power; LF: Low Frequency; HF: High Frequency Indicators of heart rate variability in the patients with and without operated congenital heart disease. In the group of children who had undergone surgery, there was no significant difference between those whose surgery included an atriotomy and the group without atriotomy. This study shows that there is a reduction in HRV after surgery for CHD in young children, but it was unable to demonstrate that atrial incision had an effect on this reduction. Following surgery, the main factors responsible for postoperatory arrhythmias include surgical scars, haemodynamic status and the action of the autonomic nervous system. Butera et al. [] demonstrated significant reduction in HRV in the setting of a decrease vagal tone in a study including 39 patients after Fontan procedure. Davos et al. [] showed that autonomic nervous system dysfunction persisted for a long time after a Fontan procedure. Previous studies evaluating the topography of the cardiac in the adult heart, have demonstrated the presence of sympathetic ganglia at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium, at the level of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. Other ganglia are present at the junction of the atrium and appendage and on the anterosuperior wall of the right atrium. Extensive manipulation of atrial tissue during , as is the case in Fontan procedures, can damage the intracardiac ganglia or the postganglionic nerve endings innervating the sinus node and the atrioventricular node. Different factors have been found responsible for the decrease in HRV in the postoperative period. Some of them are related to the administration of medications in the post-operative time, such as betablockers, flecainide and propafenone. Others are related to structural and functional changes, in particular the presence of post-operatory myocardial dysfunction []. Extracorporeal circulation may also cause an imbalance in the ANS, either due to the secretion of catecholamines, to partial vagal denervation by surgical damage or to ischaemia, as demonstrated by Bronner et al. []. Shusterman et al. [] showed that the pattern of changes in the RR intervals, rather than the absolute value of the indices, contributes to arrhythmogenesis in the adult population. Because of this, the LF/HF ratio is considered to be a strong predictor of []. There is limited literature on the effects of open heart surgery in HRV in the young age. Our study focuses on the evaluation of the heart rate changes in a population of children after congenital heart disease repair. It demonstrates that there is a significant difference in the LF/ HF ratio after surgery for CHD in children when compared to a control group. This change in the sympathetic – balance seems to be independent of the presence of an atrial incision during the surgical procedure. Unlike complex heart surgery – in particular Fontan-type operations, which necessarily involve extensive atrial manipulation – most of our surgical population was represented by non-complex procedures without extensive atrial scars. Moreover, the acute effect of circulation was not evaluated since the Holter analysis was carried out an average of 6 years after operation. not demonstrate a direct effect of atriotomy on this reduction. The effect of atriotomy remains to be proven by other studies. Hammond HK, Froelicher VF (1985) Normal and abnormal heart rate response to exercise. Prog Cardiovasc Dis 27: 271-296.

544e6d42-1924-40d0-9d02-8c0ca7d79a44,"Because cellular structures and metabolic pathways are affected by temperature. Small range What is a normal core temp? What too high of a core temperature and what is too low? - Normal core temp is approx 37 degrees C - >45 degrees C- <34 degrees C An increase in body temperature above 45 degrees C can do what? - It can destroy the normal protein structure of enzymes resulting in death What happens with the muscular contractile proteins when body temperature goes above 45 degrees C? - muscular contractile proteins will start to break down, enter blood stream, go to the kidneys where filtering happens. The kidneys filter out the proteins so kidneys become damaged from having to filter proteins.- Kidney damage/failure is why the person dies A decrease in body temp below 34 degrees C can do what? It can cause slowed metabolism and abnormal cardiac function (arrythmias) that can lead to death (heart attack). If slow down metabolism too much you can't make enough ATP for needs of the body. Animals that maintain a rather constant body core temperature Maintenance of constant body temperature requires what? Requires that heat loss match the rate of heat production. Put them in a tub of ice and water (careful to not bring body temp down to an extreme) Homeotherms serve as a ""furnace"" rather than ""refrigerator"" Our body temperatures are set at the high end of normal, we are losing heat continually but our bodies are always producing heat too. (continuous metabolic heat production) Regulation by heat conservation or cooling capacity is more efficient? Regulation by heat conservation and generation is very efficient, cooling capacity is more limited What is the largest producer of heat in our bodies? What type of exercise presents serious challenge to temperature homeostasis? What might be the only serious threat that exercise presents healthy people? What individuals are more likely to die from heat stroke? The young and old because both are less efficient so they will produce more heat per given amount of work(also don't sweat as much) What would you do to help keep the young and old safer in heat? Maintain a constant core temperature and prevent heating or overcooling(heat loss must match heat gain) If heat loss is less than heat production, what happens? There is a net gain in body heat and therefore body temperature rises If heat loss exceeds heat production, what happens? There is a net loss in body heat and body temperature decreases During exercise, body temperature is regulated by what? What is the main system through which we lose heat? Circulatory system- important function is to transport heat Blood has a high capacity for storing heat, which makes blood a good way to keep heat or get rid of heat blood flow is increased to the skin as a means of promoting heat loss to the environment- we vasodilate the blood vessels by our skin bringing the warm blood to the skin and get rid of heat If we want to prevent heat loss, what do our bodies do? Blood is directed away from the skin and toward the interior of the body to prevent additional heat loss. - we vasoconstrict which will bring blood internally to increase body temperature Within the body, temperature varies. - There is a gradient between the core temperature (deep central areas like heart, lungs, abdominal organs), and the ""shell"" (skin) temperature In extreme circumstances (extreme cold) the core temperature can differ from the skin temperature by how much? The core temperature may be 20 degrees C higher than the shell. RARE What is the ideal difference between core and shell temperatures? Measurements of deep-body temperatures can be accomplished with many devices, such as? - mercury thermometers- Thermocouples or themistors- Ingestible core temperature pills In lab settings, what is a common site of core temperature? - not the same as temperature in the brain where temp is regulated- used to estimate changes in deep-body temperature during exercise- used most frequently with exercise studies - temperature measurements near the eardrum- Good estimate of actual brain temperature - measures core temperature (deep-body temp)- not identical to brain temperature (like rectum) Which three measurements of temperature are easily performed in lab settings? 1. Rectal2. Tympanic3. Esophogeal*Limitations in field settings What temperature sensor is used onfield and during practice sessions? How does the Ingestible temperature sensor telemetry system work? Uses low-power radio frequency transmissions to communicate with a temperature monitor - Can be measured by placing temperature sensors (thermistors) on skin at 7 various locations What are the 7 various locations that skin temp is taken? 1. Forehead2. Chest3. Forearm4. Thigh5. Calf6. Abdomen7. Back Take the average of those 7 locations and divide by 7. How do you involuntarily increase heat production? Shivering and hormones that will increase metabolic rate What happens with heat production at rest and when sleeping? When doing intense exercise? At rest and when sleeping: heat production is smallIntense exercise: heat production is large Heat production can be classified as either? (2 things) 1. Voluntary (exercise)2. Involuntary (shivering or biochemical heat production caused by the secretion of hormones such as thyroxine and catecholamines) How efficient is the body? How much energy do we lose as heat? The body is 20-30% efficient, therefore 70-80% of the energy expenditure becomes heat What is the primary means of increasing heat production during exposure to cold? Shivering - maximal shivering can increase body's heat production five times the resting value What are the two hormones that help to increase heat production? - Released from thyroid- Increases metabolic rate of all the cells in your body Epinephrine and norepinephrineIncreases rate of cellular metabolism This increase in heat production due to the combined influences of thyroxine and catecholamines is called what? Heat loss from body may occur by four processes, what are they? 1. Radiation2. Conduction3. Convection4. Evaporation Radiation, conduction, and convection require what? A temperature gradient between skin and the environment - Transfer of heat via infrared rays- Transfer of heat from the surface of one object to the surface of another with no physical contact made At rest in a comfortable environment (21 degrees C), how much of heat loss occurs via radiation? (body temp is 37) Because the skin temperature is greater than the temperature of surrounding objects (walls, floors) and a net loss of heat occurs due to the thermal gradient. On hot, sunny days when surface temperatures are greater than skin temperatures Heat loss and heat gain depending on environmental conditions Transfer of heat from the body into the molecules of cooler objects in contact with its surface If sitting on a block of ice, your body temperature will decrease because your heat is transferred into that block of ice A form of conductive heat loss in which heat is transmitted to either air or water molecules in contact with the body What happens to the air or water molecules in contact with the body? The air and water molecules are warmed and move away from the source of heat and are replaced by cooler molecules. Turn on fan or air conditioner- a fan would increase the number of air molecules coming in contact with the skin and promote heat loss Room temperature is 72 degrees and body is 98.6 so what is always happening? We are continually heating up air molecules in contact with skin Water is more conductive so sitting in 72 degree water would result in greater heat loss than sitting in 72 degree air.(water is 25 times more effective than air) Would cycling at a fast or slow speed improve conductive cooling? Fast because air going past you more quickly so air being heated up can pass by more quickly. Get rid of more heat Heat is transferred for the body to water on the surface of the skin Evaporation accounts for how much of heat loss at rest? What is the most important means of heat loss during exercise? Due to a vapor pressure gradient between the skin and the air The pressure exerted by water molecules that have been converted to gas (water vapor) Evaporative cooling during exercise exists in the following way: - When body temp rises above normal, the nervous system stimulates sweat glands to secrete sweat onto the surface of the skin. - The water on the skin is converted to water vapor that takes heat away (has to be a vapor to evaporate)- As sweat evaporates heat is lost to the environment, which in turns lowers skin temperature If you are just sweating are you always losing heat? No, only the sweat that is evaporated with decrease your body temperature If exercising in 105 degrees summer time, relative humidity is low, what will happen with sweat? Wonder if relative humidity is high? - If relative humidity is low- sweat will be evaporated so won't feel like you are sweating but will feel salt on you- If relative humidity is high- sweat won't be evaporated and wont be able to cool down as much. 1. Temperature & relative humidity2. Convective currents around the body3. Amount of skin surface exposed At high environmental temperatures, what is the most important factor influencing the rate of evaporative heat loss? High relative humidity reduces what? What about when it is near 100% High relative humidity reduces the rate of evaporation, when it is near 100% evaporation is limited. Under what conditions is cooling by evaporation most effective? The act of sweating does not transfer heat away from body, water has to _____? Why does high relative humidity reduce rate of evaporation? - High relative humidity (RH) reduces the vapor pressure gradient between the skin and the environment- On hot/humid day (RH=80-90%) the vapor pressure in the air is close to the vapor pressure on moist skin therefore the rate of evaporation is greatly reduced- High sweat rates during exercise in a hot/high humidity enviornemnt result in useless water loss (sweating per se does not cool the skin; it is evaporation that cools the skin) What needs to be the case in order for evaporative cooling to occur during exercise? Evaporation occurs due to a vapor pressure gradient- for evaporative coolig to occur during exercise, the vapor pressure on the skin must be greater than the vapor pressure in the air (the larger the vapor pressure gradient the more evaporation) At any given temperature, a rise in RH results in increased _________ Less evaporative cooling occurs during exercise on a ______ day compared to a _______ day - hot and humid- cool/low humidity Large skin-to-air vapor pressure gradient would permit relatively large evaporative rate, therefore body cooling would occur under these conditions. How much heat can be lost via evaporation during exercise? The body loses .58 kcal of heat for each ml of water that evaporates. Therefore, evaporation of 1 liter of sweat would result in a heat loss of 580 kcals (1,000 x 0.58 kcal/ml = 580 kcal). What sports would have a large amount of evaporative heat? Cross Country Skiing because a large amount of skin exposed What type of job would result in reduced evaporative heat? The amount of heat gain in the body during exercise is computed as what? The amount of heat gain in the body during exercise is computed as the difference between heat production and heat lossBody heat gain during exercise = (Heat produced-heat lost) The amount of heat energy required to raise the body temperature depends on what? The amount of heat energy required to raise body temperature depends upon the size of the individual (weight) and a characteristic of body tissue called specific heat Amount of heat required to raise 1 kg of body tissue by 1 degree C Equation for heat required to increase body temp by 1 degree C? Heat required to increase body temp by 1 degree C = (specific heat x body mass)Ex. 0.83 x 70 kg = 58.1 kcals During exercise in a cool environment, ____ is the primary avenue for heat loss What conditions is cooling by evaporation most effective? Primarily responsible for dealing with increases in body heat Primarily responsible for reacting to a decrease in body temp. To maintain a relatively constant core temperature around some ""set point"" Where does the input to the temperature regulating centers in the hypothalamus come from? What are changes in the environmental temperature first detected by? Thermal receptors (both heat and cold) located in the skin Transmit nerve impulses to the hypothalamus, which then initiates the appropriate response in an effort to maintain the body's set-point temperature. Where are the heat-cold sensitive neurons located? Located in both the spinal cord and the hypothalamus itself, sensing changes in the core temperature. If body temperature increases, what is the response? The anterior hypothalamus- if body temperature increases, start sweating to increase evaporative loss- Increase blood flow to the skin by vasodilating, therefore the heat from the blood is close to the kin and can be discipated into environment via convection, radiation, etc. When core temperature returns to normal, what happens? The stimulus to promote both sweating and vasodilating is removed. What is anterior hypothalamus an example of when body temp increases? When there is a decrease in core temperature, what is the response? Posterior hypothalamus- increase in the catecholamines and thyroxine which help to vasoconstrict (reduce heat loss), therefore increasing the metabolic rate so having greater heat production- decrease in amount of blood going to skin- shivering Calculation of heat loss via evaporationEx. - 20 minutes cycling at VO2 = 2.0 L min- 20% efficient = 80% energy lost as heatTotal energy expenditure in kcals?Total heat produced in kcals?Evaporation to prevent heat gain?

Why is there a shift in the Hypothalamic Thermostat Set Point Due to Fever During fever, select proteins and other toxins secreted by bacteria can cause the set point of the hypothalamic thermostat to rise above the normal level. What are the substances that cause this shift called? Submaximal constant-load exercise in cool enviornment results in 3 things: 1. Heat production increases2. Nervous system response3. New Steady state core temperature Heat production increases during exercise due to muscular contraction and is directly proportional to _____ What distributes the excess heat throughout the body core? Venous blood draining the exercising muscle distributes the excess heat throughout the body core. thermal sensors in the hypothalamus sense the increase in blood temp and the thermal integration center in the hypothalamus compares this increase in temp with the set points temp and finds the difference between the two. The nervous system to commence sweating and to increase blood flow to the skin (vasodilate) These acts serve to increase body heat loss and minimize increase in body temperature. What happens to the internal temp at this point? - At this point, the internal temp reaches a new elevated steady state level (but this does not represent a change in the set point temp as occurs with fever)- Instead, the thermal regulatory center attempts to return the core temp back to resting levels, but is incapable of doing so bc of continual contraction of muscle during exercise. What roles do convection, radiation and evaporation play during this type of exercise? (submaximal constant-load exercise in cool environment) - There is a constant but small role of convection and radiation in heat loss during this type of exercise due to a constant temperature gradient between the skin and the room- In contrast, evaporation plays the most important role in heat loss during exercise in this type of environment During constant load exercise, core temp incrase is directly related to the ______ and is independent of _________ over a wide range of conditions. As exercise intensity increases, you see an increase in body temp in both ____ & _____ The fact that it is the exercise intensity and not environmental temp that determines rise in core temp during exercise suggests that the method of heat loss during continuous exercise is modified according to ambient conditions - As ambient temp increases, the rate of convective and radiative heat loss decreases due a decrease in the skin-to-room temp gradient. - This decrease in radiative and convective heat loss is matched with an incrase in evaporative heat loss and core temp remains the same There is a linear increase in ___ & ____ & _____ as a function of exercise intensity energy expenditure, heat production, and total heat loss What forms of heat loss do not increase as a function of exercise intensity? What is there an increase in as a function of exercise intensity? - Convective and radiative heat loss are not increased as a function of exercise work rate due to a relatively constant temperature gradient between skin and environment. - BUT there is a consistent rise in evaporative heat loss with increments of exercise intensity - convective and radiant heat loss DECREASE- evaporative heat loss INCREASES Measure of body's perception of how hot it feels when relative humidity is added to the actual air temp By combining air temp and relative humidity to compute an apparent temperature What happens in terms of heat index when relative humidity is high? - When relative humidity is high (high water vapor saturation in atmosphere), the evaporation of sweat is retarded; heat removed from the body at a lower rate resulting body heat storage and increase in body temp. - Thus, high humidity increases an individuals perception of how hot the environment feels. Higher the humidity, the less _____Less heat removed, _____ will increase High heat and humidity reduce the body's ability to lose heat by what? radiation/convection and evaporation• The combined effect of fluid loss and high core temperature increases the risk of hyperthermia (large rise in core temp) What does this inability to lose heat during exercise result in? - A greater core temperature - A higher sweat rate (more fluid loss) --> risk of hyperthermia and heat injury In cool environment, what happens to sweat rate and body temperature? Sweat rate is relatively lowBody temperature increases then plateaus In hot environment, what happens to sweat rate and body temperature? Sweat rate increasesBody temperature continually increases Have an earlier onset of sweating a higher sweat rate during exercise will likely have higher sweat rates compared to smaller individuals. Genetic variations in sweat rates exist such that two individuals with the same body size and level of heat adaptation may also differ in sweat rates. Dehydration of 1-2% body weight can impair performance What are guidelines to prevent dehydration during exercise? - hydrate prior to performance (400-800 ml) 2-3 hours before- Consume 150-300 ml of fluid every 15-20 mins- Ensure adequate rehydration- Monitor urine color What type of drink is superior to water for rehydration? What % decrease in body weight can impair physiological functioning and increase chance of heat injury If it is a hot humid day, how much fluid do you want to take in and every how many minutes? If it is a cool day, how many ml of fluid do you need? want light yellow vs. dark yellowRust color is bad How is exercise performance impaired in a hot environment? - Exercise in heat accelerates muscle fatigue- Accelerated glycogen metabolism- Increases free radical production- Reduced muscle blood flow- Higher brain temperature reduces neuromuscular drive What two types of exercise are impaired in hot/humid environment? Prolonged exercise (marathon) and intermittent (soccer) Why does an increase in the rate of muscle glycogen depletion cause an impaired performance? - During exercise in the heat, rate of muscle glycogen degradation is increased with a parallel rise in both carbohydrate metabolism and lactate accumulation - This is important because muscle glycogen depletion and low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia) are associated with muscle fatigue during prolonged exercise Exercise-induced increases in muscle pH are also linked to muscle fatigue Therefore overall depletion of muscle glycogen stores and high lactate levels could contribute to what? muscle fatigue during prolonged exercise in the heat. - Free radicals are molecules with an unpaired electron in their outer orbital- Molecules with an unpaired electron are highly reactive Free radical production is increased in skeletal muscles during exercise in the heat, why could this impair performance? - Free radicals bind quickly with other molecules and this combo results in damage to the molecule combining with the radical - Therefore, accelerated production of free radicals during exercise in the heat could contribute to muscle fatigue because of damage to muscle contractile proteins. Heat stress can result in cardiovascular strain and reduced muscle blood flow, why can this impair performance? - Reduced muscle blood flow doesn't contribute to poor exercise tolerance during light or moderate exercise bc muscle blood flow is well maintained under this exercise conditions when dehydration does not occur.- During high intensity exercise performed in hot/humid environment, there is a progressive decline in muscle blood flow due to a competition for blood between the working muscles and the skin. What happens as body temperature rises during exercise in a hot environment? Blood flow moves away from the contracting muscle toward the skin to assist in cooling the body During high intensity exercise, can reduced muscle blood flow contribute to impaired performance? What can it not explain? - During high intensity exercise, reduced muscle blood flow can contribute to impaired exercise performance in the heat- In contrast, reduced muscle blood flow cannot explain the heat-induced reduction in exercise performance during light to moderate intensity work Both hyperthermia and dehydration can directly diminish exercise performance due? central nervous system impairment because higher brain temperature. - Reduces the neuromuscular drive for motor performance - reduction in motor unit recruitment Overall, heat induced fatigue is not due to a single factor but probably results from a combo of what metabolic events? Alterations in muscle metabolism, impaired cardiovascular function/fluid balance, and CNS dysfunction resulting in impaired neuromuscular function Strategies to improve exercise tolerance in hot environment? Become heat acclimated and consume fluid before and during exercise Are there gender differences in heat tolerance (thermoregulation)? - Previously thought women were less tolerant of exercise in hot environment- NOW, shown that there are only small differences in heat tolerance Age itself doesn't limit ability to thermoregulate, what does? - deconditioning with age- lack of heat acclimatization Rapid adaptation (days to week) to environmental change Adaptation that occurs over a long time period (many week to several months) - Lower heart rate- Lower core temperature during submax exercise Partial heat acclimation occurs by what?Maximal heat acclimation occurs by what? - Partial heat acclimation occurs by training in cool environment, BUT training in hot environment will obtain maximal heat acclimation What is the primary stimulus to promote heat acclimation? Because an elevation in core temperature is the primary stimulus to promote heat acclimation, its recommended that the athlete perform strenuous interval training or continuous exercise at an intensity exceeding 50% of their VO2 max in order ot promote higher core temperatures Therefore, acclimation requires that you work out in what type of environment to see elevated core temperatures that promote adaptations? Almost complete acclimation being achieved by 7-14 days after the first exposure Heat tolerance will be lost within 7 days of not being in the heat, after 28 days you've completely lost all you've gained with heat acclimation. The primary adaptations that occur during heat acclimation: - 10-12% Increased plasma volume- Earlier onset of sweating- Higher sweat rate- Reduced salt loss (sodium cholride) in sweat- Reduced skin blood flow- Increased synthesis of heat shock proteins maintain blood volume, stroke volume, ability to sweat is increased so smaller gain in temp - Start exercising and sweat right away even if body temp hasn't gone up- Sweat more- Storing less heat and therefore core temp won't increase as much - More ability for evaporation to happen- 3 fold increase in ability to sweat - Lose less sodium which is beneficial because the more water in sweat the easier it is to evaporate Prevents cellular damage from heat""stress proteins"" In 3 days ill see changes:- HR decrease- Plasma volume increaseIn 5 days:- perceived exertion ... feel less challengingIn 8 days:- sweat rate increases An athletes ability to lose heat and therefore greatly reduces the chance of heat injury (enhanced heat loss) What can exercise in cold environment result in? How can you prevent this? Hypothermia- The combination of metabolic heat production and warm clothing prevents the development of hypothermia (large decrease in core temp) during short term work on a cold day Individuals with a high % of what improves cold tolerance? - Individuals with high % of body fat have advantage over lean individuals when it comes to cold tolerance- Large amount of subcutaneous fat provide an increased layer of insulation from the cold Do men or women generally tolerate mild cold exposure better? - Hands become numb due to reduction in the rate of neural transmission and reduced blood flow due to vasoconstriction- This results in loss of dexterity and affects throwing and catching- Frostbite- serious medical condition If elite runner running on 70 degree day vs. 50, by what % will their time be slower? None elite runners will have an decrease in time by what % because why? 12% because decrease in heat production (running in groups and running in sun longer) 3 major physiological adaptations occur when humans are chronically exposed to cold temperatures 1. Reduction in the mean skin temperature at which shivering begins2. Maintain a higher mean hand and foot temperature during cold exposure 3. Improved ability to sleep in cold environments 1. Reduction in the mean skin temperature at which shivering begins - People who are cold acclimated begin shivering at a lower skin temp- WHY? Cold acclimated people maintain heat production with less shivering by increasing nonshivering thermogenesis This is achieved by increase in the release of norepinephrine, which results in an increase in metabolic heat production 2. Maintain a higher mean hand and foot temperature Improved intermittent peripheral vasodilation to increase blood flow (and heat flow) to both the hands and feet - Unacclimated people shiver so much they cant sleep- Acclimated people sleep comfortably due to elevated levels of nonshivering thermogenesis.",108,chronic diarrhea short-term memory sweating inability to regulate body temperature heart palpitations dysautonomia,-9.553938865661621,37

14cb39f5-af87-48af-9c2f-f86f601da326,"listed in , originally published in There may be some truth in the saying 'no pain, no gain'. Pain is a friendly signal alerting us that something is dangerous or abnormal. Pain is not a disease but a symptom. To get rid of pain too swiftly, by whatever means, without correcting and removing the cause, is harmful. Sometimes, the only way to get better is to bring back to the surface, to re-awaken an old and concealed pain. I explained last month how the antalgic reflex a priori (ARAP), a mechanism discovered by Françoise Mézières, can, by hiding a pain, create distortions and various neuro-musculo-skeleto-visceral troubles. The ARAP is a very important scientific discovery of great therapeutic value in the field of medicine and physical therapy. But how does it originate? To answer this question we must first investigate the portion of the general nervous system, known as the autonomic or vegetative nervous system. The nervous system is made of two distinct parts: the cerebro-spinal or somatic, which directs the voluntary actions of the body, and the autonomous, which, as the name suggests, is self-governing, and controls the normally involuntary functions of the body, such as heart beat, intestinal movements, salivation and so forth. However, this division of the nervous system into two parts is an arbitrary one: they are anatomically linked and they physiologically interact. The autonomic system is itself subdivided into sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The interplay between these two systems maintains the homeostasis within the body. There are still some gaps in our understanding of the autonomic system which has been rather understudied in comparison with the cerebro-spinal one. This makes it a fascinating subject of investigation. From The Peripheric Nervous System, by Guy Lazorthes, I note that: ""The Sympathetic system is the fundamental element of the nervous system: it does not have any subordination vis-à-vis the cerebro-spinal system."" Evolutionarily speaking, it is the oldest part of the nervous system and that may be the reason why its actions are not limited to the so-called vegetative functions but touch the whole organism. Without the intervention of any conscious volition the autonomic nervous system (ANS) activates many processes. Prof. F. Wood Jones says that ""…the whole of (its) activity is… 'a mechanism of self-defence'. It is an involuntary activity called forth in response to fear or pain, and it fits the animal for the struggle which in animal life is likely to follow the receipt of an unpleasant sensory impression."" This remark will help us understand why the sympathetic system is the instigator of the ARAP. The sympathetic trunk is like a long necklace composed of fibres and ganglia (cluster of nerve cells). It 'hangs' from the base of the skull down to the coccyx. So, in each side of the front part of the spine, lie two sympathetic chains with many ganglia. There are also other outlying ganglia, some directly in the walls of the organs. The sympathetic cells, having migrated and wandered away from the protective encasement of the spinal column and ending up in outlying ganglia, have gained some independence, but, alas, some vulnerability too. Any trauma, even slight, such as falls, impacts, blows, and jolts can irritate and disturb a sympathetic ganglion at some level of the spine. The pain caused by the irritated ganglion is rapidly palliated by the adoption of an abnormal posture. This quick avoidance of pain constitutes the ARAP. This reflex is so efficient that the pain might not even reach the consciousness of the sufferer. And even if the pain is consciously felt, it quickly disappears to be consigned to oblivion. According to Mézières, the resulting antalgic posture always involves a lordotic bent (a hollow in the back). The spine literally bends over backwards to accommodate itself to the painful stimulus. The lordosis immobilizes and 'freezes' the 'injured' segment of the spine, as if to put the pain into quarantine. To preserve this status quo, the abnormal lordosis has to be maintained at all cost. A normal posture and natural movement require a free spine which would disturb this antalgic lordosis. To avoid this, the body reaches a compromise orchestrated by the autonomic system, and adopts an awkward posture which, in time, can lead to various deformations and symptoms ranging from osteoarthritis to pseudo-paralysis. Because the separation of the sympathetic from the somatic is only partial, the former retains some connections with the latter via some nerve fibres. As a result, the effects of the compression or irritation of a ganglion travel far away from the original source, and usually reach the limbs. The reverse can also happen. A painful stimulus can travel centrifugally as well as centripetally, so that a trauma affecting a limb can very well have repercussions into a ganglion, affecting the corresponding level of the spine. Mézières was very curious about the ANS. Her method primarily addresses this little known and still mysterious system. During and after a session of the Mézières Method, it is common for the patient to experience reactions which unmistakably come from the ANS. Profuse sweating in certain areas of the body as soon as a posture is taken, dry mouth, blushing, trembling, tears, laughs, pins and needles, dizziness… These reactions must not be mistaken for psychological ones – the postures act on the ANS, not directly on the mind or emotions. While the Yogi tries to have a conscious control over his autonomic nervous system (which he calls Kundalini), the Mézièrist works at freeing it from any interference so that it can mind its business without any conscious control – as Nature intended. Joel Carbonnel is unique in combining the disciplines of the Alexander Technique (STAT), the Mezieres Methode (AME), Morphopsychology (SFM), and Natural Hygiene (ISI).

The Gender Gap in Negotiation May Start Very Young Why College Prestige Matters and Why It Shouldn't How to Find Empathy for People You Don’t Understand The neurological and psychological correlates of troubled sleep. is the most common sleep condition in the world, with half of adults globally reporting occasional episodes. Chronic insomnia, though far less prevalent, affects as many as 10 to 15 percent of the adult population. Though these sleep problems are extremely common, the neurobiological mechanisms behind insomnia are not entirely understood. Research suggests that emotional stressors do play an outsized role in contributing to sleep problems, and it is well documented that mood and disorders are common comorbidities with insomnia. This seems like common sense. Emotional arousal, whether due to a state of anxiety or because of intrusive thoughts, makes it difficult to relax, thereby inhibiting one’s ability to either initiate sleep or get back to sleep after waking. This line of reasoning suggests that researchers may come to better understand insomnia by examining the mechanisms underlying how our body responds to . The parts of the brain that are responsible for processing and responding to stress are collectively known as the limbic system. All animals possess some iteration of a limbic system, and it allows them to quickly respond to perceived threats. When a threat is identified, the limbic system jumps into action to prepare our bodies to either escape the threat or combat it. This reaction is known as the fight-or-flight response. The fight-or-flight response is crucial for survival because it gives animals, including humans, a surge in neurotransmitters, which gives them a better chance to escape or fight back against predators. Anyone who has been startled and felt their heart began to race knows how powerful this response can be. However, the same system is activated for humans living in more modern settings even if the reason for the sudden spike in neurotransmitters is less than dire. Consequently, an approaching deadline or a potentially awkward future meeting may trigger the same biophysiological mechanism, even though these kinds of situations do not pose a significant threat to our existence. The limbic system has two primary components, the amygdala and the hippocampus. The amygdala responds to stimuli by producing emotional responses, particularly feelings of or , as well as when the body senses arousing or pleasant stimuli. The hippocampus is responsible for the creation and consolidation of . The limbic system also communicates with several other parts of the brain. In particular, the hypothalamus plays a major role in the limbic system, even though it also performs many other functions. The hypothalamus can be thought of as the body’s control center because it regulates much of the autonomic (ANS), which is responsible for controlling vital bodily functions that we do not have to think about. Some of these functions include breathing, blood pressure, body temperature, and heart rate, to name a few. When we perceive a danger, the amygdala sends distress signals to the hypothalamus, which in turn sends chemical messages to the adrenal glands to release epinephrine (or adrenaline) into the bloodstream. This boost in adrenaline activates a division of the ANS known as the (SNS), which activates the physiological changes in the body that will ultimately help us fight off a threat or flee to safety. For example, as adrenaline courses through the body, it dilates airways in our lungs to bring more oxygen into the body, it causes our heart rates to increase to push more oxygen-rich blood to our muscles, and it releases that cause fat that has been stored in our bodies to be converted into glucose, which then gives us more energy. Even our eyesight and hearing get keener. If the threat is not resolved immediately, the body can maintain this state of hyperawareness by activating what is known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis). This cascade of begins when the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), which tells the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH orders the adrenal glands to produce cortisol, which keeps the body in a state of alertness. For this reason, cortisol is often referred to as the “.” Once the threat has passed, another division of the autonomic , the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), takes over and returns our bodies to a state of repose. The PNS is not only responsible for easing our bodies out of a state of heightened alertness; it also regulates sexual activity, salivation, digestion, urination, and defecation. Broadly speaking, the SNS involves fight-or-flight, the PNS involves feed and breed. Most memories are not merely collections of perceptions. They also include the way we felt at the time a memory was created because the amygdala and the hippocampus act in concert to encode memories with emotion. On the one hand, this conditions us to repeatedly participate in activities that are tied to positive emotions. On the other, it conditions us to avoid activities that are tied to negative emotions and allows us to be better prepared for a fight-or-flight scenario. If we find ourselves in a dangerous situation and escape, we may become conditioned to avoid not only the situation itself, but activities or stimuli associated with that situation. Such a fear is not based on instinct, but rather on memory. As an extreme example, if one almost drowns in the ocean at a young age, this may create a fear not only of the ocean, but of any body of water. While this interplay between emotion and memory may lead to various phobias that can be disruptive to one’s normal life, the connection is integral to survival. Without it, we would not be able to remember potential threats or dangerous activities. Such a person would be both fearless and most likely not long for this world. The good news is that many of us no longer live in a world where we need to be constantly vigilant about predators or other potential dangers, but we are still hardwired to be ready to spring into action should a threat arise. Additionally, many of us have a difficult time shutting off the figurative “on switch” in our minds, which means that our stress levels remain high even when we are trying to lull ourselves to sleep. This is a relatively normal, if unfortunate, occurrence. In most cases, once the cause of the stress is resolved, individuals can resume normal patterns. For those with insomnia, however, the stressor appears to be the lack of sleep, and the desire for sleep becomes a stressor in itself. In other words, the fixation on getting sleep leads to feelings of stress over not falling asleep, which begins a vicious loop. According to a model first proposed by Kales et al. in , patients can develop a conditioned fear of not being able to sleep, which puts them in a state of hyperarousal when they attempt to fall asleep. This makes their inability to sleep a self-fulfilling prophecy. Supplemental research has corroborated this model. A German study published in the journal in 2014 observed that patients with insomnia responded to insomnia-related stimuli with increased amygdala activity that is associated with negative emotions. Once again, this indicates that the fear of insomnia, which may be aroused by stimuli patients associate with insomnia, can be at the root of insomnia itself. For clinicians, the authors of the study suggest that treatment options should include strategies that address the negative emotions associated with insomnia and sleep. This would include offering relaxation training (breathing techniques, , guided imagery, etc.), as well as treatment () in more difficult cases. Ultimately, the objective may not be to merely to treat the patient’s insomnia, but to also treat the patient’s fear of insomnia and to resolve any negative emotions associated with sleep.

The autonomic nervous system is a control system that acts largely unconsciously and regulates bodily functions, such as the , , , , , and . This system is the primary mechanism in control of the . The autonomic nervous system is regulated by integrated through the to the and . Autonomic functions include , (the cardiac control center), activity (the ), and certain such as , , and . Those are then subdivided into other areas and are also linked to autonomic subsystems and the peripheral nervous system. The , just above the , acts as an integrator for autonomic functions, receiving autonomic input from the . The autonomic nervous system has three branches: the , the and the . Some textbooks do not include the enteric nervous system as part of this system. The sympathetic nervous system is often considered the """" system, while the parasympathetic nervous system is often considered the ""rest and digest"" or ""feed and breed"" system. In many cases, both of these systems have ""opposite"" actions where one system activates a physiological response and the other inhibits it. An older simplification of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems as ""excitatory"" and ""inhibitory"" was overturned due to the many exceptions found. A more modern characterization is that the sympathetic nervous system is a ""quick response mobilizing system"" and the parasympathetic is a ""more slowly activated system"", but even this has exceptions, such as in and , wherein both play a role. There are and between . Relatively recently, a third subsystem of neurons that have been named (because they use as a ) have been described and found to be integral in autonomic function, in particular in the gut and the . Although the ANS is also known as the visceral nervous system, the ANS is only connected with the motor side. Most autonomous functions are involuntary but they can often work in conjunction with the which provides voluntary control. Autonomic nervous system, showing in middle, and the vagus nerve as ""X"" in blue. The heart and organs below in list to right are regarded as viscera. The autonomic nervous system is divided into the and . The sympathetic division emerges from the in the and areas, terminating around L2-3. The parasympathetic division has craniosacral “outflow”, meaning that the neurons begin at the (specifically the , , and ) and (S2-S4) spinal cord. The autonomic nervous system is unique in that it requires a sequential two-neuron efferent pathway; the preganglionic neuron must first synapse onto a postganglionic neuron before innervating the target organ. The preganglionic, or first, neuron will begin at the “outflow” and will synapse at the postganglionic, or second, neuron's cell body. The postganglionic neuron will then synapse at the target organ. The sympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in the from T1 to L2/3. These cell bodies are and are the preganglionic neurons. There are several locations upon which preganglionic neurons can synapse for their postganglionic neurons: (3) of the sympathetic chain (these run on either side of the vertebral bodies) (12) and rostral (2 or 3) (celiac ganglion, aorticorenal ganglion, superior mesenteric ganglion, inferior mesenteric ganglion) of the (this is the one exception to the two-neuron pathway rule: the synapse is directly efferent onto the target cell bodies) These ganglia provide the postganglionic neurons from which innervation of target organs follows. Examples of are: Cervical cardiac nerves and thoracic visceral nerves, which synapse in the sympathetic chain (greater, lesser, least), which synapse in the prevertebral ganglia , which synapse in the prevertebral ganglia , which synapse in the inferior hypogastric plexus These all contain afferent (sensory) nerves as well, known as . The parasympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in one of two locations: the (Cranial Nerves III, VII, IX, X) or the sacral spinal cord (S2, S3, S4). These are the preganglionic neurons, which synapse with postganglionic neurons in these locations: of the head: Ciliary (), Submandibular (), Pterygopalatine (), and Otic () In or near the wall of an organ innervated by the Vagus () or (S2, S3, S4) These ganglia provide the postganglionic neurons from which innervations of target organs follows. Examples are: The postganglionic parasympathetic splanchnic (visceral) nerves The , which passes through the thorax and abdominal regions innervating, among other organs, the heart, lungs, liver and stomach The sensory arm is composed of primary visceral sensory neurons found in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), in cranial sensory ganglia: the geniculate, petrosal and nodose ganglia, appended respectively to cranial nerves VII, IX and X. These sensory neurons monitor the levels of carbon dioxide, oxygen and sugar in the blood, arterial pressure and the chemical composition of the stomach and gut content. They also convey the sense of taste and smell, which, unlike most functions of the ANS, is a conscious perception. Blood oxygen and carbon dioxide are in fact directly sensed by the carotid body, a small collection of chemosensors at the bifurcation of the carotid artery, innervated by the petrosal (IXth) ganglion. Primary sensory neurons project (synapse) onto “second order” visceral sensory neurons located in the medulla oblongata, forming the nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS), that integrates all visceral information. The nTS also receives input from a nearby chemosensory center, the area postrema, that detects toxins in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid and is essential for chemically induced vomiting or conditional taste aversion (the memory that ensures that an animal that has been poisoned by a food never touches it again). All this visceral sensory information constantly and unconsciously modulates the activity of the motor neurons of the ANS. Autonomic nerves travel to organs throughout the body. Most organs receive parasympathetic supply by the and sympathetic supply by . The sensory part of the latter reaches the at certain . Pain in any internal organ is perceived as , more specifically as pain from the corresponding to the spinal segment. Autonomic nervous supply to organs in the Motor neurons of the autonomic nervous system are found in ‘’autonomic ganglia’’. Those of the parasympathetic branch are located close to the target organ whilst the ganglia of the sympathetic branch are located close to the spinal cord. The sympathetic ganglia here, are found in two chains: the pre-vertebral and pre-aortic chains. The activity of autonomic ganglionic neurons is modulated by “preganglionic neurons” located in the central nervous system. Preganglionic sympathetic neurons are located in the spinal cord, at the thorax and upper lumbar levels. Preganglionic parasympathetic neurons are found in the medulla oblongata where they form visceral motor nuclei; the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve; the nucleus ambiguus, the , and in the sacral region of the spinal cord. Sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions typically function in opposition to each other. But this opposition is better termed complementary in nature rather than antagonistic. For an analogy, one may think of the sympathetic division as the accelerator and the parasympathetic division as the brake. The sympathetic division typically functions in actions requiring quick responses. The parasympathetic division functions with actions that do not require immediate reaction. The sympathetic system is often considered the """" system, while the parasympathetic system is often considered the ""rest and digest"" or ""feed and breed"" system. However, many instances of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity cannot be ascribed to ""fight"" or ""rest"" situations. For example, standing up from a reclining or sitting position would entail an unsustainable drop in blood pressure if not for a compensatory increase in the arterial sympathetic tonus. Another example is the constant, second-to-second, modulation of heart rate by sympathetic and parasympathetic influences, as a function of the respiratory cycles. In general, these two systems should be seen as permanently modulating vital functions, in usually antagonistic fashion, to achieve . Higher organisms maintain their integrity via homeostasis which relies on negative feedback regulation which, in turn, typically depends on the autonomic nervous system. Some typical actions of the sympathetic and are listed below. Increase peristalsis and amount of secretion by digestive glands Stimulates; increases production of saliva and tears Stimulates to increase bulging of lens for close vision Inhibits; decrease bulging of lens; prepares for distant vision Stimulate medulla cells to secrete epinephrine and norepinephrine Promotes a , corresponds with arousal and energy generation, and inhibits digestion Diverts blood flow away from the (GI) tract and via Blood flow to and the is enhanced (by as much as 1200% in the case of skeletal muscles) Dilates of the lung through circulating , which allows for greater oxygen exchange Increases and the of cardiac cells (), thereby providing a mechanism for enhanced blood flow to skeletal muscles Dilates and relaxes the to the lens, allowing more light to enter the eye and enhances far vision Provides for the of the Constricts all the intestinal and the urinary sphincter The parasympathetic nervous system has been said to promote a ""rest and digest"" response, promotes calming of the nerves return to regular function, and enhancing digestion. Functions of nerves within the parasympathetic nervous system include: Dilating blood vessels leading to the GI tract, increasing the blood flow. Constricting the bronchiolar diameter when the need for oxygen has diminished Dedicated cardiac branches of the and thoracic nerves impart parasympathetic control of the () Constriction of the pupil and contraction of the , facilitating and allowing for closer vision Stimulating secretion, and accelerates , mediating digestion of food and, indirectly, the absorption of nutrients Sexual. Nerves of the peripheral nervous system are involved in the erection of genital tissues via the 2–4. They are also responsible for stimulating sexual arousal. The enteric nervous system is the intrinsic nervous system of the . It has been described as ""the Second Brain of the Human Body"". Its functions include: Sensing chemical and mechanical changes in the gut Main articles: and A flow diagram showing the process of stimulation of adrenal medulla that makes it release adrenaline, that further acts on adrenoreceptors, indirectly mediating or mimicking sympathetic activity. At the effector organs, sympathetic ganglionic neurons release (norepinephrine), along with other such as , to act on , with the exception of the sweat glands and the adrenal medulla: is the preganglionic neurotransmitter for both divisions of the ANS, as well as the postganglionic neurotransmitter of parasympathetic neurons. Nerves that release acetylcholine are said to be cholinergic. In the parasympathetic system, ganglionic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter to stimulate muscarinic receptors. At the , there is no postsynaptic neuron. Instead the presynaptic neuron releases acetylcholine to act on . Stimulation of the adrenal medulla releases (epinephrine) into the bloodstream, which acts on adrenoceptors, thereby indirectly mediating or mimicking sympathetic activity. A full table is found at . The specialised system of the autonomic nervous system was recognised by . In 1665, Willis used the terminology, and in 1900, Langley used the term, defining the two divisions as the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. is a found in commonly consumed beverages such as coffee, tea, and sodas. Short-term physiological effects of caffeine include increased and sympathetic nerve outflow. Habitual consumption of caffeine may inhibit physiological short-term effects. Consumption of caffeinated espresso increases parasympathetic activity in habitual caffeine consumers; however, decaffeinated espresso inhibits parasympathetic activity in habitual caffeine consumers. It is possible that other bioactive ingredients in decaffeinated espresso may also contribute to the inhibition of parasympathetic activity in habitual caffeine consumers. Caffeine is capable of increasing work capacity while individuals perform strenuous tasks. In one study, caffeine provoked a greater maximum while a strenuous task was being performed compared to a . This tendency is likely due to caffeine's ability to increase sympathetic nerve outflow. Furthermore, this study found that recovery after intense exercise was slower when caffeine was consumed prior to exercise. This finding is indicative of caffeine's tendency to inhibit parasympathetic activity in non-habitual consumers. The caffeine-stimulated increase in nerve activity is likely to evoke other physiological effects as the body attempts to maintain . The effects of caffeine on parasympathetic activity may vary depending on the position of the individual when autonomic responses are measured. One study found that the seated position inhibited autonomic activity after caffeine consumption (75 mg); however, parasympathetic activity increased in the supine position. This finding may explain why some habitual caffeine consumers (75 mg or less) do not experience short-term effects of caffeine if their routine requires many hours in a seated position. It is important to note that the data supporting increased parasympathetic activity in the supine position was derived from an experiment involving participants between the ages of 25 and 30 who were considered healthy and sedentary. Caffeine may influence autonomic activity differently for individuals who are more active or elderly. """" at Schmidt, A; Thews, G (1989). ""Autonomic Nervous System"". In Janig, W (ed.). (2 ed.).

Patients must be aged 18 or older and diagnosed with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure while in the upright position) due to Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure or autonomic neuropathies (i.e. neurogenic orthostatic hypotension). Symptoms of low blood pressure include dizziness, lightheadedness, changes in vision and generalized weakness upon standing. The main effect of the drug being studied is to increase blood pressure in the upright position so symptoms will decrease. The purpose of this clinical study is to further assess the clinical effect of high dose midodrine hydrochloride (ProAmatine®), an approved treatment for orthostatic hypotension. During the course of the study, participants will receive either ProAmatine® or a placebo. Assessments will be made using questionnaires that measure symptom and activity levels. Blood pressure in the lying down, sitting and standing positions will be measured. Patients will also complete standing time assessments. They will be asked to remain standing without moving until they feel sufficiently lightheaded, or dizzy, or feel faint so that they would feel more comfortable sitting down. A Study for Patients With Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension We are seeking male and female patients to voluntarily take part in a clinical research study. Patients must be aged 18 or older and diagnosed with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure while in the upright position) due to Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure or autonomic neuropathies (i.e. neurogenic orthostatic hypotension). Symptoms of low blood pressure include dizziness, lightheadedness, changes in vision and generalized weakness upon standing. The main effect of the drug being studied is to increase blood pressure in the upright position so symptoms will decrease. The purpose of this clinical study is to further assess the clinical benefit of midodrine hydrochloride (ProAmatine®), an approved treatment for orthostatic hypotension. During the course of the study, participants will receive either ProAmatine® or a placebo. Assessments will be made using questionnaires that measure symptom and activity levels. Blood pressure in the lying down and standing positions will be measured at each visit. Treatment of Orthostatic Hypotension in Autonomic Failure The autonomic nervous system serves multiple regulatory functions in the body, including the regulation of blood pressure and heart rate, gut motility, sweating and sexual function. There are several diseases characterized by abnormal function of the autonomic nervous system. Medications can also alter autonomic function. Impairment of the autonomic nervous system by diseases or drugs may lead to several symptoms, including blood pressure problems (e.g., high blood pressure lying down and low blood pressure on standing), sweating abnormalities, constipation or diarrhea and sexual dysfunction. Because treatment options for these patients are limited. We propose to study patients autonomic failure and low blood pressure upon standing and determine the cause of their disease by history and examination and their response to autonomic testing which have already been standardized in our laboratory. Based on their possible cause, we will tests different medications that may alleviate their symptoms. , or This preview shows a limited data set for full access, or try a Export unavailable in trial. for complete access.

Obesity-induced autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction is related to cardiac disease. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of autogenic training (AT), a therapeutic relaxation technique, on cardiac ANS functions as evaluated by heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate recovery (HRR) in Japanese obese/overweight subjects. Subjects were 40 obese/overweight male workers (42.7 ± 8.8 years old, BMI 28.8 ± 3.3 kg/m2). The subjects were randomly assigned to an AT intervention group and a control group. Subjects of the intervention group were required to perform the AT training procedures (first-third steps) for three months, while the control group participants were waiting. Before and after intervention, HRV was calculated using a 24 hr Holter ECG, and HRR was assessed by a treadmill test. In addition, Profile of Mood States (POMS), job stress and sleep conditions were assessed. Effects of AT intervention were statistically examined using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). For the HRV, the ratio of the Low Frequency to the High Frequency (LF/HF) during sleep was significantly reduced in the AT group (-39.2% and -0.6%, respectively, p=0.009). HRR was lengthened in the AT group (5.2% and 0.6%, respectively, p=0.042). In addition, the Confusion-Bewilderment score in POMS was improved in the AT group. However, mediation analysis indicated that the Confusion-Bewilderment score was not considered as a mediator between AT and ANS. A three month AT intervention improved cardiac ANS activities in Japanese obese/overweight men. These results suggest the beneficial effects of AT on -related cardiovascular conditions. Randomized control trial; Relaxation; Autonomic nervous system; Obesity; Sympathetic/parasympathetic Obesity induces autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction, which is related to an increased risk of , diabetes mellitus, , cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, sudden death, and all causes of [-]. Heart rate variability (HRV) in the ambulatory condition and heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise are widely used as standard tools for assessing the ANS activities. Low HRV and short HRR are generally considered as unfavorable ANS function [,]. Previous studies indicated a close association of obesity with reduced HRV and HRR [-], and that a weight loss in obesity increased HRV and prolonged HRR [-]. Autogenic training (AT) is a self-administered relaxation technique developed by Shultz et al. [] and widely used for the improvement of various psychological stress-related conditions such as anxiety, headache, irritable bowel syndrome, and other psychosomatic diseases [-]. From the practical point of view, comparing with other relaxation techniques, AT technique is easier for the subjects to master and execute by themselves in daily life because its procedure is simple and well structured. Although the exact mechanisms of the AT on these conditions are still unclear, some studies demonstrate that AT improved HRV in subjects with some sort of mental distress such as fire service workers or patients with anxiety disorders [,]. These results suggested that AT might modify ANS function in a similar fashion to other relaxation techniques or biofeedback procedures [,]. However, very few studies have assessed the relationship of AT with ANS in healthy subjects without psychosomatic disorders. In this randomized clinical study, we examined the effect of AT on ANS functions in healthy overweight/obesity men. Fifty-five overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m) working-age men who participated in a weight reduction program conducted by Aichi Medical University Institute of , and , were enrolled []. All the participants were naive to AT. The protocol of the study, which was approved by the Ethical Committee at Aichi Medical University, was explained in detail and a written informed consent was obtained from each subject. One subject who was under 20 years old and one subject who refused to undergo a Holter ECG was excluded from this study. A total of 53 participants were randomly assigned either to the AT intervention (n=25) or control (n=28) group (). Flow of participants through the study phases. Two subjects were excluded because they started their medical treatment during the three-month intervention. Two subjects were also excluded because their body weight changed over 5% from baseline during the three months [-]. Nine subjects were excluded because of technical error in collecting the Holter ECG data and/or Exercise test. In total, the data of 40 subjects (AT intervention group: n=21, Control group: n=19, ) was analyzed in the study. All of them were regular [,] employees working at several small and mediumsized enterprises in Japan. No subject was taking β-blockers, any cardiac medication that could affect their HR, any diabetic medication including insulin, or treatment of sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) [,,]. No subject had any history of , sleep disorders, and other psychosomatic or mental illness [,]. No subject changed their smoking habits during the study [,]. Participants were randomly assigned to the AT intervention or control group. Participants of the AT intervention group were required to carry out AT twice every day for three months, while those of the control group were waiting without any instructions (). All participants were asked to maintain their habits of smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and food intake during the intervention period [,,]. At the start and end of the intervention period, physical examination was conducted. Blood sampling was conducted in the morning after an overnight fast. Plasma glucose was analyzed in duplicate using the hexokinase method, serum insulin was measured using the chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay method, and the Homeostasis Model Assessment score of insulin resistance (HOMA-R) was calculated with the following formula: fasting insulin (mU ml) × fasting glucose (mmol l)/405. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured by the latex agglutination method. All blood sample analyses were performed in the same laboratory (SRL, Nagoya, Japan). Blood pressure was measured three times with a fully automated sphygmomanometer (TM-2655; A&D, Tokyo, Japan) after sitting quietly for five minutes. The average of the three BP measurements was calculated as Rest BP. BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m). Daily physical activity was measured using a triaxial accelerometer (Carpod, Medi Link, Toyota, Japan). On regular working days before and after intervention, the subjects wore the accelerometer for 24 hr. At the same time, HRV and HRR data were collected. Medical history, current therapeutic regime, smoking habit, and alcohol consumption were recorded by using a self-report questionnaire. Psychological conditions were assessed by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) brief form Japanese version []. Job strain, as defined by the job demands/control model [], was measured by the Japanese short version of the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) at each examination. Sleep condition was assessed by using the Japanese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [,]. Before the AT intervention, the subjects of AT group were instructed in the tranquility (calmness of feeling), first (heaviness exercise) and second (warmth exercise) standard AT exercise by a trained therapist. The AT procedure was instructed by the same therapist (T.H.). The training was conducted during a 60 min group (2-4 participants) session. They were requested to perform the AT exercises twice (after awaking and before sleeping) a day, and to record a log of the times of their AT exercise for three months. Before and after intervention, 2-channel 24 hr ambulatory ECG was conducted. The HRV was analyzed on a Holter analysis system (ML analyzer; Medi Link, Toyota, Japan). The digitized R-R intervals were recorded and stored, and the power spectral densities were computed using the maximum entropy method (MEM) from the 24 hr and nocturnal data []. The power spectral densities were analyzed in three areas of concentration of spectral power by means of MEM. In these two areas, low-frequency power (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) was analyzed as an index of the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activity, and high-frequency power (HF: 0.15-0.4 Hz) was analyzed as an index of parasympathetic nervous activity. The ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF), an indirect index of sympathetic nervous system activity [,], was calculated for each data set. The subjects performed a reach symptom-limited maximal treadmill test (STRESS TEST SYSTEM ML-6500: Fukuda Denshi, Tokyo, Japan) using a Bruce protocol [] at the checkups before and after intervention. Medications were not changed or stopped before testing. The subjects wore a mask to estimate their ventilation by collecting real time VO and VCO (OXYCON-PRO: Fukuda Denshi, Tokyo, Japan). Peak exercise, the criteria for exercise cassation, was defined as symptom-limited or achievement of the point when VCO surpassed VO, whereby the respiratory exchange ratio (RER value) was greater than 1.04. Every one minute during and after exercise, and at peak exercise, heart rate (measured by ECG in 12 derivations) and blood pressure (measured by arm-cuff sphygnomanometry) were collected. HRR was defined as the HR difference between at the peak and one minute after the peak []. We designed the study to have 80% power to detect a 1.0 difference between the groups in the decreased range of LF/HF, according to previous studies to examine the effects of AT on HRV [,]. Alpha was set at 0.05. With this assumption, the sample size in this study was estimated as 21. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. After examining the normality of distribution of all numerical variables using Shapiro–Wilk test, between-group differences at baseline were assessed using by the unpaired t test (normally distributed variables) or Mann-Whitney’s U test (non-normally distributed variables). Chi-square test was used to examine the difference in categorical variables. At the baseline, two variables, Job-control score of JCQ and Vigor- Activity score of POMS, were skewed among two groups. Thus, Spearman’s correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the association of HRV index and HRR with age [], Job-control and Vigor-Activity. To examine the significance of the effects of AT intervention, onefactor analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the three-month value as a dependent variable and with the use of a baseline value as covariate was used. Spectral measures (LF and HF) were log transformed (ln) prior to this analysis. To assess whether the improvement in psychological or sleeping condition accounted for the improvement in ANS, mediation analysis [,] were performed. According to this analysis, when (1) there is a significant relationship between AT and ANS, (2) there is a significant relationship between AT and a variable, and (3) the variable is a significant predictor of ANS in an equation including both the variable and the AT, this variable is considered as a mediator. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. SPSS 21.0 for Windows (SPSS Tokyo, Japan) was used for the statistical analysis. The baseline characteristics are presented in . There was no significant difference between the groups except for the Job-control score of JCQ and the Vigor-Activity score of POMS. Age was significantly correlated with nocturnal HF (r=-0.365, p=0.021) and HRR (r=-0.503, p=0.001). Job control score was significantly correlated with nocturnal LF (r=-0.382, p=0.015). There were no significant associations of Vigor-Activity score with HRV and HRR.

Effect of AT intervention on physiological, biochemical and psychological variables shows the physiological, biochemical and psychological variables before and after the three-month intervention. The AT intervention had no effect on almost all of these variables except for the Confusion-Bewilderment score of POMS. Confusion-Bewilderment score was significantly improved in the AT group compared to the control group (-16.3% and 16.3%, respectively; p=0.023, ).

This significant effect of AT did not change even after adjusting for age (p=0.011). Other HRV indices were not affected by the intervention (). There were no correlations between the change of nocturnal LF/HF and that of the PSQI score in both AT and control groups (r=0.153, p=0.507).

We conducted a mediation analysis [,] to clarify mediating roles of the psychological state (POMS) or sleep condition (PSQI) in linking between AT and ANS (nocturnal LF/HF and HRR). While the score of Confusion-Bewilderment of POMS significantly increased in the AT group, regression analysis did not reveal any significant relationship between the score and nocturnal LF/HF and HRR. There are few studies investigating the effects of AT on HRV and results of these studies are not consistent. Mitani et al. [] indicated a beneficial effect of 2 month AT intervention on sympathetic (LF/HF) and parasympathetic (HF/total power) nervous activity changes, and Miu et al. [], in their experimental study, presented a remarkable increase of parasympathetic activities (HF). In contrast, both Lim et al. [] and Kim et al. [] noted no significant changes in HRV by 8 week AT intervention. These inconsistent of the results might be partially due to a considerable difference in the contents or length of AT applied as intervention and in the parameters used for assessment of HRV. In addition, inter-individual differences even in resting ANS activities and their response to AT might be so variable that the effects of AT could have been concealed. In the present study, however, nocturnal LF/HF which is an index of cardiac sympathetic activity of HRV [,] was significantly reduced in the AT group. Many studies have indicated that obesity might lead to cardiac diseases or other metabolic diseases [-] through increase of cardiac sympathetic activity and the predominance of sympathetic tone during sleep might facilitate the onset of cardiovascular accidents. In addition, suppressive of sympathetic tone is thought to improve cardiac remodeling, which is relevance in obesity and associated with progressions of cardiovascular disease as well as []. AT might therefore have beneficial effects on eliminating the causal relationship between obesity and cardiovascular diseases. In the study, however, lowering effects on LF/HF was observed only during sleep at night but not during the day because LF/HF might be highly variable depending on the daily activities of the subject. In AT group, HRR after exercise test was significantly increased. Previous studies have shown that weight loss [,], regular aerobic training [], treatment of SAS [] and intake of omega-3 fatty acid [] could elevate HRR. However, the present study is the first report indicating the effects of AT on HRR. HRR is considered to express complex autonomic functions, which is predominantly derived from parasympathetic reactivation with reducing sympathetic activity, and is an important predictor of type 2 [] and the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases []. The results of HRR, an autonomic nervous function after exercise cessation, also suggest that AT intervention may reduce cardiac risk in obesity. It has been reported that AT could improve psychological or mental strain among subjects with mental disorders or in high-stress situations []. In this study, the Confusion-Bewilderment score of POMS was improved by AT (). However, no remarkable effects were observed on the other scores such as Depression-Dejection or Tension-Anxiety scores. These results suggest that daily AT training could not induce an improvement in all aspects of psychological distress in healthy subjects. Although some studies have indicated an effectiveness of AT in subjects with insomnia [], we did not observe any effects on sleep conditions assessed by PSQI in our study. However, sleep conditions were assessed by a self-report questionnaire (PSQI). Further studies using objective physiological parameters for evaluating sleep condition are needed. Lucini et al. [] reported that behavioral and relaxation interventions improved ANS dysfunction by improving high-stress condition in subjects with stressful situations. In their study, stress conditions were considered as mediators of ANS dysfunctions. In the present study, mediation analysis revealed that reduced nocturnal LF/HF and increased HRR were not mediated by improvement of any psychological or mental conditions. From these results, it is likely that AT directly improved the obese-induced ANS dysfunction. The mental stress mediated ANS dysfunction might be exaggerated by obesity [], which in turn, increases cardiovascular risk through accelerating cardiovascular reactivity to mental stress [,]. In addition, sympathetic activation may contribute to the development of future abdominal adiposity []. The exact mechanisms of AT benefit requires further clarification. In the present study, AT had no significant effects on sleep conditions. There were also no correlations between changes of ANS and that of sleep conditions. Our study has several limitations. First, the sample size of the present study (n=40) was smaller than the estimated size due to subject omission from technical errors in measurement. In addition, as the inter-individual differences in cardiac ANS activities were originally considerable, it would be difficult to detect statistically significant differences in the changes of ANS activities between the two groups. Second, our sample was Japanese obese/overweight male worker. There are some differences in the association of obesity with cardiac or metabolic risk between Western countries and Japanese people []. We also did not assess effects of AT on ANS in non-obese or female people. Thus, our results and interpretations must be carefully generalization. Third, although daily AT practice was required for subjects of the AT group, we could not monitor their exact implementation status in the daily life. Therefore, this may results in large differences in the effects of AT performance among the subjects. Fourth, we obtained a significant difference in cardiac autonomic nervous activity only during the night. However, subjects were not screened for through medical examinations but through a self-reported questionnaire. As nocturnal HRV and HRR are affected by sleep disorders such as insomnia [] or SAS [], which are prevalent among working-age Japanese obese men, the possibility that the results were confounded by a variety of sleep disorders among the subjects cannot be excluded. Finally, we did not assess ANS activity, especially sympathetic activity, using more reliable biochemical or electrophysiological indices of sympathetic activity. Grassi et al. indicated that the most reliable ways to measure sympathetic activity was direct recordings of sympathetic nerve traffic via microneurography and noradrenaline radiotracer methods []. A three month AT intervention reduced cardiac sympathetic activity during sleep, and increased parasympathetic activity in HRR in Japanese obese/overweight male workers. These results suggest the beneficial effects of AT on obesity-related cardiovascular or metabolic conditions.

2467b52b-a33d-411f-a42f-8c511c32ba14,"Psych Prep U Neurobiologic Theories and Psychopharmacology Which is considered the first-line treatment for bipolar disorder? LithiumLithium is considered the first-line treatment for bipolar disorder. Lithium is the most established mood stabilizer. The basic units of structure and function in the nervous system are called what? NeuronsNeurons, or nerve cells, are the basic units of structure and function in the nervous system. Glial cells provide mechanical and metabolic support for neurons. Each neuron consists of a cell body and snakelike extensions called dendrites and axons. Communicate information from one cell or cell group to anotherNeurotransmitters are referred to as first messengers, which means molecules that communicate information or change from one cell or cell group to another, cause an immediate effect, and are typically found in circuitry that produces behavior. You are caring for a mental health client who has developed difficulty with balance and muscle tone after a car accident that involved a head injury. Based on this information, what area of the brain was most likely injured in the accident? CerebellumThe cerebellum coordinates the voluntary muscles and maintains balance and muscle tone. The diencephalon maintains homeostasis and controls the autonomic nervous system and the pituitary gland. The brain stem connects the cerebrum and diencephalon with the spinal cord. The pons helps regulate respiration The mental health nurse instructs a client prescribed phenelzine to avoid aged foods, such as wine and cheese. For which reasons are these instructions important for client safety? The foods contain tyramine, which may provoke hypertensive crisis.Monoamine oxidase inhibitors contain tyramine, which can trigger hypertensive crisis. The client must be instructed to avoid all aged foods. None of the other options provide accurate information about the association of the medication and the suggested foods. During the stabilization phase of drug therapy for a client who is hospitalized with a psychiatric disorder, which action would be most appropriate? Assessing the client for target symptoms and side effectsDuring stabilization, the medication dosage is adjusted or titrated to achieve the maximum amount of improvement with a minimum of side effects. Psychiatric-mental health nurses assess target symptoms, looking for changes or improvements and side effects. Education about relapse prevention and target symptoms and assessing if the medication is losing its effect occur during the maintenance phase. Tapering occurs during the discontinuation phase. A client receiving an antipsychotic agent develops acute extrapyramidal symptoms. Which response by the nurse would be most appropriate? ""These are the results of the drug and can be treated; your illness is not getting worse.""Individuals with acute extrapyramidal symptoms need frequent reassurance that these are not a worsening of their psychiatric condition but instead are treatable side effects of the medication. They also need validation that what they are experiencing is real and that the nurse is concerned and will be responsive to changes in these symptoms. Extrapyramidal symptoms are not indicative of an allergy. Photosensitivity occurs with antipsychotic agents and sunlight. After teaching a client who is prescribed imipramine about the drug, the nurse determines that the education was effective when the client states what? ""I need to be careful because the drug can make me sleepy.""Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant and is associated with sedation, orthostatic hypertension, and anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth and constipation. The client needs to be careful with activities because the drug is sedating. The client should change positions slowly to minimize orthostatic hypotension. Sugarless candies, good oral hygiene, and frequent rinsing of the mouth are helpful to combat dry mouth. A high fiber intake would be appropriate to decrease possible constipation. What part of the brain would be responsible for activities such as walking and dancing? CerebellumThe cerebellum, which is located behind and below the cerebrum, controls and coordinates muscle movement integral to physical activities such as walking and dancing. Cerebrum, midbrain, and brain stem are incorrect. The nurse is assessing a client who is on a psychotropic drug. The client primarily complains about gaining weight and feeling sleepy. Which action of the drug would most likely have caused these effects? The drug blocks histamine uptake.Some psychotropic drugs like chlorpromazine are known to block histamine uptake. Histamine is responsible for peripheral allergic responses, control of gastric secretions, cardiac stimulation, and alertness. Thus, blocking of histamine receptors would cause weight gain, hypotension, and sedation. The drugs that block serotonin reuptake, such as some antidepressants, cause improved mood. Dopamine is an excitatory neurotransmitter and this action would not lead to sleepiness or weight gain. Excess production of norepinephrine would cause anxiety disorder. All but which are currently used neuroimaging techniques? Electrocardiogram (ECG)Current neuroimaging techniques include computed axial tomography (CAT) scan, positron-emission tomography (PET) scan, single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), angiography, ultrasonography, and polysomnography. Which correctly describes the primary effect of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant drug? Its ability to block the reuptake of serotoninAn SSRI antidepressant drug's primary effect typically involves its ability to block the reuptake of serotonin, not the management of the symptomology related to depression, the inhibition of the hormonal cascase, nor the increase in the number of serotonin receptor sites. When a client who is generally pleasant and cooperative begins to show aggressive behavior toward most clients in a community care facility, the nurse suspects the client has experienced cerebral trauma. Which brain structure is responsible? Frontal lobesFrontal lobe damage shows symptoms that include loss of emotional control, rage, violent behavior as well as changes in mood and personality and uncharacteristic behavior. Thus, when a client who is generally pleasant and cooperative begins to show aggressive behavior toward most members of the milieu, the nurse suspects the client has experienced cerebral trauma to the frontal lobe. Temporal, occipital, and limbic lobe damage do not exhibit aggressive behavior or personality changes. Which medication classification blocks serotonin reuptake? AntidepressantThe medication classification, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, blocks the reuptake of serotonin. Antianxiety, antibiotic, and antimanic medications do not block the reuptake of serotonin. Which client would not be able to undergo a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI)? A client with a pacemakerClients with pacemakers or metal implants, such as heart valves or orthopedic devices, cannot undergo an MRI. There are not contraindications for obese clients can to undergo an MRI. Clients who are claustrophobic or those with anxiety can have an MRI but may need special intervention such as sedation. A client is seen in an outpatient mental health clinic for complaints of involuntary tongue movement, blinking, and facial grimacing. This syndrome would be identified correctly as what? Tardive dyskinesiaThe symptoms of tardive dyskinesia include involuntary movements of the tongue, facial and neck muscles, upper and lower extremities, and truncal musculature. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potentially fatal reaction manifested by rigidity, high fever, and autonomic instability. Acute dystonia includes acute muscular rigidity and cramping, a stiff or thick tongue with difficulty swallowing, and, in severe cases, laryngospasm and respiratory difficulties. Akathisia is reported by the client as an intense need to move about. In the discharge instructions for a client who is taking alprazolam, the nurse should include what? Sudden cessation of alprazolam can cause rebound insomnia and nightmares.Clients who are taking alprazolam need to be taught that this medication must not be stopped abruptly. Frequently, abrupt cessation will cause severe rebound insomnia as well as nightmares. A group of nursing students is reviewing the role of serotonin in psychiatric disorders. The students demonstrate a need for additional study when they identify which disorder as being associated with its dysfunction? SchizophreniaSchizophrenia is associated with abnormally high activity of dopamine, not serotonin. Whereas depression and insomnia have been associated with decreased levels of 5-HT, mania has been associated with increased 5-HT. Some of the most well-known antidepressant medications, such as fluoxetine and sertraline, function by increasing serotonin concentrations within certain areas of the central nervous system. A client is experiencing acute stress leading to the stimulation of increased gastric acid. In this situation, which body system uses acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter? CholinergicThe cholinergic system uses acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. The dopaminergic system uses dopamine as its neurotransmitter. The GABA-ergic system uses GABA as its neurotransmitter. The noradrenergic system uses norepinephrine as its neurotransmitter. A client with Parkinson's disease is hospitalized on a medical unit. The nurse would be correct in identifying which neurotransmitter decreased in this disease? DopamineParkinson's disease develops from decreased availability of dopamine, while acetylcholine binding to muscle cells is impaired in myasthenia gravis. Therefore acetylcholine, neurontin, and serotonin are incorrect. Which is not an action expected of a benzodiazepine? AntidepressantBenzodiazepines do not function as an antidepressant. This drug classification has anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and antianxiety properties. Which side effect is associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)? Sexual dysfunctionSSRIs block neuronal transport of serotonin, which stimulates many postsynaptic receptor sites and probably contributes to associated side effects. These include nausea, vomiting, weight changes, agitation or restlessness, and delayed or impaired orgasm. Which is the most commonly seen adverse side effect of typical antipsychotics? Extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesiaThe greatest hazard of typical antipsychotics involves adverse effects, such as extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSs) and tardive dyskinesia. Risk of EPSs and other movement disorders is highest for clients who use older, high-potency neuroleptics, such as haloperidol or perphenazine, for long periods. Which is a major difference between the atypical antipsychotics (such as clozapine) and the typical antipsychotics (such as haloperidol)? Atypical antipsychotics block both serotonin and dopaminergic receptors.Typical antipsychotics do have side effects, often lead to weight gain, and, in rare cases, cause dysrhythmias and kidney failure. Thus, atypical antipsychotics block both serotonin and dopaminergic receptors is the correct answer. A client is having difficulty standing without assistance and is exhibiting swaying. The client has a history of falls. Which area of the brain is most likely affected? CerebellumThe cerebellum regulates postural balance and positioning. The hypothalamus regulates temperature. The thalamus functions as a regulatory structure to relay all sensory information, except smell, sent to the central nervous system from the peripheral nervous system. The hippocampus is involved in storing information, especially the emotions attached to memories. Clients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) for depression must be placed on a diet that is low in what? TyramineTyramine has a vasopressor effect that induces hypertension. If an individual ingests food that contains high concentrations of tyramine while taking MAOIs, severe headaches, palpitations, neck stiffness and soreness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, hypertension, stroke, and (in rare instances) death may result. Patients who are taking MAOIs are placed on a low-tyramine diet. Sodium, fat, and sugar are generally not restricted in patients receiving MAOIs. A college student wakes up and notices a racing heart and dilated pupils. The student is scheduled to write an exam later that morning. Which system is responsible for this physiological response? Sympathetic nervous systemThe sympathetic nervous system is stimulated by physical or emotional stress, such as strenuous exercise or work, pain hemorrhage, intense emotions, and temperature extremes. The specific body responses include: increased arterial blood pressure and cardiac output and pupil dilation to aid vision. The autonomic nervous system affects the cardiovascular function to decrease heart rate responses. The patient does not suffer from a cardiac irregularity. The release of dopamine will not affect pupillary response. In which way do neurons communicate through the use of synapses? ChemicallyNorepinephrine, a neurotransmitter, belongs to a group of structurally related chemicals called catecholamines that also includes dopamine, serotonin, and epinephrine. Neurons do not communicate electrically, excitatorily, or inhibitorily. A 46-year-old client sustained a closed-head injury 4 hours ago. The client now presents to the emergency department because the client is having difficulty breathing. This is a result of swelling surrounding which brain structure? Medulla oblongataThe hindbrain, which runs from the top of the spinal cord into the midbrain, is the most primitive area of the brain and contains the brain stem, where the pons and medulla oblongata are located. These areas of the brain control basic, vital functions, such as the respiratory centers, which control breathing; the cardiovascular centers, which regulate blood pressure; the chemoreceptor trigger zone and emetic zone, which control vomiting; the swallowing center, which coordinates the complex swallowing reflex; and the reticular activating system (RAS), which controls arousal and awareness of stimuli and contains the sleep center. What is the primary factor that contributes to the high cost of providing mental health care? most mental illnesses are chronic in naturePsychiatric care is costly because of the long-term nature of the disorders. Medication are only a part of the costs associated with the care of the mentally ill. Most mental illnesses do not result in aggressive behaviors and only a small percentage of those diagnosed with a mental illness are hospitalized. The psychiatric-mental health nurse needs to have a basic understanding of information that is unique to individual medications. Which factors that affect pharmacokinetics should the nurse know? Select all that apply ContraindicationsAdverse reactionsIndications for useFood and drug interactionsWhen responsible for the administration of medications, the psychiatric-mental health nurse needs to have a basic understanding of factors affecting pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics that include individual drugs' contraindications, adverse reactions, indications for use, and food and drug interactions. Cost of medication is useful knowledge for cost containment; however, it does not impact client safety. Therefore, it is not considered a priority with regard to medication knowledge. The therapeutic level of lithium range includes what 1 to 1.5 mEq/LTherapeutic levels in acute mania range from 0.8 to 1.4 mEq/L. Therapeutic maintenance doses range from 0.4 to 1 mEq/L. A nursing assessment of a client who has been diagnosed with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) would most likely reveal which signs? Hyperpyrexia, severe hypertension, and diaphoresisFever, hypertension, and diaphoresis are cardinal symptoms of NMS and should be immediately addressed. Dietary modifications are most likely necessary when a client is being treated with which antidepressant? Monoamine oxidase inhibitors(MAOIs)MAOIs are antidepressants that are well known for their multiple drug and food interactions. As such, dietary modifications are necessary. Such modifications are not normally necessary when a client is receiving SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, or atypical antidepressants. A client is receiving clozapine. For which life-threatening disorder should the nurse be alert when assessing this client? AgranulocytosisAgranulocytosis is an acute reaction that causes the individual's white blood cell count to drop to very low levels and concurrent neutropenia, a reduction in neutrophils in the blood, to develop. While the remaining options are potential side effects of antipsychotics, agranulocytosis is both life threatening and specific to clozapine A client is prescribed medication for a psychiatric disorder. After 3 days, the client reports being constipated. Which instruction would the nurse give the client? ""You need to eat more fruits and vegetables and drink more water.""The nurse should instruct the client to increase fiber and fluid intake. A mild laxative, exercise, and fiber supplement also may help the client's constipation. High-protein foods would have no effect on constipation. Stool softeners may be appropriate if an increase in fiber and fluids is ineffective. The side effect will not necessarily disappear. A client has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. His symptoms of spasticity are related to a decrease in which neurotransmitter? DopamineA client with Parkinson's disease develops symptoms of spasticity related to a decrease in dopamine. A client with Parkinson's disease will have an increase in acetylcholine. Adrenocorticotropic hormone and serotonin will not be influenced in relation to the disease process. A client in the operating room goes into malignant hyperthermia due to an abnormal reaction to the anesthetic. The nurse knows that the area of the brain that regulates body temperature is what? HypothalamusThe hypothalamus plays an important role in the endocrine system because it regulates the pituitary secretion of hormones that influence metabolism, reproduction, stress response, and urine production. It works with the pituitary to maintain fluid balance through hormonal release and maintains temperature regulation by promoting vasoconstriction or vasodilatation. In addition, the hypothalamus is the site of the hunger center and is involved in appetite control. A professional boxer has suffered several concussions while boxing. Since retirement, the client has experienced periods of depression and suffers from short-term memory loss. Which provides the best explanation for the neurological basis of the client's symptoms? Damage to the hippocampusDamage to the hippocampus causes short-term memory loss and lack of motivation. Damage of the nucleus accumbeus does not cause memory loss. Damage to the thalamus results in obsessive-compulsive behavior or decreased ability to experience pleasure. Damage to the medulla affects circulation and respiration. A nurse is assessing a child with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. The child has severe uncontrollable temper outbursts and repeatedly bangs the head on the wall or door. When considering medication for treatment, the nurse knows which will be the most effective? HaloperidolAntipsychotic medication like haloperidol is used to treat specific symptoms such as temper tantrums and stereotypic behavior (repeatedly bangs head on the wall or door). Pemoline and methylphenidate are used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Imipramine is used to treat enuresis. One of the most common ways in which neurotransmitters are deactivated within the nervous system at the neuronal level is: enzymatic degradation, primarily by monoamine oxidase (MAO). OlanzapineOlanzapine is considered an atypical antipsychotic. Haloperidol, thioridazine, and thiothixene are considered conventional antipsychotics Excess tyramine caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can result in what? Hypertensive crisisNormally, MAO breaks down tyramine; however, because MAOIs inhibit MAO, tyramine can accumulate in the bodies of clients taking these drugs and eating tyramine-rich foods. Tyramine also releases norepinephrine from nerve endings. These metabolic actions can precipitate a hypertensive crisis. Which client is most likely to benefit from treatment with an antiparkinsonism agent? A client who has a medication-induced movement disorder.Antiparkinsonism agents have been used to treat medication-induced movement disorders, such as neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism. The presence of lithium toxicity or the use of antidepressants or ECT is not likely to necessitate the use of antiparkinsonism agents. A client is being seen in the mental health clinic. The client has been on haloperidol for 8 months and is now exhibiting tongue protrusion, lip smacking, and rapid eye blinking. A nurse would document this chronic syndrome as: A client with schizophrenia is erratic in adhering to the antipsychotic regimen. What action best addresses this client's lack of adherence? Changing the client's medication route to intramuscular depotDepot medications can effectively compensate for a client's lack of adherence and are likely to be more effective in the long term than a system of rewards and consequences. Antipsychotics are not administered intravenously. The use of benzodiazepines will have no effect on adherence. A client taking lithium comes to the hospital for a 2-week follow-up. The client complains of a hand tremor that keeps from holding a coffee cup and states that the client feels confused, has stomach aches, and trips occasionally. Which would be the most therapeutic intervention of the psychiatric nurse? Call the client's psychiatrist because her symptoms are indicative of moderate toxicity A client who has been taking paroxetine for 3 years for depression abruptly discontinues the drug. For which signs and symptoms should the nurse monitor the client? Diarrhea and agitationWhen a client who has been taking paroxetine for 3 years for depression abruptly discontinues the drug, the psychiatric nurse assesses him frequently for diarrhea and agitation. The signs and symptoms identified in the remaining options are not associated with withdrawal from the abrupt discontinuation of paroxetine. Benzodiazepines increase which neurotransmitter function? GABADrugs that increase GABA function, such as benzodiazepines, are used to treat anxiety and to induce sleep. Benzodiazepines do not increase the function of serotonin, norepinephrine, or acetylcholine. Which reason do clients cite most frequently as the cause for self-discontinuation of medication? Intolerable side effectsClients may have many reasons for failing to adhere to medication regimens. The most frequent reason is adverse effects, many of which are debilitating and difficult to manage. Extrapyramidal side effects are characterized by a triad of symptoms, including what? Dystonia, akathisia, and pseudoparkinsonismExtrapyramidal side effects do not influence a client's affect. They include pseudoparkinsonism, dystonia, and akathisia A client has been discharged from the hospital with a prescription for lorazepam. Which instruction should the nurse provide to this client? ""Make sure that you don't drink any alcohol when you're taking this medication.""Interactions between benzodiazepines and alcohol can be lethal. Drowsiness, not insomnia, is likely. There are not dietary restrictions normally associated with benzodiazepine use, and these drugs are not a common cause of neuromuscular effects. An older adult resident of a group home has been receiving treatment for schizophrenia for several decades. The nurse who oversees care at the facility believes that the resident may be developing tardive dyskinesia. What assessment findings would support this suspicion? Select all that apply. The client often smacks lips when at restThe client makes repetitive movements with the fingersTardive dyskinesia is usually characterized by repetitive involuntary movements. Syncope, sleep disturbances, and symptom exacerbation are not suggestive of tardive dyskinesia When caring for an older adult taking a psychotropic medication, the psychiatric nurse must be aware that older adults: usually require a lower dose of these medications than do younger counterparts.The pharmacologic actions of psychotropic medications change dramatically for older persons as a result from differences in drug absorption secondary to diminished gastrointestinal motility, decreased plasma proteins, decreased kidney function, congestive heart failure, or normal age-related changes in body composition, lean body mass, and muscle mass or increased fatty tissue. A drug that is an antagonist functions to do what? Prevent natural or other substances from activating cell functionDrug antagonists block the actions of everything in the agonist spectrum. These chemicals bind to and block a receptor, producing no response and preventing agonists from binding or attaching to the receptor. Which structures are components of the brain stem? Select all that apply. Midbrain Pons MedullaThe brain stem, located beneath the thalamus and comprising the midbrain, pons, and medulla, has important life-sustaining functions. The cerebellum and occipital lobes are not part of the brain stem. Which are anticholinergic side effects that may occur with the use of antipsychotic drugs? Select all that apply. Dry mouth Constipation Urinary retentionAnticholinergic side effects resulting from blockade of acetylcholine are commonly associated with antipsychotic drugs. Others include dry mouth, slowed gastric motility, constipation, urinary hesitancy or retention, and nasal congestion. Diarrhea and a runny nose are not anticholinergic side effects. Neurotransmission is important in the function of the CNS. For neurotransmission to occur, how do neurons communicate with other cells? ChemicallyThe transmission of information between two nerves or between a nerve and a gland or muscle is chemical. Selectively, excitably, and accessibly are incorrect. What is the function of the thalamus and the hypothalamus? Coordinate internal and external responsesThe thalamus and hypothalamus coordinate internal and external responses and direct information into the cerebral cortex. A client exhibiting an uncoordinated gait has presented at the clinic. The nurse knows that what brain structure has the function of balance and coordination? CerebellumThe cerebellum controls fine movement, balance, position sense, and integration of sensory input. Portions of the pons control the heart, respiration, and blood pressure. Cranial nerves IX through XII connect to the brain in the medulla. Cranial nerves III and IV originate in the midbrain. A client has bipolar disorder and has just begun a regimen of lithium, 600 mg tid. Which is the most critical management issue for the client during the first 2 weeks of treatment? Ensuring the client's blood levels reach a therapeutic and safe doseLithium has few side effects if maintained within a therapeutic range. Adverse reactions begin to occur with toxic levels. Two nursing students are giving a presentation on the limbic system. Which can they accurately include as actions of this brain structure? BehaviorThis part of the brain seems to be largely responsible for the human aspect of brain function. Drug therapy aimed at alleviating emotional disorders, such as depression and anxiety, often involves attempting to alter the levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. The use of psychopharmacologic agents in the treatment of mental illness comes from which domain of the biopsychosocial model? BiologicNeurobiologic theories serve as a basis for understanding and administering pharmacologic agents. A nurse is studying the positron emission tomography (PET) report of a client with Alzheimer's disease. What findings should the nurse expect to find in the report? Select all that apply. Decreased blood flow to the brainPresence of amyloid plaques and tanglesDecreased glucose metabolism in the brainDecreased blood flow to the brain, presence of amyloid plaques and tangles, and decreased glucose metabolism are findings associated with Alzheimer's disease, which could be obtained on a PET scan. Atrophy of the cerebral cortex is also associated with Alzheimer's and its presence could be found in magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans. Enlarged ventricles are not associated with Alzheimer's disease; it is a feature of schizophrenia. MidbrainThe brain stem consists of the midbrain, pons, and medulla. A client with Parkinson's disease is hospitalized on a medical unit. The nurse would be correct in identifying which neurotransmitter decreased in this disease? DopamineParkinson's disease develops from decreased availability of dopamine, while acetylcholine binding to muscle cells is impaired in myasthenia gravis. Therefore acetylcholine, neurontin, and serotonin are incorrect. A client is returning from military service and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Dysfunction in which brain structure contributes to the rage and fear experienced in PTSD? HypothalamusThe hypothalamus is a part of the limbic system, which is sometimes called the emotional brain. The hypothalamus is involved in impulsive behavior associated with feelings of anger, rage, or excitement. The pons connects the cerebellum and the brainstem. The basal ganglia initiates motor function. The corpus callosum is the pathway that connects the two hemispheres of the brain A professional boxer has suffered several concussions while boxing. Since retirement, the client has experienced periods of depression and suffers from short-term memory loss. Which provides the best explanation for the neurological basis of the client's symptoms? Damage to the hippocampusDamage to the hippocampus causes short-term memory loss and lack of motivation. Damage of the nucleus accumbeus does not cause memory loss. Damage to the thalamus results in obsessive-compulsive behavior or decreased ability to experience pleasure. Damage to the medulla affects circulation and respiration. A Cuban American client has been prescribed an antipsychotic medication. Which response is most important for the nurse to make to this client? ""Call the doctor immediately if you experience any of the side effects we talked about.""In general, non-Whites treated with Western dosing protocols have higher serum levels per dose and suffer more side effects. While the other options are not inappropriate, they do not address the issue of the client's increased risk for the development of side-effects. The client has difficulty with motor coordination and walks with an unsteady gait. Of the following brain structures, which is most likely affected in the client's brain? CerebellumThe cerebellum controls and guides movements, as well as maintains muscle tone. The cerebrum is composed of the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal regions and contributes to intellectual function, including learning, judgment, reasoning, and memory. The medulla oblongata controls respiration, gastrointestinal motility, and circulation. The hippocampus is part of the limbic system Benzodiazepines work by the following mechanism of action: They act directly on GABA receptors and are thought to increase the amount of GABA available.Benzodiazepines act directly on GABA receptors and are thought to increase GABA available to dampen neural overstimulation. A client with an anxiety disorder is exhibiting agitation after missing some doses of diazepam. The nurse interprets the aggression as relating to which cause? Paradoxical excitationA rebound phenomenon, referred to as paradoxical excitation, may occur after the abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepines. The client may become more anxious, exhibit aggressive or antisocial behavior, or experience withdrawal symptoms of confusion, toxic psychosis, convulsions, or a condition resembling delirium tremens. Habituation is a term used to describe a continuous or intermittent craving for a substance to avoid a dysphoric or unpleasant mood state. Addiction is a state of chronic or recurrent drug intoxication, characterized by psychological and physical dependence as well as tolerance. Tolerance refers to the client's ability to obtain a desired effect from a specific dose of a drug. A client has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. His symptoms of spasticity are related to a decrease in which neurotransmitter? DopamineA client with Parkinson's disease develops symptoms of spasticity related to a decrease in dopamine. A client with Parkinson's disease will have an increase in acetylcholine. Adrenocorticotropic hormone and serotonin will not be influenced in relation to the disease process. What is the difference between traditional and atypical antipsychotics? Atypical antipsychotics work on dopamine-receptor and serotonin-receptor blockade, whereas traditional antipsychotics work on dopamine-receptor blockade.Atypical antipsychotics work on dopamine receptors and serotonin receptors, thus affecting both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The psychiatric nurse is preparing to provide education to a client who has recently been prescribed lithium. The nurse should include which information? Select all that apply The intended outcome of the therapy will be the prevention of manic behavior.The drug appears to balance the neurotransmission of serotonin.Blood levels of the drug should be monitored at least monthly with a sample drawn 12 hours after a dose.Your physician should be notified immediately of any vomiting, diarrhea, or profuse perspiration.Antimanic agents, or mood stabilizers, refer to agents that prevent or diminish the frequency and intensity of manic behavior, mood swings, aggressive behavior, and dyscontrol syndrome. Lithium has long been considered the treatment of choice for the manic phase of bipolar disorder. It is thought to balance serotonergic neurotransmission, preventing a decreased activity of nerve impulses that causes depression and prevents an increased activity of nerve impulses that causes mania. Blood lithium levels are monitored regularly, with samples taken 12 hours after the previous dose of lithium. Serum lithium concentrations may increase in the presence of extreme vomiting, diarrhea, or perspiration, resulting in lithium toxicity. Lithium can require 3 to 5 weeks before it is effective. Abnormalities in which lobe is believed to be associated with schizophrenia? FrontalAn abnormality in the frontal lobe has been associated with schizophrenia. A nurse is involved in gathering information about the inheritance of mental disorders using population genetics. Which would the nurse be least likely to be evaluating? Risk factor analysisRisk factor analysis is evaluated when determining genetic susceptibility (i.e., predicting who is more likely to experience psychiatric disorders or certain conditions). Population genetics evaluates family studies that analyze the occurrence of a disorder among first-degree relatives, twin studies that analyze the presence (or absences) of a disorder in pairs of twins using concordance rates, and adoption studies that compare the risk of a disorder developing in offspring raised in different environments. The psychiatric-mental health nurse needs to have a basic understanding of information that is unique to individual medications. Which factors that affect pharmacokinetics should the nurse know? Select all that apply. ContraindicationsAdverse reactionsIndications for useFood and drug interactionsWhen responsible for the administration of medications, the psychiatric-mental health nurse needs to have a basic understanding of factors affecting pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics that include individual drugs' contraindications, adverse reactions, indications for use, and food and drug interactions. Cost of medication is useful knowledge for cost containment; however, it does not impact client safety. Therefore, it is not considered a priority with regard to medication knowledge A client with diminished serotonin levels would likely experience which symptom? Depression and impulsivityLow levels of serotonin are associated with depression, aggression, suicidality, and impulsivity. High levels of serotonin are associated with anxiety disorders. Sleep disturbances are associated with acetylcholine. The fight-or-flight response is associated with epinephrine. A client with a diagnosis of schizophrenia lacks insight into the illness. The client presents with significantly declined function and is consistently nonadherent with medications. Which medication administration route is best suited for optimal treatment of this client's condition? IntramuscularlyIf a client is nonadherent and there is a significant decline in functioning, antipsychotic drugs are most often administered intramuscularly. Antipsychotic medications are not normally administered by the intravenous or subcutaneous routes, and oral administration is more challenging when a client is noncompliant with treatment. A client who has been taking clozapine for 6 weeks visits the clinic complaining of fever, sore throat, and mouth sores. The nurse notifies the client's physician because the nurse suspects what? AgranulocytosisHigh fever, sore throat, and mouth sores are indicative of infection secondary to agranulocytosis, which has been associated with clozapine. The medication can suppress the bone marrow and cause a significant decrease in white blood cells. The client's signs and symptoms do not suggest anemia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or encephalitis. A client is brought to the emergency department by her sibling, who reports that the client became very agitated and ""started hallucinating."" Further assessment reveals tachycardia, incoordination, vomiting, and diarrhea. The sibling states that the client is taking paroxetine for depression. Which would the nurse most likely suspect? Serotonin syndromeThe client's symptoms, along with the use of paroxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI]) suggest serotonin syndrome. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and acute dystonic reaction would occur with antipsychotic uses. Hypothyroidism may result from lithium use.

DAVIS, R.N., Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Decatur, Illinois Abstract Abstract Orthostatic hypotension is a physical finding defined by the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology as a systolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure decrease of at least 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing. The condition, which may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, is encountered commonly in family medicine. In healthy persons, muscle contraction increases venous return of blood to the heart through one-way valves that prevent blood from pooling in dependent parts of the body. The autonomic nervous system responds to changes in position by constricting veins and arteries and increasing heart rate and cardiac contractility. When these mechanisms are faulty or if the patient is hypovolemic, orthostatic hypotension may occur. In persons with orthostatic hypotension, gravitational opposition to venous return causes a decrease in blood pressure and threatens cerebral ischemia. Several potential causes of orthostatic hypotension include medications; non-neurogenic causes such as impaired venous return, hypovolemia, and cardiac insufficiency; and neurogenic causes such as multisystem atrophy and diabetic neuropathy. Treatment generally is aimed at the underlying cause, and a variety of pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic treatments may relieve symptoms. Orthostatic hypotension, which is a physical finding, not a disease, may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. The American Autonomic Society (AAS) and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) define orthostatic hypotension as a systolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure decrease of at least 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing up. [Evidence level C, consensus/expert guidelines] The AAS and AAN also provide a tilt-table definition. This determination has limited usefulness for the approach outlined in this article and appears to have a high rate of false-positive results. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed in all age groups, but it occurs more frequently in the elderly, especially in persons who are sick and frail. It is associated with several diagnoses, conditions, and symptoms, including lightheadedness soon after standing, an increased rate of falls, and a history of myocardial infarction or transient ischemic attack; it also may be predictive of ischemic stroke. Abstract When an adult rises to the standing position, 300 to 800 mL of blood pools in the lower extremities. Maintenance of blood pressure during position change is quite complex; many sensitive cardiac, vascular, neurologic, muscular, and neurohumoral responses must occur quickly. If any of these responses are abnormal, blood pressure and organ perfusion can be reduced. As a result, symptoms of central nervous system hypoperfusion may occur, including feelings of weakness, nausea, headache, neck ache, lightheadedness, dizziness, blurred vision, fatigue, tremulousness, palpitations, and impaired cognition. Vertigo also has been reported. When a person moves from a horizontal to a vertical position, muscle contraction in the legs and abdomen compresses veins. Because veins are equipped with one-way valves, normally blood is moved back to the heart to counter the gravitational tendency for blood to pool, and the veins constrict. In euvolemic persons, extra blood is held in the venous system, providing an additional reservoir of compensatory blood volume. The autonomic nervous system plays an important role in maintaining blood pressure when a person changes position. The sympathetic nervous system adjusts the tone in arteries, veins, and the heart. Baroreceptors located primarily in the carotid arteries and aorta are exquisitely sensitive to changes in blood pressure. When the baroreceptors sense the slightest drop in pressure, a coordinated increase in sympathetic outflow occurs. Arteries constrict to increase peripheral resistance and blood pressure, and heart rate and contractility increase. All of these responses are aimed at maintaining blood pressure and perfusion. Other physiologic mechanisms may be involved, including low-pressure receptors in the heart and lungs, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, vasopressin, and the systemic release of norepinephrine. Normally, when a person moves to an upright position, blood pressure and heart rate change so quickly that continuous electronic monitoring is required to detect the differences, and ordinary clinical observations lag behind the physiologic changes. The line between normal and pathologic changes in blood pressure and heart rate is not easy to define clinically. Although heart rate measurement is not included in the AAS/AAN definition of orthostatic hypotension, it can be determined easily and may be helpful, especially in patients who do not meet the blood pressure criteria of orthostatic hypotension. An elevation in heart rate that occurs when a patient moves from recumbency to standing may indicate compensation for decreased stroke volume. However, clinical decisions should be guided more by symptoms of decreased cerebral perfusion than by absolute blood pressure or heart rate measurements. A discussion of the pathophysiology of each reported cause of orthostatic hypotension is beyond the scope of this article, but a few comments are important. In general, all parts of the cardiovascular and nervous systems must work together. If there is inadequate intravascular volume, impairment of the autonomic nervous system, reduction of venous return, or inability of the heart to beat more rapidly or with greater power, orthostatic hypotension may result. Abstract Orthostatic hypotension can be classified as neurogenic, non-neurogenic, or iatrogenic (e.g., caused by medication). An algorithm to guide evaluation is given in . Some of the etiologies of orthostatic hypotension are shown in .  Clinical clues to help direct the evaluation are given in . Although measurements for orthostatic hypotension are not part of the standard physical examination, they should be taken if a patient's history suggests symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion or a disease associated with orthostatic hypotension. Because orthostatic hypotension may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, symptoms and blood pressure measurements should be considered. Algorithm for the evaluation of orthostatic hypotension.

For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Clinical Clues to Non-Neurogenic Etiologies of Orthostatic Hypotension Chest pain, palpations, shortness of breath, rales, edema, arrhythmia, murmur Congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, pericarditis, or myocarditis Congestive heart failure, venous obstruction, prolonged sitting or standing (resulting in venous pooling) Vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, burns, diuretic use, clinical signs of dehydration Clinical Clues to Non-Neurogenic Etiologies of Orthostatic Hypotension Chest pain, palpations, shortness of breath, rales, edema, arrhythmia, murmur Congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, pericarditis, or myocarditis Congestive heart failure, venous obstruction, prolonged sitting or standing (resulting in venous pooling) Vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, burns, diuretic use, clinical signs of dehydration Clinical Clues to Neurogenic Etiologies of Orthostatic Hypotension Autonomic failure with no other neurologic symptoms Parkinsonian features, urinary incontinence or retention, cerebellar dysfunction, autonomic symptoms Dysautonomia of acute onset or occurring over a few weeks (can occur with supine hypertension) Clinical Clues to Neurogenic Etiologies of Orthostatic Hypotension Autonomic failure with no other neurologic symptoms Parkinsonian features, urinary incontinence or retention, cerebellar dysfunction, autonomic symptoms Dysautonomia of acute onset or occurring over a few weeks (can occur with supine hypertension) Diseases not related to orthostatic hypotension can cause similar symptoms (e.g., lightheadedness, dizziness). If a patient has posturally induced symptoms without blood pressure changes, the physician should consider other conditions. If a patient has posturally induced symptoms and a decrease in blood pressure but does not meet the strict definition for orthostatic hypotension, the physician still should consider orthostatic hypotension as a possible problem. When the cause of orthostatic hypotension (e.g., hemorrhage, profound volume loss) is not immediately obvious, medications, the most common cause of orthostatic hypotension, should be considered before other etiologies. If symptoms appeared shortly after a medication reached steady state, it is likely that the medication is the cause. If the medication was started some time before the symptoms began, it may not be fully responsible (although it may play a part in the development of symptoms). For example, after starting a medication, a patient may develop an illness that causes orthostatic hypotension, or a patient may have a condition that causes mild or asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension that becomes symptomatic when a new medication is added. If the patient is taking a potentially causative medication, the drug should be discontinued if possible. If it is not possible to stop the medication, other causes might be considered; it also may be necessary to treat the orthostatic hypotension pharmacologically or by some other method . Selected Nonpharmacologic Treatments for Orthostatic Hypotension Dorsiflex feet several times before standingMake slow, careful changes in positionEat small, frequent meals Increase salt and fluid intake Elevate head of bed 5 to 20 degrees Schedule activities in the afternoonWear compression stockings Selected Nonpharmacologic Treatments for Orthostatic Hypotension Dorsiflex feet several times before standingMake slow, careful changes in positionEat small, frequent meals Increase salt and fluid intake Elevate head of bed 5 to 20 degrees Schedule activities in the afternoonWear compression stockings If medication does not appear to be fully or partly responsible for a patient's symptoms, non-neurogenic etiologies should be considered, and intravascular volume should be determined. If a patient is volume-depleted, hydration may improve symptoms; if a patient is euvolemic, other non-neurogenic causes should be considered. The patient's history and physical examination should direct further evaluation. If medication and non-neurogenic etiologies are ruled out, neurogenic causes should be considered, using the patient's history and physical examination to direct the evaluation. Many of the neurogenic etiologies of orthostatic hypotension are difficult to diagnose and treat, and neurologic consultation may be necessary. Although it is not part of the formal definition of orthostatic hypotension, the absence of a significant increase in heart rate along with a significant postural decrease in blood pressure may suggest an autonomic cause. The evaluation and management of orthostatic hypotension must be carried out in the context of the patient's unique clinical circumstances. In some patients, stopping a medication may cause more harm than benefit if the hypotension symptoms are mild. Orthostatic hypotension may have more than one cause; a patient with mild neurogenic orthostatic hypotension who becomes dehydrated or starts taking a new medication could develop symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Because orthostatic hypotension is associated with several other morbidities, its diagnosis or onset should prompt the physician to consider other conditions, especially if the patient is elderly. Abstract The first steps in treatment of orthostatic hypotension are diagnosis and management of the underlying cause. A patient with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension who has a disease with no complete or specific cure may benefit from nonpharmacologic interventions. Increasing salt and fluid intake often is an initial step, although it may be difficult to undertake in some patients, such as those with severe congestive heart failure. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used to increase intravascular volume. The mineralocorticoid fludrocortisone (Florinef) may be used in some patients to expand intravascular volume. This agent should be used judiciously; in addition to the risk of volume overload, many patients taking fludrocortisone also develop hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Additional side effects of this medication include headache, edema, weight gain, and supine hypertension. Midodrine (ProAmitine), a vasoconstrictor, is effective in some cases of orthostatic hypotension. [Evidence level A, randomized controlled trial] The most common side effects are pupillary dilation, piloerection, paresthesias, and pruritus. Midodrine also can cause supine hypertension. Erythropoietin has been used to treat autonomic failure associated with decreased red cell mass or anemia. The goal is to bring the hematocrit level within the normal range. Increased appetite is a common side effect, along with an increased sense of well-being. Choose a single article, issue, or full-access subscription.

Retrieved Jan 18 2021 from https://www.thefreelibrary.com/An+approach+to+the+clinical+assessment+and+management+of+syncope+in...-a0442536609 Syncope refers to a brief loss of consciousness (LOC) due to an abrupt fall in cerebral perfusion. It remains a frequent reason for medical presentation and accounts for a large proportion of emergency department and outpatient clinic visits. While there are no population-based epidemiological studies of syncope in South Africa, it accounts for up to 3% of hospital admissions in western countries. There are many causes of syncope (discussed below)--some benign and others more serious. The goals of the clinical assessment of a patient with syncope are twofold: (i) to identify the precise cause in order to implement a mechanism-specific and effective therapeutic strategy; and (ii) to quantify the risk of recurrence or death, which depends on the underlying disease rather than the mechanism of the syncope. Hence, a structured approach to the patient with syncope is required. History-taking is the most important aspect of the clinical assessment. The patient's history guides both appropriate selection of investigations and best management strategy. Definition of syncope Syncope is a transient loss of consciousness (T-LOC) caused by transient global hypoperfusion of both cerebral hemispheres or focal hypoperfusion of the reticular activating system. Cerebral hypoperfusion may be secondary to decreased cardiac output, peripheral vascular resistance or a combination of both. Four cardinal clinical features characterise the syncopal episode: (i) it is transient; (ii) it has a rapid onset; (iii) it has a short duration (lasting seconds to several minutes); and (iv) there is spontaneous complete recovery requiring no resuscitative efforts. [1] Appropriate orientation and behaviour is restored after the syncopal episode and there is complete return of pre-existing neurological function. Retrograde amnesia may occur in older adults. Syncopal patients may have brief, involuntary clonic movements, but do not report tongue biting or incontinence. T-LOC encompasses all disorders characterised by self-limited LOC, irrespective of mechanism. Other causes of T-LOC include trauma, epileptic seizures and psychogenic LOC. Syncope is differentiated from other causes of T-LOC by its mechanism of global cerebral hypoperfusion. Presyncope indicates symptoms and signs that occur before LOC in syncope. It is often used interchangeably with 'dizziness' and 'light-headedness' to describe a situation in which the individual thinks he or she may have a blackout, but consciousness is maintained. Is the cause of the syncopal episode life threatening? The primary responsibility of the emergency department doctor or general practitioner is to ensure that a life-threatening cause of syncope is excluded. The four main life-threatening causes of syncope are: (i) cardiac syncope (arrhythmia related or structural); (ii) massive haemorrhage with haemodynamic instability; (iii) pulmonary embolism; and (iv) subarachnoid haemorrhage (which should be suspected if a patient presents with syncope after a headache). Classification of transient loss of consciousness T-LOC is divided into traumatic and nontraumatic forms. T-LOC related to trauma is usually the result of concussion. Nontraumatic causes of T-LOC include syncope, epileptic seizures, intoxication, vertebrobasilar transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and metabolic disorders, such as hypoglycaemia, hypoxia and hyperventilation with hypocapnia (Table 1). Other disorders without LOC may also be incorrectly diagnosed as syncope; these include cataplexy, drop attacks, falls, psychogenic pseudosyncope and a TIA of vertebrobasilar origin. [1] Differentiating syncope from seizure and TIA is not always easy, and Table 2 provides useful pointers. Classification of syncope The classification of syncope is based on the underlying pathophysiological mechanism causing the event, emphasising collections of disparate disorders with a common presentation but different risk profiles (Fig. 1). Syncope is classified into cardiac syncope, orthostatic hypotension (OH) and reflex (neurally mediated) mechanisms. [2] Reflex syncope is the most frequent cause of syncope in any setting and is particularly common in young females. The most common cause of syncope is cardiac related. OH is rare in patients <40 years of age, whereas it is prevalent in older patients (Table 3). Of note, 5-15% of syncopal episodes are medication related (from orthostasis or cardiotoxicity). Reflex syncope Cardiovascular reflexes play an important role in maintaining blood pressure (BP) in normal individuals, but can cause a significant decrease in BP with subsequent syncope in those with an inappropriate response. The syncope may be due to a vasodepressor or cardio-inhibitory type of reflex--the former causing a loss of vasoconstriction and the latter resulting in significant bradycardia or asystole. [1] Reflex syncope can be further categorised into vasovagal syncope (from emotional or orthostatic stress); situational syncope (due to specific situational stressors such as micturition, vomiting and defecation); carotid sinus syncope (from pressure on the carotid sinus, e.g. shaving or a tight collar); and atypical reflex syncope (episodes of syncope or reflex syncope that cannot be attributed to a specific trigger or syncope with an atypical presentation). Cardiac syncope Cardiovascular causes of syncope may be structural (mechanical) or electrical. [3] Structural heart disease results in global cerebral hypoperfusion by decreasing the cardiac output and subsequently the systemic BP. Syncope occurs when the circulatory demands outweigh the ability of the heart to maintain an adequate cardiac output. In conditions with a fixed ventricular outflow obstruction it is not only the decreased cardiac output that plays a role, but also a reflex vasodilation or orthostatic hypotension. The main causes of structural syncope are highlighted in Table 3 and include acute myocardial infarction/ ischaemia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease (e.g. aortic stenosis and mitral stenosis) and pericardial disease. Arrhythmias causing syncope can be either brady- or tachyarrhythmias, and may be acquired or caused by congenital defects. Acquired bradyarrhythmias include sick sinus syndrome, which causes pauses due to sinus arrest and a subsequent fall in cardiac output. The atrioventricular (AV) blocks causing syncope include Mobitz I and II AV block, high-degree AV blocks (2:1 AV block and greater) and complete AV block--the mechanism being either ventricular asystole (i.e. an absent escape rhythm) or torsades des pointes due to prolongation of the QT interval. For many cardiovascular causes of syncope the pathogenesis is multifactorial, e.g. in HCM, where the syncope may be secondary to outflow obstruction, ventricular or atrial arrhythmias or neurally mediated mechanisms. [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] Orthostatic hypotension OH is due to an abnormal drop in systolic BP upon standing, and is defined as a decrease of >20 mmHg in systolic BP or a reflex tachycardia of >20 beats/minute within 3 minutes of standing. [2] The main causes of OH are autonomic nervous system (ANS) failure and hypovolaemia. Other causes are illustrated in Table 3. In older patients, especially those with diabetes, mild autonomic neuropathy is common and may easily be aggravated by diuretic treatment, medication prescribed for hypertension or tricyclic antidepressants. Vasodilator therapy or diuretics that were recently added as treatment are common precipitants of new-onset OH and syncope in the elderly. Prognosis of syncope The prognosis of syncope relates to: (i) the risk of death and life-threatening events; and (ii) the risk of recurrence of the syncope and physical injury. [1,3] The prognosis depends on the underlying cause of the syncope. Higher mortality is associated with life-threatening cardiac causes of syncope. Furthermore, there is a high morbidity in patients with a risk of recurrence of syncope and subsequent physical injury. [4] Structural heart disease and primary cardiovascular electrical disease are major risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD) in syncope. OH results in a twofold higher risk of mortality in syncope. Mortality is often related to the severity of the underlying disease rather than to syncope per se. However, young persons without structural or electrical heart disease have an excellent prognosis. [5] In up to one-third of adults there is recurrent syncope within 3 years of follow-up. Psychiatric disease and age <45 years predict higher rates of pseudosyncope. Major injury, including fractures and motor vehicle accidents, is reported in 6% of patients with syncope. Minor and soft-tissue injuries occur in 12% of patients. Morbidity is particularly high in the elderly. Moreover, recurrent syncope may have serious effects on the quality of life. [1] Clinical evaluation of syncope History and examination As syncope is a symptom or clinical presentation of an underlying disorder, attempting to establish the cause is essential and relies heavily on the history and physical examination. On history, the diagnosis of syncope can be confirmed by asking four key questions: * Was the LOC complete? * Was the LOC transient, with rapid onset and short duration? * Did the patient recover spontaneously and completely, without sequelae? * Did the patient lose postural tone? The answer to all these questions should be positive. In the majority of patients the diagnosis of syncope may be confirmed based on the history alone. Obtaining a detailed history from a witness such as a partner or family member is important to describe the LOC. History-taking must be comprehensive and include details of the situation, precipitating factors, prodrome, LOC episode and postprodrome. Important aspects to glean from the history include whether the syncope is postural, exertional, situational and associated with palpitations or cardiovascular symptoms. Additionally, the clinician must take into account the use of medications, a family history of SCD, and a personal history of cardiac disease. Table 4 includes features on the history that may be useful to distinguish a cause. The history should always aim to answer three important questions: * Was this a syncopal episode? * If indeed syncope, what is the cause? * Are there features suggesting high risk of cardiovascular events or death?[4] On examination, the vital signs must be assessed, including pulse, BP, pallor and bruits, and OH must be checked. The BP needs to be measured in the supine position, followed by BP in the erect position after 3 minutes of standing. A cardiovascular examination includes evaluation of features of underlying cardiac disease, such as impaired systolic function arrhythmias and murmurs suggesting conditions such as mitral or aortic stenosis or HCM. Neurological examination focuses on ascertainment of muscle weakness, paraesthesia, cranial nerve abnormalities and peripheral neuropathy. Gastrointestinal tract (GIT) examination should exclude a GIT source of blood loss. [4] Special investigations An ECG is recommended in all patients who present with syncope, checking for evidence of abnormal rhythm, prolonged intervals (PR, QRS, and QTc), severe bradycardia, pre-excitation, myocardial infarction, low voltage in standard limb leads suggestive of effusion, and abnormal conduction. The ECG plays a crucial role in diagnosing arrhythmia, ischaemia, pulmonary embolism, and HCM (Table 5). Additional assessments may be performed, but must be directed based on the findings of the initial evaluation. Importantly, <2-3% of patients evaluated for syncope have abnormal laboratory results. [1,6] Therefore, the routine use of a broad panel of laboratory tests is not recommended and tests should only be requested when clinically indicated. Further investigations (Table 6) are usually the domain of cardiologists, as the performance and interpretation thereof require specialised training. Echocardiography is useful in the evaluation of left ventricular systolic function and delineation of structural heart disease, including abnormal valves, chamber enlargement, hypertrophy, wall motion and pericardial disease. However, in patients with an unremarkable clinical examination, normal ECG, and no cardiac history the value of echocardiography is minimal. Transoesophageal echocardiography, cardiovascular computed tomography or cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging may be considered for evaluation of structural heart disease when the transthoracic echocardiogram is abnormal or the index of suspicion of myocardial, valvular, pericardial or coronary artery disease is high. [2] Tilt-table testing may be useful when there is an intermediate probability of reflex syncope or to demonstrate OH in a controlled environment. In a patient with a typical history suggestive of reflex syncope a tilt-table test is not indicated, as a negative test does not exclude reflex syncope. The sensitivity and specificity of tilt-table testing are 65% and 93%, respectively. The patient is attached to a cardiac and BP monitor, lies flat for 10 minutes and is then tilted 60-70[degrees] head-up and observed for 30 minutes for symptoms and signs of syncope. At 15 minutes, a sublingual nitrate is administered if no symptoms have occurred. The test is considered positive if the patient's symptoms are reproduced in the presence of hypotension, bradycardia or both. Contraindications to performing tilt-table testing include a recent myocardial infarction, stroke or tight carotid stenosis. [7] Carotid sinus massage (CSM) to diagnose carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH) is only recommended in patients >40 years of age with syncope or unexplained falls without a clearly identified cause. CSM is positive when it causes a pause of >3 seconds in the heartbeat (cardio-inhibition) or lowering of the BP by >50 mmHg (vasodepression). Complications that may arise from the procedure are TIAs or strokes (both rare). It is therefore recommended that CSM be avoided in patients with a previous TIA or stroke or in those with carotid bruits. ECG monitoring (telemetry, Holter monitoring and implantable loop recorders (ILRs)) is used to detect an underlying arrhythmia when initial cardiac or neurally mediated syncope investigations are negative and an arrhythmia is suspected. In-hospital telemetry and 24-hour Holter monitoring have a typical, very low yield but may be considered for frequent syncopal episodes. An ILR is a very useful diagnostic tool in patients with unexplained syncope; it has a battery life of 2-3 years. When syncope occurs, the device can be retrospectively activated by the patient and subsequently interrogated to establish whether there were any arrhythmias at the time of the syncopal episode. Documenting no arrhythmia during a syncopal episode is very useful to exclude an arrhythmic cause of syncope. ILRs should be considered when there is recurrent unexplained or high-risk syncope, frequent episodes affecting quality of life, recurrent and unpredictable episodes putting the patient at risk of trauma, or when syncope occurs during high-risk activity, e.g. operating machinery or driving. Occasionally, electrophysiological studies may be indicated in patients with a high index of suspicion for ventricular tachycardia, bundle branch block, or supraventricular tachycardia. Risk stratification The prognosis varies among the different categories of syncope and in many cases the diagnosis remains uncertain from history and examination alone. Between 20% and 50% of patients have unexplained syncope after intensive diagnostic evaluation. Therefore, risk stratification tools have been designed to assist differentiation between low- and high-risk patients. These tools aid in deciding whether a patient qualifies for hospital admission and further investigation or if they can be reassured and discharged from an emergency unit. Ultimately, it is imperative that the final decision remains that of the attending practitioner, based on his/her clinical discretion. [1,6,7] Table 7 illustrates the findings that categorise patients according to risk. Management principles As syncope is a symptom of disease, management depends on the underlying cause. Establishing the diagnosis should largely be based on a thorough history and examination and the use of basic investigations, e.g. an ECG. Further investigations should only be used when clinically indicated. Discussion of specific treatment options in individual diseases is beyond the scope of this article. Patients with life-threatening causes of syncope should be managed urgently and appropriately. In patients with reflex or orthostatic syncope it is important to address any exacerbating medication and provide general measures to increase BP, such as physical counter-pressure manoeuvres. A small proportion of patients with severe cardio-inhibitory carotid sinus hypersensitivity may require a dual-chamber pacemaker. Where heart disease is found to be the cause of the syncope a specialist opinion is warranted and where possible the problem should be corrected. Conclusion It is important to remember that in any patient presenting with syncope the main objectives of management are to prolong survival, limit physical injuries and prevent recurrences. This can only be done if a patient is appropriately assessed at presentation, investigated as clinically indicated, and subsequently referred to a cardiologist for appropriate management. In patients in whom the diagnosis remains uncertain, risk stratification tools can be utilised to assist in deciding whether patients need admission or further evaluation. Funding.

An aneurysm that occurs in the section of the aorta that runs through the abdomen (abdominal aorta). A non-invasive imaging procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to view the structures of the abdomen and determine the presence of an aneurysm A localized formation of pus in a cavity caused by the disintegration or displacement of tissue due to bacterial infection. A condition where the esophagus is not able to move food into the stomach. The lower esophageal muscle stays closed during swallowing, resulting in the backup of food. Abrupt onset that usually is severe; happens for a limited period of time. Treatment provided in addition to the primary treatment to prevent cancer recurrence. A document in which a person either states choices for medical treatment or designates someone who should make treatment choices if the person should become unable to make decisions. Most often the term refers to formal, written documents, but it can also be used to include spoken statements by the patient. Legal documents including the Living Will and Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care. A Living Will states what type of treatment you wish to receive in the event that you become physically or mentally unable to communicate your wishes. A Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care authorizes another person to make medical decisions for you when you are unable to do so for yourself. Exercise which can improve your functional ability and, in some cases, reduce symptoms of heart disease. It is repetitive in nature and involves the large muscle groups. Examples are walking, swimming, and cycling. An organ or tissue transplanted from one individual to another of the same species, i.e. human to human. Thin-walled, small sacs located at the ends of the smallest airways in the lungs where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place. Small portable electrocardiograph machines that are able to record the heart's rhythm. Each type of monitor has unique features related to length of recording time and ability to send the recordings over the phone. They include: Holter Monitor, Loop Recorder, and Transtelephonic transmitter. A rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the buildup of abnormal protein in tissues. Amyloidosis can be a cause of heart valve disorders and heart failure. A condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells. Anemia reduces the amount of oxygen available to the body. The abnormal dilatation (enlargement, bulging or stretching) of the wall of an artery, vein or heart caused by damage or weakness in the blood vessel wall. When aneurysms grow too large, they can rupture and the bleeding can be life threatening. In cardiac surgery, aneurysms usually apply to either the ascending, aortic arch, or descending aorta. Aneurysms that have grown too large should be replaced. Discomfort or pressure, usually in the chest, caused by a temporarily inadequate blood supply to the heart muscle. Discomfort may also be felt in the neck, jaw or arms. A common symptom of coronary artery disease, angina usually occurs during periods of physical or emotional stress and is relieved by rest. The spontaneous or drug-induced growth of new blood vessels. The growth of these vessels may help to alleviate coronary artery disease by rerouting blood flow around clogged arteries. An invasive imaging procedure that usually involves inserting a catheter into an artery leading to the heart muscle or brain and injecting a radioactive tracer into the blood stream via the catheter. This test is used to determine if there is fatty build-up or plaque in the arteries causing narrowing. Coronary angiography is also called cardiac catheterization. An invasive procedure, during which a specially designed balloon catheter with a small balloon tip is guided to the point of narrowing in a artery. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to compress the fatty matter into the artery wall and stretch the artery open to increase blood flow through the blood vessel. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE Inhibitors) A group of drugs used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. ACE inhibitors block a specific enzyme (ACE or angiotensin-converting enzyme) which retains salt in the kidney and can cause heart and blood pressure problems. A class of medicines used to treat high blood pressure. A procedure used to test the arterial blood flow to the hands and feet. A ring of tough fibrous tissue which is attached to and supports the leaflets of the heart valve. The normal anatomy for the coronary arteries involves their origin from the aorta at each of two separate sites. Sometimes people can be born with the origin of a coronary artery that comes from an abnormal site and this can lead to problems of coronary ischemia which can subsequently lead to heart attack. Not all coronary anomalies need surgery, but some do and the specific operation depends on which of the many varieties of coronary anomalies is present. A drug that is used to treat abnormal heart rhythms. A protein substance made by the body's immune system in response to a foreign substance, for example a previous transplant, blood transfusion or pregnancy. Because the antibodies attack the transplanted organ, transplant patients must take powerful immunosuppressive drugs. Also called cholinergic blockers or ""maintenance"" bronchodilators. Type of medication that helps open (dilate) the bronchial tubes (airways) to help move more air easily into and out of the lungs. Anticholinergics also help clear mucus from the airways. As the airways open, the mucus moves more freely and can therefore be coughed out more easily. A medication that prevents blood from clotting; used for people at risk for stroke or blood clots. A foreign molecule or substance, such as a transplant, that triggers an immune response. This response may be the production of antibodies. A drug that reduces hypertension (high blood pressure). Part of a group of vitamins (A, B, C and E) that may help to limit the cellular damage caused by free radicals. Studies suggest that certain antioxidants may protect against coronary artery disease. A medication, such as aspirin or Plavix (clopidogrel), used to prevent platelets from clumping together and causing the formation of blood clots. Used for people at risk for stroke or blood clots. Large artery leaving the heart. All blood pumped out of the left ventricle travels through the aorta on its way to other parts of the body. The aortic arch is that segment of the aorta between the ascending and descending portions. The aortic arch provides the origin for the blood vessels to the upper part of the body, specifically the arms and head. Surgical diseases of the aortic arch can require a replacement of this large blood vessel with preservation of the vessels to the upper body. The most common diseases requiring replacement are an aneurysm of the aortic arch or an aortic dissection involving the aortic arch. The aorta is the main blood vessel leaving the heart and provides blood flow to the rest of the body. This blood vessel is made up of many layers. In certain circumstances, a tear develops in the middle layer, which allows blood to travel down the layer, setting up two channels - the ""true"" lumen or opening through the blood vessel and the new ""false"" lumen. Aortic dissection can be a life-threatening emergency, in some situations requiring emergency surgery to repair or replace that segment of the aorta. Aortic insufficiency refers specifically to the aortic valve, which is the valve the blood passes through as it leaves the heart and enters the aorta. When blood leaks back through the valve it is known as aortic insufficiency. Small amounts of aortic insufficiency may be inconsequential, but larger amounts require repair or replacement of the aortic valve. The aortic valve is the last valve through which the blood passes before it enters the aorta or main blood vessel of the body. The valve prevents blood from leaking back into the left ventricle from the aorta after it has been ejected from the heart. When replacement of an aortic valve is necessary it is possible to replace the valve with another human valve known as an aortic valve homograft. This operation involves cardiopulmonary bypass The aortic valve is the last valve in the heart through which the blood travels prior to circulating in the body. When this valve is leaking or too tight, the surgeon may be able to repair the valve rather than replace it. When the aortic valve is diseased, it can become either stenotic (too narrow) or insufficient (leaky). In such cases, the aortic valve may need to be replaced with either a prosthetic or human valve. A blood test that measures oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. In patients who require coronary artery bypass graft surgery, it is sometimes desirable to use arteries from other parts of the body to provide the bypass grafts. This is known as arterial grafting. The alternative is to use vein grafts for coronary bypass surgery. Blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart to the arms, legs, head, body and organs. X-ray of an artery after dye is injected. Patient may or may not be admitted to the hospital after the test. The process whereby abnormal deposits of lipids, cholesterol and plaque build up, leading to narrowing or blockage in arteries taking blood to the hand, foot head or vital organs. Also called atherosclerosis. The aorta is the main blood vessel that leaves the heart to provide blood flow to the rest of the body. When the ascending or first part of the aorta is diseased, it sometimes needs to be replaced. The replacement is most often done with a synthetic cloth tube. A condition that occurs when the contents of the stomach or esophagus are breathed into the airways. A disease of the air passages that carry air in and out of the lungs. Asthma causes the airways to narrow, the lining of the airways to swell and the cells that line the airways to produce more mucus. These changes make breathing difficult and cause a feeling of not getting enough air into the lungs. Common symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing and excess mucus production. Partial or complete collapse of the lung, usually due to a blockage of the air passages with fluid, mucus or infection. Symptoms include dry cough, chest pain and mild shortness of breath. Atherectomy (DCA - Directional Coronary Atherectomy) The DCA catheter has a hollow cylinder on the tip with an open window on one side and a balloon on the other. When the catheter is inserted into the narrowed artery, the balloon is inflated, pushing the window against the fatty matter clogging the vessel. A blade (cutter) within the cylinder rotates and shaves off any fat, which protruded into the window. The shavings are caught in a chamber within the catheter and removed. This process is repeated as needed to allow better blood flow. Large build-up of fat, cholesterol and other substances on the walls of an artery, causing narrowing. Also called plaque. Commonly known as ""hardening of the arteries."" A disease in which fatty deposits accumulate on the inner walls of the arteries, causing narrowing or blockage that may result in a heart attack. The abnormal closure or absence of an opening or passage. The upper chambers of the heart. Atrium refers to one chamber of the heart. Atrial fibrillation is an irregular heart rhythm in which many impulses begin and spread through the atria. The resulting rhythm is disorganized, rapid and irregular and the atria are not able to fully empty their contents into the ventricles. Atrial flutter is a regular heart rhythm in which many impulses begin and spread through the atria. The resulting rhythm is organized, but so rapid that the atria are not able to fully empty their contents into the ventricles. A myxoma is a tumor of the heart. It resides in the atrial chamber and causes symptoms when its growth produces a tumor so large it obstructs blood flow through the heart chambers. The atria are the chambers of the heart in which the blood dwells prior to entering the ventricles, which are the main pumping chambers. The right and left atrial lie next to each other in the heart and there is a membranous wall or septum between the two. In some people, there can be a hole in the muscular wall or septum, known as an atrial septal defect. Tiny defects called patent foramen ovale are present in up to 30 percent of people and are of no consequence except in unusual circumstances. Moderate size to larger size defects should be corrected and may require heart surgery. A center of special cells located near the center of the heart that helps to regulate the heart rhythm. Here, the electrical current slows for a moment before going on to the ventricles. The top filling chamber of the heart. There are two atria - the left and the right, divided by a muscular wall, called the septum. The atrium contracts before the ventricle to allow optimal filling of the ventricle. The doctor who has the main responsibility for your care while you are in the hospital. There may be other doctors caring for you such as consulting doctors, resident doctors, and medical students. A regulatory structure that helps people adapt to changes in their environment. It adjusts or modifies some functions in response to stress. The ANS helps regulate blood vessels' size and blood pressure, the heart's electrical activity and ability to contract, the bronchium's diameter (and thus air flow) in the lungs, the movement and work of the stomach, intestine and salivary glands, the secretion of insulin and the urinary and sexual functions. Balloon Angioplasty (PTCA - Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty) A specially designed balloon catheter with a small balloon tip is guided to the point of narrowing in the artery. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to compress the fatty matter into the artery wall and stretch the artery open to increase blood flow through the blood vessel. A nonsurgical treatment for achalasia. While the patient is under light sedation, the gastroenterologist inserts a specially designed balloon through the lower esophageal sphincter and inflates it. The balloon disrupts the esophageal muscle to relieve the pressure that blocks food from passing easily into the stomach. Some patients may have to undergo repeat dilation treatments to achieve an improvement in symptoms, or other treatments may also be needed. Bacterial endocarditis is an infection of the heart's inner lining (endocardium) or the heart valves. This can damage or even destroy your heart valves. A test in which the patient swallows a barium sulfate preparation (liquid or other form) and its movement through the esophagus is evaluated using X-ray technology. Barium is safe and does not dissolve or react in the body. It is used as a contrast material because it blocks x-rays so the area being evaluated appears white against a dark background. A condition that develops in some people who have chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or inflammation of the esophagus. During this surgical procedure, to treat heart failure, the surgeon cuts out a piece of the patient's enlarged left ventricular muscle. The intention is to reduce the size of the left ventricular cavity, improve left ventricular function and reverse congestive heart failure. This procedure is not performed at Cleveland Clinic Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at this time because long term results revealed a significant failure rate, however, this procedure has led to better surgical techniques to treat those with heart failure (see infarct exclusion surgery) A drug that slows heart rate, lowers blood pressure, controls angina and protects patients with prior heart attacks from future heart attacks. A valve with two leaflets (cusps) instead of three. Professionals who are skilled in helping people make decisions about what is morally right and wrong. The removal of a sample of tissue via a small needle. The tissue is removed for examination to determine a diagnosis. BIPAP (Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure) Machine A breathing machine that uses two pressure levels (inspiratory and expiratory) to provide breathing assistance. This machine is often used for patients with sleep apnea or respiratory failure. A clot forms when clotting factors in the blood cause it to coagulate or become a solid, jelly-like mass. When a blood clot forms inside a blood vessel (a thrombus), it can dislodge and travel through the blood stream, causing a heart attack or stroke. The force exerted in the arteries by blood as it circulates. It is divided into systolic (when the heart contracts) and diastolic (when the heart is filling) pressures. Medicine used to prevent clots from forming or getting larger. Heparin is generally given through the vein and Coumadin (warfarin) by mouth. A test that can help establish compatibility between two different types of blood. Blood types include A, B, AB or O. A waste product regularly removed by the kidneys and eliminated in the urine. Regular testing of the BUN level serves as an indicator of how well the kidney is functioning. A flexible tube that transports blood throughout the body. Arteries, veins, and capillaries are the body's blood vessels. The number, derived by dividing body weight by height squared; used to determine health risk created by excess body weight. A treatment for some patients with achalasia. Botox is a protein made by the bacteria that cause botulism. When injected into muscles in very small quantities, Botox can relax spastic muscles. It works by preventing nerves from sending signals to the muscles that tell them to contract. Brain damage that is so severe and extensive that the brain cannot recover. Breathing has stopped, but the circulation may still be continuing because of artificial ventilation. Donor organs can only be taken from people who are declared brain dead. Sounds heard through a stethoscope. The intensity of the sound of air moving in and out of the lungs may indicate the amount of obstruction. A temporary tube put into the nose or mouth. Anesthesia or air and oxygen pass through the tube allowing artificial breathing. A pair of breathing tubes that connect the trachea to the lungs. Oxygen and carbon dioxide travel in opposite directions through the bronchi. Branches of the airways (air passages) in the lungs. The smallest branches of the airways in the lungs. They connect to the alveoli (air sacs). Irritation and inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes. The irritation causes coughing and excess amounts of mucus in the airways which can lead to difficulty breathing. Bronchitis is considered chronic when the person has a productive cough (coughs up mucus) and shortness of breath that lasts at least three months each year for at least two years in a row. Medication used to relax the muscle bands that tighten around the airways to increase air flow. Bronchodilators also help clear mucus from the lungs. A long, thin tube with a small camera at the end that is used to evaluate the airways. The bronchoscope is passed through the nose or mouth, past the vocal chords and down the airway as far as necessary. The camera transmits the images on a television monitor. Bronchoscopy can be used to remove objects or mucus blocking the airway, or to remove growths in the airway. A diagnostic test used to view the inside of the airway. The test can be performed to diagnose lung diseases or locate the source of a problem by visualizing the throat, larynx, trachea and lungs and collecting tissue samples for biopsy. The sudden tightening of the bands of muscle that surround the airways, causing the airways to become narrower. Bronchospasm may result in wheezing. An abnormal sound heard when a stethoscope is placed over an artery. Most commonly affects the small and medium sized arteries, veins, and nerves. The arteries of the arms and legs become narrowed or blocked, causing lack of blood supply (ischemia) to the fingers, hands, toes and feet. The electrical impulses travel down a normal pathway through the heart. From the SA node, the impulse travels to the AV node. Then it goes to the bundle of His. The bundle divides into a right bundle and the left bundle. The bundles take the impulse through the ventricles (bottom chambers) to cause them to contract. Normally, the electrical impulse travels down both the right and left bundle branches at the same speed and the ventricles contract at the same time. If there is a block in one of the branches, it is called a bundle branch block. A bundle branch block causes one ventricle to contract just after the other ventricle. A surgical procedure designed to increase blood flow to an organ or extremity that has narrowing or blockage of the blood supplying artery. Examples include coronary artery bypass surgery, aortic replacement, ABI (aorta-bi-iliac), ABF (aorto-bi-femoral), and femoral-popliteal bypass) CRP is a protein found in the blood. It is a marker for inflammation, meaning its presence indicates a heightened state of inflammation in the body. Inflammation is a normal response to many physical states including fever, injury and infection, and is now believed to play a role in the initiation and progression of cardiovascular disease. An individual who has recently passed away of causes not affecting the organ intended for transplant. Cadaver organs usually come from people who have willed their organs before death by signing organ donor cards. Permission for donation also can be given by the deceased person's family at the time of death. A process in which tissue becomes hardened due to deposits of calcium salts. Calcification of blood vessels plays a role in the development of atherosclerosis. A mineral found mainly in dairy products that is used by the body as a building block of bone and for the proper functioning of organs and muscles. It is needed in many phases of blood clotting. Calcium is also an ingredient of artery-clogging plaque. A drug that reduces spasm of the blood vessels, lowers blood pressure, and controls angina; acts by selectively blocking the uptake of calcium by the cells. A small plastic tube used to supply extra oxygen through the nose. Tiny blood vessels connecting arteries to veins. These blood vessels carry oxygen and nutrients to individual cells. An organic compound, found in sugars, cereal, fruits and vegetables, that provide fuel for the body. A colorless, odorless gas that is formed in tissues of the body, created during metabolism when the cells use oxygen to burn fat and release energy. The lungs release it when you breathe out. A gas found in cigarette smoke; damages artery walls and reduces the ability of blood to carry oxygen, increasing the risk of coronary artery disease. When the heart stops beating suddenly and respiration (breathing) and other body functions stop as a result. The use of a stethoscope to listen to the sounds the heart makes as it contracts and relaxes. Cardiac auscultation can be used to evaluate the heart rate, rhythm, and flow through the valves. An invasive imaging procedure that involves inserting a catheter into a blood vessel in the arm or leg, and guiding it to your heart with the aid of a special x-ray machine. Contrast dye is injected through the catheter so that x-ray movies of your valves, coronary arteries and heart chambers are taken. Cardiac catheterization is also called coronary angiography. The amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute. A structured program of education and activity guided toward lifestyle modification, increasing functional capabilities and peer support. Doctor specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease. An abnormal heart condition in which the heart is dilated (poor pumping power), restrictive (impaired ability of the heart to fill) and hypertrophic (enlarged heart). CPR is a technique designed to temporarily circulate oxygenated blood through the body of a person whose heart has stopped. It involves assessing the airway; if necessary breathing for the person; determining if the person is pulseless; and if necessary, applying pressure to the chest to circulate blood. Relates to the blood and blood vessels. A procedure used to convert an irregular heart rhythm to a normal heart rhythm by applying electric shock. Cardioversion may be accomplished using medications or a defibrillator. A vessel that supplies the brain with oxygenated blood. A progressive disease which involves the buildup of fatty material and plaque in the carotid arteries; can lead to a stroke. Carotid Angiography (carotid angiogram, carotid angio) An invasive imaging procedure that involves inserting a catheter into a blood vessel in the arm or leg, and guiding it to the carotid arteries with the aid of a special x-ray machine. Contrast dye is injected through the catheter so that x-ray movies of your carotid arteries (the arteries that supply your brain with oxygen-rich blood) are taken. An abnormal sound, heard when using a stethoscope to listen to blood flow in the carotid artery. This is the main artery in the neck; it brings blood to the head. An imaging procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to view the blood vessels in the neck to and determine the presence of narrowing in the carotid arteries. A thin, flexible instrument used to introduce or withdraw fluids from the body. A catheter also may be used to monitor blood pressure. A common cause of stroke - an embolus that has moved through the blood stream and obstructs an artery leading to the brain. The medical term used to describe a stroke Used to view the lungs and lower respiratory tract. A chest X-ray may be used for diagnosis and therapy. A fatty substance that is acquired in part from certain foods. A high cholesterol level may lead to atherosclerosis. The thin, fibrous chords that lead from the valve leaflets to the small papillary muscles within the heart muscle wall, contributes to the support of the tricuspid and mitral valves. Continuing over a certain period of time; long-term. Damaged valves in the veins or a blood clot in the leg may cause ongoing swelling, blood pooling in the legs, and if untreated, discomfort and ulceration. Hair-like structures that line the airways in the lungs and help to clean out the airways. A research study or protocol conducted with patients to evaluate a new medical treatment, drug or device, to compare the effect and value of an intervention or treatment with a control. Control means there's no intervention or treatment given, only a placebo or standard treatment. Clinical researchers conduct clinical trials. () The purpose of clinical trials is to find new and improved methods of treating different diseases and special conditions. A group of chemicals in the blood, including fibrinogen, prothrombin, and calcium, that combine to form thrombi. The ends of the fingers and toes enlarge and bend inward; related to inadequate oxygen-rich blood supply. Often seen with congenital heart defects, but also seen in other conditions. A procedure using cardiac and respiratory equipment and medications possibly to restore the heartbeat and/or breathing. Problem with blood clotting, either too much clotting or not enough. A severe narrowing of the aorta, causing a decrease in blood flow to the lower part of the body. This narrowing is a congenital defect and can be corrected with surgery. The seal is a protein material that is used after an invasive procedure (such as a cardiac catheterization) performed through the groin. The ""seal"" works with your body's natural healing processes to form a clot in the artery, decreasing the amount of time needed to lie flat. The collagen seal cannot be given to every patient for individual reasons. Once a seal has been placed in the groin artery, that artery cannot be used during another procedure for at least 3 months after the seal has been placed. Small capillary-like branches of the artery that form over time in response to narrowed coronary arteries. The collaterals ""bypass"" the area of narrowing and help to restore blood flow. However, during times of increased exertion, the collaterals may not be able to supply enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle. The heart valves are made up of leaflets. The leaflets touch each other and the edge of the area where they come in contact is known as the commissures. In some patients, specifically those with rheumatic heart disease, the commissures can become scarred and fail to open and allow blood to flow through easily. In situations like this, the commissures can be released or reopened with a procedure known as commissurotomy. An arrhythmia. The electrical current is slowed between the atria and ventricles. In more severe cases, conduction is blocked completely and the atria and ventricles beat independently. Starchy foods that are good sources of energy and nutrients, such as bread, rice, pasta and grains. The act of following orders and adhering to rules and policies, i.e. taking one's medications after transplant. The occurrence of diseases or medical problems simultaneously in the body. An x-ray procedure that combines many x-ray images with the aid of a computer to generate cross-sectional views of the body. Heart defects present at birth. Also known as heart failure. A condition where the heart muscle weakens and can not pump blood efficiently throughout the body. Disease caused by problem with collagen (the elastic support system in the body); can have a vascular component. Examples include Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Can also be referred to mixed connective tissue diseases (MCTD) The pericardium is the sac around the heart. In some patients, this sac can become inflamed and scarred. If this scarring process produces a contracture or shrinkage of the pericardium, it can prevent the heart from filling to its full extent. This disease is known as constrictive pericarditis. Any condition which indicates that a particular course of treatment (or exercise) would be inadvisable or cause harm. A general term used to describe several lung diseases. The most common diseases in this group include chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Chronic asthma may also be included. COPD worsens gradually, causing limited airflow in and out of the lungs. Enlargement of the right side of the heart. Cor pulmonale weakens the heart and causes increased shortness of breath and swelling in the feet and legs. Patients who have chronic COPD with low oxygen levels may develop this condition. A procedure that allows picture to be taken of the arteries supplying the heart with blood (the coronary arteries). Angiography shows blockages in the arteries. Network of blood vessels that branch off the aorta to supply the heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood. There are two main coronary arteries: the right and the left. The left splits into two arteries called the circumflex and the left anterior descending (LAD) arteries, thus, the heart is often considered to have three major coronary arteries. A build-up of fatty material in the wall of the coronary artery that causes narrowing of the artery. During coronary spasm, the coronary arteries restrict or spasm on and off, causing lack of blood supply to the heart muscle. It may occur at rest and can even occur in people without significant coronary artery disease. CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) Machine A breathing machine that provides pressure to keep the upper airways open during breathing. This machine is often used for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. A waste product in the blood that is removed by the kidneys and eliminated in the urine. Regular testing of the creatinine level serves as an indicator of how well the kidney is functioning. A test that establishes the compatibility or closeness of blood between the organ donor and recipient. A positive crossmatch shows that the donor and patient are incompatible. A negative crossmatch means there is no reaction between donor and patient and that the transplant may proceed. A blue tint to the skin, indicates the body is not receiving enough oxygen-rich blood. A blood test that measures the amount of cyclosporine in the blood. Based on the amount of cyclosporine measured, a physician decides what dose of cyclosporine is appropriate for a patient. A common virus that may be present without symptoms in healthy people, but can be a serious condition if present in transplant patients. A condition in which a patient is unable to understand his or her choices or declare personal wishes about his or her care. A clot in a deep vein, usually the leg. Symptoms may include pain, swelling or no symptoms at all. If untreated, the clot could travel to the lungs. A machine that is used to administer an electric shock to the heart in order to reestablish normal heart rhythm. A condition in which the body does not produce or respond to insulin (a hormone produced by your body, which allows blood sugar or glucose into your body's cells for energy. An artificial means of cleansing the blood of waste products and removing fluids from the body when the patient’s own kidneys are unable to continue this process. The thin muscle below the lungs and heart that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen. The diaphragm is the most efficient breathing muscle. Surgery performed on the diaphragm. Diaphragmatic surgery may be performed to treat a hernia or any other conditions that affect the diaphragm. The part of the heart cycle during which the myocardium relaxes and expands. During diastole, blood fills the heart chambers. The lower number in a blood pressure reading that indicates the pressure in the heart when the muscle is relaxed (the point of least pressure). The pressure of the blood in the arteries when the heart is filling. It is the lower of two blood pressure measurements, e.g., 120/80, where 80 is the diastolic pressure. A measurement of how much oxygen is carried from your lungs into your bloodstream. A disease of the myocardium (heart muscle) that causes the heart cavity to become stretched and enlarged, and the pumping capacity of the heart is reduced. The increase in size of a blood vessel. If you are unable to exercise on a treadmill or stationary bicycle for a stress test, a medication, called dipyridamole (Persantine) is used instead of exercise to test the heart's blood flow. A drug that helps the body get rid of excess water by increasing the amount of urine the body excretes. An advanced directive that means no CPR is to be done when the heart and lungs stop. Dobutamine Stress Echo Echocardiogram (dobutamine echo, pharmacological echocardiogram) A procedure that involves infusing a medication through an intravenous (IV) line, called dobutamine, while you are closely monitored. The medication stimulates your heart, to evaluate your heart and valve function at rest and with exertion, when you are unable to exercise on a treadmill or stationary cycle. Echocardiography is an imaging procedure that creates a graphic outline of the heart's movement, valves and chambers using high-frequency sound waves that come from a hand held wand placed on your chest. Echo is often combined with Doppler ultrasound and color Doppler to evaluate blood flow across the heart's valves. A person who gives an organ, tissue or blood to another person. A compatible donor is a person who has the same tissue and blood types as the person who receives the organ, tissue or blood. A written advance directive in which individuals name someone else (the ""agent"" or ""proxy"") to make health care decisions for them when they are unable to speak for themselves. Dysautonomia (neurocardiogenic syncope, - postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous syndrome. Causes symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, increased heart rate, and other symptoms. See syncope. Abnormal or precancerous cells or tissue. Shortness of breath, difficulty breathing. A congenital malformation of the tricuspid valve. It usually occurs together with a septal defect. An imaging procedure that creates a moving picture outline of the heart's valves and chambers using high-frequency sound waves that come from a hand held wand placed on your chest or passed down your throat. Echo is often combined with Doppler ultrasound and color Doppler to evaluate blood flow across the heart's valves. Doppler senses the speed of sound and can pick up abnormal leakage or blockage of valves. In patients who are unable to provide oxygen for their own blood or enough blood circulation, they can be put on life support known as extra corporeal membrane oxygenation. The blood is withdrawn from a large vein in the body and passes through a pumping mechanism, and then through a device which puts oxygen into the blood and removes carbon dioxide from the blood. The blood is then returned to the body and circulated in such a way as to sustain life. Out of place. An ectopic heart beat originates in an abnormal location of the heart. Abnormal swelling of tissue due to fluid buildup, usually in the hands, feet, ankles, legs or abdomen; may be a complication of heart failure. A disease characterized by thickening of the pulmonary arteries, elevated blood pressure in the lungs, and heart failure. Eisenmenger's syndrome develops as a complication of ventricular septal defect, a congenital disorder. The amount of blood pumped out of a ventricle during each heart beat. The ejection fraction evaluates how well the heart is pumping; Normally 50 - 70 percent. A test that records on graph paper the electrical activity of the heart via small electrode patches attached to the skin. An EKG helps a physician determine the causes of abnormal heartbeat or detect heart damage. One of the substances in the blood that helps to regulate the proper balance of body fluids. Examples of electrolytes include sodium and potassium. An EP Study is a recording of the electrical activity your heart. This test is used to help your doctor find out the cause of your rhythm disturbance and the best treatment for you. During the test, your doctor may safely reproduce your arrhythmia, then give you medications to see which one controls it best. The blockage of an artery by an embolus (see below). A blood clot that moves through the blood stream. When forced into a smaller blood vessel, it can create an obstruction. A degenerative disease characterized by the destruction, or breakdown, of the walls of the alveoli (air sacs) located at the end of the bronchial tubes. The damaged alveoli are not able to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and the blood. The bronchioles lose their elasticity and collapse during exhalation, trapping air in the lungs. The trapped air keeps fresh air and oxygen from entering the lungs. A collection of pus in the pleural space (the cavity between the lung and the membrane that surrounds it). An infection of the inner lining of the heart or its valves. It is usually caused by bacteria and is more likely to occur in people who have heart valve defects or have had heart surgery to treat valve disease. The smooth, inner lining of the heart chambers.

A treatment for those with symptomatic coronary artery disease, not eligible for standard treatments of revascularization. During EECP, cuffs wrapped around the calves, thighs and buttocks are inflated and deflated, gently but firmly compressing the blood vessels in the lower limbs, increasing blood flow to the heart. EECP may stimulate the openings or formation of collateral vessels to create a ""natural bypass"" around narrowed or blocked arteries. A protein in cells that stimulates chemical reactions in the body. The thin membrane surrounding the myocardium The study of large populations to determine the frequency, distribution, and risk factors associated with a particular disease. A hormone produced by the adrenal glands that also acts as a neurotransmitter for nerve cells. As part of the fight-or-flight response, epinephrine signals the heart to pump harder, increases blood pressure and has other effects on the cardiovascular system. Also called adrenaline. Erythrocyte (red blood cell, red cell, red corpuscle) Red blood cell that delivers oxygen to tissues and removes carbon dioxide and other waste products. The uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the esophagus. The uncontrolled reproduction of cells results in the formation of tumors that can block or compress the esophagus.

A small recorder (monitor) is attached to electrodes on your chest. It is worn continuously for a period of time. If symptoms are felt, an event button can be depressed, and the heart's rhythm is recorded and saved in the recorder. The rhythm can be saved and transmitted over the phone line. A procedure that combines echocardiography with exercise to evaluate the heart's function at rest and with exertion. Echocardiography is an imaging procedure that creates a picture of the heart's movement, valves and chambers using high-frequency sound waves that come from a hand held wand placed on your chest. Echo is often combined with Doppler ultrasound and color Doppler to evaluate blood flow across the heart's valves. A test used to provide information about how the heart responds to stress. It usually involves walking on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike at increasing levels of difficulty, while the electrocardiogram, heart rate and blood pressure are monitored. When one is not able to do activity, medications may be used to ""stress"" the heart. This is called a pharmacological stress test.

A destructive fragment of oxygen produced as a byproduct when cells use oxygen to burn fat. Death of tissue due to inadequate blood supply, usually affects the extremities (hands or feet), is more likely to occur in people with atherosclerosis, vascular disease, or other conditions associated with poor blood circulation. Physician who specializes in diagnosing and treating disorders of the digestive system, such as hepatitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and colon or rectal cancer. Gastroenterologists may perform many specialized tests, such as endoscopy, to diagnose or treat diseases. When necessary, they may consult with surgeons. A condition that occurs when the contents of the stomach travel back up into the esophagus. When you swallow, food passes down your throat and through your esophagus to your stomach. A valve called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) controls the passage of food from the esophagus to the stomach when you swallow. It remains tightly closed except when you swallow food. When this muscle fails to close or opens spontaneously, the acid, bile and food contents of the stomach can travel backward into the esophagus. When stomach acid enters the lower part of the esophagus, it can produce a burning sensation, commonly referred to as heartburn. An artificial opening from the stomach to a hole (stoma) in the abdomen where a feeding tube is inserted. The feeding tube allows the delivery of nutrients directly into the small intestine, bypassing the stomach. A feeding may be needed temporarily after certain surgeries to allow recovery. See also enteral nutrition. Gene therapy is correcting functional gene loss by delivering genes to human tissues. Often DNA viruses engineered to be safe or nonviral DNA are used to help deliver a healthy gene to the tissue cells. Enlargement of the gums.

A machine that oxygenates the blood and circulates it throughout the body during surgery. An electrocardiography machine designed to monitor heart function continuously. Heart surgery is any surgery, which involves the heart or heart valves. There are four valves in the heart: the tricuspid and the mitral valve, which lie between the atria and ventricles and the pulmonic and aortic valves which lie between the ventricles and the blood vessels leaving the heart. The heart valves help to maintain one-way blood flow through the heart. A surgical treatment for achalasia in which the muscles of the valve between the esophagus into the stomach are cut. Traditional Heller myotomy surgery is completed through an open incision in the abdomen or through an incision in the left side of the chest between the ribs. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy surgery can be performed using smaller incisions with a minimally invasive approach.

A small tube connected to a catheter in a vein in the arm for easy access. An infection for which transplant patients are at risk. It appears as small sores on the skin, lips or genitals. When there are no sores, the herpes virus lies dormant (not causing infection) in the body. An opening in the diaphragm -- the muscular wall separating the chest cavity from the abdomen. Also called hiatus hernia. An area of the stomach that bulges up into the chest through the hiatus. Normally, the esophagus (food pipe) goes through the hiatus to drain into the stomach. In a , the stomach bulges up into the chest through that opening. After a heart attack, some areas of heart muscle do not pump as they should. Some areas will have permanent damage. Other areas are able to return to their normal function if blood flow is returned to that area by medications or a procedure. Hibernating myocardium is heart muscle that is ""resting"" and may possibly return to normal function. Lipoprotein particle in the blood. HDL is known as ""good"" cholesterol because it deposits cholesterol in the liver, where it is excreted by the body. High HDL is thought to protect against coronary artery disease. An excessive increase of hair growth, sometimes leading to male-pattern hair growth in a female. A common side effect of corticosteroids, it can also occur with cyclosporine (Sandimmune) therapy. Hirsutism can be easily treated with depilatory creams or other hair removal methods. A naturally-occurring substance that is released by the immune system after being exposed to an allergen. When you inhale an allergen, mast cells located in the nose and sinus membranes release histamine. Histamine then attaches to receptors on nearby blood vessels, causing them to enlarge (dilate). Histamine also binds to other receptors located in nasal tissues, causing redness, swelling, itching and changes in the secretions. See H2 receptor antagonists. Molecules found on all nucleated cells in the body that characterize each individual as unique. These antigens are inherited from one's parents. Human leukocyte antigens determine the compatibility of tissues for transplantation from one individual to another. There are three major genetically controlled groups: HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR. In transplantation, the HLA tissue types of the donor and recipient are sometimes an important part of the selection process. This depends on the recipient's antibodies. A small recorder (monitor) is attached to electrodes on your chest. It records the heart's rhythm continuously for 24 hours. After the monitor is removed the heart's beats are counted and analyzed by a technician with the aid of a computer. Your doctor can learn if you are having irregular heart beats, what kind they are, how long they last, as well as what may cause them. An amino acid.

The iliac veins eventually join to form the inferior vena cava. The body's defense against foreign objects or organisms, such as bacteria, viruses or transplanted organs or tissue. The body's response mechanism for fighting against bacteria, viruses and other foreign substances. If a cell or tissue (such as bacteria or a transplanted organ) is recognized as not belonging to the body, the immune system will act against the ""invader."" The immune system is the body's way to fight disease. A drug that prevents the immune system from responding to cells that it recognizes as foreign to the body. Such drugs prevent the immune system from recognizing that a transplanted organ, such as a lung, is not the organ a person had when he or she was born. The artificial suppression of the immune response, usually through drugs, so that the body will not reject a transplanted organ or tissue. Drugs commonly used to suppress the immune system after transplant include prednisone, azathioprine (Imuran), mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept), and cyclosporine (Neoral). An ICD is a surgically inserted electronic device that constantly monitors your heart rate and rhythm. When it detects a very fast, abnormal heart rhythm, it delivers electrical energy to the heart muscle. This causes the heart to beat in a normal rhythm again. A device that is used to encourage deep inspiration to expand the lungs and improve cough effectiveness. Tissue death due to lack of oxygen-rich blood. A team of physicians and nurses who help control the hospital environment to protect you against harmful sources of infection. One of the body’s defense mechanisms, inflammation results in increased blood flow in response to infection and certain chronic conditions. Symptoms of inflammation include redness, swelling, pain and heat. In the heart, inflammation is a local response to cellular injury, inflammation (triggered by environmental factors or genetic influences) causes a sequence of actions in the coronary artery such as, plaque rupture, thrombus formation and embolization into the blood vessels within the heart - placing one at increased risk for heart attack. A process of reaching an agreement based on full disclosure. Informed consent has components of disclosure, comprehension, competence and voluntary response. Informed consent often refers to the process by which one decides to donate the organs of a loved one. Innocent Heart Murmurs (functional or physiologic murmur) Sounds made by the blood circulating through the heart's chambers and valves or through blood vessels near the heart. Innocent murmurs are common in children and are quite harmless. The two principle veins returning blood from the upper part of the body.

Intermittent claudication can be caused by atherosclerosis or a spasm or occlusion in an artery. A special nursing area devoted to providing continuous and immediate care to patients recovering right after surgery or to seriously ill patients. The inner layer of the arterial wall. Atherosclerosis originates in the intima. The intra-aortic balloon pump is a machine that can help the pumping function of the heart. It is usually inserted through an artery in the groin area and threaded backwards into the descending thoracic aorta in the chest. In this location the balloon inflates and deflates in synchrony with the heart in order to aid the blood pumping function of the heart in patients with cardiac disease. An Intracardiac Tumor can be any tumor of the heart, either malignant or benign. The most common tumor of the heart is a benign atrial myxoma. An invasive procedure, performed along with cardiac catheterization; a miniature sound probe (transducer) on the tip of a coronary catheter is threaded through the coronary arteries and, using high-frequency sound waves, produces detailed images of the interior walls of the arteries.

A feeding tube that is inserted through the skin on the abdomen into the small intestine. The feeding tube allows the delivery of nutrients directly into the small intestine, bypassing the stomach. A J-tube may be needed temporarily after certain surgeries to allow recovery. A minimally invasive surgical technique. During laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon inserts a thin, telescopic-like instrument called a laparoscope through a small incision above the umbilicus (belly button). The laparoscope is connected to a tiny video camera -- smaller than a dime -- that projects a view of the abdomen onto video monitors located in the operating room. The abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide, a gas, to allow your surgeon a better view of the operative area. Three or four additional small incisions are made in the abdomen through which the surgeon inserts specialized surgical instruments. The surgeon uses these instruments to perform the operation. As compared with traditional surgery, patients who undergo laparoscopic surgery experience decreased postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay and a more rapid recovery and return to work. Other possible benefits include reduced risk of infection and less bleeding. See Nissen fundoplication. A minimally-invasive surgical procedure used to treat achalasia. This surgical treatment opens up the lower valve (lower esophageal sphincter) so that food passes from the mouth to the stomach by gravity. Because the lower esophageal sphincter’s function is to stop the return of gastric contents into the esophagus, a partial fundoplication procedure is also performed to minimize reflux and protect the esophagus from damaging gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). An evaluation that involves looking into the abdominal cavity with a special camera (called a laparoscope). A lead is a special wire that delivers energy from a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to the heart muscle. A lead extraction is the removal of one or more leads from inside the heart. Leads that are placed outside the heart during open heart surgery cannot be removed during this type of procedure. Thin pieces of tissue or flaps that make up a valve. In patients with end-stage heart disease whose hearts do not pump a sufficient amount of blood to keep the body healthy, it is possible to place a mechanical device that aids in the pumping function of the blood.

The uncontrolled reproduction of cells results in the formation of tumors that can block or compress airways and displace or damage normal lung tissue. This can make the lung stop functioning as it should. Also called respiratory failure. The sudden inability of the lungs to provide normal oxygen delivery or normal carbon dioxide removal. Also called pulmonary nodule. A round lesion or growth located within the lung. Lung nodules usually do not cause symptoms, but may be detected on a chest x-ray. More than half of lung nodules are noncancerous (benign) and may be caused by a previous infection. A needle biopsy may be required to test the nodule to determine if is benign or malignant. A surgical procedure in which a healthy lung from a donor replaces the recipient's unhealthy lung. Lung transplant is a treatment option reserved for selected patients with chronic lung diseases. A surgical procedure performed to remove diseased, emphysematous lung tissue. This procedure reduces the size of an over-inflated lung and allows the expansion of the remaining, often more functional lung. This surgery has been shown to help improve breathing ability, lung capacity and overall quality of life in selected patients.

MRI uses large magnets and radiofrequency waves to produce pictures of the body's internal structures. No X-ray exposure is involved. MRI acquires information about the heart as it is beating; creating moving images of the heart throughout its pumping cycle. Also called thoracic artery. Artery located in the chest wall and used for coronary artery bypass surgery. Most commonly kept intact at its origin, and sewn to the coronary artery beyond the site of blockage. If the surgeon removes the mammary artery from its origin to use as a bypass graft, it is then called a ""free"" mammary artery bypass graft. A condition that affects the connective tissue. Connective tissue holds the body together and provides support to many structures throughout the body. In Marfan syndrome, the body's connective tissue isn't normal. As a result, many body systems are affected, including the heart,blood vessels, bones, tendons, cartilage, eyes, nervous system, skin and lungs. The Maze procedure is a surgical treatment for chronic atrial fibrillation. The surgeon makes multiple incisions in the atrium to form a path or maze through which the impulse can travel to reach the atrioventricular node. After this is done the atrium is sewn back together and a normal rhythm is more easily maintained. In people who require heart valve replacement surgery, it is sometimes desirable to implant a mechanical valve. A mechanical valve is made of artificial parts and functions similarly to a normal heart valve. People who have a mechanical valve implanted must take blood thinners lifelong to prevent blood clots from forming on the mechanical valve. A benign or cancerous growth that forms in the area of the chest that separates the lungs (mediastinum). A minimally invasive surgical technique used to treat some mediastinal tumors.

An inorganic compound needed by the body for good health, proper metabolic functioning, and disease prevention. Examples are calcium, magnesium, and iron. Minimally Invasive Heart Surgery is a technique developed to reduce the trauma associated with surgery. The incision through which the surgeon works is smaller. This smaller incision may allow the patient to heal more rapidly and decrease the time to recovery and full activity. It also helps to reduce the pain and discomfort associated with heart surgery. See video-assisted thoracic surgery. Mitral insufficiency is a condition where blood in the left ventricle leaks back through the mitral valve into the left atrium and can back into the lungs. The mitral valve normally opens to allow blood to flow into the left ventricle and then closes, preventing blood from backing up into the atrium during the ventricle's contraction. Mitral stenosis is a condition in where the mitral valve becomes narrowed or stenotic preventing the easy flow of blood from the left atrium into the left ventricle. The mitral valve is the valve that lies between the left atrium and left ventricle (main pumping chamber of the heart). This valve allows blood to flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle and then prevents the back flow of blood into the left atrium during ventricular contraction.

Failure to follow instructions given by health care providers, such as not taking medication as prescribed or not attending follow-up appointments. Nonpenetrating. Noninvasive tests or procedures do not penetrate the body and are usually considered low-risk and painless. A MI or heart attack that does not cause changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG) however, chemical markers in the blood indicate that damage has occurred to the heart muscle. In non-Q-wave MI, a clot may block the coronary artery for a period of time, and then break up by itself or collateral circulation may help to restore blood flow to the area of ischemia (lack of blood supply). The size of damage is fairly small; therefore, overall function of the heart is usually maintained. A hormone produced by the adrenal glands that also acts as a neurotransmitter for nerve cells. Part of the fight-or-flight response. The National Organ Transplant Act, passed by Congress in 1984, outlawed the sale of human organs and initiated the development of a national system for organ sharing and a scientific registry to collect and report transplant data. Nuclear imaging is a method of producing images by detecting radiation from different parts of the body after the administration of a radioactive tracer material. Excess of body fat that is 20 percent or more over a person's ideal weight. Obesity strains the cardiovascular system and increases the risk of diabetes, hypertension, and elevated lipid levels.

Impaired artery blood flow to the brain. During a stroke, brain cells in the affected area are starved for oxygen and subsequently die. If blood flow is returned to an area of heart muscle after a period of ischemia (lack of blood supply), the heart muscle may not pump normally for a period of days following the event. This is called ""stunned"" heart muscle or myocardium. Subvalvular aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the flow of blood below the aortic valve in the left ventricle. It is usually caused by a membrane or thickening in the muscle in this area. A sudden, unexpected death caused by loss of heart function. Most sudden cardiac deaths are caused by arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation. A clot in a superficial vein, just under the skin. Survival rates indicate the percentage of patients or grafts (transplanted organs) that are still alive functioning at a certain point posttransplant. Survival rates are often given at one-, three-, and five-year increments. Policy modifications are never made without examining their impact on transplant survival rates. Survival rates improve with technological and scientific advancements. Developing policies that reflect and respond to these advances in transplantation will also improve survival rates. A cluster of risk factors that together, put someone at higher risk of coronary artery disease. These risk factors include: central obesity (excessive fat tissue in the abdominal region), glucose intolerance, high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol, and high blood pressure. The circulation of blood from the left ventricle, through an extensive network of vessels that penetrate every part of the body, to the right side of the heart.

A surgeon who specializes in treating problems that affect all organs in the chest (thoracic) cavity, such as cancers and diseases of the lung, esophagus, and chest wall; abnormalities of the great vessels; birth defects of the chest; and tumors in the organs contained in the chest cavity. The highly-specialized team of thoracic surgeons at Cleveland Clinic has among the largest experience in the country in diagnosing and surgically treating diseases of the lung and esophagus. Thoracic surgeons work closely with specialists from other areas, including pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, thoracic anesthesiologists and medical and radiation oncologists, to provide a collaborative approach to your diagnosis and treatment. A surgical field focusing on treatments for lung cancer, tumors of the chest wall, emphysema, esophageal swallowing problems, lung transplantation, esophageal cancer and gastroesophageal reflux. Video imaging of the chest cavity and lung performed through a 5mm-10mm (1/4 inch) camera.

The total amount of cholesterol in the blood. A test that measures the amount of air in the lungs after a person has breathed in as much as possible. Also called the “windpipe.” The main airway (windpipe) supplying air to both lungs. A narrowing in the trachea that restricts air flow to the lungs. Small opening or incision made in the throat. Through the tracheostomy, a tube is placed to aid breathing for patients who may need to be supported longer than expected with mechanical ventilation. Instead of breathing through the nose and mouth, the patient then breathes through the tracheostomy or “trach.” An invasive imaging procedure that creates a picture of the heart's movement, valves and chambers using high frequency sound waves that come from a small transducer passed down your throat. TEE provides clear images of the heart's movement because the transducer is close to the heart and limits interference from air in the lungs. Echo is often combined with Doppler ultrasound and color Doppler to evaluate blood flow across the heart's valves. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA, also called a mini-stroke) A sudden onset of temporary symptoms (loss of sensation, movement, speech, mental function or vision) lasting minutes, or hours, that occurs when the brain is deprived of oxygen-rich blood but, the effects wear off completely after resumption of blood-flow. It can be a warning sign for stroke. May be caused by carotid artery narrowing or blockage. In patients with severe ischemic heart disease who are not candidates for bypass surgery, it is possible to do a procedure called trans-myocardial laser revascularization. In this procedure, an incision is made in the chest. The heart is exposed and small holes are drilled through the wall of the heart, with a laser allowing blood to flow from the inner chamber of the heart into the muscle of the heart. This procedure is still considered experimental and can be used only in a small number of patients. A registered nurse who coordinates all of the events leading up to and following your transplant. The transplant coordinator helps arrange your pre-transplant tests and helps find a suitable donor. The staff physician who performs the transplant surgery. The transplant surgeon follows your progress while you are in the hospital and monitors your post-transplant care after you are discharged. A small monitor is attached to electrode leads (usually on your finger or wrist. Your heart's rhythm is transmitted over the phone line with the aid of this device to your doctor's office. The tricuspid valve is the valve that separates the right atrium from the right ventricle and prevents blood from flowing back into the right atrium during contraction of the ventricle. A fat found in the blood. Most fat found in the diet and body fat is in the form of triglycerides. A temporary artificial method of providing food through a tube inserted into the stomach. This food is in a liquid form and contains calories, vitamins and electrolytes. Enteral feeding may be necessary when food cannot be taken by mouth. Break in the skin, usually on lower legs or fingers, related to poor circulation and blood pooling. United Network for Organ Sharing – the national nonprofit agency that establishes and enforces regulations to ensure equality in organ transplantation and fairness in distribution of donor organs. U.S. Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients A database of post-transplant information. Follow-up data on every transplant are used to track transplant center performance, transplant success rates and medical issues impacting transplant recipients. UNOS facilitates the collection, tracking and reporting of transplant recipient and donor data. This type of angina is considered an acute coronary syndrome. It may be a new symptom or a change from stable angina. It may come more often, occur at rest, or feel more severe. Although this angina can be relieved with oral medications, it is unstable and may progress to a heart attack. Usually medical treatment or a procedure is required in the near future. A series of x-rays used to evaluate the upper gastrointestinal system (the esophagus, stomach and part of the small intestine) to detect abnormalities. There are four valves in the heart: the tricuspid and the mitral valve, which lie between the atria and ventricles and the pulmonic and aortic valves which lie between the ventricles and the blood vessels leaving the heart. The heart valves help to maintain one-way blood flow through the heart. Balloon valvotomy is when a balloon is used to at the time of cardiac catheterization to increase the area of a narrowed valve. A procedure to improve valve function. A type of angina that occurs at rest. Most often due to coronary spasm. A type of medication that relaxes and dilates the blood vessels, allowing increased blood flow. Conditions caused by spasm of blood vessels, causing them to clamp down (constrict) or open up (dilate). Examples include Raynaud's Disease, Erythromelalgia, Hypothenar Hammer Syndrome. Blood vessels that carry blood from the arms, legs, head and body organs back to the heart. The two large veins that collect blood returning from all parts of the body and return it to the heart (right atrium) The inferior vena cava brings blood from the lower half of the body; and the superior vena cava brings blood from the upper half. A non-invasive imaging procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to determine the presence of clots in the arms or legs. A blockage in a vein caused by a thrombus. A machine used to assist or control breathing (may be called a respirator). The lower, pumping chambers of the heart. The heart has two ventricles - the right and left ventricle. An erratic, disorganized firing of impulses from the ventricles. The ventricles quiver and are unable to contract or pump blood to the body. This is a medical emergency that must be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation as soon as possible. In patients who suffer a significant heart attack, it is sometimes the case that the area of the muscle wall of the heart that is affected can become so weakened that it ruptures and leaks blood from the inner chamber of the heart. The right and left ventricles lie next to each other in the heart. The septum is the membranous wall that separates them. A ventricular septal defect is a hole in the septum. A rapid life-threatening rhythm originating from the lower chambers of the heart. The rapid rate prevents the heart from filling adequately with blood, and less blood is able to pump through the body. Surgery of the chest that is performed with a thoracoscope (small video-scope) using small incisions and special instruments to minimize trauma. During thoracoscopic surgery, three small (approximately 1-inch) incisions are used as compared with one long 6- to 8-inch incision that is used during traditional, “open” thoracic surgery. As compared with traditional surgery, patients who undergo minimally invasive surgery experience decreased postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay and a more rapid recovery and return to work. Other possible benefits include reduced risk of infection and less bleeding. A minimally invasive surgical technique that is less invasive than traditional thoracotomy surgery. During VATS lobectomy surgery, three 1-inch incisions and one 3- to 4-inch incision are made to provide access to the chest cavity without spreading of the ribs. With VATS lobectomy, the patient may experience a more rapid recovery with less pain and a shorter hospital stay (usually 3 days) than traditional thoracotomy surgery. One of the organic compounds needed by the body for good health, proper metabolic functioning and disease prevention. After evaluation by the transplant physician, and after committee presentation, a patient is added to the national waiting list by the transplant center. Lists are specific to both geographic area and organ type: heart, lung, kidney, pancreas, intestine, heart-lung, kidney-pancreas. Each time a donor organ becomes available, the computer generates a list of potential recipients based on factors that include blood type, organ size, medical urgency and time on the waiting list. A ""new"" United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) waiting list is generated each time an organ becomes available. There are many factors that go into the actual decision of donor selection and recipient matching. Although your place on the list and the amount of time you have been waiting for transplant are important factors, the transplant surgeon ultimately is the one to make the final decision. Surgical removal of a wedge-shaped portion of tissue from one, or both, lungs. A wedge resection is typically performed for the diagnosis or treatment of small lung nodules. WPW is a form of supraventricular tachycardia (fast heart rate originating above the ventricles). When you have WPW, along with your normal conduction pathway, you have extra pathways called accessory pathways. These electrical impulses set up a short circuit causing the heart to beat rapidly and conduct impulses in both directions. The impulses travel through the extra pathway (short cut) as well as the normal AV-HIS Purkinje system. The impulses can travel around the heart very quickly, in a circular pattern, causing the heart to beat unusually fast. This is called re-entry tachycardia.

Fibromyalgia • ME & C.F.S. Lyme Disease • Natural Wellness  Reprinted with the kind permission of Cort Johnson and . It seemed ever so clear. The reduction in the number of small nerves in the skin and eyes of roughly forty percent or so of the people with and chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) must bring the body – as opposed to the brain – into play. How could nerve damage in the body, after all, be explained by central sensitization in the brain?  Something separate must be going on in the body. The only problem with that notion is that, thus far, researchers have been unable to track down that something. Given the small nerve “burnout” found, the immune system was immediately fingered, but , including a recent study that looked for an have been unrewarding. Plus, the oddness of the small fiber neuropathy (SFN) occurring in FM had to be taken into account.  The SFN in FM appears to result in smaller nerves as well as reduced nerve density – an unusual combination.  Functionally, the nerve problems appear to be different as well. One study suggests that the slows as nerve activity increases. (That is reminiscent of a similar pattern in ME/CFS of pooping out under the stress of an increased workload.) Plus, the SFN symptoms in FM are a bit different. The seen in diabetes, where the symptoms first start in the feet and moves upwards, often doesn’t occur in FM.  Nor is the quite as expected. One study suggested that the SFN in FM is not increasing pain levels but is associated with pins and needles (paresthesias) sensations, and interestingly, autonomic nervous system symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an entirely “top-down” pathogenic mechanism by which increased CNS excitatory tone not only increased pain behavior but also altered the density and length of peripheral nerve fibers. Harte et al. 2017 Perhaps we are ready for a different interpretation of the SFN in FM. That new interpretation first showed up in a 2017 study by . Harte and Watson noted that brain imaging scans indicated that increased activity exists in the connections between the two brain regions (insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)) involved in producing pain sensations. (Both of these regions have been implicated in ME/CFS as well.) A part of the limbic system – the insula – regulates basic processes such as pain levels, the autonomic nervous system and the emotions. Problems with the insula have been implicated in both ME/CFS and FM. Several studies have produced a proximate cause – increased levels of the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, and reduced levels of an inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA – in the insula. Studies indicate that when Lyrica works, it works by rebalancing those levels. Harte and Watson’s novel idea proposed a very strong brain/body connection existed indeed. They proposed that hyperactivity in the insula is producing such strong pain sensations that the body was effectively burning out the nerves in the periphery in an attempt to stop them. Increasing the glutamate levels in the insulas of rats resulted in increased sensitivity to heat and pressure and – a reduction in the nerve fiber density in the rodents’ hind paws. The authors presented two possibilities: the peripheral nervous system “reorganization” to stop the flow of sensory stimuli to an already overheated brain; and the possibility that the alterations in the insula – a major autonomic nervous system regulator – could be impacting the small autonomic nervous system fibers found in conjunction with the sensory nerve fibers in the skin. The study also offered some hope for FM patients. Despite increasing the insula’s glutamate levels high enough to produce dramatically increased pain and reduce nerve density in the rodents’ feet, no nerve damage was found in the insula. It had been thought that glutamate-induced could be damaging neurons in FM – a more difficult situation. This study, though, found that both the insula and the anterior cingulate cruciate were fully intact; they were simply being supercharged. Neuron repair, then, in FM might not be needed.

The Brain and Pain Sensitization in the Skin A recent Brazilian study, “Potency of descending pain modulatory system is linked with peripheral sensory dysfunction in fibromyalgia: An exploratory study“, expands on the brain-body / body-brain connection in FM. The study, which used humans this time, determined whether a factor associated with reduced pain inhibition in the brain called BDNF was associated with problems with skin sensitization as measured by NPS (numerical pain scale) and QST (quantitative sensory testing) testing. This testing was used as an analogue for small nerve fiber problems. If increased sensitization in the skin was purely a peripheral (or body) phenomenon, it should not be related to problems in the brain. If, on the other hand, increased pain levels at the skin were associated with weaker brain inhibitory pain pathways – the two are likely related. The study measured a factor called BDNF (brain-derived-neurotrophic-factor) which has been found increased in FM. BDNF strengthens the excitatory and pain-triggering nerve pathways in the brain and weakens the inhibitory and pain reducing pathways. In fact, one study suggests this bad boy may even be able to turn pain inhibiting pathways into pain producing pathways (!). This study confirmed our hypothesis that the peripheral sensory dysfunction is associated with the disengagement of the descending pain modularity system (DPMS) in FM. – Unfortunately, the study did not directly measure small fiber density. Nor did it directly measure the strength of brain inhibitory pathways. Its findings did indirectly suggest, though, that weakened brain pain inhibitory pathways are directly associated with increased pain sensitization in the skin. The evidence is pretty preliminary, but it suggests that nerve problems in the skin and altered pain pathways in the brain may be linked in FM. If this is true, four possibilities have been raised: strange signal transmissions from the small nerve fibers in the skin are causing the pain inhibitory pathways in the brain to go bananas (turn themselves off). Or, as Harte suggested, a weakened pain inhibiting system is causing the body to wreak havoc on the small nerve fibers in an attempt to protect itself.  A third possibility is that both are happening. Another possibility exists – a possibility that takes in findings from Parkinson’s disease as well – that autonomic nervous system problems are driving the small nerve problems in FM and ME/CFS. That’s an interesting possibility given that autonomic nervous system symptoms were associated with reduced small nerve fiber density in FM in one study. It’s also possible that something as yet unidentified in the skin is damaging the small nerve fibers there. Plenty of evidence – from increased levels of , mitochondrial problems, inflammation, to – suggests problems exist in the skin of FM patients. A just published study put an extra pin in the possible importance of SFN in FM and possibly ME/CFS. This large suggests that reduced small nerve fiber density is strongly associated with increased pain levels and disease burden in FM. That casts doubt on Harte’s and Clauw’s claim that SFN is a kind of secondary factor in FM and suggests that finding out its cause may be more critical than ever. If the brain is driving the small nerve fiber problems, then we need to find out how to cool down the hyperactive pain-producing pathways and buff up the pain-inhibiting pathways. If the small fiber problems are helping drive the problems with the pain-producing and inhibiting pathways in the brain, then we need figure how to stop whatever whatever is hammering the small nerves in the body.

The central nervous system controls the brain and spinal cord. The average human brain weighs approximately 3 pounds and contains approximately 100 billion neurons, as well as trillions of “support cells” called glia. The spinal cord weights approximately 35-40 grams and is around 43 cm long in adult woman and 45 cm long in adult men. The frontal lobe of the brain controls our judgement and is responsible for reasoning, planning and carrying out complex tasks. The frontal lobe works together with the amygdala. This is the part of the brain which is linked with emotional memory. The prefrontal cortex (part of the frontal lobe) analyses a situation, such as a student about to walk into an exam hall to take an important exam, and if the individual’s actual coping ability conflicts with the individual’s perceived coping ability i.e. the student panics and feels they are not fully prepared, then the amygdala will highlight that there is a problem. Depending on the actual problem, the prefrontal cortex can negotiate with the amygdala and try to defuse the situation. For example, the prefrontal cortex will try to reason with the amygdala and tell the amygdala to stop worrying and that they have prepared enough. However, in extreme circumstances, such as if the individual begins to doubt their self esteem, the amygdala can neuro hijack the prefrontal cortex resulting in extreme stress such as rage. The amygdala then signals the hypothalamus releasing the neurotransmitter chemical noradrenaline which activates the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system, part of the peripheral nervous system.
